<title>Abstract</title><p>Two types of osteoblasts are required to assemble the zebrafish embryonic skeleton: classical osteoblasts homologous to the mammalian cell, and notochord sheath cells, which serve as non-classical osteoblasts. The gene <italic>entpd5a</italic> is critically required for ossification via both types of osteoblasts. Despite the indispensability of zebrafish models in vertebrate research, the genetic regulation of bone formation, as well as mechanisms of transcriptional control of <italic>entpd5a</italic>, remain largely unknown. Here, using a newly generated transgenic line, we isolate classical and non-classical osteoblasts from zebrafish embryos and performed both ATAC-seq and RNA-seq. We analysed results independently and integratively to understand those chromatin dynamics and accompanying transcriptomic changes that occur in different skeletal cell types. We show that although Dlx family factors are playing important roles in classical osteoblast regulation, Hox family factors are involved in governing spinal ossification via non-classical osteoblasts. We further present a resource-driven analysis of the <italic>entpd5a</italic> promoter, experimentally validating the ATAC-seq dataset and proposing mechanisms of regulating the complex <italic>entpd5a</italic> expression pattern during zebrafish osteogenesis. Our results thus provide a necessary comprehensive resource for the field of bone development and indicate spatio-temporally regulated promoter/enhancer interactions taking place in the <italic>entpd5a</italic> locus.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Osteogenesis is one of the vital processes taking place in vertebrate embryos. In amniotes, including all mammals, osteoblasts are known to give rise to all cranial and axial bones through endochondral and intramembranous ossification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mackie et al., 2008</xref>, Breeland et al., 2022). While most cranial bones form via intramembranous ossification, mammalian axial bones are formed via a cartilagenous template by osteoblasts derived from the somitic sclerotome. Despite the differences in modes of ossification, all osteoblasts are considered as a uniform cell type, experiencing similar ontogenetic stages which are controlled by similar genetic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Amarasekara et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hartmann, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jensen et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Teleost and amphibian processes of endochondral and intramembranous ossification are conserved with amniotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Weigele and Franz-Odendaal, 2016</xref>). Although the osteoblasts, which generate bone in amniotes and anamniotes are considered homologous, relatively recent work in teleost fish identified a bone producing cell type, which has not been described in anamniotes: the notochord sheath cell (NSC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Grotmol et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lleras Forero et al., 2018</xref>). NSCs, also referred to as chordoblasts, form an epithelial layer around the vacuolated cells of the embryonic notochord (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), and secrete the molecules making up the acellular, thick notochord sheath layer. NSCs are directly responsible for forming ossified chordacentra, ossified rings that are positioned in a segmental array within the sheath of the notochord. Chordacentra formation precedes the accumulation of sclerotomal osteoblasts around the notochord, which complete formation of the vertebral centra and in a later step also give rise to the dorsal and ventral arches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fleming et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Grotmol et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lleras Forero et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, formation of chordacentra is now considered the first stage of spine formation in fish.</p>

<p>Here we coin the terms “classical” and “non-classical” osteoblast to describe zebrafish bone formation. Classical osteoblasts, highly homologous to the mammalian osteoblast, express <italic>osterix</italic> and generate the cranial bones and the late perichordal centra of the spine, while non-classical osteoblasts, with to date no known homologous cell type in amniotes, refer to the <italic>osterix-</italic> subset of NSCs capable of early chordacentra mineralisation. Zebrafish cranial classical osteoblasts originate from the cranial neural crest, share a common progenitor with cranial chondrocytes, and can be detected as early as 2 dpf using markers such as <italic>runx2b</italic>, <italic>entpd5a</italic> and <italic>osterix</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Huitema et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Li et al., 2009</xref>). Axial classical osteoblasts are derived from the somitic sclerotome and contribute to the mineralization of the finite vertebrae in a process very similar to the one observed in mammals. They are rather late in appearance, and <italic>osterix</italic>+ cells can only be found along the growing vertebral central and arches from approximately 17 dpf onwards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Spoorendonk et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B, C</xref>).</p>
<p>Non-classical osteoblasts are derived from notochord progenitor cells (NPCs). Unlike classical osteoblasts, NSCs are distinct in their lack of expression of the transcription factor Osterix, commonly considered as an osteoblast master regulator in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Nakashima et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wopat et al., 2018</xref>). Rather than <italic>osterix</italic>, expression of the early zebrafish bone marker <italic>ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 5a (entpd5a)</italic> was demonstrated in bone-forming NSCs using BAC transgenic lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). As early as 4 dpf <italic>entpd5a</italic> was shown to be expressed in NSCs in a segmental pattern, gradually progressing from anterior to posterior, predicting the precise location of the mineralised chordacentra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lleras Forero et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wopat et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>entpd5a</italic>+ segments along the notochord are separated by intersegmental regions expressing cartilage markers, such as <italic>col9a2</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). <italic>entpd5a</italic> codes for a secreted hydrolase binding nucleoside di- and triphosphates, generating NMP and inorganic phosphate, a key mineral to initiate the mineralisation process of bone. Indeed, <italic>entpd5a</italic> mutant zebrafish embryos present with a complete lack of ossification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Huitema et al., 2012</xref>). In mouse mutants this phenotype has not been reported, although it was observed that homozygous mutants are smaller than their littermates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Read et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, NSCs, despite providing a morphologically uniform population of cells, are critical for initial chordacentrum ossification by expressing <italic>entpd5a</italic> in a segmental manner along the anterio-posterior axis. How this segmental expression pattern of <italic>entpd5a</italic> is established is not understood, but it is distinct from the one involved in somitogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lleras Forero et al., 2018</xref>). The role of the BMP and Notch signalling pathways has been highlighted in the segmenting notochord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Peskin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wopat et al., 2018</xref>), but the transcriptional events governing <italic>entpd5a</italic> expression in classical osteoblasts and in the NSCs remain unknown.</p>
<p>The transcriptomics of mammalian classical osteoblasts have been investigated in some detail in the past decades. Genes such as Runx2, Dlx family factors and Osterix play significant roles in different stages of osteoblast specification and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hassan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hojo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jensen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Shirakabe et al., 2001</xref>). More recently, the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (ATAC-seq) has been widely used in the field. In addition, an increasing number of studies integrate RNA-seq and ATAC-seq to provide deeper insight into gene regulation in populations of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ackermann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hojo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Yang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yu et al., 2021</xref>). Such studies, however, are to date available neither for classical, nor for non-classical zebrafish osteoblasts, rendering the molecular fingerprints and chromatin dynamics of zebrafish osteogenic cells to date elusive. Molecularly characterising zebrafish classical osteoblasts is of particular interest for the field, as it allows for direct comparison between mammalian and teleost transcriptional regulation of osteogenesis. Specifically, it is crucial to acquire a deeper understanding of teleost osteoblasts in order to answer evolutionary questions regarding the cell type’s origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Nguyen and Eames, 2020</xref>). Moreover, better understanding the mechanisms of regulation in non-classical osteoblasts is likely to highlight either novel ossification mechanisms that have not been appreciated to date, or that are unique in teleosts.</p>
<p>In this study, we provide the first comprehensive resource of ATAC-seq and RNA-seq performed on classical and non-classical zebrafish osteoblasts, enabling studies of embryonic osteoblast development and differentiation. Comparisons across those populations and their closely related chondrocyte and intersegmental NSC populations allows a detailed assessment of gene expression profiles and chromatin regulation in different osteogenic cells, based on FAC-sorted cells from live embryos. We furthermore focus on the promoter structure of the early bone marker <italic>entpd5a</italic>, a gene critical for osteogenesis in zebrafish. We thus not only validate the usefulness and quality of the ATAC-seq data, but also demonstrate the complex mode of <italic>entpd5a</italic> regulation through identification of enhancers located both upstream of the ATG and within intronic regions, and suggest candidate transcription factors likely to be acting on the identified enhancer elements.</p>

<title><italic>entpd5a</italic> is an early marker of developing osteoblasts</title>
<p>Entpd5a is a critical factor for zebrafish osteogenesis, and <italic>entpd5a</italic> mutants show no bone formation at all. We had previously generated a transgenic reporter line and established the gene to be expressed at sites of bone formation, but wanted to better understand the dynamics of <italic>entpd5a</italic> expression. We thus recombined the BAC construct CH73-213B8, which was used previously to generate stable <italic>entpd5a</italic> transgenic lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bussmann and Schulte-Merker, 2011</xref>), and replaced the start codon of the gene with that of the Gal4FF open reading frame (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 1A</xref>). The Gal4/UAS system has proven valuable for other genes to provide stronger fluorescence signals. Indeed, the newly generated <italic>entpd5a:Gal4FF</italic>; <italic>UAS:GFP</italic> transgenic line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Labbaf et al., 2022</xref>) allowed detection of <italic>entpd5a</italic> expression domains which had previously not been reported.</p>
<p>Using this line, we could detect for the first time expression of <italic>entpd5a</italic> not only in the developing cranial bones starting from 3 dpf, but also in a subset of cartilage cells forming the developing jaw (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 1B, D</xref>). This pattern is reminiscent of the one previously shown for the bone master regulator <italic>osterix</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hammond and Schulte-Merker, 2009</xref>). In addition, we detected <italic>entpd5a</italic> expression in a few neurons of the CNS in the head at 3 dpf (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 1C</xref>) and along the spinal cord. We also found expression within the hypochord (data not shown). Finally, observation of the strongly expressing Gal4 line led us to identify early expression of <italic>entpd5a</italic> in notochord progenitor cells (NPCs) at 24 hpf (data not shown).</p>
<p>To further elucidate early <italic>entpd5a</italic> expression, we used the previously established <italic>entpd5a:Kaede</italic> transgenic line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lleras Forero et al., 2018</xref>) to investigate notochord dynamics prior to 3 dpf. We photoconverted and directly imaged <italic>entpd5a:Kaede</italic> positive embryos starting from the 15 somite-stage (s), when we could first detect the fluorophore along the newly-formed notochord progenitor cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 1E</xref>). We repeated photoconversion and imaging at 18, 21 and 24s (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 1F-H</xref>). In all three stages, <italic>de novo</italic> expression (in green) was identified. We repeated the photoconversion and imaging at 48 hpf and at 72 hpf (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 1I-J</xref>). At both stages, expression of <italic>entpd5a</italic> was restricted exclusively to NSCs positioned along the ventral-most notochord sheath. Hence, the previously observed expression of <italic>entpd5a</italic> in the notochord prior to segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lleras Forero et al., 2018</xref>) in vacuolated cells and a subset of NSCs is merely the result of long half-lives of fluorophores.</p>
<p>In conclusion, <italic>entpd5a</italic> expression in the zebrafish embryo appears to be more dynamic than previously appreciated, which implies diverse regulatory mechanisms. A list of tissues expressing <italic>entpd5a</italic> (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) provides a better understanding of <italic>entpd5a</italic> expression dynamics, and serves as a basis for considering ATAC- and RNA-sequencing datasets.</p>

<title>ATAC-seq on classical versus non-classical osteoblasts identifies a high degree of correlation between regions of open chromatin</title>
<p>In order to identify cell type-specific enhancers in the different cell types forming the zebrafish skeleton, and to further predict crucial transcriptional regulators that are active in each population, we performed ATAC-seq using cells isolated from the <italic>entpd5a</italic>:<italic>Gal4FF; UAS:GFP</italic>; <italic>R2col2a1a:mCherry</italic> transgenic line at 15 dpf (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 2A-B</xref>). The developmental stage was chosen in order to obtain sufficient numbers of <italic>entpd5a+</italic> and <italic>entpd5a-</italic> NSCs (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 2A</xref>). Larvae were decapitated and dissociated, and cells were sorted according to fluorescence, using GFP-; mCherry-embryos as controls. Classical GFP+ osteoblasts and mCherry+ chondrocytes were isolated from the head and GFP+ NSCs and mCherry+ intersegmental NSCs from the trunk (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 3</xref>).</p>
<p>We assessed the quality of sequenced data according to ENCODE standards and used ATAQV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Orchard et al., 2020</xref>) to determine the Fragment Length Distribution Distance (FLDD) and the TSS enrichment score (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The FLDD scores were always found to be between 0 and 0.3, indicating good degree of transposition. The TSS value, although low in comparison to data from mammalian cells, indicates enrichment of fragments around the promoters. Furthermore, we assessed sample correlation via Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and by producing a correlation heatmap based on FRiP (Fraction of Reads in Peaks) scores using DiffBind (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 2C-D</xref>). Both methods highlighted a high degree of correlation between biological replicates, as well as tight clustering between all 6 samples derived from <italic>entpd5a</italic>+ cells versus the 6 samples derived from <italic>entpd5a</italic>-cells. These correlations confirmed the reliability of the data.</p>
<p>Differential accessibility analysis was performed, comparing the two head-derived cell populations with each other to identify putative enhancer regions associated with either classical osteoblasts or with chondrocytes (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 2E</xref>). Similarly, the two trunk populations were compared to identify open chromatin regions specific to the <italic>entpd5a+</italic> bone-producing NSCs, and chromatin regions specific to <italic>entpd5a-</italic> intersegmental NSCs (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 2F</xref>). Overall, we identified here 558 peaks specific to classical osteoblasts and 26 peaks enriched in NSCs (non-classical osteoblasts). The latter small number is likely due to the high degree of similarity of the two cell types compared (<italic>entpd5a</italic>+ vs. <italic>entpd5a</italic>-NSCs).</p>

<title>Functional validation of ATAC-seq leads to novel insights into <italic>entpd5a</italic> regulation</title>
<p>To test if the ATAC-seq open chromatin regions are predictors of putative regulatory elements, we focused on the <italic>entpd5a</italic> locus, and used GFP reporters to perform enhancer function tests <italic>in vivo</italic>. Within close proximity to the <italic>entpd5a</italic> ORF six ATAC peaks show enrichment in osteoblasts and represent enhancer candidates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Further away from the ORF, the non-coding sequences present in the BAC contain an additional 2 peaks of interest for osteoblast regulation (peaks 7-10, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) and 2 peaks enriched in cartilage samples (peaks 8/9, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Using the ZF_carp_phastcons track on the UCSC browser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baranasic et al., 2022</xref>), we assessed the degree of teleost non-coding sequence conservation in close proximity to the open reading frame of <italic>entpd5a</italic>. We found that all 10 ATAC-peaks were positioned within conserved non-coding regions, suggesting the presence of cis regulatory elements (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). We first focused on ATAC peaks 1-6 within approximately 10kb of the <italic>entpd5a</italic> ATG (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). As shown in the diagram, the first peak was found in an intron at the 3’ end of the <italic>coq6</italic> gene. Peaks 2 and 3 were contained in introns 3 and 1, respectively, of the <italic>entpd5a</italic> gene. The first introns of a gene often play regulatory roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Rose, 2019</xref>), making these peaks intriguing. Finally, we highlight peak 4, close to the TSS of <italic>entpd5a</italic>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Nepal et al., 2013</xref>) as well as two more peaks (5 and 6) located within 6kb and 11kb of the TSS, respectively. We sought to experimentally test possible roles of these open chromatin domains, by generating transgenes that place these domains 5’ or 3’ of a GFP casette, and comparing the resulting expression patterns upon reporter transgenesis to that of the <italic>entpd5a</italic> locus (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>We first generated an <italic>entpd5a(2.2):GFP</italic> construct by cloning a 2.2kb fragment including the 5’UTR and core promoter of <italic>entpd5a</italic> as well as the non-coding region upstream of it, which includes peak number 4. The fragment was placed upstream of the GFP open reading frame (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), with Tol2 sites on either side of the construct. As a control, we generated <italic>entpd5a(1.1):GFP</italic>, a construct containing only the 5’UTR, along with the TSS and core promoter of the gene. We generated stable transgenic lines by injecting <italic>entpd5a(1.1):GFP</italic> or <italic>entpd5a(2.2):GFP</italic> together with Tol2 transposase mRNA into zebrafish eggs. In fish stably expressing <italic>entpd5a(1.1):GFP</italic>, expression could be detected in a variety of tissues but not in regions of ossification (data not shown). The result was confirmed by analysing progeny of six separate founders. In <italic>entpd5a(2.2):GFP; entpd5a:pkRed</italic> stable lines, we identified overlap of GFP and pkRed in the developing cranial bones, specifically the cleithrum, the operculum and a subset of jaw bones, but not in the notochord (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). While at 6 dpf segmentation in the notochord is ongoing, as can be readily observed using the <italic>entpd5a</italic>:<italic>pkRed</italic> stable line, GFP is undetectable in pkRed+ NSCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, inset). This result was consistently found in progeny of three different founders, indicating the presence of proximal enhancers of <italic>entpd5a</italic> functioning in cranial osteoblasts in the sequence where peak number 4 is identified.</p>
<p>In order to assess whether additional <italic>entpd5a</italic> enhancers are present upstream of the area covered by the <italic>entpd5a(2.2):GFP</italic> construct, we generated <italic>entpd5a(5.7):GFP</italic>, which extends a further 3.5kb, covering the peak number 5 sequence (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 4A</xref>). The sequence covered by the <italic>entpd5a(5.7):GFP</italic> construct is conserved across teleosts, but conservation is no longer observed 5’ of the cloned fragment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). We generated stable transgenic lines, and imaged at 6 dpf in the background of the <italic>entpd5a:pkRed</italic> line, to identify cranial expression, as well as notochord expression (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 4B, C</xref>). As for <italic>entpd5a(2.2):GFP</italic>, we could only identify GFP expression in pkRed+ developing cranial bones, but not in the notochord (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 4B, C</xref>). Furthermore, although pkRed was detectable in the jaw chondrocytes, GFP signal was not found, indicating lack of a cartilage-specific enhancer capable of initiating expression autonomously within the sequence of peak number 5 (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 4B</xref>, inset). These results were validated by assessment of the progeny of eight founders. In conclusion, conserved sequences amongst teleosts upstream of peak number 4 do not appear to contain any enhancers that play roles in activating expression of <italic>entpd5a</italic> during development.</p>
<p>We next tested genomic regions equivalent to peaks 2 and 3, found in teleost-conserved <italic>entpd5a</italic> introns 3 and 1, respectively, for activating regulatory functions. To this end, we amplified the region between exon 1 and exon 4, including intron 1-3, and introduced them in the <italic>entpd5a(2.2):GFP</italic> construct, directly downstream of the GFP open reading frame, thus generating the construct <italic>entpd5a(2.2-introns):GFP</italic>. We injected the construct into single cell-stage zebrafish eggs, and observed that NSCs were expressing GFP in a mosaic manner (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F-G</xref>), an effect not seen with other constructs. We generated an <italic>entpd5a(2.2-introns):GFP</italic> stable transgenic line, and indeed the notochord expression of <italic>entpd5a</italic>, as observed in the <italic>entpd5a</italic>:<italic>pkRed</italic> transgenic line, was present from 24 hpf until segmentation stages (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 5</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D-F</xref>). Although GFP appeared in the expected segmental pattern along the notochord, expression levels were relatively low and patchy. This may be the result of this specific integration event (only one founder could be identified), or due to lack of additional enhancers located in other non-coding regions upstream or downstream of the gene. We confirmed, however, that the expression of GFP was enriched in segments compared to intersegmental spaces, by measuring the fluorescence intensity within 6 segments and 5 intersegmental spaces, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). Plotting the corrected total cell fluorescence measurements in each region (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>) confirmed the segmental pattern of GFP in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>.</p>

<p>Neither of the above constructs showed GFP expression in jaw cartilages, thus, a cartilage-specific enhancer of <italic>entpd5a</italic> has not been identified. We performed BAC recombineering to delete larger regions of the <italic>entpd5a</italic>:<italic>pkRed</italic> BAC, in order to assess presence of enhancers within peaks 6-10, as well as within the peak found in intron 11, which appears more prominent in cartilage cell populations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). First, we generated the large deletion <italic>entpd5a(Δ21):pkRed</italic>, spanning 21.4kb upstream of the <italic>entpd5a(2.2):GFP</italic> construct, deleting the sequence harbouring peaks 5-10 from the BAC construct (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). We generated a stable transgenic line and found that the expression pattern appeared unaltered, with strong expression appearing in the cranial skeleton, cartilage and notochord (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-E</xref>). Therefore, no additional upstream open chromatin regions were found to contribute to the wild type expression pattern as depicted in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Moreover, we generated the deletion <italic>entpd5a(Δ10):pkRed,</italic> in which the intron 11 sequence was removed, but this failed to affect expression of pkRed in cartilages (data not shown).</p>
<p>Moreover, we went on to assess in a comparable <italic>in vivo</italic> setting the presence of active <italic>entpd5a</italic> enhancers within the region of peak number 1, located in the last intron of the gene <italic>coq6</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Similarly to the generation of <italic>entpd5a(2.2-introns):GFP</italic>, we generated the construct <italic>entpd5a(2.2-coq6):GFP</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3J</xref>), and injected it in single cell-stage zebrafish embryos. We scored the fish injected with either of the two constructs and found that NSCs were not expressing GFP in the case of <italic>entpd5a(2.2-coq6):GFP</italic>, while such cells were commonly occurring when the <italic>entpd5a(2.2-introns):GFP</italic> was injected (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F-I, K</xref>).</p>
<p>We thus conclude that out of the 10 peaks of interest (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), only ATAC peaks 2, 3 and 4 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) identify genomic elements playing activating roles in <italic>entpd5a</italic> regulation, with proximal enhancers in peak number 4 driving classical and regulatory elements in peaks 2 and 3 non-classical osteoblast expression. We further found that the open chromatin located further 5’ of the <italic>entpd5a</italic> TSS or downstream of the open reading frame plays no role in regulating expression in the developing cartilage and bone tissue of zebrafish embryos.</p>

<p>In order to further narrow down the region within the <italic>entpd5a(2.2):GFP</italic> construct, which is responsible for driving cranial expression of <italic>entpd5a</italic>, we generated sequential deletions from the 3’ end of the construct. Constructs <italic>entpd5a(d243):GFP</italic>, <italic>entpd5a(d418):GFP</italic>, <italic>entpd5a(d665):GFP</italic> and <italic>entpd5a(d880):GFP</italic> carry deletions of 243bp, 418bp, 665bp and 880bp, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>).

<p>We injected the constructs into zebrafish embryos carrying <italic>entpd5a</italic>:<italic>pkRed</italic> at the single cell-stage, and screened at 3 dpf for GFP expression in the cleithrum, a morphologically distinct bone of the zebrafish skeleton. The total numbers of screened embryos with GFP+ cells along their bodies, indicating successful integration of the construct, are provided in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J</xref>, and are derived from a minimum of 2 biological replicates for each construct. Each injection was accompanied by independent injections of the <italic>entpd5a(2.2):GFP</italic> control construct in sibling embryos. Of the GFP-expressing embryos, we scored embryos as positive when 2 or more GFP+ cells were present along the cleithrum at 3 dpf. When the <italic>entpd5a(2.2):GFP</italic> and the <italic>entpd5a(d243):GFP</italic> constructs were injected, 42.7% and 52.7% of the scored fish presented with strongly GFP-positive cleithra (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B, C, J</xref>). The number of scored injected fish with GFP in their cleithra dropped to 12.7%, 0.5% and 0% when constructs <italic>entpd5a(d418):GFP</italic>, <italic>entpd5a(d665):GFP</italic> and <italic>entpd5a(d880):GFP</italic>, respectively, were injected (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J</xref>). We observed that in those injections only very few GFP+ cells (if at all) were detected along the cleithra, in stark contrast to the control and <italic>entpd5a(d243):GFP</italic> constructs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B-F</xref>). This indicates that a region of 422bp (highlighted as a red box in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) is responsible for <italic>entpd5a</italic> regulation in classical osteoblasts.</p>
<p>The identified 422bp region of interest includes two putative Runx2 binding sites. We injected the three constructs, deleting them both individually and simultaneously, and found that, although deletion r31 had no effect in the number of scored embryos with GFP expression in the cleithrum at 3 dpf (44%), deletions r37 and r31/r37 both resulted in a consistent drop to approximately half of the control group (19.5% and 18.6%, respectively) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J</xref>). This led us to conclude that the predicted Runx2 binding site located close to the summit of the ATAC peak has a functional role in <italic>entpd5a</italic> expression in the cranial skeleton.</p>

<title>Integration of ATAC-seq and RNA-seq identifies candidate regulators of classical and non-classical osteoblasts</title>
<p>In order to identify possible transcriptional regulators active in cell types of interest, we sought to integrate our ATAC-seq dataset with differential expression data from RNA-seq. To that end, we performed RNA-seq at 15 dpf on cranial osteoblasts and cartilage chondrocytes, as well as on <italic>entpd5a</italic>+ NSCs and intersegmental <italic>entpd5a</italic>-NSCs. As with ATAC-seq, biological triplicates of all samples were sequenced and analysed.</p>
<p>Our RNA-seq results highlighted unique signatures, with <italic>entpd5a</italic>+ cells from head and trunk highly expressing genes known to function in bone formation, for example <italic>phex</italic> (Quarles, 2003), <italic>panx3</italic> (Ishikawa and Yamada, 2017) and <italic>col10a1b</italic>. In contrast, <italic>entpd5a</italic>-cells from head and trunk were found to express genes known to function in cartilage formation, such as <italic>acan</italic> and <italic>ccn</italic> family genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dateki, 2017</xref>; John A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Arnott, 2016</xref>) as well as <italic>col9a1b</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A, B</xref>). We further show that, as expected, <italic>entpd5a</italic>+ cells isolated from both tissues share 872 genes, accounting for 43% of the total differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of both head and trunk <italic>entpd5a</italic>+ cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Similarly, <italic>entpd5a</italic>-cells share 765 genes, accounting for 64% of the total DEGs found in cartilage and 40% of those found in intersegmental cells. This high degree of overlap was in contrast to the very low number of genes shared between osteoblasts and intersegmental cells (43 DEGs) or between cartilage and <italic>entpd5a</italic>+ NSCs (7 DEGs). We confirmed the reliability of our results by performing PCA analysis, in which the 3 biological replicates of each cell type clustered together (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Of note, Principal Component 1 (PC1) distinguishes between the samples isolated from head versus trunk, while PC2 effectively distinguished between <italic>entpd5a</italic>+ and <italic>entpd5a</italic>-cells from both tissues. Overall, we observed significant overlaps in gene expression signatures between the <italic>entpd5a</italic>+ cells and <italic>entpd5a</italic>-cells, even though they are distinctive cell types, originating from widely diverse progenitors. We do note, however, that despite the similarities, classical and non-classical osteoblasts maintain significant differences in their expression profiles.</p>

<p>In teleost fish, osteoblasts have been previously found to share expression of typical chondrocyte genes, providing support to theories of bone cells having evolved from cartilage cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Nguyen and Eames, 2020</xref>). Looking closely at our RNA-seq data and ATAC-seq data we found that, despite the logFC values showing clear enrichment in <italic>entpd5a</italic>-cells, indeed classical chondrocyte markers maintain open promoters (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 6A-D</xref>) and low levels of gene expression relatively to cartilage and intersegmental cells (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 6E</xref>). It should be noted that ATAC signal indicating the presence of active enhancers in promoter areas is observably lower, often by an order of magnitude, in osteoblasts compared to cartilage cells (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 6A-D</xref>).</p>
<p>We next combined the information of the ATAC-seq and RNA-seq datasets, to gain further insight into gene regulatory activity in our cell types of interest. To this end, we searched within intronic regions, as well as (a) 5kb, (b) 10kb and (c) 20kb upstream of the TSS of all genes in the GRCz11 genome assembly and isolated the respective three sets of zebrafish genes associated with ATAC peaks. First, we made an assessment of the distribution of peaks in the vicinity of genes. For each cell population, we plotted the proportion of zebrafish genes that had ATAC peaks in close association with promoter regions (within 5kb of the TSS and in the introns), in comparison to the proportion of genes that only had ATAC peaks associated with sequences within 10kb or within 20kb of their TSS (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). We concluded that in all cell populations, the majority of identified genes had peaks close to their promoter regions or within the intronic domains. A relatively small percentage of genes showed peaks only associated with the area 5kb-10kb of the TSS or with the area 10kb-20kb of the TSS. The same conclusion was reached upon isolation from these three isolated sets of genes that are actively expressed in each cell population according to our RNA-seq data. We plotted the proportion of cell type-specific DEGs that are associated with cell type-specific ATAC peaks and found that an even larger proportion (in all populations over 80%) of identified DEGs had ATAC peaks in close proximity to their predicted TSS, compared to very few additional DEGs identified for having peaks in areas between 5kb-20kb of the TSS (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). This effect further validated our ATAC-seq results, showing that ATAC peaks were concentrated close to the TSS of genes, rather than being distributed evenly in non-coding regions of the genome. Furthermore, we observed that the proportion of genes with peaks within 5kb of their TSS increased when looking exclusively at DEGs, further supporting the higher degree of chromatin accessibility around their promoters, related to their active regulation.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="600453v1_fig6.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>Subsequently, we sought to identify the degree of overlap between genes that are associated with ATAC peaks either in their introns or up to 20kb upstream of the TSS, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in each cell type (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C-F</xref>). We found 152 DEGs with ATAC peaks in cranial osteoblasts, 251 in cartilage, 8 in <italic>entpd5a</italic>+ NSCs and 56 in intersegmental cells. In 3 out of 4 cell types, there were significantly more DEGs identified, compared to genes associated with ATAC peaks, an effect perhaps associated with the exclusion of peaks during differential accessibility analysis.</p>
<p>We then extracted the ATAC peaks associated with DEGs that have open chromatin in close proximity to the TSS. We examined the extracted peaks using the HOMER software, in order to identify enriched transcription factor binding sites in promoters of interest in each cell population. We intersected the resulting tables with RNA-seq datasets, identifying zebrafish orthologues of the predicted binding transcription factors that are differentially expressed in each given cell type (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Interestingly, we found that in osteoblasts there was both an enrichment for predicted binding sites of factors belonging to the Dlx family, and higher expression of orthologues of those particular members of the family compared to cartilage cells. Similarly, Hox family transcription factors were predicted to bind to open chromatin close to DEGs in <italic>entpd5a</italic>+ segments. Simultaneously, the zebrafish orthologues of the identified family members were differentially expressed in <italic>entpd5a</italic>+ segments. Finally, our analysis highlighted an enrichment of Fox and Sox family binding sites in both cartilage and intersegmental cells, accompanied by differential expression of the corresponding family member orthologues in our RNA-seq samples.</p>

<p>Finally, we used CIIIDER to search within introns 1 and 3, as well as within the 422bp element of the <italic>entpd5a</italic> promoter element identified in this work to play a crucial role in driving cranial osteoblast expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), for predicted binding sites of the classical and non-classical osteoblast regulators shown in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>).

The same area included a predicted Isl1 binding site in classical osteoblasts and two Hoxc8 binding sites in non-classical osteoblasts (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). A total of six Runx2 binding sites were identified, of which two were positioned in the 422bp sequence. Of these, one site was found to drive expression in classical osteoblasts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Although Runx2 was not one of the candidate factors identified in osteoblasts (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), it is a factor known to play important regulatory roles in osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hojo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Nishio et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Rashid et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, our RNA-seq data showed that both <italic>runx2a</italic> and <italic>runx2b</italic> are slightly upregulated in osteoblasts versus cartilage (logFC = 1.39 and 2.64, respectively) and <italic>runx2a</italic> is upregulated in <italic>entpd5a</italic>+ segments versus intersegmental cells (logFC = 1.69). Compatible with this, our ATAC-seq data showed open chromatin in the vicinity of both genes, likely indicating open enhancers (data not shown).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In recent years, research on teleost fish identified the ability of the embryonic notochord to produce bone in a manner independent of classical sclerotome-derived osteoblasts, and to initiate the formation of mineralised chordacentra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fleming et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lleras Forero et al., 2018</xref>). The cells responsible for this are non-classical osteoblasts within the notochord sheath, expressing the early bone marker <italic>entpd5a</italic> but not the classical osteoblast regulator <italic>osterix</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lleras Forero et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Spoorendonk et al., 2008</xref>). Here, we aimed to better understand the genetic regulation and molecular signatures of classical and non-classical osteoblasts, and how those two populations differ from each other and from the closely related cranial chondrocytes and intersegmental NSCs. To this end, we characterised the newly generated transgenic line <italic>entpd5a:Gal4FF</italic>; <italic>UAS:GFP</italic> in combination with the previously described <italic>R2col2a1a:mCherry</italic> to isolate classical and non-classical osteoblasts as well as cartilage and intersegmental cells from the head and trunk of zebrafish larvae. We employed ATAC-seq to reveal the differentially accessible chromatin domains in <italic>entpd5a</italic>+ cells of head and trunk populations and performed RNA-seq in equivalent cell populations to understand the gene expression signatures accompanying observed chromatin changes. This first compilation of combined ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data from teleost osteoblasts enables the genome-wide analysis of osteoblast, chondrocytes, notochord sheath cells, and intervertebral disk precursors at both the chromatin and transcriptome level. This comprehensive dataset will be of use to a wide variety of researchers interested in osteogenesis, both within and outside the field of teleost developmental biology. For our immediate purposes, and as a proof of principle study, the data has allowed us to dissect the promoter organisation and to identify likely regulators of <italic>entpd5a</italic>, a critical gene in bone formation in zebrafish.</p>
<p>The ATAC-seq datasets of both <italic>entpd5a</italic>+ and <italic>entpd5a</italic>-cells in the head and trunk reveal the chromatin landscape in these skeletogenic cell populations. Although highly similar due to their respective origin from either cranial neural crest cells or notochord progenitor cells, differential chromatin accessibility analysis on head and trunk populations revealed putative enhancer regions of interest for bone vs. cartilage generation. Here, we validate our chromatin accessibility datasets and prove the significance of performing such analyses by demonstrating the regulatory importance of open regions detected both upstream of <italic>entpd5a</italic> and within the gene’s intronic regions, thus highlighting a highly complex promoter organisation. Specifically, we demonstrate that a series of active enhancers responsible for driving expression in classical osteoblasts are located in a short stretch of non-coding sequence within 2.2kb of the <italic>entpd5a</italic> ATG. Moreover, introns 1-3 contain regulatory regions required for <italic>entpd5a</italic> segmental activation in non-classical osteoblasts. Although we attempted to test several of the additional peaks found in non-coding areas surrounding the gene, more work is required to pinpoint the enhancers driving expression in cranial chondrocytes. In conclusion, the <italic>entpd5a:Gal4FF</italic> line has allowed us to refine the expression pattern of zebrafish <italic>entpd5a</italic> and to use ATAC-seq to elucidate the structure of its promoter.</p>
<p>We additionally performed RNA-seq in order to better understand the molecular signatures of the different cell populations and the functional significance of the observed chromatin configurations. As expected, our analyses reveal enrichment of bone-specific genes in <italic>entpd5a</italic>+ populations and, conversely, of cartilage-specific genes in <italic>entpd5a</italic>-populations. We went on to integrate the ATAC-seq and RNA-seq datasets to increase the predictive power of our analyses, which led to the determination of candidate transcriptional regulators for each cell type of interest. Our results suggest functional roles of Dlx family genes in classical osteoblasts, of Hox family regulators in non-classical osteoblasts, and of Foxa and Sox family members in <italic>entpd5a</italic>-cells of both the head and the trunk. It thus appears that gene expression is not regulated in the same manner in classical and non-classical osteoblasts, since the identified candidate regulators showed no overlap. In contrast, chondrocytes of the head and intersegmental NSCs demonstrated a surprising amount of overlap in putative regulators governing gene expression specific to their skeletogenic roles.</p>
<p>Identification of putative functions of Dlx family transcription factors in classical osteoblasts is compatible with the long-recognised roles of these factors in upregulating key osteoblast genes during all stages of osteoblast specification and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hassan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Shirakabe et al., 2001</xref>). Significantly, Dlx factors have been implicated in recruiting Osterix, the master regulator of osteoblasts, to osteoblast enhancers in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hojo et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, it has been shown that distinct Dlx family members become active in different stages of osteoblast development, with chick Dlx3 being able to activate mature osteoblast expression programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Li et al., 2008</xref>). Consistent with this, our analyses reveal enrichment of <italic>dlx3b</italic> expression in zebrafish classical osteoblasts. In non-classical osteoblasts, we identified several Hox factors amongst predicted regulators of skeletal fate genes. Hox family genes have long been known for their crucial roles in skeletal patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fromental-Ramain et al., 1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Wellik and Capecchi, 2003</xref>), and in the adult skeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Song et al., 2020</xref>). In future work, the binding affinity of zebrafish Dlx and Hox factors on the promoters of osteoblast genes such as <italic>entpd5a</italic>, as well as generating mutants in specific <italic>dlx</italic> and <italic>hox</italic> genes would be appropriate means to obtain further insight into the gene regulatory network governing osteogenesis and axial patterning.</p>
<p>In regards to candidate regulators with putative roles in <italic>entpd5a</italic>-cells, Foxa2 and Foxa3 are transcription factors with confirmed roles in chondrogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ionescu et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, SOX9 is known as the master regulator of chondrocyte differentiation, and competition between SOX9 and FOXA have been shown to aid this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Tan et al., 2018</xref>). Both <italic>entpd5a</italic>-cell populations investigated here differentially express the zebrafish genes <italic>foxa2</italic>, <italic>foxa3</italic> and <italic>sox9a</italic>, while the second SOX9 orthologue, <italic>sox9b</italic>, is enriched in cranial <italic>entpd5a</italic>-cells. We thus postulate that the mechanism of chondrocyte differentiation is likely conserved between amniotes and zebrafish.</p>
<p>In summary, integration of ATAC-seq and RNA-seq has been valuable in predicting candidate regulators for skeletogenic cells found in fish in a non-biased manner. Although this should not be viewed as a comprehensive list of regulators, it provides guidance in the first steps of elucidating genetic interactions taking place in these cell types, and particularly in the non-classical osteoblasts of the notochord, which have only been recently started to be analysed.</p>
<p>In addition to its use in better understanding the gene regulatory programs acting in skeletogenic cells, our approach of performing both RNA-seq and ATAC-seq using <italic>in vivo</italic>-derived samples and analysing the data not only individually but also in an integrated manner, provides a comprehensive resource that has hitherto not been available. Although osteoblasts of mammals and birds have been the subject of transcriptomic analyses for decades, the vast majority of RNA-seq and ATAC-seq studies have been performed using <italic>in vitro</italic>-differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yu et al., 2021</xref>). To our knowledge, only one study thus far used <italic>in vivo</italic>-derived mouse neonatal skeletal cells to perform both assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hojo et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, RNA-seq and ATAC-seq studies on osteoblasts of teleost fish remain extremely limited or absent. With the exception of one study in which scRNA-seq was performed on the zebrafish adult regenerating fin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Tang et al., 2022</xref>), and another study where RNA-seq was performed on medaka osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Phan et al., 2020</xref>), we are not aware of any RNA-seq or ATAC-seq analyses that have been performed on embryonic classical osteoblasts of fish. Thus, our study fills a void and moves teleost osteoblasts on par with the single mouse study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hojo et al., 2022</xref>) that provided both ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data.</p>
<p>Of note, the significance of studying the molecular signatures of osteoblasts in teleost fish has become more pressing in recent years. It has been observed that ‘aquatic’ and ‘amphibian’ osteoblasts and cartilage behave differently to ‘terrestrial’ osteoblasts in terms of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Nguyen and Eames, 2020</xref>). Specifically, the less evolved osteoblasts of fish and amphibians appear to share gene expression with chondrocytes, a pattern which we also observed in our datasets, while amniote osteoblasts have suppressed chondrocyte markers in the course of evolution. Despite this, the vast majority of NGS studies have been carried out on osteoblasts of amniotes, leading to the establishment of an incomplete picture of the osteoblast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Nguyen and Eames, 2020</xref>). In this work, we show that the bone marker <italic>entpd5a</italic> is expressed in chondrocytes of the developing jaw, in a manner similar to <italic>osterix</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hammond and Schulte-Merker, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, we show that several other genes conventionally thought of as cartilage-specific, such as <italic>ccn6, sox9a, acana</italic> and <italic>col9a2</italic> are expressed at low levels in osteoblasts. These discoveries reinforce the arguments regarding the chondrocyte origin of osteoblasts, while also pointing towards cells that might be prone to transdifferentiate into osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hammond and Schulte-Merker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Thesingh et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Moving beyond the classical osteoblasts, we also here provide means to investigate non-classical osteoblasts, a cell type confined to teleosts that has recently been shown to play crucial roles in the initiation of fish spine development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Grotmol et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lleras Forero et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Renn et al., 2013</xref>). Very little is known to date about the mechanisms of gene regulation in these non-classical osteoblasts, limited to RNA-seq data that indicate a role for BMP and Notch signalling in patterning the cells of the notochord sheath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wopat et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Peskin et al., 2023</xref>). However, the gene regulatory interactions that are required to bring about the segmental expression of <italic>entpd5a</italic> remains unknown. We here demonstrate and experimentally validate a short piece of promoter sequence to be sufficient in governing <italic>entpd5a</italic> expression in NSCs, setting the stage for identifying the gene regulatory network that determines transcriptional control of this key factor in axial skeletogenesis.</p>
<p>Finally, this work provides insight into the mechanism of regulation of the early bone marker <italic>entpd5a</italic>, which we show is regulated in an unexpectedly dynamic manner throughout zebrafish embryonic development. <italic>entpd5a</italic> is not only of great interest because it acts as a specific osteoblast marker, but also because it is non-dispensable for bone development in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Huitema et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, <italic>entpd5a</italic> expression presents in a segmented manner along the zebrafish embryonic notochord, predetermining the locations of chordacentra mineralisation and future vertebrae position. This segmentation was shown to be independent of the somitic segmentation clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lleras Forero et al., 2018</xref>), arguing for an independent manner of generating the periodic appearance of <italic>entpd5a</italic> expression within NSCs. The molecular mechanism guiding this stereotypic pattern remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fernández Arancibia et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we show that <italic>entpd5a</italic> introns 1-3, together with enhancers located upstream of the ATG, drive segmental notochord expression of <italic>entpd5a</italic>. Furthermore, we used our NGS analyses to predict candidate regulators, including <italic>dlx</italic>, <italic>hox</italic> and <italic>runx</italic> family genes, putatively binding on the identified enhancer sites to drive <italic>entpd5a</italic> expression in both classical and non-classical osteoblasts. Importantly, we identified a 37bp region within 2.2kb of the ATG, predicted to be able to bind Runx2a or Runx2b, as well as various members of the <italic>dlx</italic> gene family. <italic>runx2</italic> family members are of particular interest to the process of osteogenesis, as mammalian Runx2 is known to play important roles in the regulation of osteoblast genes, both through its action as a pioneer factor, playing a crucial role in the plasticity between chondrocyte and osteoblast fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hojo et al., 2022</xref>), and through its interaction with co-factors to directly upregulate osteogenic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Nishio et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Rashid et al., 2014</xref>). Although <italic>runx2a</italic> and <italic>runx2b</italic> were not thought to be expressed in mature osteoblasts in fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Huycke et al., 2012</xref>), via RNA-seq data we detect low level expression of at least one of the two factors in <italic>entpd5a</italic>+ cells of the head and of the trunk, rendering them plausible <italic>entpd5a</italic> regulators in classical and non-classical fish osteoblasts. Our <italic>in silico</italic> predictions and presented hypotheses are to be validated by functional analyses (such as generating mutants), and this information can be built on to reveal gene regulatory network upstream of <italic>entpd5a</italic> in both types of zebrafish osteoblasts. Moreover, the role of Entpd5 in bone formation should be determined in other species and the evolutionary conservation of the mechanisms which we begin to identify here should be confirmed.</p>
<p>Overall, we here characterise the organisation of the complex promoter of <italic>entpd5a</italic>, and identify critical genomic elements that govern transcriptional control of this early and highly specific marker of classical and non-classical osteoblasts. En route, we suggest candidate transcriptional regulators that can now be tested. We furthermore provide a resource with a wide range of possible uses in the field, making both ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data sets available that are based on chondrocytes and osteoblasts isolated from <italic>in vivo</italic> derived material.</p>

<p>All PCR amplification and quality control steps were carried out according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Buenrostro et al., 2015</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Buenrostro et al., 2015</xref>). Following amplified DNA purification, AMPure XP SPRI beads (Beckman Coulter, A63881) were used (1.4x sample volume) to remove primer dimers from the chromatin sample. The beads were brought to room temperature and thoroughly vortexed before use. The sample plus beads mixture was incubated at room temperature for 5min, then placed on the magnetic stand for 5min to clear the solution. The supernatant was discarded and the beads were washed for 30sec with 80% ethanol. The wash step was repeated. Following removal of the supernatant, the beads were air-dried, removed from the magnetic stand and 20μl of EB buffer was added for DNA elution. The sample was mixed and incubated for 2min at room temperature, then placed back on the magnetic stand for 5min. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube.</p>
<p>The quality of purified chromatin was assessed using the Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA Analysis kit (Agilent). Libraries were sequenced using the NextSeq 500/550 Mid Output Kit v2.5 (150 Cycles) (Illumina, 20024904) on the sequencing platform Illumina NextSeq500. 20M reads were sequenced per sample.</p>

<title>Sequencing Data analysis</title>
<p>For ATAC-seq, sequences were de-multiplexed into fastq files applying standard parameters of the Illumina pipeline (bcl2fastq) using Nextera index adapters. The individual fastq files were processed with fastp (version 0.20.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2018</xref>) and mapped to the zebrafish reference genome GRCz11 using Bowtie2 (version 2.3.5.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>) with the ‘very-sensitive option’. Sequences with mapping quality &gt;30 were isolated and sorted using SAMtools (version 1.9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Danecek et al., 2021</xref>). Mitochondrial reads and duplicates were removed using BEDTools (version 2.28.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>) and Sambamba (version 0.7.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Tarasov et al., 2015</xref>), respectively. Reads were shifted using the standard method for ATAC samples and bigwig files were generated for visualisation using deepTools (version 3.3.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Ramírez et al., 2016</xref>). IGV (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://igv.org/app/">https://igv.org/app/</ext-link>) was employed for peak visualisation. MACS2 (version 2.2.6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) was used to call peak enrichment with the settings -g 1.412e9 --keep-dup all --nomodel --shift −100 --extsize 200. ataqv (version 1.3.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Orchard et al., 2020</xref>) was employed for assessing the fragment distribution analysis and TSS enrichment scores. To determine differentially accessible chromatin regions and produce plots, we used the R package DiffBind (version 3.8.4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Ross-Innes et al., 2012</xref>). The summits parameter was set to 150, to account for peak read lengths of 301bp. Head samples (osteoblasts vs. cartilage) and trunk samples (<italic>entpd5a</italic>+ segments vs. intersegmental regions) were individually contrasted. An element was considered <italic>entpd5a</italic>-positive if log2 fold change in read density was ≤-1 and FDR≤0.05. Conversely, <italic>entpd5a</italic>-negative elements were log2 fold change ≥1 and FDR≤0.05.</p>
<p>RNA-seq analysis was carried out by first pre-processing reads and removing duplicates using fastp (version 0.23.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2018</xref>), aligning the cleaned reads to the zebrafish reference genome GRCz11 using the STAR aligner (version 2.7.2b) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>), isolating and sorting high mapping quality reads (q &gt; 30) using SAMtools (version 1.9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Danecek et al., 2021</xref>). Raw read counts for each gene were calculated using the function featureCounts from the Subread package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Liao et al., 2014</xref>). The R package DESeq2 (version 1.38.3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Love et al., 2014</xref>) was employed for differential expression analysis with an adjusted p-value cut-off of ≤0.05. As for ATAC-seq, <italic>entpd5a</italic>+ and <italic>entpd5a</italic>-populations from head and trunk samples were contrasted amongst each other, and only genes with |log2FC|&gt;0.5 were considered for further analyses. PCA plots were produced with DESeq2, and heatmaps using the package ComplexHeatmap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gu, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gu et al., 2016</xref>).</p>

<title>Integration of ATAC-seq and RNA-seq and binding site prediction</title>
<p>Data integration was performed using the R package tidyverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wickham et al., 2019</xref>). Visualisations were generated using the R packages VennDiagram (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen and Boutros, 2011</xref>) and ggplot2. HOMER software was used to identify enrichment in transcription factor binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>). The program CIIIDER was used to identify binding sites within the <italic>entpd5a</italic> promoter sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gearing et al., 2019</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>The complex expression pattern of <italic>entpd5a</italic> is dynamically regulated during zebrafish development.</title>
<p>(A) Schematic of the BAC driving expression of Gal4FF in the <italic>entpd5a:Gal4FF</italic> transgenic line. The BAC contains the entire open reading frame of <italic>entpd5a</italic>, and part of the open reading frames of adjacent genes, <italic>coq6</italic> and <italic>aldh6a1</italic>. (B, C, D) GFP expression is detected in osteoblasts (arrow) and (partially) in cartilage (asterisk; D, inset) making up the head skeleton. (C) Strong GFP expression is seen in the notochord and the cleithrum, but also in a subset of CNS neurons. (E-J) Using the <italic>entpd5a:Kaede</italic> photoconversion line we first detect <italic>entpd5a</italic> expression at the 15 somite-stage (E). Following the same embryo, active expression of the gene continues until prior to 24 hpf (F-H). Between 24 hpf and until notochord segmentation takes place, <italic>entpd5a</italic> is only actively expressed in the ventral-most NSCs of the notochord, while expression in the remaining NSCs and vacuolated cells is turned off (I, J). (I-J, insets) Cross section of the notochord at 48 hpf and at 72 hpf in the position indicated by the white vertical line. (B) ventral view; (C-J) lateral views, anterior towards the left. (B-J) scale bars: 100μm. (D, I, J) insets scale bars: 50μm.</p></caption>

<p>(A, B) Trunk and head, respectively, of transgenic fish used for collection of FAC-sorted cells. Dashed lines indicate the site where the cut was made to separate head from trunk tissue. GFP+ cells indicate mineralising cells (A, NSCs; B, cranial osteoblasts) while mCherry+ cells indicate (A) intersegmental NSCs and (B) head cartilage. (C) PCA analysis, with red circle indicating mCherry+ cell samples and green circle GFP+ cell samples. (D) Heatmap indicating correlation amongst individual replicates. (E, F) Volcano plots showing for (E) head and (F) trunk the identified significantly accessible chromatin regions. Positive log Fold Change indicates regions open in mCherry+ cells, negative log Fold Change indicates regions open in GFP+ cells. (A, B) lateral views, anterior to the left.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work uses transgenic reporter lines to isolate entpd5a+ cells representing classical osteoblasts in the head and non-classical (osterix-) notochordal sheath cells. The authors also include entpd5a- cells, col2a1a+ cells to represent the closely associated cartilage cells. In a combination of ATAC and RNA-Seq analysis, the genome-wide transcriptomic and chromatin status of each cell population is characterized, validating their methodology and providing fundamental insights into the nature of each cell type, especially the less well-studied notochordal sheath cells. Using these data, the authors then turn to a thorough and convincing analysis of the regulatory regions that control the expression of the entpd5a gene in each cell population. Determination of transcriptional activities in developing zebrafish, again combined with ATAC data and expression data of putative regulators, results in a compelling and detailed picture of the regulatory mechanisms governing the expression of this crucial gene.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The major strength of this paper is the clever combination of RNA-Seq and ATAC analysis, further combined with functional transcriptional analysis of the regulatory elements of one crucial gene. This results in a very compelling story.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>No major weaknesses were identified, except for all the follow-up experiments that one can think of, but that would be outside of the scope of this paper.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Complementary to mammalian models, zebrafish has emerged as a powerful system to study vertebrate development and to serve as a go-to model for many human disorders. All vertebrates share the ancestral capacity to form a skeleton. Teleost fish models have been a key model to understand the foundations of skeletal development and plasticity, pairing with more classical work in amniotes such as the chicken and mouse. However, the genetic foundation of the diversity of skeletal programs in teleosts has been hampered by mapping similarities from amniotes back and not objectively establishing more ancestral states. This is most obvious in systematic, objective analysis of transcriptional regulation and tissue specification in differentiated skeletal tissues. Thus, the molecular events regulating bone-producing cells in teleosts have remained largely elusive. In this study, Petratou et al. leverage spatial experimental delineation of specific skeletal tissues -- that they term 'classical' vs 'non-classical' osteoblasts -- with associated cartilage of the endo/peri-chondrial skeleton and inter-segmental regions of the forming spine during development of the zebrafish, to delineate molecular specification of these cells by current chromatin and transcriptome analysis. The authors further show functional evidence of the utility of these datasets to identify functional enhancer regions delineating entp5 expression in 'classical' or 'non-classical' osteoblast populations. By integration with paired RNA-seq, they delineate broad patterns of transcriptional regulation of these populations as well as specific details of regional regulation via predictive binding sites within ATACseq profiles. Overall the paper was very well written and provides an essential contribution to the field that will provide a foundation to promote modeling of skeletal development and disease in an evolutionary and developmentally informed manner.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Taken together, this study provides a comprehensive resource of ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data that will be very useful for a wide variety of researchers studying skeletal development and bone pathologies. The authors show specificity in the different skeletal lineages and show the utility of the broad datasets for defining regulatory control of gene regulation in these different lineages, providing a foundation for hypothesis testing of not only agents of skeletal change in evolution but also function of genes and variations of unknown significance as it pertains to disease modeling in zebrafish. The paper is excellently written, integrating a complex history and experimental analysis into a useful and coherent whole. The terminology of 'classical' and 'non-classical' will be useful for the community in discussing the biology of skeletal lineages and their regulation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Two items arose that were not critical weaknesses but areas for extending the description of methods and integration into the existing data on the role of non-classical osteoblasts and establishment/canalization of this lineage of skeletal cells.</p>
<p>(1) In reading the text it was unclear how specific the authors' experimental dissection of the head/trunk was in isolating different entp5a osteoblast populations. Obviously, this was successful given the specificity in DEG of results, however, analysis of contaminating cells/lineages in each population would be useful - e.g. using specific marker genes to assess. The text uses terms such as 'specific to' and 'enriched in' without seemingly grounded meaning of the accuracy of these comments. Is it really specific - e.g. not seen in one or other dataset - or is there some experimental variation in this?</p>
<p>(2) Further, it would be valuable to discuss NSC-specific genes such as calymmin (Peskin 2020) which has species and lineage-specific regulation of non-classical osteoblasts likely being a key mechanistic node for ratcheting centra-specific patterning of the spine in teleost fishes. What are dynamics observed in this gene in datasets between the different populations, especially when compared with paralogues - are there obvious cis-regulatory changes that correlate with the co-option of this gene in the early regulation of non-classical osteoblasts? The addition of this analysis/discussion would anchor discussions of the differential between different osteoblasts lineages in the paper.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study characterizes classical and nonclassical osteoblasts as both types were analyzed independently (integrated ATAC-seq and RNAseq). It was found that gene expression in classical and nonclassical osteoblasts is not regulated in the same way. In classical osteoblasts, Dlx family factors seem to play an important role, while Hox family factors are involved in the regulation of spinal ossification by nonclassical osteoblasts. In the second part of the study, the authors focus on the promoter structure of entpd5a. Through the identification of enhancers, they reveal complex modes of regulation of the gene. The authors suggest candidate transcription factors that likely act on the identified enhancer elements. All the results taken together provide comprehensive new insights into the process of bone development, and point to spatio-temporally regulated promoter/enhancer interactions taking place at the entpd5a locus.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors have succeeded in justifying a sound and consistent buildup of their experiments, and meaningfully integrating the results into the design of each of their follow-up experiments. The data are solid, insightfully presented, and the conclusion valid. This makes this manuscript of great value and interest to those studying (fundamental) skeletal biology.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study is solidly constructed, the manuscript is clearly written and the discussion is meaningful - I see no real weaknesses.</p>
