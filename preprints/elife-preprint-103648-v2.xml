<title>Abstract</title><p>Kinesin motor proteins facilitate microtubule-based transport by converting chemical energy into mechanic forces, but this activity is autoinhibited until cargo is loaded. Regulatory mechanisms underlying this autoinhibitory conformation are not well understood. Here, we show that a NEver in mitosis Kinase NEKL-3 directly phosphorylates a flexible elbow region between two coiled coil domains connecting the motor head and tail of an intraflagellar transport kinesin, OSM-3. The phosphor dead (PD) mutation, but not phosphor mimic (PM) mutation, induce constitutive motility of OSM-3 in vitro. Using knock-in animals, we discovered that both PD and PM mutations shorten the <italic>C. elegans</italic> sensory cilia. The constitutively active OSM-3PD fails to enter cilia and abnormally accumulates in neurites, mimicking another hyperactive mutation, OSM-3G444E. Conversely, OSM-3PM enters cilia but moves at a reduced speed, indicating an inhibitory role of elbow phosphorylation in kinesin motility. These findings highlight the crucial role of elbow phosphorylation in regulating kinesin autoinhibition.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Kinesin motor proteins, integral to intracellular transport along microtubules, are tightly regulated for precise cargo delivery within cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Burute &amp; Kapitein, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Christensen &amp; Reck-Peterson, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hirokawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">G. Ou &amp; J. M. Scholey, 2022</xref>). Dysregulation of kinesin activity is linked to neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brady &amp; Morfini, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sleigh et al., 2019</xref>). Understanding these regulatory mechanisms is vital for elucidating disease mechanisms and developing potential therapeutic strategies. Mechanisms controlling kinesin activation involve protein interactions, post-translational modifications, and cargo binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cason &amp; Holzbaur, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Verhey &amp; Hammond, 2009</xref>). Protein phosphorylation is recognized for its regulatory role in a variety of proteins, yet its impacts on kinesin motility are not fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Banerjee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">DeBerg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Espeut et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Liang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Sato-Yoshitake et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Schäfer et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Cilia serve as a unique model for studying how microtubule-based motor proteins are regulated in specific cellular regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anvarian et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Nachury &amp; Mick, 2019</xref>). The formation of cilia relies on bidirectional intraflagellar transport (IFT) along microtubules within the axoneme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ishikawa &amp; Marshall, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Klena &amp; Pigino, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Taschner &amp; Lorentzen, 2016</xref>). At the ciliary base, kinesin-2 family proteins undergo conformational changes to transport IFT-particles loaded with ciliary precursors to the axonemal tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">G. Ou &amp; J. M. Scholey, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Taschner &amp; Lorentzen, 2016</xref>). After unloading cargo, kinesin-2 is deactivated, while dynein-2 is activated to recycle the anterograde IFT machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">G. Ou &amp; J. M. Scholey, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Prevo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Taschner &amp; Lorentzen, 2016</xref>). In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, kinesin-II and OSM-3 collaborate to construct sensory cilia in chemosensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ou et al., 2005</xref>; Guangshuo Ou &amp; Jonathan M. Scholey, 2022; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Prevo et al., 2015</xref>). Initially, kinesin-II transports IFT-particles, building the middle ciliary segments, while OSM-3 is inactive and transported by kinesin-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mitra et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ou et al., 2005</xref>; Guangshuo Ou &amp; Jonathan M. Scholey, 2022; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Prevo et al., 2015</xref>). Later, kinesin-II transfers IFT particles to OSM-3, activating it to convey cargo molecules and assemble the distal axoneme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mitra et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ou et al., 2005</xref>; Guangshuo Ou &amp; Jonathan M. Scholey, 2022; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Prevo et al., 2015</xref>). The molecular mechanisms that govern the activation and inactivation of kinesin-II and dynein-2 along the cilia are still unclear. Additionally, the regulation of OSM-3’s regional motility presents an even greater mystery: Deleting OSM-3 only disrupts the distal axoneme without affecting the ciliary middle region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mitra et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ou et al., 2005</xref>; Guangshuo Ou &amp; Jonathan M. Scholey, 2022; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Prevo et al., 2015</xref>). It remains unclear how OSM-3 becomes enriched in the distal domain than the middle segment.</p>
<p>The “elbow” of a kinesin refers to a flexible region situated between two coiled-coil domains, linking the motor head and tail of the kinesin protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Weijman et al., 2022</xref>). This junction imparts necessary flexibility and facilitates interactions between the globular motor head and the rigid stalk-like tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Verhey &amp; Hammond, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Weijman et al., 2022</xref>). The elbow region is thus considered to serve as a pivotal regulatory center, governing the motor’s activity and facilitating precise spatiotemporal control of intracellular transport processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Weijman et al., 2022</xref>). However, the post-translational modification of the kinesin elbow and its physiological consequences have not been elucidated. In our previous study, a genetic screen targeting the OSM-3(G444E) hyperactive mutation identified NEKL-4, a member of the NIMA kinase family, as a suppressor of this phenotype (Peishan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Yi et al., 2018</xref>). This finding, combined with reports that NIMA kinases regulate ciliary processes independently of their canonical mitotic roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chivukula et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Smith et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Thiel et al., 2011</xref>), prompted us to investigate whether NIMA kinases modulate OSM-3-driven intraflagellar transport. We hypothesized that NEKL-3/4, as paralogs within this family, might directly phosphorylate OSM-3 to regulate its motility. In this study, we demonstrate that the NEKL-3 kinase directly phosphorylates the elbow of OSM-3 kinesin. Our in vitro and in vivo findings suggest that elbow phosphorylation exerts an inhibitory effect on OSM-3 motility. We show that elbow phosphorylation inhibits OSM-3 motility in the soma and dendrites of sensory neurons, while its dephosphorylation is necessary for activating OSM-3 in sensory cilia.</p>

<title>NEKL-3 phosphorylates the OSM-3 kinesin’s elbow</title>
<p>To determine whether NIMA kinase family members could directly phosphorylate OSM-3, we purified prokaryotic recombinant <italic>C. elegans</italic> NEKL-3/NEKL-4 and OSM-3 protein in order to perform in vitro phosphorylation assays. We were able to obtain active recombinant NEKL-3 but not NEKL-4. The in vitro phosphorylation assays showed that NEKL-3, directly phosphorylates OSM-3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-B</xref>, Appendix Table S1). Subsequent mass spectrometric analysis revealed phosphorylation at residues 487-490, which localize to the conserved “YSTT” motif within OSM-3’s C-terminal tail region. (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-E</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>, Appendix Table S1). To gain structural insights from this motif, we employed LocalColabFold based on AlphaFold2 to predict the dimeric structure of OSM-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Evans et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Mirdita et al., 2022</xref>). The highest-confidence model was selected for further analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). These four phosphorylated “YSTT” residues are situated at the end of the hinge2 region, linking coiled-coil1 and coiled-coil2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A, C-D</xref>). In kinesin-1, this inter-coiled-coil junction is known as the “elbow”, essential for adopting a compact conformation for autoinhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Weijman et al., 2022</xref>). Accordingly, we have designated the region comprising amino acids 487-490 as the “elbow” of OSM-3. Although the elbow region is prevalent throughout the kinesin superfamily, the molecular regulation of the elbow conformation remains to be illustrated.</p>

<title>Phosphorylation at the elbow inhibits the motility of the OSM-3 kinesin in C. elegans</title>
<p>To investigate the in vivo effects of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at the “elbow” region of OSM-3, we utilized genome-editing techniques to generate knock-in worms harboring phospho-dead (PD) and phospho-mimic (PM) mutations. Specifically, we replaced the amino acids 487-490 YSTT with FAAA for the PD mutation and DDEE for the PM mutation in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> OSM-3::GFP genome (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D-E</xref>). The wild-type (WT) OSM-3::GFP facilitates anterograde IFT to construct the distal ciliary segments of sensory neurons, and OSM-3::GFP fluorescence localizes along the ciliary distal segment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-B</xref>). However, OSM-3PD::GFP was absent from cilia and excluded from cell bodies, instead forming bright puncta around the axons of sensory neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-B</xref>). By introducing an IFT marker IFT70/DYF-1::mScarlet into <italic>osm-3pd</italic> worms, we revealed a marked reduction in ciliary length to 2.15 ± 0.37 μm compared to WT animals of 7.74 ± 0.94 μm, consistent with the absence of OSM-3 kinesin within the cilia (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-C</xref>). The shortened cilia length and the formation of abnormal puncta at the neurite tip resemble the phenotype observed in our previously characterized OSM-3G444E mutation, which disrupts autoinhibition and leads to hyperactivation of OSM-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Xie et al., 2024</xref>). Conversely, OSM-3PM::GFP fluorescence did not form puncta but localized within the sensory cilia, albeit with shortened cilia of 4.89 ± 1.14 μm and reduced IFT speed at both middle and distal segment, indicating impaired OSM-3 motility (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-D</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>).</p>

<p>These findings indicate that OSM-3-PM is in an autoinhibited state capable of ciliary delivery, yet fails to achieve full activation due to defective dephosphorylation. This incomplete activation results in suboptimal motor function and intermediate ciliary length phenotypes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2 B-C</xref>). In contrast, OSM-3-PD exhibits constitutive activation leading to aggregation into axonal puncta, which completely abolishes its ciliary entry capacity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2 A-B</xref>). Our findings collectively suggest that NEKL-3-mediated phosphorylation of the OSM-3 elbow domain serves as a critical regulatory mechanism suppressing motor activity. Under physiological conditions, this phosphorylation-dependent autoinhibition likely prevents precocious activation during cytoplasmic transport, ensuring proper delivery of motor complexes to the cilium. Subsequent dephosphorylation at the ciliary base then activates OSM-3, enabling its processive movement required for intraflagellar transport.</p>
<p>While <italic>nekl-3</italic> null mutants are inviable due to essential mitotic roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barstead et al., 2012</xref>), conditional knockout (cKO) of <italic>nekl-3</italic> in ciliated neurons (Huang et al., JCB, 2025, in press, 10.1083/jcb.202407152) revealed its critical role in regulating OSM-3 dynamics. In <italic>nekl-3</italic> cKO animals, OSM-3—normally enriched in the ciliary distal segment—redistributed uniformly along the cilium, concomitant with premature activation of anterograde motility in the middle ciliary region (Huang et al., JCB, 2025, in press, 10.1083/jcb.202407152). This phenotype aligns with our model wherein NEKL-3 phosphorylation suppresses OSM-3 activity, ensuring spatiotemporal regulation of IFT.</p>

Compared to the PM model of OSM-3, the PD-mutated side chains had lower side-chain rotamer energy (The ‘fa_dun’ term) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alford et al., 2017</xref>), likely due to the larger and higher charged residues in the PM state. However, the PD mutation residues exhibited higher folding/unfolding free energy (The ‘ref’ term) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alford et al., 2017</xref>), indicating an unstable folding state of the mutated loop (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-C</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>, Appendix Table S2).

<title>Biochemical analyses reveal the role of elbow phosphorylation in OSM-3 motility</title>
<p>To directly observe the effects of phosphor mutants in the elbow region of OSM-3 in microtubule binding and motility, we examined the microtubule-stimulated ATPase activity, microtubule gliding activity and single molecular movement of the WT and mutant OSM-3 variants using prokaryotic recombinant proteins (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-F</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>). The WT full-length OSM-3 exhibited minimal ATPase activity (6.97% of KHC) due to its autoinhibition (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). As previously reported, the hyperactive OSM-3G444E mutation showed a significant increase in ATPase activity (131.65% of KHC) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Imanishi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Xie et al., 2024</xref>). Consistent with our structural predictions, the OSM-3PD mutation also led to an upregulation of ATPase activity (98.15% of KHC) to a level similar to OSM-3G444E (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). In contrast, OSM-3PM caused a slight increase in ATPase activity (34.28% of KHC) compared to WT but was markedly lower than OSM-3G444E or OSM-3PD (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4A</xref>). The PM mutant’s partial ATPase activity (34.28% of KHC) might arise from imperfect phosphomimicry—while the DDEE substitution introduces negative charges, it lacks the steric bulk of phosphorylated tyrosine (pY487). And this incomplete mimicry allows residual autoinhibition, sufficient to limit ciliary construction in vivo. Notably, the open-state OSM-3 mutants (e.g., G444E) displayed elevated ATPase activity, consistent with structural predictions of autoinhibition release (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Xie et al., 2024</xref>).

<p>Next, we performed microtubule gliding assays to examine the gliding activity of OSM-3 and its mutants. In support of the changes in ATPase activities, OSM-3PD exhibited increased gliding speed (0.67 ±0.08 μm/s) compared to WT (0.52 ±0.06 μm/s) but was slower than OSM-3G444E (0.87 ±0.09 μm/s) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B-D</xref>). To examine the processivity of OSM-3, we used a total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope to visualize GFP-labeled motors. We did not detect any processive movement of WT OSM-3 or OSM-3PM on microtubules (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B, E-G</xref>). In contrast, OSM-3PD, similar to the hyperactive OSM-3G444E, underwent persistent movement along microtubules, albeit at a slower speed and with a lower landing rate (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B, E-G</xref>). These data indicate that the OSM-3PD mutation disrupts the autoinhibition of full-length OSM-3, providing in vitro evidence for the inhibitory effect of NEKL-3 phosphorylation at the OSM-3 elbow region in regulating its autoinhibition.</p>

<p>We studied the in vivo behaviors of the OSM-3PD-A489T variant and observed that the vast majority of GFP fluorescence was localized within cilia (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Notably, neither of the GFP-tagged OSM-3PD-A489T mutants displayed any discernible GFP puncta throughout the entirety of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> body (N &gt; 100 for each double mutant), indicating that the A489T mutation completely eliminated the aberrant accumulation of OSM-3PD (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). By measuring IFT speeds, we showed that OSM-3PD-A489T moved indistinguishably from WT along the middle and distal ciliary segments (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D-E</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>). These observations were further confirmed in transgenic animals expressing GFP-tagged OSM-3PD-A489T in the <italic>osm-3(p802)</italic> null allele background (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D-E</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>).</p>
<p>To probe the regulatory role of T489 phosphorylation, we generated <italic>osm-3(T489E)</italic> and osm-<italic>3(T489A)</italic> mutant animals. Strikingly, both mutants formed axonal puncta (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7</xref>), recapitulating the hyperactive phenotype of the OSM-3G444E mutant. While the similar puncta formation in T489E and T489A mutants initially appeared paradoxical, this observation underscores the necessity of dynamic phosphorylation cycling at T489 for proper autoinhibition. Specifically, the T489A mutant likely disrupts phosphorylation-dependent autoinhibition stabilization, leading to constitutive activation, whereas the T489E mutant may mimic a “locked” phosphorylated state, preventing dephosphorylation-dependent release of autoinhibition in cilia and trapping OSM-3 in an aggregation-prone conformation. These results highlight T489 as a structural linchpin whose post-translational modification dynamically regulates motor activity. While the precise molecular mechanism—such as how phosphorylation modulates tail-motor domain interactions—remains to be elucidated, our data conclusively demonstrate that perturbing T489 (even in isolation) destabilizes autoinhibition, driving puncta formation and the constitutive activity.</p>
<p>Collectively, these in vivo findings indicate that the A489T mutation suppresses the defects of OSM-3PD, restoring its normal function and localization.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study introduces a model that elucidates the essential role of OSM-3 elbow phosphorylation in modulating kinesin motility (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). We demonstrate that NEKL-3 kinase phosphorylates the elbow region of OSM-3 kinesin in vitro. Fluorescence of OSM-3::GFP and NEKL-3::GFP was observed in the soma and dendrites of sensory neurons, indicating the sites of protein synthesis and potential regulatory activity. We propose that OSM-3 is synthesized in the soma, where its elbow region is subsequently phosphorylated by NEKL-3. This phosphorylation is critical to inhibit OSM-3 motility prior to its arrival at the cilia. Previous findings have shown that cytoplasmic dynein-1 facilitates the transport of centrioles from the soma along the dendrites to the dendritic tip, the site of ciliary base formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Li et al., 2017</xref>). We hypothesize that inactive OSM-3 is similarly transported, possibly by dynein-1, to the ciliary base as a cargo molecule. Dephosphorylation at the ciliary middle segment appears necessary to activate OSM-3, thereby driving IFT along the ciliary distal segments.</p>

</fig>
<p>In the absence of phosphorylation at the soma or dendrites, as demonstrated in the OSM-3PD model, OSM-3 may remain constitutively active. This constitutive activity might induce cellular responses that erroneously direct active OSM-3 to neurite tips rather than to cilia. Furthermore, OSM-3 harboring the G444E mutation within the hinge region exhibits constitutive activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Imanishi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Xie et al., 2024</xref>). Our recent study revealed that this hyperactive form of OSM-3 was also absent from cilia and was instead expelled through membrane abscission at the tips of aberrant neurites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Xie et al., 2024</xref>). Adjacent glial cells subsequently engulf and degrade the extruded OSM-3G444E, a process mediated by the engulfment receptor CED-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Xie et al., 2024</xref>). We propose that the constitutively active OSM-3PD is subject to a similar fate, leading to ciliary defects analogous to those observed in the <italic>osm-3</italic> null or <italic>osm-3G444E</italic> alleles.</p>
<p>Our mass spectrometry analysis did not yield conclusive data regarding the specific residue in the elbow region undergoing phosphorylation. However, intriguingly, genetic suppressor screens revealed that the A489T mutation fully restores OSM-3PD localization to the cilia. Although direct mass spectrometric analysis from OSM-3PD-A489T animals is pending, the genetic suppression strongly implicates the role of the T489 site in regulating elbow phosphorylation. Considering the previous proteomic study of Chlamydomonas flagellar proteome identified protein phosphatases in cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Pazour et al., 2005</xref>), we postulate that a protein phosphatase may dephosphorylate inhibitory phosphorylations on the OSM-3 elbow. Once within the cilia, this phosphatase in the ciliary middle segment likely dephosphorylates OSM-3, relieving inhibition from both the motor domain and the elbow region, thereby facilitating OSM-3-driven IFT and contributing to the construction of ciliary distal segments.</p>
<p>In our gliding assays, OSM-3PM has an increased gliding speed of 0.69 ±0.07 μm/s (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C-D</xref>), similar to PD mutant. PD and PM mutations are confined to the elbow region, leaving the motor head’s mechanochemical properties intact. Upon tail immobilization—which releases autoinhibition—the gliding speeds reflect motor head activity. Single-molecule assays, however, directly resolve their native regulatory states: PD mutants are constitutively active, whereas PM mutants persist in an autoinhibited state (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E-G</xref>). Although monomeric OSM-3 could theoretically mediate single-motor gliding, the previous SEC-MALS data demonstrate that OSM-3 purifies as stable dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Xie et al., 2024</xref>). Thus, dimeric OSM-3 is perhaps the predominant functional species in our assays.</p>
<p>As demonstrated in our recent study (Huang et al., JCB, 2025, In press, 10.1083/jcb.202407152), phosphorylation of OSM-3 by NEKL-3 at two distinct regions—Ser96 and the conserved “elbow” motif—differentially regulates its activity and localization. Phosphorylation at Ser96 reduces OSM-3’s ATPase activity and alters its ciliary distribution from the distal segment to a uniform localization, while elbow phosphorylation induces autoinhibition, retaining OSM-3 in the cell body. Strikingly, in vitro phosphorylation of OSM-3 by NEKL-3 significantly reduces its microtubule-binding affinity, likely arising from combined modifications at both sites. We propose a model wherein elbow phosphorylation ensures anterograde ciliary transport, while Ser96 phosphorylation fine-tunes distal segment targeting. This multistep regulation may involve distinct phosphatases to reverse phosphorylation at specific sites, a hypothesis warranting further investigation.</p>
<p>It is plausible that additional kinases are involved in elbow phosphorylation. Previous studies have shown NEKL-4 can regulate the stability of ciliary microtubules by affecting tubulin glutamylation, indicating the ciliary functions of the NIMA family kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Power et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Power et al., 2024</xref>). NEKL-3 and its homologue NEKL-4 exhibit similar localization patterns in the soma and dendrites. While NEKL-3 is indispensable for OSM-3 regulation, NEKL-4 appears to have a redundant role in this process. Although our phosphorylation assays utilized recombinant NEKL-3 due to technical constraints that we could not generate recombinant NEKL-4 with activity, it remains possible that NEKL-4, akin to NEKL-3, may also phosphorylate the OSM-3 elbow.</p>
<p>This study primarily elucidates the inhibitory phosphorylation of OSM-3 prior to ciliary entry. Equally intriguing is the regulation of OSM-3 at the ciliary tip, where its activity must be curtailed to halt IFT, thus preventing excessive ciliary elongation. Previous studies have identified DYF-5, DYF-18 kinases and other ciliary kinases as crucial regulators limiting ciliary length across various species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Berman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Burghoorn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Maurya &amp; Sengupta, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Omori et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Ozgul et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Park et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tucker et al., 2011</xref>; P. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Yi et al., 2018</xref>). It is plausible that elbow phosphorylation by these kinases serves as a regulatory mechanism restraining OSM-3 motility at the ciliary tip. Given the ubiquity of the kinesin elbow region across the superfamily, we propose that phosphorylation regulation of this region may represent a widespread mechanism governing kinesin motility. This suggests a fundamental role for elbow phosphorylation in modulating the activity of kinesins, potentially impacting a broad array of cellular processes.</p>

<title>ATPase assays</title>
<p>Microtubule stimulated ATPase activity assays were performed with a commercial kit (HTS Kinesin ATPase Endpoint Assay Biochem Kit, Cytoskeleton Inc.) following the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>

<title>In vitro Motility assays</title>
<p>Microtubule gliding assays and single molecular assays were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Imanishi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Xie et al., 2024</xref>). Briefly, the elution peak fraction was applied to a Zeba™ Spin Desalting Column to exchange the protein into motility buffer (80 mM pipes-K pH6.8, 200 mM KCl, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM ATP, 10 mM bME) before use. For microtubule gliding assays, OSM-3 was flowed into a flow cell in desired concentration and rhodamine labeled microtubules were subsequently flowed-in with assay buffer (BRB80, 1 mM ATP/Mg2<sup>+</sup>, 1% β-Mercaptoethanol, 0.08 mg/mL glucose oxidase, 0.032 mg/mL catalase and 80 mM glucose). For single molecular assays, microtubules were attached to the flow cell surface via antibodies (SAP4G5), and the motors were flowed-in in a desired concentration in assay buffer. The eGFP and the rhodamine were illuminated by 488 or 561 nm laser at 20 mW, and signals were visualized by Olympus IX83 microscopy equipped with a 150×(1.45 NA, oil, Olympus) objective lens and an ORCA-Flash4.0 V3 camera. The system was controlled by Micro-Manager 2.0.</p>

<sec id="s8h">
<title>In vitro phosphorylation assay</title>
<p>20 μM purified OSM-3 was incubated with 1 μM GST-NEKL-3 at 30 °C in 100 μL reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM ATP) for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by boiling for 5 min with an SDS-sample buffer.</p>

<sec id="s8i">
<title>Mass spectrometry</title>
<p>Following NEKL-3 treatment, OSM-3 proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Protein bands corresponding to OSM-3 were excised and subjected to digestion using the following protocol: reduction with 5 mM TCEP at 56°C for 30 min; alkylation with 10 mM iodoacetamide in darkness for 45 min at room temperature, and tryptic digestion at 37°C overnight with a 1:20 enzyme-to-protein ratio. The resulting peptides were subjected to mass spectrometry analysis. Briefly, the peptides were analyzed using an UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano system coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). We applied an in-house proteome discovery searching algorithm to search the MS/MS data against the <italic>C. elegans</italic> database. Phosphorylation sites were determined using PhosphoRS algorithm with manual validation of MS/MS spectra.</p>

<title>Genetic screening</title>
<p>To isolate suppressors of <italic>osm-3(PD)</italic>, L4 worms were collected in 4 mL M9 and treated with 20 μL ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) for 4 hours. Adult F2 animals were subjected to Dye-Filling Assay and Dye-positive mutant animals were individually cultured. Dye (DiI, 1,1’-dioctadecyl-3,3,3’,3’,-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used at a final concentration of 20 μg/mL. Whole-genome sequencing was applied to all suppressor strains to identify candidate genes.</p>

<sec id="s8k">
<title>Quantifications and statistical analysis</title>
<p>ImageJ software was used to perform measurements and quantifications of the images. For cilium length, the indicated numbers of phasmid cilia were measured. For IFT velocity, the indicated numbers of IFT particles in amphid and phasmid cilia were randomly selected for the measurement. Microtubule-stimulated ATPase activities were derived from three assays and the average activity of kinesin heavy chain (KHC) was set to 100%. Single molecule and gliding data were measured using ImageJ software and all the events measured were selected randomly. Statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism. The statistical differences were determined by two-tailed Student’s t-test or ANOVA analysis as described in the figure legends. The frequency distribution of IFT velocity was analyzed and fitted with a Gaussian distribution curve.</p>

<p>In their <bold>important</bold> manuscript, Chen et al. investigate the phospho-regulation of the C. elegans kinesin-2 motor protein OSM-3, revealing that the kinase, NEKL-3, phosphorylates a serine/threonine patch at the hinge region of the motor to mediate autoinhibition until it reaches the ciliary middle segment. The findings are supported by robust genetic data, in vivo imaging, and motility assays with wild-type and mutant motors. Overall, the study provides a <bold>compelling</bold> contribution to understanding the regulation of OSM-3 kinesin activity both on the molecular and cellular levels.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript is a focused investigation of the phosphor-regulation of a C. elegans kinesin-2 motor protein, OSM-3. In C-elegans sensory ciliary, kinesin-2 motor proteins Kinesin-II complex and OSM-3 homodimer transport IFT trains anterogradely to the ciliary tip. Kinesin-II carries OSM-3 as an inactive passenger from the ciliary base to the middle segment, where kinesin-II dissociates from IFT trains and OSM-3 gets activated and transports IFT trains to the distal segment. Therefore, activation/inactivation of OSM-3 plays an essential role in its ciliary function.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>In this study, using mass spectrometry, the authors have shown that the NEKL-3 kinase phosphorylates a serine/threonine patch at the hinge region between coiled coils 1 and 2 of an OSM-3 dimer, referred to as the elbow region in ubiquitous kinesin-1. Phosphomimic mutants of these sites inhibit OSM-3 motility both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that this phosphorylation is critical for the autoinhibition of the motor. Conversely, phospho-dead mutants of these sites hyperactivate OSM-3 motility in vitro and affect the localization of OSM3 in C. elegans. The authors also showed that Alanine to Tyrosine mutation of one of the phosphorylation rescues OS-3 function in live worms.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Collectively, this study presents evidence for the physiological role of OSM-3 elbow phosphorylation in its autoregulation, which affects ciliary localization and function of this motor. Overall, the work is well performed, and the results mostly support the conclusions of this manuscript. During revision, the authors further supported conclusions and ruled out alternative explanations by filling some logical gaps with new experimental evidence and in-text clarifications.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions: I have no additional comments or concerns.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The regulation of kinesin is fundamental to cellular morphogenesis. Previously, it has been shown that OSM-3, a kinesin required for intraflagellar transport (IFT), is regulated by autoinhibition. However, it remains totally elusive how the autoinhibition of OSM-3 is released. In this study, the authors have shown that NEKL-3 phosphorylates OSM-3 and release its autoinhibition.</p>
<p>The authors found NEKL-3 directly phosphorylates OSM-3 (Figure 1). The phophorylated residue is the &quot;elbow&quot; of OSM-3. The authors introduced phospho-dead (PD) and phospho-mimic (PM) mutations by genome editing and found that the OSM-3(PD) protein does not form cilia, and instead, accumulates to the axonal tips. The phenotype is similar to another constitutive active mutant of OSM-3, OSM-3(G444A) (Imanishi et al., 2006; Xie et al., 2024). osm-3(PM) has shorter cilia, which resembles with loss of function mutants of osm-3 (Figure 2). The authors did structural prediction and shows that G444E and PD mutations change the conformation of OSM-3 protein (Figure 3). In the single molecule assays G444E and PD mutations exhibited increased landing rate (Figure 4). By unbiased genetic screening, the authors identified a suppressor mutant of osm-3(PD), in which A489T occurs. The result confirms the importance of this residue. Based on these results, the authors suggest that NEKL-3 induces phosphorylation of the elbow domain and inactivates OSM-3 motor when the motor is synthesized in the cell body. This regulation is essential for the proper cilia formation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The finding is interesting and gives new insight into how IFT motor is regulated.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions: In the revised manuscript, the authors describe why they focused on NEKL-3 and detailed experimental procedures are presented.</p>
<p>My only minor concern is the title, which appears to be too general. Researchers in the motor protein field may firstly assume this paper focuses on kinesin-1, because the &quot;elbow&quot; domain was originally suggested in kinesin-1. This paper newly determines the elbow region of OSM-3 and shows its crucial role in autoinhibition. Therefore, a more specific title, &quot;Kinesin-2 Autoinhibition Requires Elbow Phosphorylation&quot; or &quot;OSM-3 Autoinhibition Requires Elbow phosphorylation&quot; may be better.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript is a focused investigation of the phosphor-regulation of a C. elegans kinesin-2 motor protein, OSM-3. In C-elegans sensory ciliary, kinesin-2 motor proteins Kinesin-II complex and OSM-3 homodimer transport IFT trains anterogradely to the ciliary tip. Kinesin-II carries OSM-3 as an inactive passenger from the ciliary base to the middle segment, where kinesin-II dissociates from IFT trains and OSM-3 gets activated and transports IFT trains to the distal segment. Therefore, activation/inactivation of OSM-3 plays an essential role in its ciliary function.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>In this study, using mass spectrometry, the authors have shown that the NEKL-3 kinase phosphorylates a serine/threonine patch at the hinge region between coiled coils 1 and 2 of an OSM-3 dimer, referred to as the elbow region in ubiquitous kinesin-1. Phosphomimic mutants of these sites inhibit OSM-3 motility both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that this phosphorylation is critical for the autoinhibition of the motor. Conversely, phospho-dead mutants of these sites hyperactivate OSM-3 motility in vitro and affect the localization of OSM3 in C. elegans. The authors also showed that Alanine to Tyrosine mutation of one of the phosphorylation rescues OS-3 function in live worms.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Collectively, this study presents evidence for the physiological role of OSM-3 elbow phosphorylation in its autoregulation, which affects ciliary localization and function of this motor. Overall, the work is well performed, and the results mostly support the conclusions of this manuscript. However, the work will benefit from additional experiments to further support conclusions and rule out alternative explanations, filling some logical gaps with new experimental evidence and in-text clarifications, and improving writing before I can recommend publication.</p>

<p>The regulation of kinesin is fundamental to cellular morphogenesis. Previously, it has been shown that OSM-3, a kinesin required for intraflagellar transport (IFT), is regulated by autoinhibition. However, it remains totally elusive how the autoinhibition of OSM-3 is released. In this study, the authors have shown that NEKL-3 phosphorylates OSM-3 and releases its autoinhibition.</p>
<p>The authors found NEKL-3 directly phosphorylates OSM-3 (although the method is not described clearly) (Figure 1). The phophorylated residue is the &quot;elbow&quot; of OSM-3. The authors introduced phospho-dead (PD) and phospho-mimic (PM) mutations by genome editing and found that the OSM-3(PD) protein does not form cilia, and instead, accumulates to the axonal tips. The phenotype is similar to another constitutive active mutant of OSM-3, OSM-3(G444A) (Imanishi et al., 2006; Xie et al., 2024). osm-3(PM) has shorter cilia, which resembles with loss of function mutants of osm-3 (Figure 3). The authors did structural prediction and showed that G444E and PD mutations change the conformation of OSM-3 protein (Figure 3).

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Major Concerns</p>
<p>(1) Why do the authors think that NEKL-3 phosphorylates OSM-3 in the first place? This seems to come out of nowhere and prior evidence indicating that NEKL-3 may be phosphorylating OSM-3 is not even mentioned in the Introduction.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for raising this important point. Our hypothesis that NEKL-3 phosphorylates OSM-3 stems from prior findings in our lab. In a previous study (Yi et al., Traffic, 2018, PMID: 29655266), we identified NEKL-4, a member of the NIMA kinase family, as a suppressor of the OSM-3(G444E) hyperactive mutation. This discovery prompted us to explore the broader role of NIMA kinases in regulating OSM3. Subsequent genetic screens (Xie et al., EMBO J, 2024, PMID: 38806659) revealed that both NEKL-3 and NEKL-4 suppress multiple OSM-3 mutations, further supporting their functional interaction. Given the established role of NIMA kinases in phosphorylation-dependent processes (Fry et al., JCS, 2012, PMID: 23132929; Chivukula et al., Nat. Med., 2020, PMID: 31959991; Thiel, C. et al. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2011, PMID: 21211617; Smith, L. A. et al., J. Am. Soc. Nephrol., 2006, PMID: 16928806), we hypothesized that NEKL-3/4 may directly phosphorylate OSM-3 to modulate its activity.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we expressed recombinant <italic>C. elegans</italic> NEKL-3 and OSM-3 proteins and conducted in vitro phosphorylation assays. While we were unable to obtain active recombinant NEKL-4 (limitations noted in the revised text), our experiments with NEKL-3 revealed phosphorylation at residues 487-490 (YSTT motif) in OSM-3’s tail region, as confirmed by mass spectrometry. These findings are now explicitly contextualized in the Introduction and Results sections of the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Page #4, Line #11:</p>
<p>“...In our previous study (Yi et al., Traffic, 2018, PMID: 29655266), a genetic screen targeting the OSM-3(G444E) hyperactive mutation identified NEKL-4, a member of the NIMA kinase family, as a suppressor of this phenotype. This finding, combined with reports that NIMA kinases regulate ciliary processes independently of their canonical mitotic roles (Fry et al., JCS, 2012, PMID: 23132929; Chivukula et al., Nat. Med., 2020, PMID: 31959991; Thiel, C. et al. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2011, PMID: 21211617; Smith, L. A. et al., J. Am. Soc. Nephrol., 2006, PMID: 16928806), prompted us to investigate whether NIMA kinases modulate OSM-3-driven intraflagellar transport. We hypothesized that NEKL-3/4, as paralogs within this family, might directly phosphorylate OSM-3 to regulate its motility...”</p>

<p>OSM-3, we purified prokaryotic recombinant C. elegans NEKL-3/NEKL-4 and OSM3 protein in order to perform in vitro phosphorylation assays. We were able to obtain active recombinant NEKL-3 but not NEKL-4. The in vitro phosphorylation assays showed that NEKL-3, directly phosphorylates OSM-3 (Fig. 1A-B, Appendix Table S1). Subsequent mass spectrometric analysis revealed phosphorylation at residues 487-490, which localize to the conserved &quot;YSTT&quot; motif within OSM-3’s C-terminal tail region ...”</p>

<p>(2) The authors need to characterize the proteins they expressed and purified for in vitro ATPase and motility assays. Are these proteins monomers or dimers?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>For our in vitro ATPase and motility assays, OSM-3 was expressed in <italic>E. coli BL21(DE3)</italic> and purified using established protocols (Xie et al., EMBO J, 2024, PMID: 38806659; Imanishi et al., JCB, 2006, PMID: 17000874). To confirm its oligomeric state, we analyzed recombinant OSM-3 by size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS). As reported in Xie et al. (2024), OSM-3 (~80 kDa monomer) elutes with a molecular weight of 173–193 kDa under physiological buffer conditions, consistent with a homodimeric assembly. These findings confirm that the functional unit used in our assays is the biologically relevant dimer. This characterization has been added to the revised manuscript on Page #35, Line #7.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors primarily used PD and PM mutations, which affect all four amino acids in the region. This may or may not be physiologically relevant. Figure 5 indicates that T489 is a critical regulatory site. However, this conclusion is undermined by reliance on PD mutations, which affect all four amino acids. Creating PM (T489E) and PD (T489A) mutations based on WT OSM-3 would better reflect physiological relevance. In vitro assays with a single phosphomimic or phosphor-dead mutation at residue 489 are missing at the end of this story. This would better link Figure 5 with the rest of the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this constructive critique. Below, we address the concerns and integrate new data to strengthen the link between T489 and autoinhibition:</p>
<p>To probe the regulatory role of T489 phosphorylation, we generated osm-3(T489E) (phosphomimetic, PM) and osm-3(T489A) (phospho-dead, PD) mutant animals. Strikingly, both mutants formed axonal puncta (Figure S7), recapitulating the hyperactive phenotype of the OSM-3G444E mutant. While the similar puncta formation in PM and PD mutants initially appeared paradoxical, this observation underscores the necessity of dynamic phosphorylation cycling at T489 for proper autoinhibition. Specifically, the PD mutant (T489A) likely disrupts phosphorylationdependent autoinhibition stabilization, leading to constitutive activation, where as the PM mutant (T489E) may mimic a &quot;locked&quot; phosphorylated state, preventing dephosphorylation-dependent release of autoinhibition in cilia and trapping OSM-3 in an aggregation-prone conformation. These results highlight T489 as a structural linchpin whose post-translational modification dynamically regulates motor activity. While the precise molecular mechanism—such as how phosphorylation modulates tailmotor domain interactions—remains to be elucidated, our data conclusively demonstrate that perturbing T489 (even in isolation) destabilizes autoinhibition, driving puncta formation and the constitutive activity.</p>
<p>We have integrated the above paragraph in the revised manuscript on page #8, line #27.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) There seems to be a disconnect between the MT gliding assays in Figure 4C and single molecule motility assays in Figure 4E. The gliding assays show that all constructs can glide microtubules at near WT speeds. Yet, the motility assays show that WT and PM cannot land or walk on MTs. The authors need to explain why this is the case. Is this because surface immobilization of kinesin from its tail disrupts autoinhibition? Alternatively, the protein preparation may include monomers that cannot be autoinhibited and cannot land and processively walk on surface-immobilized microtubules (because they only have one motor domain) but can glide microtubules when immobilized on the surface from their tail.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The surface immobilization of OSM-3 via its tail domain disrupts autoinhibition, a phenomenon previously observed in other kinesins such as kinesin-1 (Nitzsche et al, Methods Cell Biol., 2010, PMID: 20466139). In our assays, OSM-3 was nonspecifically immobilized on glass surfaces, enabling microtubule gliding by motors whose autoinhibition was relieved through tail anchoring. Critically, the PD and PM mutations reside in the tail region and do not alter the intrinsic properties of the motor head domain. Consequently, once autoinhibition is released via immobilization, the gliding velocities reflect the conserved motor head activity, which is expected to remain comparable across all constructs. While we cannot entirely rule out the presence of monomeric OSM-3 in solution, several lines of evidence argue against this possibility. First, the mutations are located in the elbow region, which is dispensable for motor dimerization. Second, SEC-MALS analysis from prior studies confirms that purified OSM-3 exists predominantly as dimers in solution.</p>
<p>We have discussed these issues in the revised text on page #10, line #18:</p>
<p>“…In our gliding assays, OSM-3PM has an increased gliding speed of 0.69 ± 0.07 μm/s (Fig. 4 C-D), similar to PD mutant. PD and PM mutations are confined to the elbow region, leaving the motor head’s mechanochemical properties intact. Upon tail immobilization—which releases autoinhibition—the gliding speeds reflect motor head activity. Single-molecule assays, however, directly resolve their native regulatory states: PD mutants are constitutively active, whereas PM mutants persist in an autoinhibited state (Fig. 4E-G). Although monomeric OSM-3 could theoretically mediate singlemotor gliding, the previous SEC-MALS data demonstrate that OSM-3 purifies as stable dimers (Xie et al., EMBO J, 2024, PMID: 38806659). Thus, dimeric OSM-3 is perhaps the predominant functional species in our assays…”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) An alternative explanation for the data is that both PD and PM mutations result in loss-of-function effects, disrupting OSM-3 activity. For instance:</p>
<p>a) In Figure 2C, both mutations cause shorter cilia than the wild type (WT).</p>
<p>b) In Figure 4A, both mutations result in higher ATPase activity than WT.</p>
<p>c) In Figure 4D, both mutations show increased gliding velocity compared to WT. These results suggest the observed effects could stem from loss of function rather than phosphorylation-specific regulation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although PD and PM mutations exhibit superficially similar &quot;loss-of-function&quot; phenotypes in certain assays, they mechanistically disrupt motor regulation in distinct ways:</p>
<p>a) Ciliary Length (Figure 2C) PD Mutants: Hyperactivation causes OSM-3-PD to prematurely aggregate into axonal puncta, preventing ciliary entry. Consequently, cilia are built solely by the weaker Kinesin-II motor, which only constructs shorter middle segments.</p>
<p>PM Mutants: OSM-3-PM retains autoinhibition during transport (enabling ciliary entry) but cannot be dephosphorylated in cilia. This blocks activation, leaving OSM-3-PM partially functional and resulting in cilia intermediate in length between WT and PD.</p>
<p>We have discussed this issue in the revised text on page #5, line #30:</p>
<p>“…These findings indicate that OSM-3-PM is in an autoinhibited state capable of ciliary delivery, yet fails to achieve full activation due to defective dephosphorylation. This incomplete activation results in suboptimal motor function and intermediate ciliary length phenotypes (Fig.2 B-C). In contrast, OSM-3-PD exhibits constitutive activation leading to aggregation into axonal puncta, which completely abolishes its ciliary entry capacity (Fig.2 A-B)...”</p>
<p>b) ATPase Activity (Figure 4A)</p>
<p>PD Mutants: Fully autoinhibition-released (98.15% of KHC ATPase activity), consistent with constitutive activation.</p>
<p>PM Mutants: Show partial ATPase activity (34.28% of KHC), reflecting imperfect phosphomimicry. While the DDEE substitution introduces negative charges, it fails to fully replicate the steric/kinetic effects of phosphorylated tyrosine (Y486; phenyl ring absent), resulting in incomplete autoinhibition stabilization. Despite this, the residual inhibition is sufficient to phenocopy shorter cilia in vivo.</p>
<p>We have discussed this issue in the revised text on page #7, line#19:</p>
<p>“…The PM mutant’s partial ATPase activity (34.28% of KHC) might arise from imperfect phosphomimicry—while the DDEE substitution introduces negative charges, it lacks the steric bulk of phosphorylated tyrosine (pY487). And this incomplete mimicry allows residual autoinhibition, sufficient to limit ciliary construction in vivo...”</p>
<p>c) Microtubule Gliding Velocity (Figure 4D)</p>
<p>Gliding Assay Limitation: Tail immobilization artificially releases autoinhibition, masking regulatory differences. Thus, all constructs (PD, PM) exhibit similar velocities (~0.7 µm/s), reflecting conserved motor head activity.</p>
<p>Single-Molecule Assay (Figure 4E): Directly resolves native autoinhibition states:</p>
<p>PD mutants show robust motility (autoinhibition released).</p>
<p>PM mutants remain largely inactive (autoinhibition retained).</p>
<p>We have discussed this issue in the revised text on page #10, line#18:</p>
<p>“…In our gliding assays, OSM-3PM has an increased gliding speed of 0.69 ± 0.07 μm/s (Fig. 4 C-D), similar to PD mutant. PD and PM mutations are confined to the elbow region, leaving the motor head’s mechanochemical properties intact.

<p>We suspect that the Reviewer asked for NEKL-3-treated OSM-3.</p>
<p>In our other study which has just been accepted by the Journal of Cell Biology, NEKL3-treated OSM-3 significantly reduced the affinity between OSM-3 motor and microtubules and showed very low ATPase activity. We have cited and discussed this in the revised text on page #10, line #28:</p>
<p>“…As demonstrated in our recent study (Huang et al., JCB, 2025, In press, attached), phosphorylation of OSM-3 by NEKL-3 at two distinct regions—Ser96 and the conserved &quot;elbow&quot; motif—differentially regulates its activity and localization. Phosphorylation at Ser96 reduces OSM-3’s ATPase activity and alters its ciliary distribution from the distal segment to a uniform localization, while elbow phosphorylation induces autoinhibition, retaining OSM-3 in the cell body. Strikingly, in vitro phosphorylation of OSM-3 by NEKL-3 significantly reduces its microtubulebinding affinity, likely arising from combined modifications at both sites. We propose a model wherein elbow phosphorylation ensures anterograde ciliary transport, while Ser96 phosphorylation fine-tunes distal segment targeting. This multistep regulation may involve distinct phosphatases to reverse phosphorylation at specific sites, a hypothesis warranting further investigation….”</p>

<p>(2) It should be described why the authors hypothesized NEKL-3 phosphorylates OSM3. Was there genetic evidence? Did the authors screened cilia-related kinases? or Did the authors identify it incidentally? Providing this information would help readers to understand the context of the research.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate both Reviewers for pointing out this issue.</p>
<p>Our hypothesis that NEKL-3 phosphorylates OSM-3 stems from prior findings in our lab. In a previous study (Yi et al., Traffic, 2018, PMID: 29655266), we identified NEKL-4, a member of the NIMA kinase family, as a suppressor of the OSM-3(G444E) hyperactive mutation. This discovery prompted us to explore the broader role of NIMA kinases in regulating OSM-3. Subsequent genetic screens (Xie et al., EMBO J, 2024, PMID: 38806659) revealed that both NEKL-3 and NEKL-4 suppress multiple OSM-3 mutations, further supporting their functional interaction. Given the established role of NIMA kinases in phosphorylation-dependent processes (Fry et al., JCS, 2012, PMID: 23132929; Chivukula et al., Nat. Med., 2020, PMID: 31959991; Thiel, C. et al. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2011, PMID: 21211617; Smith, L. A. et al., J. Am. Soc. Nephrol., 2006, PMID: 16928806), we hypothesized that NEKL-3/4 may directly phosphorylate OSM3 to modulate its activity.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we expressed recombinant <italic>C. elegans</italic> NEKL-3 and OSM-3 proteins and conducted in vitro phosphorylation assays. While we were unable to obtain active recombinant NEKL-4 (limitations noted in the revised text), our experiments with NEKL-3 revealed phosphorylation at residues 487-490 (YSTT motif) in OSM-3’s tail region, as confirmed by mass spectrometry. These findings are now explicitly contextualized in the Introduction and Results sections of the revised manuscript.</p>

This finding, combined with reports that NIMA kinases regulate ciliary processes independently of their canonical mitotic roles (Fry et al., JCS, 2012, PMID: 23132929; Chivukula et al., Nat.

Nephrol., 2006, PMID: 16928806), prompted us to investigate whether NIMA kinases modulate OSM-3-driven intraflagellar transport.

<p>(3) It is curious the authors have not addressed the cilia phenotype and the localization of OSM-3 in nekl-3 mutant. Regardless of whether these observations agrees with the proposed mechanisms, it is essential for the authors to show and discuss the cilia phenotype and OSM-3 localization in nekl-3 mutants.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for highlighting this critical point. Indeed, <italic>nekl-3</italic> null mutants are inviable due to essential mitotic roles (Barstead et al., 2012, PMID: 23173093), precluding direct analysis of ciliary phenotypes. To bypass this limitation, we recently generated <italic>nekl-3</italic> conditional knockouts (cKOs) in ciliated neurons (Huang et al., JCB, 2025 in press, attached). In these mutants, OSM-3—which is normally enriched in the ciliary distal segment—becomes uniformly distributed along the cilium. This redistribution correlates with premature activation of OSM-3-driven anterograde motility in the ciliary middle region, consistent with our proposed model where NEKL3 phosphorylation suppresses OSM-3 activity. We have now integrated this result and discussion into the revised manuscript, reinforcing the physiological relevance of NEKL-3-mediated regulation in ciliary transport.</p>

<p>(c) The methods to predict conformational changes by introducing various point mutations are interesting (Figure 3). However, the methods require more detailed descriptions. In the current form, the manuscript only lists the tools used. The pipelines and parameters need to be described. This information is important because AlphaFoldbased predictions often give folded conformations because the training data are mainly composed of folded proteins. It is surprising that the methods applied here give open conformations induced by point mutations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have described the pipelines in the revised Methods section on page#34, line#25:</p>
<p>“…OSM-3 model was predicted using LocalColabFold (Evans et al., 2022; Jumper et al., 2021; Mirdita et al., 2022). Mutated proteins were designed by Pymol 2.6, choosing the rotamer of the mutated residues in G444E, PM and PD models with the least clash as the initial conformation. To predict mutation-induced conformational changes, the initial models were subjected to Pyrosetta (Chaudhury et al., 2010). The energies of pre-relaxed models were evaluated with Rosetta Energy Function 2015 (Alford et al., 2017), and then the relax procedure were applied to the models with default parameters to obtain the relaxed models visualized by Pymol to minimize the energy of these models. In detail, to obtain the relaxed models visualized by Pymol and minimize the energy of these models, the classic relax mover was used in the procedure mentioned above with default settings.

<p>(5) The authors have purified proteins. Do they show different properties in gel filtration that are consistent with the structural prediction? It is anticipated that open-form mutants are eluted from earlier than closed forms.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful suggestion. Indeed, our recent study supported that the open-from of the active OSM-3 G444E mutation were eluted earlier than the wild-type closed form (Xie et al., EMBO J., 2024). While the current study did not perform gel filtration chromatography (SEC) to directly compare the hydrodynamic properties of the OSM-3 mutants, our functional assays provide robust evidence for conformational changes predicted by structural modeling. For example: ATPase activity assays revealed that the open-state mutants (e.g., G444E and PD muatnts) exhibited significantly enhanced enzymatic activity (Figure 4A), consistent with structural predictions of an active, destabilized autoinhibitory interface (Figure 3A). These functional readouts collectively validate the predicted structural states. While SEC could further corroborate these findings by distinguishing compact (closed) versus extended (open) conformations, we prioritized assays that directly link structural predictions to in vitro enzymatic activity and in vivo ciliary transport dynamics. Future studies incorporating SEC or cryo-EM will provide additional biophysical validation of these states.</p>
<p>We have revised the text in the manuscript (Page #7, Lines #22):</p>
<p>“…Notably, the open-state OSM-3 mutants (e.g., G444E) displayed elevated ATPase activity, consistent with structural predictions of autoinhibition release (Fig. 3A, Fig. 4A) (Xie et al., 2024). While hydrodynamic profiling (e.g., SEC) could further resolve conformational states, our functional assays directly connect predicted structural changes to altered biochemical and cellular activity...”</p>
