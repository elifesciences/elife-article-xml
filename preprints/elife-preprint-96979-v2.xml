<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) is one of three endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane stress sensors that mediate the unfolded protein response (UPR). Despite its crucial role in long-term ER stress adaptation, regulation of ATF6 alpha (α) signalling remains poorly understood, possibly because its activation involves ER-to-Golgi and nuclear trafficking. Here, we generated an ATF6α/IRE1 dual UPR reporter CHO-K1 cell line and performed an unbiased genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis screen to systematically profile genetic factors that specifically contribute to ATF6α signalling in the presence and absence of ER stress. The screen identified both anticipated and new candidate genes that regulate ATF6α activation. Among these, calreticulin (CRT), a key ER luminal chaperone, selectively repressed ATF6α signalling: Cells lacking CRT constitutively activated a BiP::sfGFP ATF6α-dependent reporter, had higher BiP levels and an increased rate of trafficking and processing of ATF6α. Purified CRT interacted with the luminal domain of ATF6α <italic>in vitro</italic> and the two proteins co-immunoprecipitated from cell lysates. CRT depletion exposed a negative feedback loop implicating ATF6α in repressing IRE1 activity basally and overexpression of CRT reversed this repression. Our findings indicate that CRT, beyond its known role as a chaperone, also serves as an ER repressor of ATF6α to selectively regulate one arm of the UPR.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>This version of the manuscript has been revised to update the following:
1. To address whether the introduction of the reporter system affects normal BiP protein levels in the cells, we conducted new experiments comparing endogenous BiP protein levels between reporter-containing cells and parental CHO-K1 cells using immunoblotting with an anti-BiP antibody. This information is now included in revised <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S1C</xref>.
2. To further evaluate ER stress levels in CRT-depleted cells, we compared expression levels of endogenous ER resident proteins containing a KDEL signal (e.g., P3H1, GRP94, BiP and PDI) in parental CHO-K1 cells, dual UPR reporter cell lines (XC45-6S) and CRT-depleted cells (CRT∆#2P) under basal conditions and during ER stress by immunoblotting. This comparison confirmed the basal elevation in BiP protein level in cells lacking CRT, consistent with previous findings (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>) and more broadly the integrity of UPR signalling in cells lacking CRT. This new information has been incorporated as <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S5</xref>.
3. To investigate if CRT depletion alters the redox status of ATF6 we compared ATF6⍺ redox status in parental and CRT-depleted cells using non-reducing SDS-PAGE. These new data have been included as <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S7</xref> and are detailed explained in the results section of the revised version.
4. We have included additional details in the Methods section regarding the creation of the XBP1 reporter.
5. We have simplified <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref> to make it more interpretable by focussing the attention of the reader on the transfected population.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and its associated chaperones, constitutes the major cellular compartment for the synthesis, folding, and quality control of secretory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sun and Brodsky, 2019</xref>). An imbalance between synthesis and folding can lead to ER stress, potentially resulting in ER dysfunction and pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wang and Kaufman, 2016</xref>). To restore cellular homeostasis, adaptive pathways, collectively known as the unfolded protein response (UPR), are activated. The UPR is coordinated by three known ER stress transducers: IRE1, PERK and ATF6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). Of the three arms of the UPR, the mechanisms that govern ER stress-dependent ATF6 activation remain the least well understood, even though ATF6 mediates much of the ER-stress-induced changes in gene expression observed in vertebrates. Thus, ATF6 is specialised in the regulation of quality control proteins in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adachi et al., 2008</xref>) and complete loss of ATF6 impairs survival upon ER stress in cellular and animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Wu et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>ATF6 is a type II transmembrane ER glycoprotein containing an N-terminal portion comprising its basic leucine zipper (b-ZIP), DNA-binding and transactivation domains and a C-terminal ER luminal domain (LD) that senses stress and regulates ATF6α activity. Vertebrates have two isoforms: ATF6α and ATF6β. The ATF6α isoform dominates the regulation of UPR target genes in mammalian cells and is the focus of this study. Unlike IRE1 and PERK, which remain in the ER after UPR activation, ATF6 translocates from the ER to the Golgi, where it is sequentially cleaved by two serine protease, site-1 (S1P) and site-2 (S2P) proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Haze et al., 1999</xref>) to release its soluble active N-cytosolic domain (N-ATF6α) that is further translocated into the nucleus. There, N-ATF6α acts as a potent but short-live transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">George et al., 2020</xref>) that binds ER stress response elements (ERSE-I and -II) in the promoter regions of UPR target genes in complex with the general transcription factor NF-Y and YY1 to upregulate the expression of a large number of ER chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Li et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Yoshida et al., 2000</xref>). Among those, the gene encoding the ER Hsp70 chaperone BiP (<italic>GRP78</italic>) has been well documented as an important ATF6α target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adachi et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>At ER level, it has been proposed that ATF6α is retained by its association with BiP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Shen et al., 2002</xref>), yet the existence of additional factors influencing its ER localisation remains uncertain. Redox regulation has also been proposed to keep ATF6α in the ER as a mixture of monomeric and multimeric disulphide-linked forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Nadanaka et al., 2007</xref>) that upon ER stress are reduced by protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) family members (such as ERp18 or PDIA5), promoting the transit of a reduced monomeric ATF6α population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Higa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Oka et al., 2019</xref>). COPII-coated vesicles have been implicated in the trafficking of ATF6α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Schindler and Schekman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lynch et al., 2012</xref>) and the ATF6α_LD’s N-glycosylation state has also been proposed to influence its ER trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hong et al., 2004</xref>), yet the details of these processed remain incompletely understood. Furthermore, it is widely recognised that a key step of ATF6α activation occurs in the Golgi, the site of proteolytic processing. This is reflected in the inability of cells lacking S2P to trigger BiP transcription in response to ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Ye et al., 2000</xref>). Hence, although there is a relatively clear understanding of the events triggering ATF6α cleavage and activation upon reaching the Golgi, much remains unknown about the factors influencing ATF6α regulation in the ER.</p>
<p>ATF6α signalling also involves crosstalk with the IRE1 pathway. This is partly mediated by direct heterodimerisation of N-ATF6α with XBP1s the active, spliced form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Yamamoto et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">2004</xref>). However, the relationship between the ATF6α and IRE1 pathway is complex: (i) XBP1 and IRE1 genes are transcriptional targets of activated ATF6α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Yoshida et al., 2001</xref>), (ii) XBP1s and IRE1 have some different target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Shoulders et al., 2013</xref>), (iii) and ATF6α activity can also repress IRE1 signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Walter et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we established an ATF6α/IRE1 dual UPR reporter cellular model to conduct an unbiased genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen focussed on ATF6α. Complemented by bioinformatic analysis, post-screen hit validation using targeted gene editing and <italic>in vitro</italic> biophysical assays we report on a comprehended analysis of a complex signalling pathway.</p>

<title>A dual UPR reporter cell line to monitor ATF6α and IRE1 activity</title>
<p>In vertebrates, the transcriptional activation of BiP is predominantly governed by ATF6α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adachi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Adamson et al., 2016</xref>). To dynamically monitor ATF6α activity in live cells, a “landing pad” cassette, containing recombination sites and expressing the <italic>Cricetulus griseus</italic> (<italic>cg</italic>) BiP promoter region fused with a super folder green fluorescent protein (BiP::sfGFP), was targeted to the <italic>ROSA26</italic> safe-harbour locus of Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1) using CRISPR/Cas9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Gaidukov et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental S1A</xref>) in a previously characterised cell line (<italic>CHO-XC45)</italic> in the lab carrying an integrated XBP1s::mCherry reporter transgene monitoring the IRE1 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Harding et al., 2019</xref>). Flow cytometry analysis of these ATF6α/IRE1 dual UPR reporter cells (referred as <italic>XC45-6S</italic>) treated with ER stress-inducing agents such as tunicamycin (which inhibits N-glycosylation), 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (which inhibits glycolysis), or thapsigargin (which depletes ER calcium), revealed time-dependent activation of both UPR arms with a broad dynamic range (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>, top panel, and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental S1B</xref>). Additionally, the introduction of the reporter systems did not affect basal BiP protein levels when compared with plain CHO-K1 cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental S1C</xref>).</p>

<p>Disruption of endogenous <italic>cgATF6</italic>α in <italic>XC45-6S</italic> cells by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing abolished the responsiveness of the BiP::sfGFP reporter to ER stress and derepressed IRE1 signalling, both basally and in response to ER stress. These observations are consistent with ATF6α’s obligatory role in BiP expression and with findings that IRE1 signalling is repressed by ATF6α activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Walter et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>To further validate these UPR reporters, cells were subjected to tunicamycin treatment in the presence of Ceapin-A7 (a small molecule that blocks ATF6α activation by tethering it to the lysosome) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Gallagher et al., 2016</xref>) or an S1P inhibitor (PF429242) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hawkins et al., 2008</xref>). Ceapin-A7 effectively blocked the activation of the ATF6α fluorescent reporter, whereas the S1P inhibitor partially attenuated the BiP::sfGFP signal in stressed cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental S1D</xref>).</p>
<p>The selective IRE1 inhibitor 4μ8C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cross et al., 2012</xref>), did not affect the ATF6α-dependent BiP::sfGFP reporter under ER stress conditions, but blocked the IRE1-dependent XBP1s::mCherry reporter (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental S1E</xref>). Collectively, these observations confirm that the dual UPR reporter <italic>XC45-6S</italic> cell line enables independent monitoring of ATF6α and IRE1 activities, making it well-suited for identifying additional modulators of ATF6α signalling by high-throughput techniques.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out screens to profile ATF6α signalling</title>
<p>To identify regulators of ATF6α, a library of pooled lentiviral single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting 20,680 predicted protein-coding genes in CHO cells, with ∼ 6 sgRNAs per gene, was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ordóñez et al., 2021</xref>). Transduction of the <italic>XC45-6S</italic> ATF6α/IRE1 dual UPR reporter cells was performed at a coverage of ∼ 640X, with a multiplicity of infection of 0.3, intentionally set low to disfavour acquisition of more than one sgRNA by any one cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Shalem et al., 2014</xref>). Non-transduced cells were purged by puromycin selection, and the pool of transduced cells was expanded for 10 days to favour gene editing and the establishment of loss of-function phenotypes.</p>
<p>To systematically identify genes regulating the ATF6α transcriptional programme, two positive selection screens were conducted in parallel: a “loss-of-ATF6α function screen” under ER stress conditions to identify activators/enhancers of ATF6α, and a “gain-of-ATF6α function screen” under basal conditions to identify ATF6α repressors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). In the ATF6α <italic>activator screen</italic>, cells were stressed by exposure to 2-Deoxy-D-glucose for 18 h before fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS). Cells at the lowest 2% of BiP::sfGFP signal, with preserved IRE1 signalling (BiP::sfGFP<sup>low</sup>; XBP1s::mCherry<sup>high</sup>), were selected for further analysis. The search for genes whose inactivation de-represses ATF6α (ATF6α <italic>repressor screen</italic>) was conducted in the absence of ER stress. Here, cells exhibiting a constitutively active ATF6α reporter but only basal levels of the IRE1 reporter (BiP::sfGFP<sup>high</sup>; XBP1s::mCherry<sup>low</sup>) were selected for further analysis. Sorted cells from both screens underwent two rounds of progressive enrichment through cell culture expansion and phenotypic selection by sorting. As a result, a progressive increase in the proportion of BiP:sfGFP<sup>low</sup> or BiP:sfGFP<sup>high</sup> cells occurred in the respective screen (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental S2A</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2B</xref>).</p>
<p>The integrated sgRNAs were amplified from genomic DNA, and their abundance in the enriched populations after one or two rounds of sorting was estimated by deep sequencing and compared to a reference sample of transduced and unsorted population. MAGeCK bioinformatics analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Li et al., 2014</xref>) was used to determine sgRNA sequence enrichment, establishing the corresponding ranking of targeted genes (Table S1; see GEO accession number: GSE254745) and quality controls (QC) measures (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental S2C</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2D</xref>).

<title>Expected and new candidate genes that contribute to ATF6α activation</title>
<p>MAGeCK-based analysis of sgRNAs enriched in cells with attenuated ATF6α signalling and intact activity of the IRE1 reporter, revealed that those targeting S1P and S2P proteases (encoding by the <italic>MBTPS1</italic> and <italic>MBTPS2</italic> genes) were the two most enriched genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>), validating the experimental methodology. Gene Ontology (GO) cluster analysis of the 100 most significantly enriched targeted genes revealed up to 19 enriched pathways (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplemental S3A</xref>), with the top two pathways highlighted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> being closely related to ATF6α signalling.</p>
<p>We focused our attention on targeted genes that could act upstream to find early regulatory events of ATF6α. Therefore, targeted genes that were likely to act downstream and impact on the cleaved ATF6α form (N-ATF6α) were dismissed, including the <italic>SP2</italic> transcription factor, which shares the binding site with NF-Y (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Völkel et al., 2015</xref>), and also genes involved in nuclear import, such as <italic>NUP50</italic> and <italic>SEH1L</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplemental S3A</xref>). Similar consideration was applied to <italic>PRMT8</italic>, as the family member <italic>PRMT1</italic> has been shown to enhance ATF6α transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baumeister et al., 2005</xref>). Additionally, guides targeting <italic>IGFR1</italic> and <italic>CXXC1</italic> were also dismissed as likely affecting ER proteostasis indirectly <italic>via</italic> cellular growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Pfaffenbach et al., 2012</xref>). Guides targeting the genes encoding the ER resident proteins <italic>SEC61A1</italic>, <italic>SEC61B</italic> (both components of the translocon machinery) and the <italic>DNAJB9</italic>/ERDj4 co-chaperone were highly enriched. However, given their roles in selectively regulating IRE1 signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Adamson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Shoulders et al., 2013</xref>), we deemed their identification to reflect a bias towards IRE1 activators arising from the selection scheme for ATF6α<sup>low</sup> and IRE1<sup>high</sup> cells.</p>
<p>One of the genes that could plausibly play a proximal role and act upstream on ATF6α activation was the ubiquitous Golgi-localised protease FURIN (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Like S1P, FURIN belongs to the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Nakayama, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Van de Ven et al., 1991</xref>) and is thus poised to act at the level of ATF6α proteolytic processing. All six sgRNAs targeting <italic>FURIN</italic> were enriched in the BiP:sfGFP<sup>low</sup> cells, a level of enrichment similar to that observed to the established ATF6α regulators <italic>MBTPS1</italic> (S1P) and <italic>MBTPS2</italic> (S2P) (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplemental S3B</xref>). The genotype-phenotype relationship suggested by the screen was also observed upon targeting <italic>FURIN</italic> in ATF6α/IRE1 dual reporter cells, as both pools of targeted cells and an individual clone had diminished responsiveness of BiP:sfGFP to ER stress (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplemental S4A</xref> left and middle panels). Furthermore, the S1P inhibitor more effectively attenuated the BiP::sfGFP reporter in <italic>FURIN</italic>Δ cells compared to wild-type cells (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplemental S4A</xref> right panel, S4B and S4C).</p>
<p>These observations raised the possibility of redundant roles of FURIN and S1P in activating ATF6α by cleaving its luminal domain. However, ATF6α_LD expressed and purified from mammalian cells, failed to serve as a substrate for FURIN <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplemental S4D</xref>), suggesting instead that FURIN’s role in regulating ATF6α signalling is indirect.</p>

<title>Calreticulin and an interconnected gene network repress ATF6α</title>
<p>To identify genes that basally repress ATF6α, a similar MAGeCK-based data analysis was applied to the targeted genes enriched in cells that selectively activated the ATF6α reporter under basal conditions. GO analysis of the 100 most significantly enriched genes established an interconnected network highlighting signalling processes including the calreticulin (CRT)/calnexin (CNX) cycle, N-glycan biosynthesis, ERAD and COPI-dependent Golgi-to ER retrograde traffic (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplemental S3C</xref>). Among these, the top 10 genes included CRT, components of the dolichol-phosphate mannose (DPM) synthase complex, such as <italic>DPM3</italic>, <italic>DPM2</italic> and <italic>DPM1</italic> involved in the N-glycosylation process, and ERAD components, such as <italic>UBE2G2, SEL1L</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>Because these four pathways potentially activate all three branches of the UPR, genes previously identified in genome-wide screens to modulate IRE1 or PERK functionality were excluded from further analysis (e.g. <italic>TMED10, SEL1L, FAB2, SYVN1, PDIA6</italic>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1H</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Adamson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Panganiban et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). Of the remaining genes, we focused on those encoding proteins localised in the ER lumen or Golgi, which could act as specific proximal regulators of ATF6α. Among these, CRT, an abundant luminal ER lectin chaperone, caught our attention (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1H</xref>). Notably, although CRT promotes the folding of ER synthesised glycoproteins <italic>via</italic> the CRT/CNX cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lamriben et al., 2016</xref>), its ER transmembrane homolog CNX was not identified in the screen.

<title>Constitutive activation of ATF6α in cells lacking calreticulin</title>
<p>To explore <italic>CRT</italic>’s role in ATF6α regulation, <italic>CRT</italic> was targeted by CRISPR/Cas9 in wild-type <italic>XC45-6S</italic> dual UPR reporter cells. <italic>CRT</italic>-targeted cells exhibited large populations of BiP::sfGFP<sup>high</sup>; XBP1s::mCherry<sup>low</sup> cells, mirroring the results of the initial screen. This phenotype was stable in single clones from the targeted pool (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). Targeting CRT repressed the IRE1 reporter basally and left little room for further induction of the ATF6α reporter upon ER stress (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). De-repression of the ATF6α reporter in <italic>CRT</italic>Δ clones correlated with a slight increase in BiP protein levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). Immunoblots of ER-resident proteins (reactive with antibody directed to their endogenous KDEL C-terminal tag) confirmed the increase in BiP protein levels in <italic>CRT</italic>Δ cells and revealed no marked changes in GRP94 protein levels, a slight increase in P3H1 levels, and a notably increase in a band likely corresponding to PDIA in a <italic>CRT</italic>Δ clone (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplemental S5</xref>). By contrast, depletion of CNX had no impact on the BiP::sfGFP reporter (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplemental S6A-S6C</xref>), consistent with the findings of the screen.</p>
<p>To test whether de-repression of the BiP::sfGFP reporter in <italic>CRT</italic>Δ cells was ATF6α dependent, endogenous <italic>ATF6</italic>α was also inactivated in <italic>CRT</italic>Δ cells.

<title>Calreticulin represses Golgi-trafficking and processing of ATF6α</title>
<p>Considering the crucial role of trafficking in ATF6α activation, we next investigated whether depletion of CRT affected the stress-induced localisation of ATF6α by comparing the subcellular localisation of ATF6α in parental and <italic>CRT</italic>Δ cells. As trafficking is closely linked to proteolytic processing, wild-type ATF6α does not accumulate in the Golgi of stressed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Shen et al., 2002</xref>). To stabilise ATF6α molecules reaching the Golgi, a CHO-K1 cell line stably expressing a GFP-tagged version of <italic>cg</italic>ATF6α_LD lacking S1P and S2P cleavage sites (GFP-ATF6α_LD<sup>S1P,S2Pmut</sup>) was engineered (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). In non-stressed cells, GFPATF6α_LD<sup>S1P,S2Pmut</sup> was distributed in a prominent reticular ER pattern with only a minor fraction co-localising with the Scarlet-tagged Giantin Golgi localisation marker. Exposure to the rapidly acting ER stress-inducing agent Dithiothreitol (DTT), increased the Golgi pool at the expense of the ER pool (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>); an expected outcome validating GFP-ATF6α_LD<sup>S1P,S2Pmut</sup> as a sentinel for the ATF6α protein. Compared to parental cells, GFP-ATF6α_LD<sup>S1P,S2Pmut</sup> showed significantly more Golgi co-localisation in <italic>CRT</italic>Δ cells under basal conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). These results were in line with our previous flow cytometry observations and suggested that CRT contributes to ER retention of ATF6α, either directly or indirectly.</p>

<p>GFP-ATF6α_LD<sup>S1P,S2Pmut</sup> reporter cannot be proteolytically processed. Consequently, to gauge the effect of CRT on ATF6α processing we sought to create a CHO-K1 stable cell line to track endogenous ATF6α. For that, the <italic>cgATF6</italic>α locus was tagged with a 3xFLAG and a monomeric GreenLantern (mGL) fluorescent protein, generating a cell line referred to as <italic>2K</italic>: 3xFLAG-mGL-ATF6α (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). The functionality of this probe was confirmed by treatment with DTT that resulted in the appearance of a prominent faster migration band in SDS-PAGE, compatible with the processed S2P-cleaved ATF6α (N-ATF6α) form, and depletion of the precursor form (ATF6α-P) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>.1, lane 8). Subsequently, <italic>2K</italic> cells were targeted to generate <italic>2K-CRT</italic>Δ derivatives cells, enabling a comparison of ATF6α processing. <italic>2K</italic>-<italic>CRT</italic>Δ clonal cells exhibited elevated levels of the processed N-ATF6α form under both basal and stress-induced conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>.1 and 3B.2) that correlated with a higher nuclear mGL-ATF6α signal observed by live cell microscopy (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). These findings indicated that CRT represses both ER-to-Golgi trafficking and processing of ATF6α into its active form.</p>
<p>It has been reported that ATF6α can exist in three redox forms: a monomer and two inter-chain disulfide-stabilised dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Nadanaka, et al., 2007</xref>). To investigate whether CRT depletion alters the redox status of ATF6α, cell lysates from <italic>2K</italic>-parental cells and a <italic>2K</italic>-<italic>CRT</italic>Δ clonal cells were analysed under both basal and ER-stress conditions using non-reducing SDS-PAGE (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplemental S7A</xref>). We detected two redox forms of ATF6α, consistent with an inter-chain disulfide-stabilised dimer and a monomer. Under basal conditions, ATF6α predominantly existed as a high mobility monomer in both <italic>2K</italic>-parental and <italic>2K</italic>-<italic>CRT</italic>Δ cells, with the appearance of an even faster-migrating processed N-ATF6α form in <italic>2K</italic>-<italic>CRT</italic>Δ cells, consistent with the findings presented in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>. ER stress (induced by 2-deoxy glucose, 2DG) was associated with appearance of a low mobility band consistent with a disulfide-stabilised dimer, and a concomitant decrease in the ATF6α monomer intensity in <italic>2K</italic>-parental cells, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Oka et al., 2022</xref>). Interestingly, under stress conditions, the monomer levels in <italic>2K</italic>-<italic>CRT</italic>Δ cells remained largely unchanged, indicating a higher monomer-to-dimer ratio compared to parental cells (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplemental S7B</xref>). These data suggest that the loss of CRT may stabilise the monomeric form of ATF6α, which is proposed to be more efficiently trafficked. This observation aligns with our results showing that CRT depletion is linked to activation of ATF6α.</p>

<p>Unlike the ATF6α_LD<sup>WT</sup>, neither the ATF6α_LD<sup>ΔGly</sup> nor the ATF6α_LD<sup>ΔC</sup> repair templates fully restored BiP::sfGFP responsiveness to stress (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref> top panel), consistent with the importance of N-glycosylation and disulphide bond formation to ATF6α functionality. Notably, whereas ATF6α_LD<sup>ΔC</sup> knock-in cells exhibited basal activation of the IRE1 reporter comparable to levels observed in the ATF6αΔ parent (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref> lower panel), the IRE1 reporter signal in the ATF6α_LD<sup>ΔGly</sup> knock-in cells shifted to that observed in wild-type cells, suggesting that ΔGly allele retained some functionality.

<p>CRT is a lectin chaperone that interacts with the protein disulphide isomerase ERp57 to stabilise CRT-substrate binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Oliver et al., 1999</xref>).

<title>Calreticulin depletion exposes a negative feedback loop by which ATF6α represses IRE1</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study reports on a comprehensive and unbiased genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-based knockout screen dedicated to discovering regulators of ATF6α. Whereas previous high-throughput studies have broadly studied modulators of the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Adamson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jonikas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Panganiban et al., 2019</xref>) we designed an ATF6α/IRE1 dual UPR reporter cell line to selectively detect regulators of ATF6α. Although a connection between CRT and ATF6α was proposed previously based on an interaction between overexpressed proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hong et al., 2004</xref>), our study utilises unbiased genetic tools and manipulation of endogenous proteins to establish CRT’s role as a selective repressor of endogenous ATF6α signalling, mapping its function in retaining ATF6α in the ER.</p>
<p>It is notable that, though the screen identified well-known regulators of ATF6α processing (including S1P, S2P and NF-Y, and thus validating the experimental approach), only a limited number of new genes that contribute to ATF6α signalling emerged from the screen. Despite the biochemical evidence for the role of COPII-coated vesicles and the oligomeric state of ATF6α in its activation, no cluster of genes involved in COPII vesicular transport or PDIs were found among the most enriched pathways. Nor were any counterparts to SCAP or INSIG, regulators of ER-to-Golgi trafficking of the related SREBP proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Yang et al., 2002</xref>), identified. This might reflect essentiality of the genes involved or redundancy amongst them. Cell type specificity may also be implicated in failure to identify components that are unimportant to ATF6α activation in CHO-K1 cells. For example, deletion of ERp18, a small PDI-like protein implicated in ATF6α activation in HEK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Oka et al., 2019</xref>), affected neither the ATF6α nor IRE1α UPR branches in CHO-K1 cells studied here (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplemental S6E</xref>).</p>
<p>The screen implicated two components of the nuclear pore complex (<italic>NUP50</italic> and <italic>SEH1L</italic>) in ATF6α pathway activity. While it might be tempting to consider a role for these components in the nuclear translocation of the processed soluble ATF6α N-terminal domain, there is no reason to think it would be regulatory, as it operates downstream of ER stress-regulated trafficking and processing events.</p>
<p>In addition to the identified S1P and S2P proteases, the <italic>screen for ATF6</italic>α <italic>activators</italic> identified FURIN, a Golgi-localised protease belonging to the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase family (like S1P protease) responsible for proteolytic activation of a wide array of precursor proteins within the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Braun and Sauter, 2019</xref>). FURIN deletion synergised with S1P inhibitors in attenuating ATF6α signalling. Additionally, ATF6α_LD has a conserved region (<underline>R</underline>T<underline>K</underline>S<underline>RR</underline>) related to the FURIN cleavage motif (generally described as RX-R-X-[K/R]-R↓ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Nakayama, 1997</xref>) (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig S4E</xref>). It has been suggested that S1P’s role in activation is to reduce the size of ATF6α’s_LD, thereby promoting S2P cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Shen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Ye et al., 2000</xref>). FURIN cleavage could contribute to such a process and account for partial redundancy between S1P inhibition and FURIN depletion observed here. Nonetheless, <italic>in vitro</italic> FURIN failed to cleave the ATF6α_LD. These findings collectively suggest that FURIN may function as an indirect enhancer of ATF6α signalling, perhaps by setting up conditions in a post-ER compartment that favours ATF6α cleavage and activation.</p>
<p>The <italic>screen for ATF6</italic>α <italic>repressors</italic> revealed a substantial enrichment of genes involved in glycoprotein metabolism. Among that cluster, the most notable hit, not previously identified in other high-throughput UPR screens, was CRT, a well-characterised soluble ER chaperone with a key role in protein quality control. Intriguingly, its ER-membrane counterpart, CNX, did not emerge in our screen, despite the inclusion of six sgRNA targeting CNX in the CRISPR library. This suggests a special role of CRT in the regulation of ATF6α, at least in CHO-K1 cells. CRT may not be the only repressor of ATF6α; this role may be shared by BiP, which has been widely suggested to suppress all the three branches of the UPR under basal conditions. Nevertheless, because of BiP’s pervasive effects on ER proteostasis and its role in direct repression of the IRE1 branch, its role in regulating ATF6 might have been missed by this screen.</p>
<p>Disruption of CRT in the <italic>XC45-6S</italic> dual ATF6α/IRE1 UPR reporter cell line selectively activated the ATF6α pathway reporter under basal conditions. This activation was accompanied by an increased baseline trafficking of ATF6α from the ER to the Golgi, enhanced processing of ATF6α to its active form and increased endogenous BiP protein levels. Loss of CRT also resulted in a conspicuous basal downregulation of the XBP1s::mCherry reporter that was associated with a reduced activity of IRE1 in <italic>CRT</italic>Δ cells. These findings align with previous evidence that N-ATF6α suppresses IRE1 signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Walter et al., 2018</xref>), and highlights the importance of ATF6α/IRE1 crosstalk.</p>
<p>CRT engages monoglycosylated glycoproteins in the ER <italic>via</italic> its glycan-binding lectin domain, retaining them in the CRT/CNX cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hebert et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ou et al., 1993</xref>). A role for CRT’s interaction with ATF6α_LD glycans in repressing ATF6α is suggested by the markedly diminished ability of a lectin mutant CRT<sup>Y92A</sup> to repress the ATF6α pathway compared to the wild-type. However, it is worth noting that CRT has been observed to bind proteins also in a glycan-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Wijeyesakere et al., 2013</xref>). Both BLI data and immunoprecipitation from cell extracts revealed that CRT can associate with both wild-type and unglycosylated ATF6α (ΔGly). In the former, direct interaction is characterised by slow kinetics, consistent with previous measurements of glycosylation-independent binding of CRT to its clients (Table 1 from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Wijeyesakere et al., 2013</xref>). These biophysical features, coupled with the residual ability of the lectin mutant CRT<sup>Y92A</sup> to repress endogenous ATF6α, lead us to suggest that CRT repression of ATF6α may involve both glycosylation-dependent and independent interactions.</p>
<p>Currently, the structural basis for ATF6α_LD interactions with CRT remains unknown, and its role in the direct or indirect retention of ATF6α in the ER is a subject for speculation. Nonetheless, the observations presented here support previous studies indicating that the stable interaction of CRT with cellular substrates combines both lectin-dependent and lectin independent interactions into a hybrid mode. Moreover, our observations raise the possibility that the lectin activity of CRT is dispensable for its interaction with ATF6α_LD but implicated in recruitment of a third component required for repression. Either way titration of CRT by competing ligands is a plausible regulatory mechanism coupling ATF6α activity to the burden of unfolded (glycol) proteins in the ER (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>).</p>

<title>Generation of the <italic>XC45-6S</italic> double UPR reporter cell by genome editing in <italic>ROSA26</italic> locus of CHO-K1 cells</title>
<p>The putative <italic>ROSA26</italic> locus in CHO cells has been recently identified and described as a “safeharbour” site for heterologous gene expression and stable long-term expression of a transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Gaidukov et al., 2018</xref>). To generate a double UPR reporter cell line, we used a previously-described <italic>XC45</italic> CHO-K1 cell line bearing a XBP1s::mCherry reporter expressing a pCAX-F-XBP1ΔDBD-mCherry transgene randomly integrated in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Harding et al., 2019</xref>), for targeting the <italic>ROSA26</italic> locus for knock-in with a landing pad cassette, comprised the <italic>cg</italic>BiP promoter region containing ERSE-I elements, fused to the superfolded (sf) GFP into the CHO genome by CRISPR/Cas9 integration to make this reporter cell line also sensitive to ATF6α activity. The landing pad donor vector was constructed by appending homology arm sequences of <italic>ROSA26</italic> locus (440 bp predefined sequence from Gaidukov’s paper) to the 5’ promoter region of <italic>cg</italic>BiP (1,000 bp), along with the first 8 amino acids of the BiP CDS fused to the sfGFP. Homology arms were PCR amplified from CHO genomic DNA using predefined primers from Gaidukov’s paper. Subsequently, the <italic>cg</italic>BiP promoter, a geneblock containing sfGFP, and the flanking homology arms were fused by Gibson assembly cloning method, which allows multiple DNA fragments joining in a single, isothermal reaction (1 h at 50°C). Targeted integration was performed by co-transfection with the circular landing pad donor vector (UK2846) and a single sgRNA/Cas9 targeting <italic>cgROSA26</italic> locus (UK2847). Transfected cells were selected with puromycin (8 μg/ml) for 3 days and then treated with 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (4 mM) for 20 h to induce ER stress prior FACS. Cells were phenotypically sorted into 96-well plates by their activation of both UPR reporters (mCherry<sup>high</sup>; GFP <sup>high</sup>). Phenotypically selected clones were subsequently confirmed by correct genetic integration. For stability integration, clones were maintained and expanded every 2-3 days for 1 month and weekly analysed with flow cytometry for mCherry and GFP expression under treatment with different ER stressors agents. For the wide-genome CRISPR/Cas9 screen, Cas9 was ultimately introduced by transduction with lentiviral particles prepared from packaging Lenti-Cas9 plasmid (UK1674). Cas9 activity was confirmed by targeting the exon 18 of IRE1 (<italic>ERN1</italic> locus) (UK2929) followed by induction of ER stress with 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (4 mM) for 20 h (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental S1F</xref>).</p>

<title>CRISPR/Cas9 screen</title>
<p>The screen was performed following established protocols using a pooled CHO-K1 knockout CRISPR library containing 125,030 sgRNAs targeting 21,896 genes, with six guides per gene, as well as 1,000 non-targeting sgRNAs as a negative control cloned into the lentiviral sgRNA expression vector pKLV-U6gRNA(BbsI)-PGKpuro2ABFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Shalem et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ordóñez et al., 2021</xref>). Approximately 2.1 × 10<sup>8</sup> CHO-K1 Cas9 stable cells carrying the dual UPR reporter ATF6α/IRE1 (<italic>XC45-6S</italic> cells) were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.3 to favour infection with a single viral particle per cell. Two days after infection, transduced cells were selected with 8 µg/ml puromycin for 14 days. Afterwards, transduced cells were split into two subpopulations: one was treated with 2-Deoxy-D-glucose to induce ER stress, while the other one remained untreated. For the <italic>ATF6</italic>α <italic>activator screen,</italic> conducted under ER stress conditions, less than 2% of cells that showed a XBP1s::mCherry<sup>high</sup>; BiP::sfGFP<sup>low</sup> phenotype were selected for analysis. Similarly, for the <italic>ATF6</italic>α <italic>repressor screen,</italic> conducted under basal (untreated) conditions, less than 2% of total sorted cells that showed a XBP1s::mCherry<sup>low</sup>; BiP::sfGFP<sup>high</sup> phenotype were selected for analysis. Rounds of enrichment were carried out through cellular recovery, expansion, and sorting. Equal number of transduced cells, both untreated or 2-Deoxy-D-glucose treated, were passed without sorting as a control group in each round of sorting. To prepare samples for deep sequencing, genomic DNA from enriched and sorted populations as well as unsorted cells (to represent the entire library) was extracted from ∼3.6× 10<sup>7</sup> and ∼1-3× 10<sup>6</sup> cells, respectively, by incubation in proteinase K solution [100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 5 mM EDTA, 200 mM NaCl, 0.25% (w/v) SDS, 0.2 mg/ml Proteinase K] overnight at 50°C. Integrated sgRNA sequences were amplified by nested PCR and the necessary adaptors for Illumina sequencing were introduced at the final round of amplification. The purified products were quantified and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 by 50-bp single-end sequencing. Downstream analyses to obtain sgRNA read counts, gene rankings, and statistics were performed with MAGeCK software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Gene ontology analyses were performed using Metascape with default parameters.</p>

<p>Protein alignment of <italic>hs</italic>ATF6α and <italic>cg</italic>ATF6α (UniProt database) indicated that translation initiation predominantly occurs at the second Met at the beginning of exon 2 (<underline>M</underline>ESP). Instead of tagging at the first Met in the CHO genome, tags were introduced before the third Met. CHO-K1 plain cells were offered with a unique pSpCas9(BB)-2A-mCherry targeting exon 2 of <italic>cg</italic>ATF6α locus (UK2942) and a donor plasmid containing homology arms flanking a minigene encoding a 3xFLAGmGreenLantern(mGL)-TEV sequence geneblock (UK2955) to create an endogenous tagged ATF6α.

Clones that preserved stable mGL fluorescent signal by flow cytometry and showed expected ATF6α processing upon ER stress induction (DTT) were subsequently confirmed by correct genetic integration. Microscopy characterisation was performed under basal conditions or after treatments with ER stressors (DTT), Ceapin A7 and S1P inhibitor.

<p>ATF6 has a half-life of about 3 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">George et al., 2020</xref>). To increase the proportion of intact, active N-ATF6α molecules reaching the Golgi, a genetic construct featured the TM and LD of ATF6α, deliberately lacking S1P and S2P cleavage sites, and further strategically appended with an Avi-tag at the C-terminal, was engineered. This construct was then used for a dual purpose: as a tool for both microscopy studies as well as to be biotinylated and purified to be used as a ligand in BLI experiments. Shen and Ye’s research provided the basis for the design of S2P and S1P mutations (N391F &amp; P394L for S2P mutant, and LL408/9VV for S1P mutant) (Shen and Prywes, 2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Ye et al., 2000</xref>).

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Tung and colleagues identify Calreticulin as a repressor of ATF6 signaling using a crispr screen and characterize the functional interaction between ATF6 and CALR.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is well written and interesting with an innovative experimental design which provides some new mechanistic insight into ATF6 regulation as well as crosstalk with the IRE1 pathway. The methods used were fit for purpose and reasonable conclusions were drawn from the data presented.</p>
<p>Comments on latest version:</p>
<p>The authors did a good job at addressing my comments even though they found several aspects to exceed the scope of the work. The manuscript is clearer now and the model pushed by the authors is better supported by the data. One point I am curious about the authors' opinion would be about the status of ATF6alpha activation in pathological cells in which CALR is mutated (e.g., myeloproliferative neoplasms), although this neither challenges the conclusions of the manuscript and my positive opinion of the work.</p>

<p>The authors explore ER stress signalling mediated by ATF6 using a genome-wide gene depletion screen. They find that the ER chaperone Calreticulin binds and directly represses ATF6; this proposed function for Calreticulin is intriguing and constitutes an important finding.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Tung and colleagues identify Calreticulin as a repressor of ATF6 signalling using a CRISPR screen and characterize the functional interaction between ATF6 and CALR.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is well written and interesting with an innovative experimental design that provides some new mechanistic insight into ATF6 regulation as well as crosstalk with the IRE1 pathway. The methods used were fit for purpose and reasonable conclusions were drawn from the data presented. Findings are novel and bring together glycoprotein quality control and activation of one sensor of the UPR. This is a novel perspective on how the integration of ER homeostasis signals could be sensed in the ER.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Several points remain to be documented to support the authors' model.</p>
<p>Major comments</p>
<p>(1) It is interesting that BiP, PDIs, and COPII are not identified in the screen. Might this indicate some bias in the system perhaps limiting its sensitivity or pleiotropic effects of the reporter?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer raises a valid concern. Our CRISPR screen aimed to identify genes that selectively modulate ATF6⍺. Therefore, we excluded from consideration genes whose inactivation had effects on the broader ER environment. This would disfavour the selection of genes encoding BiP, PDI and COPII components. Additionally, a positive selection screen inherently removes essential genes like BiP. The absence of COPII components among the hits could be due to essentiality or that those components are not strong selective modulators for ATF6⍺ activation, as the stronger ATF6⍺ modulators as S1P, S2P and transcription factor S2P and NFY were among our top hits. Cell type specificity may also play a role. For example, ERp18, a small PDI previously implicated in ATF6⍺ activation (Oka et al 2019; PMID: 31368601), despite the presence of sgRNAs targeting hamster ERp18 in the library. Interestingly, depletion of ERp18 in our dual UPR reporter CHO-K1 cell line did not affect the ATF6⍺ and IRE1⍺ UPR branches in CHO-K1 cells. This new information has been incorporated into the revised manuscript as Supplemental Figure S6E and the discussion has been edited in line with these comments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) CLR interacts with ATF6 independently of ATF6 glycans (and cysteines). How do the authors reconcile this observation with the lectin functions of CALR? What is the interaction mode then - if the CALR N (lectin) domain is not involved, is it the P domain that is responsible for the interaction? All the binding experiments are performed in the presence of 1 mM CaCl2, is calcium necessary for CALR to achieve binding?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These points merit clarification. The Biolayer Interferometry (BLI) assay reported on an interaction between ATF6 and CRT that is independently of ATF6⍺ glycans. However, cellbased experiments revealed a contribution of glycan-dependent interactions to the binding and repression. Therefore, we conclude that the interaction of CRT with ATF6⍺ likely involves both lectin-dependent and lectin-independent interactions (dependent on the P-domain). Indeed, this hybrid model has previously been suggested as the mode of stable interaction of CRT with other substrates, as cited in the discussion section (Wijeyesakere et al., 2013; PMID: 24100026). CRT is a known calcium-dependent protein, and all the in vitro experiments were conducted in the presence of 1 mM CaCl2. We do not have data from experiments without CaCl2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Does the introduction of the reporter system affect the normal BiP (or ATF6) protein levels in the cells?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To address this question, we have conducted new experiments comparing endogenous BiP protein levels between the reporter-containing cells and the parental CHO-K1 cells using immunoblotting and an anti-BiP antibody. These data indicate that the reporter system does not affect to the endogenous BiP protein levels. This new information has been incorporated as revised Supplemental Figure S1C.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Does the depletion of CRT affect BiP interaction with ATF6? The absence of CRT may lead to misfolding of glycoproteins and titration of BiP away from ATF6 leading to activation. An indicator of ER stress levels that is independent of ATF6 and IRE1 might be useful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To further assess ER stress levels in CRT-depleted cells, we compared expression levels of endogenous ER resident proteins containing a KDEL signal (e.g., P3H1, GRP94, BiP and PDI) in parental CHO-K1 cells, dual UPR reporter cell lines (XC45-6S) and CRT-depleted cells (CRT∆#2P) under basal conditions and during ER stress by immunoblotting. This comparison confirmed the basal elevation in BiP protein level in cells lacking CRT, consistent with previous findings (Figure 2D) and more broadly the integrity of UPR signalling in cells lacking CRT. In the interest of time, we did not extend the analysis to other branches of the UPR. This new information has been incorporated as Supplemental Figure S5 and in the text of the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Does CALR depletion alter ATF6 redox status.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this interesting point. In response, we compared ATF6⍺ redox status in parental and CRT-depleted cells using non-reducing SDS-PAGE. Overall, the redox pattern was similar in parental and CRT-depleted cells with the detection of two redox forms: an inter-chain disulfide-stabilised dimer and the monomer. Under basal conditions, ATF6⍺ predominantly existed as a monomer, while under ER stress, the monomer band decreased with a corresponding increase in a disulfide-stabilised dimer form in parental cells, as previously reported (Oka et al, 2022; PMID: 35286189). However, under ER stress, CRTdepleted cells showed a significantly higher fraction of monomer versus dimer compared to parental cells. Taking all together, these data suggest that the loss of CRT may favour the monomeric form of ATF6α, which is proposed to be more efficiently trafficked (Nadanaka, et al 2007; PMID: 17101776), aligning with our observations that CRT depletion is associated to constitutive activation of ATF6α. These new data have been included as Supplemental Figure S7 and are detailed explained in the results section of the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Figure 4C would benefit from some immunoblotting against BiP.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although we acknowledge the validity of this suggestion and understand the referee's interest in comparing the amount of CRT in pulldown with that of BiP, the necessity of generating additional samples makes this experiment impractical. Consequently, we opted not to include in our conclusion any comparison regarding the retention of ATF6α by BiP relative to CRT.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Overlooked requirement of cysteines for ATF6 functionality (Figure 5B).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We interpret this comment to refer to the inactivity of the cysteine-free allele of ATF6⍺. Whilst this is a reproducible observation of significance to the structure-activity features of ATF6⍺’s luminal domain, it is less informative in terms of understanding trans-active regulators of ATF6⍺ and was therefore not explored further.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Without a clear definition of the role of CRT in ATF6 folding, one cannot infer that the observed phenotype is not based on defects in ATF6 &quot;folding&quot; and glycosylation considering the possibility of activation of newly synthesised un-glycosylated ATF6.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>If the main role of CRT were to assist ATF6⍺ folding, one would expect that depletion of CRT would lead to a non-functional ATF6⍺, resulting in ER retention and less activity. However, our data indicate that the loss of CRT correlates with the constitutive activation of the ATF6⍺ fluorescent reporter and increased Golgi trafficking and processing of ATF6⍺. Therefore, these data suggest that in CRT-depleted cells, the majority of ATF6⍺ is likely to fold to a functional state.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) ATF6 was defined in several studies as a natively unstable protein and shows a close relationship with the ERAD machinery, is the role of CALR also involved in a quality control mechanism for natively unfolded ATF6?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer brings up a valid point too. Although we have not closely evaluated the role of CRT in the quality control machinery, we observed that the loss of CRT was not associated with an increased levels of ATF6⍺ in CRT depleted cells in basal conditions compared with parental cells (Fig 3B.1, compare line 1 and line 7; Figure 3B.2, compare line 1 and line 5). These observations suggest that if ATF6⍺ were degraded by ERAD and loss of CRT compromised ERAD functionality, CRT-depleted cells should exhibit increased levels of endogenous ATF6⍺. The fact that endogenous ATF6⍺ levels are slightly reduced in CRT depleted cells does not support a role for CRT in the quality control mechanism for natively unfolded ATF6⍺.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) C618 in ATF6 is located within the BiP binding site and in close proximity of an Nglycosylation site. Is this region of particular importance for CALR binding?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is an interesting point that we have not explored in this study. Consequently, without experimental data, we cannot infer the possible implications of C618 in CRT binding.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) The authors have mutated all the N glycosylation sites at once; they should be mutated one by one and the impact on ATF6 stability evaluated independently of the CALR status.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that analysing each N-glycosylation site individually would provide further insight into their contributions to ATF6⍺ stability/functionality. However, given the scope of the paper in its present form we have elected not to addressing this point.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(12) The relationship between the absence of CALR and IRE1 remains weak. The authors do not exclude the possibility that CALR could have a direct effect on IRE1 itself. This should be either removed or further investigated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We beg to differ. The relationship between the absence of CRT and IRE1 is not weak; loss of CRT in CHO-K1 cells represses IRE1; we conceded readily that the relationship is incompletely understood. ATF6⍺ signalling involves crosstalk with the IRE1 pathway, partly mediated by direct heterodimerisation of N-ATF6⍺ with XBP1s (Yamamoto et al., 2007, 2004). Additionally, recent research has shown that ATF6⍺ activity can repress IRE1 signalling (Walter et al., 2018). Therefore, given that our results indicate that the loss of CRT leads to constitutive activation of ATF6⍺, we suggest that a negative feedback loop in which ATF6⍺ represses IRE1 contributes to the observations made here on the relationship between CRT and IRE1. This does not exclude other aspects to the relationship, a point that is now clarified further in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor point</p>
<p>In the introduction on page 3 it is mentioned that loss of ATF6 impairs survival in cellular and animal models, this is not completely true as ATF6a ko in mice has no clear deleterious phenotype and only the double ko ATF6a/b has some dramatic impact.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have modified that sentence on the revised manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors set out to use an unbiased CRISPR/Cas9 screen in CHO cells to identify genes encoding proteins that either increase or repress ATF6 signalling in CHO cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strengths of the paper include the thoroughness of the screens, the use of a novel, double ATF6/IRE1 UPR reporter cell line, and follow-up detailed experiments on two of the findings in the screens, i.e. FURIN and CRT, to test the validity of involvement of each as direct regulators of ATF6 signalling. Additional strengths are the control experiments that validate the ATF6 specificity of the screens, as well as, for CRT, the finding of focus, determining roles for the glycosylation and cysteines in ATF6 as mechanistically involved in how CRT represses ATF6, at least in CHO cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their favourable assessment of our work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The weaknesses of the paper are that the authors did not describe why they focused only on the top 100 proteins in each list of ATF6 activators and repressors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We concede that the more genes one studies the better. However, In whole genome CRISPR screens where thousands of hits arise, it is a common practise that researchers prioritise candidates with the greatest significant as those genes are likely to have a more meaningful impact on the phenotype under investigation. Therefore, our decision to focus on the top 100 genes was based on a desire to identify the most prominent and potentially impactful candidates for further analysis, ensuring a manageable scope for in-depth study while maintaining a measure of relevance and significance. Moreover, setting the threshold at 100 hits to perform GEO enrichment analysis is a practise used by previous researchers (PMID: 30323222; PMID: 37251921). In our case, the top 100 hits included the genes with an adjusted P &lt; 0.005. For interested readers, the full ranked list is accessible in the GEO databank (GSE254745) and as supplemental Table S1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Additionally, there were a few methodology items missing, such as the nature of where the insertion site in the CHO cell genome of the XBP1::mCherry reporter. Since the authors go to great lengths to insert the other reporter for ATF6 activation in a &quot;safe harbor&quot; location, it leads to questions about whether the XBP1::mCherry reporter insertion is truly innocuous.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the opportunity to clarify certain aspects of our experimental procedures. In order to generate a double UPR reporter cell line, we employed a previously established the XC45 CHO-K1 clone with an integrated XBP1s::mCherry reporter (Harding et al., 2019; PMID: 31749445). Since the ROSA26 safe harbor locus was available in the XC45 CHO-K1 cell line, we directed integrated the ATF6⍺ reporter there. To provide further clarity, the revised manuscript includes additional details in the Methods section regarding the creation of the XBP1 reporter.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) An additional weakness is that the evidence for the physical interaction between ATF6LD and CRT is not strong, being dependent mainly on a single IP/IB experiment in Figure 4C that comprises only 1 lane on the gel for each of the test cases. Moreover, while that figure suggests that the interaction between CRT and ATF6 is decreased by mutating out the glycosylation sites in the ATF6LD, the BLI experiment in the same figure, 4B, suggests that there are no differences in the affinities of CRT for ATF6LD WT, deltaGly and deltaCys.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to highlight that in the IP/IB experiments (see Figure 4C), where wildtype ATF6 (ATF6⍺_LDWT) and GFP-ATF6_LD∆Gly were transiently transfected, GFP-ATF6_LD∆Gly was expressed at lower levels than ATF6⍺_LDWT. This lower expression levels might explain why CRT is more prominently immunoprecipitated with ATF6⍺_LDWT and could account for the differences observed among in vitro and in vivo assays.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) An additional detail is that I found Figure 6A to be difficult to interpret, and that 6B was required in order for me to best evaluate the points being made by the authors in this figure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have simplified Figure 6A in the revised manuscript to make it more interpretable by focussing the reader’s attention on the transfected population.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Overall, I believe that this work will positively impact the field as it provides a list of potential regulators of ATF6 activation and repression that others will be able to use as a launch point for discovering such interactions in cells and tissues or interest beyond CHO cells. However, I agree with the authors that these findings were in CHO cell lines and that it is possible, if not likely, that some of the interactions they found will be cell type/line specific.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We accept this point and re-emphasize the qualification that our conclusions cannot be glibly extrapolated to other cell lines.</p>
