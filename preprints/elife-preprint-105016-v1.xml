<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Mutations fuel evolution while also causing diseases like cancer. Epigenome-targeted DNA repair can help organisms protect important genomic regions from mutation. However, the adaptive value, mechanistic diversity, and evolution of epigenome-targeted DNA repair systems across the tree of life remain unresolved. Here, we investigated the evolution of histone reader domains fused to the DNA repair protein MSH6 (MutS Homolog 6) across over 4,000 eukaryotes. We uncovered a paradigmatic example of convergent evolution: MSH6 has independently acquired distinct histone reader domains; PWWP (metazoa) and Tudor (plants), previously shown to target histone modifications in active genes in humans (H3K36me3) and Arabidopsis (H3K4me1). Conservation in MSH6 histone reader domains shows signatures of natural selection, particularly for amino acids that bind specific histone modifications. Species that have gained or retained MSH6 histone readers tend to have larger genome sizes, especially marked by significantly more introns in genic regions. These patterns support previous theoretical predictions about the co-evolution of genome architectures and mutation rate heterogeneity. The evolution of epigenome-targeted DNA repair has implications for genome evolution, health, and the mutational origins of genetic diversity across the tree of life.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>DNA damage, the precursor to mutations, occurs between 1,000 to 100,000 times daily in each cell <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. This poses a continual risk of generating mutations that could negatively impact health and fitness. To address this challenge, organisms rely on proteins that detect and repair DNA damage. Whether organisms can preferentially repair and reduce mutation rates in functionally important genomic regions such as coding regions is both a mechanistic and theoretical question critical to understanding mutation rate evolution <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Research in humans, largely from the field of cancer biology, has revealed specific mechanisms that recruit DNA repair proteins to epigenomic marks found in the coding regions of active genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. These consist of DNA repair proteins fused to histone reader domains, which bind to specific histone posttranslational modification (PTMs). For example, the N-terminus of human DNA mismatch repair protein MSH6 (homolog of bacterial and archaeal MutS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>) is fused to a PWWP histone reader domain that binds to H3K36me3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a-c</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. H3K36me3, in humans, is highly enriched in the exons of active genes, while MSH6 plays a key role in several DNA repair pathways. Consequently, targeting MSH6 via its PWWP domain to H3K36me3 reduces mutation rates in coding regions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. This is especially true and well-studied in somatic tissues where mutations in coding sequences are the primary source of cancer driver mutations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>.</p>

</fig>
<p>In plants, H3K4me1 is the most enriched histone PTM, marking coding regions of actively expressed and essential genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Studies on <italic>de novo</italic> mutation in the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (Arabidopsis hereafter) and rice have found that H3K4me1 exhibits the strongest association with regions of low mutation rates, akin to H3K36me3-associated hypomutation observed in humans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Indeed, mutation rates in Arabidopsis are lower in gene bodies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. Importantly, the N-terminus of MSH6 in Arabidopsis was found to be fused to a Tudor domain that binds H3K4me1, which is distinct from the H3K36me3-binding PWWP domain fused to the human MSH6 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a-d</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Experiments have confirmed that genic H3K4me1-associated hypomutation is significantly diminished in the absence of MSH6 in Arabidopsis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. This observation aligns with mutation accumulation studies in MSH2 deficient plants (the protein that dimerizes with MSH6 to form the mismatch repair protein complex MutSα <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>), which, like Arabidopsis lacking MSH6, exhibit elevated mutation rates in H3K4me1-rich gene bodies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Thus, humans and Arabidopsis have distinct histone readers fused to MSH6, PWWP, and Tudor, respectively, which each bind histone PTMs in genic regions and contribute to lower mutation rates. However, the evolution of these systems across the tree of life remains unknown.</p>
<p>The Tudor and PWWP domains of Arabidopsis and Human MSH6, respectively, are each members of the ‘Royal Family’ of histone readers, which also includes Agenet, Chromo, and MBT domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. These histone readers are found across eukaryotes in numerous proteins (often those involved in chromatin regulatory feedbacks, for example, when fused to histone methyltransferases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>). PWWP, Tudor, and other Royal Family histone reader domains are believed to have arisen and diversified from a common eukaryotic ancestor before the emergence of major eukaryotic clades <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. The differences in binding sites, structure, and amino acid sequence between the MSH6 Tudor and PWWP domains suggest they do not share a common origin in an ancestral MSH6 protein with histone reader functionality (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c,d</xref>). Furthermore, the presence of Tudor and PWWP domains in multiple other proteins across Arabidopsis and humans indicates that these domains likely evolved separately before they were incorporated into MSH6 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. Thus, the N-terminus fusions of Tudor and PWWP domains to MSH6 may reflect independent evolutionary events, a hypothesis that has yet to be tested with broad phylogenetic analyses.</p>
<p>Here, we investigated histone reader fusions to MSH6 across the eukaryotic tree of life to elucidate their origins, diversity, and potential adaptive value. Specifically, we test for evidence of evolutionary convergence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>, selection of functional amino acids in the MSH6 histone readers, and co-evolution of MSH6 histone readers with other traits.</p>

<title>Results &amp; discussion</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>MSH6 independently evolved distinct histone readers in eukaryotes</title>
<p>Our first aim was to determine the evolutionary history and diversity of histone reader fusions to MSH6. We identified putative MSH6 orthologs in 4075 eukaryotic organisms, in which the presence and absence of histone reader could be confidently called, emphasizing the detection and removal of false negatives (Materials and Methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). We observed no cases where MSH6 orthologs showed evidence of containing both PWWP and Tudor domains. The vast majority (99% and 97% of PWWP and Tudor, respectively) of species in which MSH6 histone reader domains were identified showed evidence of histone readers from both <italic>blastp</italic> and <italic>ab initio</italic> domain prediction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Table 2, Supplemental Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>These data provided the basis to examine the distribution of MSH6 histone reader domains across the eukaryotic tree of life and characterize their evolutionary origins and history (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>, <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>). We found that fungi, along with most taxa diverging from the last eukaryotic common ancestor, lack PWWP or Tudor domains in their MSH, as also seen in the MutS homologs of bacteria and archaea (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref>). This finding is consistent with a reader-less MSH6 being the ancestral state in eukaryotes, supporting independent evolutionary histories of PWWP and Tudor domain fusions to MSH6.</p>

<title>Metazoa evolved MSH6-PWWP</title>
<p>MSH6-PWWP domain fusions were only found in Eumetazoa, with the distribution of presence/absence suggesting either multiple gains or loss events. While the presence of the PWWP domain is highly conserved in Deuterostomes (98%), major Protostome clades, such as Endopterygota (flies, beetles, wasps, ants) and Nematodes, lack a histone reader (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>, <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>). Our filtering criteria excluded species with evidence of potential false negatives (MSH6 incorrectly identified as lacking a reader) due to possible genome annotation errors (Materials and Methods). Still, individual species that lack evidence of a histone reader in MSH6 are interpreted cautiously until they can be independently verified to be free of assembly or annotation artifacts. Nonetheless, clear phylogenetic patterns exemplified by whole clades lacking any MSH6 reader are likely reliable, along with confirmed reader-less MSH6 orthologs observed in model organisms such as <italic>Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a-b</xref>, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>). These findings are also comparable to broader evolutionary trends in Protosomes, where losses of a number of DNA repair proteins have been observed in various taxa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Determining the ancestral state of MSH6 reader presence in Eumetazoa and whether the variability observed across taxa represents multiple gains versus multiple losses is challenging due to the uncertainty about the relative rate at which these transitions might occur. Losses may be more mutationally likely (i.e., deletion events) than gains (e.g., translocations from another PWWP-containing protein). Ancestral state reconstruction assuming equal rates (ER) suggests multiple gain events, whereas all-rates-different (ARD) models indicate multiple losses (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>, <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>). The discovery of variation in MSH6 histone reader domains enforces the importance of exercising caution in generalizing experimental findings on mutation rate heterogeneity and DNA repair mechanisms across taxa <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. This diversity also has implications for understanding variation in mutation rates and spectra across the Tree of Life <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Once lost, an MSH6 reader may be improbable to be re-gained.</p>

<title>Plants and their relatives evolved MSH6-Tudor</title>
<p>MSH6 fusions to Tudor domains are unique to land plants and other photosynthetic organisms, including green algae, brown algae, and cryptomonad algae. In land plants (Streptophyta), MSH6-Tudor fusions are highly conserved (96%) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>, <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>). Some green algae (Chlorophyta), along with some diatoms, brown algae (Stramenopiles), and other SAR (Stramenopiles + Alveolata + Rhizaria) lineages lack the Tudor domain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). It is interesting to note that the species lacking MSH6-Tudor includes <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, a model for algal genomics, which also lacks the H3K4me1 enrichment of gene bodies that is otherwise conserved in higher land plants <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. We also do not observe MSH6-Tudor in any red algae (Rhodophyta). Like in animals, the ancestral state of the MSH6 domain presence is somewhat uncertain, especially given that several groups containing Tudor domains, including Stramenopiles, have potentially gained genes from green algae via ancient endosymbioses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. However, the phylogenetic relationship of MSH6 orthologs does not support horizontal gene transfer from green algae: a maximum likelihood tree of MutS domains I-V shows the MSH6 ortholog of Stramenopiles sister to other SAR taxa that lack a Tudor domain (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4</xref>).</p>
<p>Plants (Viridiplantae) contain a unique MutS ortholog, MSH7, which arose via an ancient duplication of MSH6 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>. We identified putative MSH7 orthologs in plants and queried whether Tudor domains were observed (Materials and Methods). We found no plant MSH7 orthologs containing Tudor domains, suggesting that the Tudor was acquired by MSH6 after the duplication that gave rise to MSH7 (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6</xref>). or that MSH7 lost the Tudor domain during or after duplication in the common ancestor of plants. Thus, the MSH6-Tudor fusion is probably ancient and predates the separation of the major clades of Viridiplantae, possibly in the common ancestor of Viridiplantae, crytomonads, and SAR.</p>

<title>Testing for additional fusions of MutS homologs to histone readers</title>
<p>We used <italic>ab initio</italic> domain prediction to investigate whether additional, previously undescribed, histone reader fusions have occurred with MSH6. This analysis yielded no known candidate histone reader domains beyond Tudor and PWWP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Table 3</xref>). We further expanded our search to other potential MutS homologs, and while we did identify a number of intriguing fusions to non-MutS domains, we found none with obvious histone readers.</p>
<p>For example, we identified a fusion between MSH3 and N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase component (Gpi1) (e.g., UniProt: G3Y5U7) shared across <italic>Aspergillus</italic> fungi, with unknown functional importance. We also found a fusion of MSH6 with ESCO acetyltransferase and Zinc-Finger binding domains in the Ustilaginomycetes (smut fungi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure S5</xref>). These domains are not known to be histone readers <italic>per se</italic>; however, ESCO proteins have been previously described to bind chromatin by DNA-binding of a charged N-terminus intrinsically disordered region <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>. While not histone readers, these findings are a reminder of the potential for undiscovered fusions between chromatin interacting domains and other proteins involved in DNA repair, a potentially valuable direction for future research.</p>
<p>In summary, we find compelling evidence of convergent evolution in the origins of distinct histone-binding domains, specifically to MSH6 in eukaryotes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. These fusions of histone readers to MSH6 provide a unique opportunity to study the evolutionary dynamics of epigenome-recruited DNA repair systems at a Tree of Life scale.</p>

<title>Constraint on linker region</title>
<p>In both human and Arabidopsis, the MutS repair domains are separated from the histone reader by a (MobiDB-lite annotated) intrinsically disordered “linker” region (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a-b</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). To better understand this region, we examined its sequence composition and length across all species containing the respective domains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). Regardless of histone reader (PWWP or Tudor), we found that MSH6 linker regions were significantly (p&lt;2×10<sup>-16</sup>) enriched for the charged amino acids lysine (K), aspartate (D), and glutamate (E), consistent with a role in promoting disordered protein regions and potentially other molecular interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>. As expected, these linker regions were &gt;36 times more likely to be predicted as intrinsically disordered than histone reader or MutS-containing protein regions <italic>in silico</italic><sup><italic>79</italic></sup> (Z=782.5, p&lt;2×10<sup>-16</sup>).</p>

<p>We also observed a notable degree of conservation in linker sequence lengths (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). It is difficult to establish a strong null model with which to compare disordered region length variation against neutrality. However, we did note that Tudor domains are significantly closer (shorter linker region) to MutS domain I than PWWP (Tudor mean = 201 a.a., PWWP mean = 217 a.a, t = 13.527, p-value &lt; 2.2×10<sup>-16</sup>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). This is interesting given that the Arabidopsis MSH6 Tudor and human PWWP domains bind to methylated lysines on the 4th (most distal to histone/DNA) and 36th (more proximate) lysines, respectively. The length of the disordered and potentially flexible linker region may be constrained to tether MSH6 at an optimal distance to chromatin, a hypothesis necessitating further experimental testing.</p>

<sec id="s2e2">
<title>Constraint on histone interacting domain amino acids</title>
<p>We then investigated patterns of evolutionary constraint on the reader domains themselves. If the histone PTM binding affinities are subject to selection, we would expect to observe the conservation of amino acids involved in interactions with the H3 peptides, as seen in the evolution of sites involved in protein-protein interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. We compared MSH6 Tudor and PWWP domains across all species. For each amino acid position within the domains, we identified the consensus amino acid (the most common residue) and calculated both the conservation (the frequency of the consensus amino acid) and Shannon entropy (a measure of amino acid diversity at each position).</p>
<p>For both Tudor and PWWP domains, amino acids involved in H3 PTM binding were among the most conserved residues, consistent with purifying selection on histone reader binding affinities (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b-c</xref>). We estimated the distance between amino acids and the H3 peptide by superimposing predicted structures to experimentally determined PWWP and Tudor structures that captured H3 PTM binding, H3K36me3 and H3K4me1, respectively (Materials and Methods). We found that amino acids predicted to be in close proximity to the H3 peptides are significantly more conserved, both in PWWP and Tudor reader domains (PWWP: R=0.55, p=2×10<sup>-9</sup>; Tudor: R=0.56, p=4×10<sup>-6</sup>). (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b-c</xref>). Thus, evidence of purifying selection was enriched at the histone-binding interface. Several distal amino acids were also highly conserved. This conservation may reflect roles in proper folding or other interactions, such as between PWWP and DNA directly <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In summary, evolutionary conservation observed in MSH6 domain architectures, as well as Tudor and PWWP domains themselves, exhibit signatures of selection, especially for histone binding.</p>

<title>Species with MSH6 histone readers show distinct genomic traits</title>
<p>The preceding analyses revealed convergent evolution and conservation of MSH6 histone readers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).

<title>Contrasting genomic traits</title>
<p>Theory and experimental work have observed that hypermutators and changes in mutation biases can be favored by selection under certain conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup>. Whether this can help explain variability in MSH6 reader presence in eukaryotes is a compelling, albeit challenging, question to answer. Previous theory based on the drift-barrier hypothesis predicts that the adaptive value of promoting DNA repair in coding regions may be contingent on genome architectures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. To test this, we compared a suite of genomic traits between species (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, <xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table S4</xref>). We found that species with MSH6 fused to histone readers have (more than an order of magnitude) larger genomes. Previous investigations have described substantial evolutionary variation in intron/exon architectures across eukaryotes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>.

This was also the case when only Protosome animals were examined, where the loss of MSH6-PWWP may have occurred (<xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7b</xref>). These observations are consistent with the hypothesis proposed by Lynch et al.

<p>For species where data were available<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup>, we also compared several metrics relevant to life history and population genetics. Species without MSH6 histone reader domains have smaller body sizes, greater estimated population sizes, and experience significantly lower germline SNP mutation rates (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4d</xref>). While interesting, these associations were not significant after accounting for phylogeny. Measurements of these characteristics across more species with a broader taxonomic range may be needed for more robust tests for co-evolution with reader domains in phylogenetic contexts.</p>
<p>In summary, we observed significant co-evolution with genome features like genome size and intron number per gene and found differences in population and organismal characteristics in species with and without reader fusions to MSH6. Whether these reflect a cause or consequence of epigenome-recruited repair or instead reflect correlated responses to shared evolutionary forces remains an open question. Still, these results highlight interesting connections between DNA repair systems and the evolution of genome architectures. These patterns are consistent with the selective benefits and costs of such systems being contingent on factors like non-coding genome size, as previously hypothesized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. More sampling of traits and mutation rates, coupled with theoretical analyses, are needed to integrate these findings through the models of the drift-barrier hypothesis to better determine what evolutionary processes underlie these associations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>These findings inspire a number of outstanding questions: How conserved are epigenomes across the tree of life? Are there yet-to-be-discovered mechanisms of epigenome-recruited DNA repair systems? Are there biological or evolutionary costs associated with epigenome-recruited mismatch repair? What is the relative importance of these mechanisms for somatic versus germline mutation in different organisms? Do the distributions of fitness effects between coding and non-coding sequences differ among organisms? Finally, what is the extent of mutation rate heterogeneity across different organisms’s genomes? These and other questions, in light of the findings presented here, provide a roadmap for future empirical and theoretical work.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The recruitment of DNA mismatch repair by H3K36me3 (MSH6-PWWP) in humans and by H3K4me1 in Arabidopsis (MSH6-Tudor), now investigated at a tree of life scale, reveals a compelling example of evolutionary convergence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. Previous experiments support the role of these mechanisms in recruiting mismatch repair to functionally important genomic regions, at least in Humans and Arabidopsis, with consequences on mutation rates <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. The phylogenetic distribution of PWWP and Tudor fusions to MSH6 support their independent evolutionary origins, a hallmark of evolution by natural selection. Patterns of evolutionary conservation reveal selection for histone binding and potentially on the regions that link reader domains with MutS repair domains, providing hypotheses about biochemical functions. We also find evidence of clades that never gained or have lost MSH6 histone readers, especially of PWWP in major clades with Protosome animals, coupled with differences in genome architectures and other characteristics. This co-evolution may provide insight into the evolutionary forces acting on these mechanisms, reflecting their costs and benefits under different conditions. In summary, the convergent evolution of epigenome targetting in MSH6 suggests conditionally adaptive mechanisms, inspiring further questions about the mutational consequences and evolution of DNA repair systems across the tree of life.</p>

<title>Defining MSH6 orthologs</title>
<p>We downloaded all annotated (both NCBI RefSeq and GenBank) public eukaryotic genomes and proteomes on NBCI (4,938 species) on August 9, 2023 (<xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8</xref>). For each proteome, we queried using the protein sequence of human MSH6 (<italic>blastp</italic> with eval threshold of 0.01). Each of the resulting hits was blasted back against the human proteome. Proteins were considered potential orthologs of human MSH6 if the top hit in the human proteome was human MSH6. We thus removed proteins that show evidence of belonging to other members of the MSH protein family, though these were retained for downstream analysis to test for the presence of histone readers. We also performed the same reciprocal blastp analysis with Arabidopsis MSH6. Proteins were considered MSH6 only if the top hit of the reverse blast was the Arabidopsis MSH6 protein. These predicted MSH6 orthologs for each species were then defined as those that were classified as orthologs of both human and Arabidopsis MSH6. Finally, to further confirm MSH6 orthology, we ran <italic>ab initio</italic> of each predicted MSH6 ortholog using InterProScan with all available databases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup>. The final set of MSH6 orthologs was determined by requiring them to be called MSH6-specific orthologs by both reciprocal <italic>blastp</italic> queries and also contain <italic>ab initio</italic> annotated MutS domains. This removed potential false positives from downstream analysis in which non-MSH proteins containing PWWP or Tudor domains would be incorrectly called. Because genome annotation errors can lead to false negatives of MSH6 presence in a species, we ignored all species lacking a definitive MSH6 ortholog in all downstream analyses.</p>

<sec id="s4b">
<title>Identifying Tudor and PWWP domains in MSH6 orthologs</title>
<p>For each species proteome, we queried for the PWWP domain of the human MSH6 protein (<xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8</xref>). We also queried for the Tudor domain of the Arabidopsis MSH6 protein. From these results, we annotated MSH6 orthologs as containing Tudor and PWWP domains if the same protein was detected by MSH6 blastp searches (preceding step) and significant (e score) matches for specific queries of PWWP and Tudor domains. To further improve the annotation of Tudor and PWWP domains, we analyzed the results of <italic>ab initio</italic> domain prediction from InterProScan with “CDD,” “Pfam,” “SMART,” and “ProSiteProfiles” databases. MSH6 orthologs were thus annotated as containing a Tudor domain if they contained a significant match to the Tudor domain query or if they were annotated as having a Tudor domain by InterProScan. Likewise, MSH6 orthologs were thus annotated as containing a PWWP domain if they contained a significant match to the PWWP domain query or if they were annotated as having a PWWP domain by InterProScan. Species were classified as containing a Tudor domain or a PWWP domain in MSH6 if any of their MSH6 orthologs contained such domains. This approach was conservative in that it prioritized against calling false negatives. That is, to preclude misclassifying species as lacking a histone reader when, in reality, one is present. For example, in a polyploid species, we might find multiple putative MSH6 orthologs, which vary in the presence/absence of a reader domain. If at least one MSH6 ortholog contained a reader domain, it was classified as having that domain at the species level.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4c">
<title>Removing species with evidence of genome annotation errors</title>
<p>We considered several possible scenarios from which genome annotation errors could cause false negatives in identifying reader domains in MSH6 orthologs (<xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8</xref>).</p>
<p>First, genome annotations could lead to incorrect splits of MSH6 into several genes. In this case, the MSH6 gene may be found adjacent to a “gene” that contains a Tudor domain or PWWP domain. To identify such cases, we compared the location of MSH6 orthologs to results from querying (<italic>blastp</italic>) Tudor and PWWP domains. Cases in which a neighboring gene (within 5kb) contained a Tudor or PWWP domain were classified as ambiguous and removed from subsequent analyses.</p>
<p>Second, genes could be incompletely annotated such that transcribed regions (e.g., whole exons) are excluded from the predicted gene model. We thus used <italic>tblastn</italic> to query Tudor and PWWP domains on the entire genome, which were translated into all reading frames of each genome. Species in which a sequence matching a Tudor or PWWP domain within 5 kb of an MSH6 ortholog were classified as ambiguous and removed from subsequent analyses.</p>
<p>Finally, we considered the possibility that MSH6 orthologs with histone reader domains may be missed from annotation entirely. To identify and remove such cases, we used <italic>tblastn</italic> to query MSH6 protein sequences from human and Arabidopsis orthologs. Cases where potential unannotated orthologs (matching MSH6 &gt; 200aa, to exclude matches to potential reader domain itself, such as in other proteins which contain these domains) were defined as cases where a <italic>tblastn</italic> query for Tudor or PWWP domain was also found within 5 kb of MSH6 tblastn result. For such cases, the species’ domain call was classified as ambiguous and excluded from downstream analyses.</p>
<p>Despite these steps, we could not preclude other sources of misannotation that might lead to false negatives for domain presence in a single species. For example, fragmentation during genome assembly could lead to edge cases where the repair domain (i.e., MutS domains) of MSH6 and its reader domain (if present) were assembled on different scaffolds or contigs, making it impossible to accurately control against the subsequent effects of misannotation. Similar issues might arise from miss-assemblies that cause false separation from MSH6 repair domains from reader domains. Thus, we interpret single species lacking a reader domain, especially when nested within a clade in which closely related species that contain such a domain, with caution until they can be validated.</p>

<title>MSH6 homologs in non-eukaryotes</title>

We queried, with <italic>blastp</italic>, the entire NCBI Archaeal protein database for the Arabidopsis and Human MSH6 proteins and checked for any that aligned to Tudor or PWWP regions of MSH6.

<title>Modeling Structure of Tudor and PWWP domains interface with histone PTMs</title>
<p>Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in all MSH6 proteins were predicted with ALBATROSS <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup>. To examine the size, sequence composition, and IDR enrichment of the linker sequence separating MutS domains from histone readers, we used results from InterProScan to identify positions of well-annotated protein domains (one each of MutS I through V, Tudor, and PWWP, if present). Amino acid enrichment in linker regions was estimated by comparing amino acid counts within linker regions across species with the expectation of uniformity in amino acid frequencies. IDR enrichment was estimated by comparing the frequency of overlaps between linkers and predicted IDRs with overlaps between repair or reader domains with predicted IDRs. Given the disparities in species numbers with each domain architecture, we randomly selected 200 species with each domain architecture to visualize (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). These were plotted with domain positions centered around the start of MutS domain I. We compared the estimated size of the linker sequence between all PWWP and Tudor domain-containing species by measuring the length between the InterProScan annotated reader and MutSI domains.</p>
<p>Next, we approximated the distance between reader domain amino acids and H3 peptides.

From the resulting structural alignments, we estimated the distance of each amino acid in the histone reader domain to the corresponding H3 peptide chain by calculating the minimum Euclidean distance between atoms in each amino acid to atoms in the H3 peptide. We compared the relationship between the estimated distances of each amino acid with their evolutionary constraint (Shannon entropy).

<p>Maximum likelihood tree from MutS domains of putative MSH6 orthologs in non-metazoan and non-fungal organisms.

<p>This paper describes the study of the evolution of the N-terminal domain of the MSH6 mismatch repair protein in regard to the presence or absence of histone reader domains. While the presence of the histone reader domains was previously known, the phylogenetic analysis of these domains performed here establishing their insertion through convergent evolution is <bold>important</bold>, definitively done, and establishes an interesting feature of the MSH6 family of proteins. The work is <bold>convincing</bold> but the presentation of the structural features of MSH6 could be improved.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that the MSH6 family of mismatch repair proteins contains an unstructured N-terminal domain that contains either a PWWP domain, a Tudor domain or neither and that the interaction of the histone reader domains with the appropriate histone H3 modification enhances mismatch repair, and hence reduces mutation rates in coding regions to some extent. However, the elimination of the MSH6-histone modification probably does not completely eliminate mismatch repair, although the published papers on this point do not seem definitive.</p>
<p>In this study, the authors perform a details phylogenetic analysis of the presence of the PWWP and Tudor domains in MSH6 proteins across the tree of life. They observe that there are basically three classes of organisms that contain either a PWWP domain, a Tudor domain, or neither. On the basis of their analysis, they suggest that this represents convergent evolution of the independent acquisition of histone reader domains and that key amino acid residues in the reader domains are selected for.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The phylogenetic aspects of the work seem well done and the basic evolutionary conclusions of the work are well supported. The basic evolutionary conclusions are interesting and there is little to criticize from my perspective.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A major concern about this paper is that the authors fail to put their work into the proper context of what is already known about the N-terminus of MSH6. Further, their structural studies, which are really structural illustrations, are misleading, often incorrect, and not always helpful in addition to having been published before.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this work, Monroe JG and colleagues show a compelling case of convergent evolution in the fusion between an important mismatch repair protein (MSH6) and histone reader domains across the tree of life. These fused MSH6 readers have been shown to be important for the recruitment of MSH6 to exon-rich genome locations, therefore improving the efficiency of reducing mutation rates in coding regions.</p>
<p>Comparative genomic analyses here performed revealed independent instances of MSH6 fusion with histone readers in plants and metazoa with several instances of putative loss (or gain) across the phylogeny. The work also unveiled instances of MSH6 fusion putatively interesting domains in fungi which might be worth exploring in the future.</p>
<p>The authors also show potential signatures of purifying selection in functional amino acids MSH6 histone readers.</p>
<p>Overall the approach is adequate for the questions proposed to be answered, the analyses are rigorous and support the authors' claims.</p>
<p>DNA repair genes are essential to maintain genome stability and fidelity, and alterations in these pathways have been associated with hypermutation phenotypes in the context for instance of cancer in humans, with sometimes implications in treatment resistance. This is an important work that contributes to our understanding of the evolutionary consequences of the evolution of epigenome-targeted DNA repair.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The methods used are adequate for the questions and support the results. The search for MSH6 fusions was rigorous and conservative, which strengthens the significance of the claims on the evolutionary history of these fusion events.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I did not identify any major weaknesses, but please see my suggestions/recommendations.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the manuscript entitled &quot;Convergent evolution of epigenome recruited DNA repair across the Tree of Life&quot;, Monroe et al. investigate bioinformatically how some important mechanisms of epigenome-targeted DNA repair evolved at the tree of life scale. They provide a clear example of convergent evolution of these mechanisms between animals and plants, investigating more than 4000 eukaryotic genomes, and uncovering a significant association between gain/retention of such mechanisms with genome size and high intron content, that at least partially explains the evolutionary patterns observed within major eukaryotic lineages.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is well written, clear, and understandable, and has potentially broad interest. It provides a thorough analysis of the evolution of MSH6-related DNA repair mechanisms using more than 4000 eukaryotic genomes, a pretty impressive number allowing to identify both large-scale (i.e. kingdoms) as well as shorter-scale (i.e. phyla, orders) evolutionary patterns. Moreover, despite providing no experimental validation, it investigates with a sufficient degree of depth, a potential relationship between gain/retention of epigenome recruited DNA repair mediated by MSH6 and genomic, as well as life-history (population size, body mass, lifespan), traits. In particular, it provides convincing evidence for a causative effect between genome size/intron content and the presence/absence of this mechanism. Moreover, it stimulates further scientific investigation and biological questions to be addressed, such as the conservation of epigenomes across the tree of life, the existence of potential trade-offs in gain/retention vs. loss of such mechanisms, and the relationship between these processes, mutation rate heterogeneity, and evolvability.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Despite the interesting and necessary insights provided on (1) the evolution of DNA repair mechanisms, and (2) the convergent evolution of molecular mechanisms, this bioinformatic study emanates from studies in humans and Arabidopsis already showing signs of potential convergent evolution in aspects of epigenome-recruited DNA repair. For this, this study, although bioinformatically remarkably thorough, does not come as a surprise, potentially lowering its novelty.</p>
<p>What could have increased further its impact, interest, and novelty could have been a more comprehensive understanding of the causative processes leading to gain/retention vs. loss of MSH6-related epigenetic recruitment mechanisms. The authors provide interesting associations with life-history traits (yet not significant), and significant links with genome size and intron content only at the theoretical level. For the first aspect, the analyses could have expanded toward other life-history traits. For the second, maybe it could have been even possible to tackle experimentally some of the generated questions, functionally in some models, or deepened using specific case studies.</p>

<p>Thank you for the helpful suggestions on this front. We agree that some of the structural visualizations were over simplified and apologize for the lack of clarity. Notably, we did not annotate the presence of putative or known short PCNA-interacting protein (PIP) motifs which have been found at the linker disordered N-terminus of MSH6 proteins. Indeed, while not direct to our investigation of the origins of histone readers, the PIP motifs are an interesting and functionally important feature of MSH6 structural biology, especially because they may facilitate DNA repair processes more generally. In the revised manuscript, we aim to improve the scholarship on this topic and clarify the presence/importance of this motif for MSH6 function, as well as what is known about the structural biology of the MSH6 N-terminus more broadly. We will add annotations of the PIP motif and will also improve structural prediction by visualizing MSH6 structure in its dimerized form with MSH2, for a more accurate estimate of its folding <italic>in vivo</italic>. We hope that these in addition to other valuable suggested improvements will enhance the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this work, Monroe JG and colleagues show a compelling case of convergent evolution in the fusion between an important mismatch repair protein (MSH6) and histone reader domains across the tree of life. These fused MSH6 readers have been shown to be important for the recruitment of MSH6 to exon-rich genome locations, therefore improving the efficiency of reducing mutation rates in coding regions.</p>
<p>Comparative genomic analyses here performed revealed independent instances of MSH6 fusion with histone readers in plants and metazoa with several instances of putative loss (or gain) across the phylogeny. The work also unveiled instances of MSH6 fusion putatively interesting domains in fungi which might be worth exploring in the future.</p>
<p>The authors also show potential signatures of purifying selection in functional amino acids MSH6 histone readers.</p>
<p>Overall the approach is adequate for the questions proposed to be answered, the analyses are rigorous and support the authors' claims.</p>
<p>DNA repair genes are essential to maintain genome stability and fidelity, and alterations in these pathways have been associated with hypermutation phenotypes in the context for instance of cancer in humans, with sometimes implications in treatment resistance. This is an important work that contributes to our understanding of the evolutionary consequences of the evolution of epigenome-targeted DNA repair.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The methods used are adequate for the questions and support the results. The search for MSH6 fusions was rigorous and conservative, which strengthens the significance of the claims on the evolutionary history of these fusion events.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the manuscript entitled &quot;Convergent evolution of epigenome recruited DNA repair across the Tree of Life&quot;, Monroe et al. investigate bioinformatically how some important mechanisms of epigenome-targeted DNA repair evolved at the tree of life scale. They provide a clear example of convergent evolution of these mechanisms between animals and plants, investigating more than 4000 eukaryotic genomes, and uncovering a significant association between gain/retention of such mechanisms with genome size and high intron content, that at least partially explains the evolutionary patterns observed within major eukaryotic lineages.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is well written, clear, and understandable, and has potentially broad interest. It provides a thorough analysis of the evolution of MSH6-related DNA repair mechanisms using more than 4000 eukaryotic genomes, a pretty impressive number allowing to identify both large-scale (i.e. kingdoms) as well as shorter-scale (i.e. phyla, orders) evolutionary patterns. Moreover, despite providing no experimental validation, it investigates with a sufficient degree of depth, a potential relationship between gain/retention of epigenome recruited DNA repair mediated by MSH6 and genomic, as well as life-history (population size, body mass, lifespan), traits. In particular, it provides convincing evidence for a causative effect between genome size/intron content and the presence/absence of this mechanism. Moreover, it stimulates further scientific investigation and biological questions to be addressed, such as the conservation of epigenomes across the tree of life, the existence of potential trade-offs in gain/retention vs. loss of such mechanisms, and the relationship between these processes, mutation rate heterogeneity, and evolvability.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Despite the interesting and necessary insights provided on (1) the evolution of DNA repair mechanisms, and (2) the convergent evolution of molecular mechanisms, this bioinformatic study emanates from studies in humans and Arabidopsis already showing signs of potential convergent evolution in aspects of epigenome-recruited DNA repair. For this, this study, although bioinformatically remarkably thorough, does not come as a surprise, potentially lowering its novelty.</p>
<p>What could have increased further its impact, interest, and novelty could have been a more comprehensive understanding of the causative processes leading to gain/retention vs. loss of MSH6-related epigenetic recruitment mechanisms. The authors provide interesting associations with life-history traits (yet not significant), and significant links with genome size and intron content only at the theoretical level. For the first aspect, the analyses could have expanded toward other life-history traits. For the second, maybe it could have been even possible to tackle experimentally some of the generated questions, functionally in some models, or deepened using specific case studies.</p>

<p>We agree that this work expands on recent experimental work in humans and Arabidopsis on the function of histone readers in MSH6, PWWP and Tudor, respectively. However, the evolution of these fusions remained a significant knowledge gap, limiting the degree to which functional work could be translated to other organisms. This study definitively characterized the evolutionary history of MHS6 histone readers and lays the groundwork for future investigations in diverse species. We agree that more causal inference would be valuable to understand the evolutionary pressures acting on MSH6 histone reader presence/absence. Indeed, we prioritized the conservative approach of testing hypotheses with strict phylogenetically constrained contrasts. While we observed highly significant associations between histone readers and genomic traits like intron content, associations with life history traits were only significant before accounting for phylogeny. It is possible that this is due to a lack of power because such traits are only available in limited taxa. In the revised manuscript, we aim to clarify potential causes, outline future experimental work beyond the scope of this individual study, and argue that this work highlights the need to catalog trait diversity at broader phylogenetic scales.  We also address other valuable suggestions in the revised manuscript.</p>
