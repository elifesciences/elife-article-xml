<title>Abstract</title><p>Severe dengue infections are characterized by endothelial dysfunction shown to be associated with the secreted nonstructural protein 1 (sNS1), making it an attractive vaccine antigen and biotherapeutic target. To uncover the biologically relevant structure of sNS1, we obtained infection-derived sNS1 (isNS1) from DENV-infected Vero cells through immunoffinity purification instead of recombinant sNS1 (rsNS1) overexpressed in insect or mammalian cell lines. We found that isNS1 appeared as an approximately 250 kDa complex of NS1 and ApoA1 and further determined the cryoEM structures of isNS1 and its complex with a monoclonal antibody/Fab. Indeed, we found that the major species of isNS1 is a complex of the NS1 dimer partially embedded in a High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) particle. Cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) studies confirmed that the isNS1 interacts with the major HDL component ApoA1 through interactions that map to the NS1 wing and hydrophobic domains. Furthermore, our studies demonstrated that the sNS1 in sera from DENV-infected mice and a human patient form a similar complex as isNS1. Our results report the molecular architecture of a biological form of sNS1 which may have implications for the molecular pathogenesis of dengue.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dengue virus (DENV) is a member of the flavivirus genus and is the cause of significant healthcare problems and economic burden worldwide, partially due to the lack of effective therapeutics and the limited efficacy of licensed vaccines, Dengvaxia® and QDENGA®<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. While the majority of DENV infections are mild or asymptomatic, severe dengue infections, marked by vascular leakage, can be life-threatening and even fatal. The severity of dengue infections has been demonstrated to be correlated to high sera levels of sNS1 in clinical studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. The viral nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a highly conserved and multifunctional protein that exists as intracellular membrane-associated NS1, a presumed GPI-anchored outer plasma membrane-associated NS1, and secreted NS1 (sNS1) during viral infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. NS1 could interact with a myriad of proteins associated with its immune evasion and virotoxin roles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. The interactions of NS1 with viral E protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> and the NS4A-2K-NS4B precursor protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> have been shown to be important in virus production and replication respectively. Intracellular NS1 found in the ER lumen is an essential part of the membranous viral RNA replication compartment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Upon release from the cells, sNS1 enters the blood circulation where <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse evidence have demonstrated its ability to induce vascular permeability, a hallmark of severe dengue, either independently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> or through inducing pro-inflammatory responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The high-resolution crystal structures of NS1 dimer have been reported for DENV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, WNV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, and ZIKV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> which provide a conserved molecular view of flaviviral NS1. Mature NS1 is 352 amino acids long with an apparent molecular mass between 40 – 50 kDa depending on its glycosylation state. NS1 has a three-domain architecture, a hydrophobic β-roll (residues 1-29), an α/β wing (38-151), and a β-ladder (181-352). The connector segments between the wing and β-ladder domains, residues 30-37 and 152-180, form a 3-stranded β-sheet. The dimer has a distinct cross shape with the wings extending from the central β-ladder which has an extended β-sheet that faces the hydrophobic β-roll and a ‘‘spaghetti loop” on the opposite hydrophilic outer face that lacks structured elements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. sNS1 was reported to be a barrel-shaped hexamer with lipid cargo held together by hydrophobic interactions based on biophysical and low-resolution EM analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. CryoEM structures of recombinant sNS1 (rsNS1) were recently reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. The rsNS1 is mainly tetrameric with only 3% of the rsNS1 population found to be in the hexameric form<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Other studies have implied that sNS1 interacts with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and its major protein components, such as ApoA1 and ApoB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Additionally, sNS1 appears to utilize the scavenger receptor B1, a known receptor for HDL, as the cognate receptor in cultured cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Since the interactions of sNS1 with the target cells implicated in pathogenesis require the hydrophobic β-roll side to be exposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, the mechanism by which the oligomeric sNS1 with its lipid load in the central channel dissociates and associates have been a topic of intense research interest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. However, the native structure of the extracellular NS1 during viral infection remains unclear.</p>
<p>To closely mimic of sNS1 circulating in dengue patients’ sera, we obtained infection-derived sNS1 (isNS1) from the culture supernatant of Vero cells infected with either the DENV2 WT (isNS1wt) or T164S mutant (isNS1ts). The T164S mutation in the greasy finger loop between the wing and β-ladder interdomain of NS1 was identified from a DENV2 epidemic in Cuba in 1997, where a correlation with enhanced clinical disease severity was observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. We demonstrated that this single mutation in NS1 could directly cause lethality in mice and increased sNS1 secretion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, which served as an epidemiologically relevant tool to study the biochemical and structural characteristics of sNS1 in this study.</p>
<p>We determined that the isNS1 is a complex of the NS1 dimer embedded on a single HDL particle composed of ApoA1. By applying integrative structural tools, we report the cryoEM structural model of the purified isNS1:HDL complex at ∼7 Å resolution with protein-protein interactions between NS1 and ApoA1 defined by crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL-MS). Furthermore, the Ab56.2 binding site model in the cryoEM model of isNS1:ApoA1 complex was elucidated using hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) as well as NS1 peptide competition ELISA. Interrogation of DENV-infected mouse sera and a human patient suggests that the sNS1:HDL complex exists <italic>in vivo</italic> as a similar complex to isNS1.</p>

<p>We purified sNS1 using a monoclonal antibody 56.2 from the supernatant of the infected Vero cell cultures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 1a-b). Initial negative stain screening of the isNS1wt (Supplementary Fig. 1c) showed some 2D classes of NS1 dimers presumably docked onto a spherical density, mirroring the <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution of rsNS1 with HDL complex negative stain microscopy results by Benfrid et al. (2022)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Both immunoaffinity purified isNS1wt (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 2a) and isNS1ts (Supplementary Fig. 2a and 3b) retained a molecular size of ∼250 kDa as detected with Coomassie Blue (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 2a) and on a Western blot using Ab56.2 following separation on a Native-PAGE (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>), as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. The isNS1wt migrated slower than the rsNS1 protein (a gift from Shu et al. 2022<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>), indicating possible conformational or oligomeric differences between the two NS1 species (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). On a reducing SDS-PAGE, we identified two major bands of approximately 50 kDa and 25 kDa in isNS1wt, the former corresponding to the single monomeric NS1 band seen in rsNS1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Preliminary mass ID identified the 25 kDa protein as bovine apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), a major component of HDL in bovine serum-containing culture media, which has a reported molecular weight of 28 kDa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Hence, the two bands were further validated on a Western blot, which confirmed the 50 kDa band as NS1 and the 25 kDa band as ApoA1 respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). The same observations were seen in isNS1ts (Supplementary Fig 3).</p>

<p>DENV 2 WT (Chan et al., 2019) cell culture supernatant was filtered, supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail and 0.05% sodium azide, concentrated using a 100 kDa MWCO Vivaflow cassette and purified using 56.2 anti-NS1 antibody immunoaffinity chromatography as described previously (Gagnon et al., 2012). The eluted isNS1wt was dialysed against PBS, concentrated, and stored at –80°C until further use. <bold>(a)</bold> Schematic of isNS1 purification to illustrate the samples used for gel analyses. % NS1 is measured by the total amount of NS1 (quantified using the anti-NS1 ELISA kit (Bio-rad) as a percentage of total protein (quantified using the Bradford assay) found in each sample.

The Crude and Elute fractions contain 1 µg of total protein. The Wash fraction contains approximately 100 ng of total protein in maximum well volume of the gel. The same set of samples were also subjected to a western blot detection of NS1 using 56.2 anti-NS1 antibody after separation on a 10% Native- PAGE (right). The Crude and Elute fractions contain 500 ng of total protein. The Wash fraction contains approximately 100 ng of total protein in maximum well volume of the gel. <bold>(c)</bold> Coomassie blue detection of proteins from Crude, Wash and Elute immunoaffinity fractions for isNS1wt and rsNS1 (Shu et al., 2022), after separation on a 4-20% reducing SDS-PAGE gel. The Crude and Elute fractions contain 1 µg of total protein. The Wash fraction contains approximately 100 ng of total protein in maximum well volume of the gel. Similarly, the same set of samples were also subjected to a western blot detection of NS1 and ApoA1 using 56.2 anti-NS1 antibody or ApoA1 antibody (Biorbyt, orb10643) respectively, after separation on a 4- 20% reducing SDS-PAGE (right). <bold>(d)</bold> In-gel protein identification of the purified isNS1wt by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS).

</fig>
<p>Next, we elucidated the composition of the prominent 250 kDa band observed in the Native-PAGE by label-free quantification (LFQ) analysis of proteins using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS). We obtained LC-MS data for the ∼250 kDa protein excised from the Native-PAGE separation of the immunoaffinity purified isNS1wt (represented in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, purple box as Gel Band 1); an aliquot of the elute fraction from immunoaffinity purification (depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> blue box and referred to as “Elute”) and the 50 kDa and 25 kDa bands excised after separation of the elute fraction on a reducing SDS-PAGE (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, represented by red and green boxed labelled as Gel Band 2 and 3 respectively) as positive controls. The raw data for the ion intensities of the samples tested are as detailed in Supplementary File 1. We found that the combined LFQ intensity of NS1 and ApoA1 accounted for more than 77.6% and 88.6% of the total ion intensity count (TIC) detected from the elute fraction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, blue box) and the 250 kDa band (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, the purple box labelled ‘1’) respectively, indicating that NS1 and ApoA1 were the major proteins in the elute fraction and the ∼250 kDa band from immunoaffinity purified isNS1wt (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Accordingly, as depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, NS1 accounted for 96.85% of the TIC for the 50 kDa band (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, red box ‘2’), while the intensity of ApoA1 accounted for 96.23% of the TIC for the 25 kDa band (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, green box ‘3’). Similar LFQ analysis of LC-MS data for the purified isNS1ts mutant showed that NS1 and ApoA1 were the major components (Supplementary Fig. 2) of the respective Elute and ∼250 kDa gel band on Native-PAGE (Supplementary Fig. 2a; 3a, purple box). The corresponding 50 kDa and 25 kDa gel bands on th reducing SDS-PAGE (Supplementary Fig. 2b, 3b) identified as NS1 and ApoA1 by immunoblotting with the respective antibodies (Supplementary Fig. 3b), were further confirmed by LC-MS as NS1 and ApoA1 (Supplementary Fig. 2c, 3c, Supplementary file 1). Taken together, the results from the Native PAGE and LFQ by LC-MS strongly indicated that the isNS1 purified from the supernatant of infected cells <italic>in vitro</italic> is an approximately 250 kDa complex of NS1 and ApoA1.</p>

<title>CryoEM structure of isNS1</title>
<p>To gain insights into the molecular organization of this native isNS1, we determined the cryoEM structure of isNS1 (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 4-7). The 2D classes of isNS1ts are observed to be heterogenous spheres with some internal features, some of which resembling the cross-shaped NS1 protruding from the sphere (Supplementary Fig. 4b). However, the 3D reconstruction of isNS1ts alone was observed to have no discernible features beyond a spherical-like density with varying dimensions averaging around 106 Å by 77 Å (Supplementary Fig. 4). To obtain higher resolution structural information on the complex, we collected data for the ternary complexes of the isNS1wt:Ab56.2, isNS1wt:Fab56.2 and the isNS1wt:Fab56.2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 5-6). The use of antibodies as fiduciary markers is a well-proven approach for solving the structures of small proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Overall, both samples resulted in similarly distinguishable 2D class averages (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2b-c</xref>) which show asymmetrical binding of one unit of Fab56.2 to the dimeric cross-shaped sNS1 associated with a lower-density sphere, presumably HDL.</p>

<p>In the isNS1wt:Fab56.2 ternary complex dataset, we further observed two apparent but rare sub-classes of free sNS1wt dimer bound to two units of Fab56.2 representing 3.5% of the total population of picked particles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, red dashed boxes). While the cryoEM map reconstructions remain limited at low resolutions (Supplementary Fig. 5-6), they could be fitted with the NS1 dimer and Fab56.2 models (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>) predicted separately using AlphaFold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, with a correlation value of 0.75 to the fitted regions using a simulated 5 Å map from the NS1 dimer and Fab models. The AlphaFold predicted model of the NS1 dimer was used despite the availability of the crystallographic dimer model (PBS ID: 6WER) because the latter had a few unmodelled residues (aa 118-128)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. The predicted model upon superimposition on the crystallographic model, nonetheless, has a RMSD of 0.67 Å indicating that these two models were highly similar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. The map-model fitting showed that the epitope sites were at the tip of the C-terminal β-ladder region. The approximate dimensions of the spherical HDL could also be measured at 82 Å by 65 Å (Supplementary Fig 5-6) which aligned with existing reports of spherical HDL being measured at 70-120 Å in diameter with predominantly homodimeric ApoA1 arranged as an anti-parallel double-belt stabilized by intermolecular salt bridges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. We predicted a model of an antiparallel dimer of ApoA1 using AlphaFold2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> without the first 58 residues of ApoA1 as the N-terminal domain is highly flexible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. The model has a cross-sectional distance of approximately 78 Å and fits into the spherical density in the cryoEM map. The NS1 dimer appears semi-embedded on the HDL particle through its hydrophobic surface, with a conformation that exposed only one end of the β-ladder domain to which Ab56.2 and Fab56.2 bind. Overall, the cryoEM model indicated that the purified ∼250 kDa isNS1 is a complex of a NS1 dimer and HDL, consistent with the gel and LFQ analysis of LC-MS data presented above.</p>
<p>Similarly, we determined the structures of the ternary complex of isNS1ts mutant with Fab56.2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Interestingly, 2D class averages of isNS1ts:Fab56.2 dataset showed a significant sub-population of a free NS1ts dimer bound to two units of Fab56.2 (53.7%), in addition to the HDL spheres (23.6%) and isNS1ts dimer:HDL:Fab56.2 (22.7%) classes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 7). The predicted structure of the isNS1ts dimer bound to Fab56.2 could be fitted with an overall correlation value of 0.5 using map simulated from atoms at 5 Å (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). Achieving atomic resolution to map the Fab binding interface with the NS1 β-ladder domain remains a challenge due to the preferred orientation (Supplementary Fig. 7). A comparison of the cryoEM density maps of free isNS1ts dimer:Fab56.2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>, grey) and isNS1ts dimer:HDL:Fab56.2 ternary complex (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>, yellow) fitted with a correlation value of 0.71 based on the NS1 map region, revealed a pose difference of the Fab56.2 between the free isNS1ts dimer and the HDL-bound isNS1ts dimer (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>, inset). Further comparison of the density maps of the isNS1 dimer:HDL population in the Fab56.2 ternary complexes of isNS1wt (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>, purple) and isNS1ts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>, yellow) revealed conformational similarities of the isNS1 dimer:HDL complex.</p>

<title>XL-MS maps the inter- and intra-molecular architecture of the isNS1</title>
<p>Next to refine our understanding of the NS1 dimer:HDL complex of the isNS1 indicated by the LFQ of LC-MS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 3d) and cryoEM results (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2d</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>), we probed the interactions between NS1 and ApoA1 - the major protein moiety of HDL - using crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL-MS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> on the immunoaffinity purification eluate fraction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 8a-b). We identified 28 NS1:NS1 and 29 ApoA1:ApoA1 intramolecular crosslinks, as well as 25 NS1:ApoA1 intermolecular crosslinks for isNS1wt (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>; Supplementary File 2a-b). As depicted in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b-c</xref>, the NS1 residues that are involved in both intra- and inter-molecular crosslinks were located mainly on the β-roll and wing domains, with ∼34% of the NS1:ApoA1 crosslinks being located on the β-roll domain. The NS1:NS1 intramolecular crosslink pairs were further validated on the predicted NS1 dimer model by implementing a 30 Å cut-off distance for the Cα atoms of crosslinked residues, a criterion that was met by 85% of the NS1:NS1 intramolecular crosslinks (24 out of 28; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). The NS1:ApoA1 intermolecular crosslinks for the immunoaffinity purified isNS1wt were found to be located between the β-roll and wing domains of NS1 and the helices 3, 4, 8 and 10 of ApoA1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b, d</xref>). Applying the same cut-off value of &lt;30 Å distance between the Cα atoms of the NS1:ApoA1intermolecular crosslinked residues and validating it on the cryoEM model of isNS1wt in this study (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d-e</xref>) satisfied 76% of the crosslinks (19 out of 25 intermolecular crosslinks between NS1 dimer and ApoA1). In the case of ApoA1:ApoA1 intramolecular crosslinks, the &lt;30 Å distance between their Cα atoms cut-off satisfied 62% of the crosslinks (18 out of 29 ApoA1:ApoA1 intramolecular crosslinks). The higher number of violated crosslinks in ApoA1:ApoA1 compared to those in NS1:NS1 could be due to the flexible and dynamic nature of ApoA1 dimers which may prevent it from assuming a fixed relative position among the ApoA1 dimer population in the HDL. Overall, the XL-MS data and structural validation agreed with the cryo-EM model of isNS1 being a complex of the NS1 dimer embedded on a HDL particle composed of an ApoA1 dimer (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4d-e</xref>).</p>

<p>Additionally, the XL-MS mapping of isNS1ts mutant (Supplementary Fig. 8c-d) followed by rigid-body fitting into the corresponding cryoEM map (Supplementary Fig. 8e) revealed a similar crosslink pattern to isNS1wt, except that there were fewer crosslink sites (Supplementary Fig. 8f, Supplementary File. 2a). This indicated that isNS1ts dimer may have a weaker affinity to HDL in comparison to the isNS1wt dimer. This finding is consistent with the cryoEM data for isNS1ts where we found that free isNS1ts dimers bound to Fab56.2 formed a significant sub- population (34.5%) of the total picked particles (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 7b).</p>
<p>Given the reported structures of hexameric and tetrameric rsNS1 from mammalian expression systems, insect cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> and Expi293 HEK cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, we further examined whether rsNS1 oligomerizes in the presence of exogenously added human HDL, using XL-MS. The crosslinked rsNS1 alone appeared as higher oligomer bands of dimers, tetramers, and hexamers on the SDS- PAGE analysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>, lane 3) which differed from the crosslinked isNS1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4f</xref>, lane 3). Interestingly, the addition of human HDL and crosslinker resulted in a smearing band ranging from 30-150 kDa with the loss of the well-defined monomeric rsNS1 band (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4f</xref>, lane 4). In the crosslinked rsNS1 in the absence of HDL, we identified 17 NS1:NS1 intramolecular crosslinks at the β-roll and wing domains (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f-g</xref>, Supplementary File 3a-b). In the presence of human HDL, we identified 30 ApoA1:ApoA1, 4 NS1:NS1, and 6 NS1:ApoA1 crosslinks (Supplementary File 3a-b). Most crosslinks identified are ApoA1:ApoA1 intramolecular crosslinks in the rsNS1:ApoA1 samples (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref>). Only 1 out of 6 rsNS1:ApoA1 intermolecular crosslinks was within the 30 Å cutoff distance when mapped to the NS1:ApoA1 cryoEM model (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). This was in stark contrast with the isNS1 samples where the number of crosslinks between ApoA1:ApoA1, sNS1:sNS1, and sNS1:ApoA1 was similar (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4b</xref>). Overall, this suggests that rsNS1 may form oligomers of dimers but not a complex with HDL under the tested conditions.</p>

<title>Ab56.2 binds at the C-terminal <bold>β</bold>-ladder region of NS1</title>
<p>The cryoEM map for isNS1wt:Fab56.2 reliably placed the epitope site of Ab/Fab56.2 at the C- terminal b-ladder region, although the precise identification of the epitope site was hindered by the limited resolution of the cryoEM maps (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 4-7). Attempts to improve the resolution were challenging so we resorted to using a truncated form of recombinant secreted NS1 consisting of only the C-terminal region (rsNS1c; residues 172-352) to determine Ab56.2 epitope. The rsNS1c fragment of residues 172-352 was previously used for structural studies of dengue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> and other flaviviruses, West Nile virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, Zika virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, and Japanese encephalitis virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. The epitope region of Ab56.2 was first confirmed by overlapping 15-mer NS1 peptide competition ELISA for Ab56.2 binding (Supplementary Fig. 9a, Supplementary Table 2). The greatest competition was observed at the NS1 peptide spanning residues 316-330 out of 301-340 which showed a decrease in OD450 absorbance (Supplementary Fig. 9b). We further applied the hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to monitor the conformational dynamics between Fab56.2 and NS1c to obtain higher peptide-level resolution for the binding interface. Comparative HDX results revealed global scale protection against deuterium exchange of NS1c in the presence of Fab56.2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 10a), indicative of reduced conformational dynamics. Large-scale differences in deuterium exchange were primarily observed across peptides spanning the dimer interface (residues 174-186) and at the tip of the C-terminal β-ladder (residues 286-347) of NS1c (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). Multiple overlapping peptides, spanning residues 286-347 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>), showed protection against deuterium exchange even at the longer labeling times (100 min) in NS1c:Fab56.2 complex (Supplementary Fig. 10a, Supplementary File 4). These results suggest that Fab56.2 bound stably with NS1c. Coupled with the observation that the most significant change in the differential plot was at residues 300-310 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>), these results collectively indicate that NS1c binds stably to Fab56.2 at the primary epitope site of residues 300-310.</p>

Upon binding to NS1c, peptides spanning CDRH3 (residues 89-116) showed the largest magnitude decrease in deuterium exchange at all labeling time points, while CDRH2 showed minor significant differences. In addition, only the CDRL2 loop (residues 49-56) of the light chain of Fab56.2 showed significantly decreased deuterium exchange. Mapping of the deuterium exchange profiles of heavy and light chains onto a model of Fab56.2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>) revealed that CDRH1-3 and CDRL2 loops were spatially co-localized to form the paratope site to bind NS1c, with the heavy chain being the primary anchor.

<p>Lastly, we sought to provide <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence of NS1 and ApoA1 interaction using sera samples from DENV-infected mice and a human patient. Since we previously showed that DENV2 T164S mutant virus led to more severe disease in the AG129 mouse model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, we used the same infection model to obtain pooled mice serum for immunoaffinity purification of sNS1ts as described in Supplementary Fig. 1.

A primary infection sample with high levels of sNS1 (&gt;15 µg/ml) detected by commercial Platelia™ NS1 ELISA was selected for this purpose to avoid the confounding factor of the presence of anti-NS1 Abs in the secondary infected patients and to pull-down sufficient sNS1 from the patient serum. The patient serum was first subjected to a pre-clearing step using Protein AG resin to reduce the abundance of human IgGs that may interfere with the downstream analysis. We then subjected the pre-cleared patient serum to immunoprecipitation using commercial polyclonal anti-ApoA1 antibodies to pull down and detect ApoA1 and possibly sNS1. Increasing the anti-ApoA1 antibody from 10 to 50 µg coupled onto Protein AG resin for pull-down resulted in a corresponding increase in the sNS1 amount detected by ELISA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>), suggesting a specific association between sNS1 and ApoA1.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, by integrating biochemical and biophysical approaches including immunoaffinity purification, cryoEM, XL-MS and HDX-MS, we have successfully purified and characterised a native population of isNS1. We determined the cryo-EM structure of a natively secreted NS1 from DENV2-infected cells as a ternary complex of NS1 dimer embedded on a single HDL particle. The structure is validated by in-solution cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) analysis of the cryoEM samples. The NS1:ApoA1 complex is mediated through defined interactions between the β-roll and wing domains of NS1 and helices 3, 5, 8, and 10 of (bovine) ApoA1 – the main protein moiety of HDL. Additionally, we were able to preliminarily observe NS1:HDL complexes in purified sNS1 from the sera of DENV2-infected mice and further detect and quantify NS1 that co-immunoprecipitated with ApoA1 in the serum of a DENV1-infected patient, further supporting the <italic>in vivo</italic> and clinical relevance of the NS1:HDL complexes. We also captured a population of free sNS1 dimers that are bound to two copies of Fab56.2 from the same sample. These sNS1 dimers may be separated from HDL complex or the oligomeric form upon Fab56.2 binding. There may be a dynamic equilibrium between the HDL-bound NS1 and oligomeric NS1, regulated by an interplay between NS1 secretion and circulating HDL.</p>
<p>Secreted NS1 from DENV1-infected cells was shown to be a detergent-labile complex of ∼300 kDa that contains lipid species similar to that of HDL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Benfrid et al. (2022) recently reported that dimers of rsNS1 bind to HDL when healthy plasma was spiked with purified rsNS1 and subsequently immunoaffinity purified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Indeed, for the ∼250 kDa PAGE band that was thought to be hexameric<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, it could be a complex of dimeric NS1 (∼100 kDa) with HDL (∼164 kDa reported by Benfrid et al., 2022<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>) composed of ApoA1 homodimer (∼50 kDa) arranged as an antiparallel dimer along with the lipids. Similar to our isNS1 findings, NS1 dimers from the rsNS1 were found to be anchored on the surface of the spheroid human HDL particles, albeit in varying ratios from one to three dimers docked on a single HDL particle <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. These differences in ratios could be attributed to variations in the concentration of sNS1 used for spiking and immunoaffinity purification. The concentration of the rsNS1 (400 μg/mL) used for spiking in the mentioned study was more than 10-fold higher than that in the concentrated crude supernatant we used for immunoaffinity purification (∼30 μg/mL). Given that circulating spheroid HDL can consist of two or more copies of ApoA1 in a double-belt model or multifoil model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> respectively within the same HDL population, it is theoretically possible that under high concentrations of rsNS1, the NS1 dimers could associate with multiple ApoA1 molecules on the HDL particle. Nonetheless, the structure of a NS1 dimer docked onto a single HDL particle is likely to be more physiologically relevant, considering that the concentration used in our study is closer to the maximum clinically reported concentration of sNS1 in the sera of DENV patients (50 μg/mL)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the observation that NS1 interacts with HDL regardless of the source of mammalian ApoA1 is unsurprising, given the high sequence similarity of bovine and mouse HDL to human HDL of approximately 79% and 65% respectively (Supplementary Fig. 11) and that the structure of ApoA1 is highly conserved due to the functional significance of the amphipathic α-helices in HDL assembly and lipid interactions.</p>
<p>While we observed a significant number of NS1:ApoA1 crosslinks (29 crosslinks, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4b</xref>) via XL-MS in isNS1wt, only 6 NS1:ApoA1 crosslinks (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4g</xref>) were detected between rsNS1 and HDL, suggesting weaker interaction between the two species compared to that in the isNS1 complex. However, the reconstitution experiment in the aforementioned study demonstrated that rsNS1 could disassemble into its dimeric building blocks in the presence of human serum, allowing for anchorage onto HDL particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. These findings collectively suggest that once the higher-order oligomers of NS1 dimers are formed, they become highly stable and may require assistance from other serum proteins to dissociate and bind to HDL. HDL is known to recruit and interact with at least 96 different serum proteins for its functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Alternatively, it could be due to the difference between insect cell (<italic>Drosophila</italic> S2)-expressing rsNS1 used in the reconstitution experiment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> and the commercial HEK293-expressing rsNS1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> used in our study for crosslinking with purified human HDL. Hexamers were reported in insect cell-expressing rsNS1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> while tetramers were the predominant form from Expi293F-expressing rsNS1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Hence, such structural differences may affect the binding pattern between the two different sources of rsNS1. Overall, the intermolecular interaction residues identified using in-solution XL-MS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>) do support the fitted 3D model of isNS1 as a complex of NS1:HDL (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d-e</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 8e).</p>
<p>High molecular weight recombinant NS1 was also interpreted to be a hexameric NS1 oligomer based on results obtained from SEC, SAXS, chemical crosslinking, negative staining EM methods, and crystallographic packing analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> depicted in Supplementary Fig. 12a. Shu et al. (2022) recently reported the first high-resolution cryoEM structure of rsNS1 that is predominantly tetrameric with two NS1 dimers interacting with each other via the hydrophobic interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, with only ∼3.1% out of all rsNS1 particles in the hexameric form<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. 12b). However, these hexamer models highly disagree with our XL-MS data (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 8c) since the β-roll domain in these models is presumably forming the lipid core with little space (∼17 – 20 Å) for interaction with another protein. Hence, it is improbable to accommodate the ApoA1 at the core of the hexamer which we illustrated in Supplementary Figure 12a-c using a sphere with a radius of 30 Å to represent the maximum range between the Cα atoms that can be cross-linked to the β-roll (residue Ser2). These multimeric NS1 species may still co-exist with NS1:HDL during viral infection given that rsNS1 form oligomers such as tetramers and hexamers in the absence of ApoA1 and its associated lipid content from HDL. Furthermore, the presence of a significant population of free isNS1ts dimers in complex with Fab56.2 and fewer crosslinks identified between isNS1ts and ApoA1 point towards the possibility that isNS1ts is more dynamic in its association with host proteins than isNS1wt. The dynamic picture of the different forms of sNS1 that is further enriched in the presence of anti-NS1 antibodies has been recently reviewed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Finally, the detection and quantification of sNS1 from an ApoA1 pull-down using commercial antibodies in DENV1-infected patient serum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> provided preliminary evidence that HDL-bound sNS1 complexes are clinically relevant. This is irrespective of the source of mammalian ApoA1 which are highly conserved in sequence and length, for which human and bovine ApoA1 shares ∼78% sequence identity (Supplementary Fig. 11). Although the sample size of mice and dengue patient is small and the NS1 antibodies could bind to serum proteins non-specifically, our observation of sNS1 association with ApoA1 from <italic>in vivo</italic> natural infection is supported by Benfrid et al. (2022) study which detected sNS1 in complex with HDL in the sera of hospitalized DENV patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Overall, our work provided a better understanding of the native structure of sNS1 in DENV pathogenesis. The functional role of HDL-bound NS1 protein in disease is now a topic of contention. Contrary to the known protective roles of HDL such as against endotoxic shock caused by lipopolysaccharides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>, Benfrid et al. (2022) showed that sNS1:HDL complex triggers proinflammatory signals when tested with primary human macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. The presence of sNS1:HDL complexes as a predominant population of sNS1 in our <italic>in vitro</italic> infection model corroborates with a previous report of an interaction between insect-derived recombinant NS1 and the classical HDL/ApoA1-binding receptor known as SR-BI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, which is expressed on hepatocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. This interaction in hepatocytes have been demonstrated to trigger endocytosis of sNS1 and subsequent downstream effects including vascular permeability, which is a characteristic feature of severe dengue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Internalisation of sNS1 is critical for increased virus production in hepatocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> and NS1-mediated permeability in endothelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Furthermore, NS1:HDL complexes have been shown to induce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages and their presence has been detected in the sera of hospitalised DENV patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Yet, this hypothesis is confounded by other reports. While rsNS1 has been shown to trigger a TLR4-mediated release of proinflammatory cytokines to induce vascular leakage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>, Coelho et al. (2021) further showed that lipid-free recombinant ApoA1 neutralizes the proinflammatory effects caused by insect-derived recombinant intracellular NS1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Furthermore, exogenous administration of purified HEK-293 derived NS1 failed to worsen <italic>in vivo</italic> vascular leakage in sublethally infected mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. This underscores the need for physiologically relevant studies to reconcile these discrepancies and gain a comprehensive understanding of the role of NS1-HDL complex in DENV pathogenesis.</p>
<p>In conclusion, despite the study limitations that our isNS1wt and isNS1ts were immunoaffinity purified with one specific monoclonal antibody (Ab56.2), our structural model, obtained by CryoEM and verified by XL-MS, of infection-derived sNS1 shows a NS1 dimer embedded on a single HDL particle composed of ApoA1 dimer. Future investigation of this work using infected mouse sera from other DENV strains and different flaviviruses would inform the structural and functional relevance of the HDL-bound NS1 protein complex amongst flaviviral NS1 as well as provide a basis for the development of NS1-directed therapeutics.</p>

<p>The authors of this study seek to visualize NS1 purified from dengue virus infected cells. They infect vero cells with DV2-WT and DV2 NS1-T164S (a mutant virus previously characterized by the authors). The authors utilize an anti-NS1 antibody to immunoprecipitate NS1 from cell supernatants and then elute the antibody/NS1 complex with acid. The authors evaluate the eluted NS1 by SDS-PAGE, Native Page, mass spec, negative-stain EM, and eventually Cryo-EM. SDS-PAGE, mas spec, and native page reveal a &gt;250 Kd species containing both NS1 and the proteinaceous component of HDL (ApoA1). The authors produce evidence to suggest that this population is predominantly NS1 in complex with ApoA1. This contrasts with recombinantly produced NS1 (obtained from a collaborator) which did not appear to be in complex with or contain ApoA1 (Figure 1C). The authors then visualize their NS1 stock in complex with their monoclonal antibody by CryoEM. For NS1-WT, the major species visualized by the authors was a ternary complex of an HDL particle in complex with an NS1 dimer bound to their mAB. For their mutant NS1-T164S, they find similar structures, but in contrast to NS1-WT, they visualize free NS1 dimers in complex with 2 Fabs (similar to what's been reported previously) as one of the major species. This highlights that different NS1 species have markedly divergent structural dynamics. It's important to note that the electron density maps for their structures do appear to be a bit overfitted since there are many regions with electron density that do not have a predicted fit and their HDL structure does not appear to have any predicted secondary structure for ApoA1. The authors then map the interaction between NS1 and ApoA1 using cross-linking mass spectrometry revealing numerous NS1-ApoA1 contact sites in the beta-roll and wing domain. The authors find that NS1 isolated from DENV infected mice is also present as a &gt;250 kD species containing ApoA1. They further determine that immunoprecipitation of ApoA1 out of the sera from a single dengue patient correlates with levels of NS1 (presumably COIPed by ApoA1) in a dose-dependent manner.</p>
<p>In the end, the authors make some useful observations for the NS1 field (mostly confirmatory) providing additional insight into the propensity of NS1 to interact with HDL and ApoA1. The study does not provide any functional assays to demonstrate activity of their proteins or conduct mutagenesis (or any other assays) to support their interaction predications. The authors assertion that higher-order NS1 exists primarily as a NS1 dimer in complex with HDL is not well supported as their purification methodology of NS1 likely introduces bias as to what NS1 complexes are isolated. While their results clearly reveal NS1 in complex with ApoA1, the lack of other NS1 homo-oligomers may be explained by how they purify NS1 from virally infected supernatant. Because NS1 produced during viral infection is not tagged, the authors use an anti-NS1 monoclonal antibody to purify NS1. This introduces a source of bias since only NS1 oligomers with their mAb epitope exposed will be purified. Further, the use of acid to elute NS1 may denature or alter NS1 structure and the authors do not include controls to test functionality of their NS1 stocks (capacity to trigger endothelial dysfunction or immune cell activation). The acid elution may force NS1 homo-oligomers into dimers which then reassociate with ApoA1 in a manner that is not reflective of native conditions. Conducting CryoEM of NS1 stocks only in the presence of full-length mAbs or Fabs also severely biases what species of NS1 is visualized since any NS1 oligomers without the B-ladder domain exposed will not be visualized. If the residues obscured by their mAb are involved in formation of higher-order oligomers then this antibody would functionally inhibit these species from forming. The absence of critical controls, use of one mAb, and acid elution for protein purification severely limits the interpretation of these data and do not paint a clear picture of if NS1 produced during infection is structurally distinct from recombinant NS1. Certainly there is novelty in purifying NS1 from virally infected cells, but without using a few different NS1 antibodies to purify NS1 stocks (or better yet a polyclonal population of antibodies) it's unclear if the results of the authors are simply a consequence of the mAb they selected.</p>
<p>Data produced from numerous labs studying structure and function of flavivirus NS1 proteins provide diverse lines of evidence that the oligomeric state of NS1 is dynamic and can shift depending on context and environment. This means that the methodology used for NS1 production and purification will strongly impact the results of a study. The data in this manuscript certainly capture one of these dynamic states and overall support the general model of a dynamic NS1 oligomer that can associate with both host proteins as well as itself but the assertions of this manuscript are overall too strong given their data, as there is little evidence in this manuscript, and none available in the large body of existing literature, to support that NS1 exists only as a dimer associated with ApoA1. More likely the results of this paper are a result of their NS1 purification methodology.</p>
<p>Suggestions for the Authors:</p>
<p>Major:</p>
<p>1. Because of the methodology used for NS1 purification, it is not clear from the data provided if NS1 from viral infection differs from recombinant NS1. Isolating NS1 from viral infection using a polyclonal antibody population would be better to answer their questions. On this point, Vero cells are also not the best candidate for their NS1 production given these cells do not come from a human. A more relevant cell line like U937-DC-SIGN would be preferable.</p>
<p>2. The authors need to support their interaction predictions and models via orthogonal assays like mutagenesis followed by HDL/ApoA1 complexing and even NS1 functional assays. The authors should be able to mutate NS1 at regions predicted to be critical for ApoA1/HDL interaction. This is critical to support the central conclusions of this manuscript.</p>
<p>3. The authors need to show that the NS1 stocks produced using acid elution are functional compared to standard recombinantly produced NS1. Do acidic conditions impact structure/function of NS1?</p>
<p>4. Overall, the data obtained from the mutant NS1 (contrasted to WT NS1) reveals how dynamic the oligomeric state of NS1 proteins are but the authors do not provide any insight into how/why this is, some additional lines of evidence using either structural studies or mutagenesis to compare WT and their mutant and even NS1 from a different serotype of DENV would help the field to understand the dynamic nature of NS1.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Chew et al describe interaction of the flavivirus protein NS1 with HDL using primarily cryoEM and mass spec. The NS1 was secreted from dengue virus infected Vero cells, and the HDL were derived from the 3% FBS in the culture media. NS1 is a virulence factor/toxin and is a biomarker for dengue infection in patients. The mechanisms of its various activities in the host are incompletely understood. NS1 has been seen in dimer, tetramer and hexamer forms. It is well established to interact with membrane surfaces, presumably through a hydrophobic surface of the dimer form, and the recombinant protein has been shown to bind HDL. In this study, cryoEM and crosslinking-mass spec are used to examine NS1 secreted from virus-infected cells, with the conclusion that the sNS1 is predominantly/exclusively HDL-associated through specific contacts with the ApoA1 protein.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The experimental results are consistent with previously published data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>CryoEM:</p>
<p>Some of the neg-stain 2D class averages for sNS1 in Fig S1 clearly show 1 or 2 NS1 dimers on the surface of a spherical object, presumably HDL, and indicate the possibility of high-quality cryoEM results. However, the cryoEM results are disappointing. The cryo 2D class averages and refined EM map in Fig S4 are of poor quality, indicating sub-optimal grid preparation or some other sample problem. Some of the FSC curves (2 in Fig S7 and 1 in Fig S6) have extremely peculiar shapes, suggesting something amiss in the map refinement. The sharp drop in the &quot;corrected&quot; FSC curves in Figs S5c and S6c (upper) indicate severe problems. The stated resolutions (3.42 &amp; 3.82 Å) for the sNS1ts-Fab56.2 are wildly incompatible with the images of the refined maps in Figs 3 &amp; S7. At those resolutions, clear secondary structural elements should be visible throughout the map. From the 2D averages and 3D maps shown in the figures this does not seem to be the case. Local resolution maps should be shown for each structure.</p>
<p>The samples were clearly challenging for cryoEM, leading to poor quality maps that were difficult to interpret. None of the figures are convincing that NS1, Ab56.2 or Fab56.2 are correctly fit into EM maps. There is no indication of ApoA1 helices. Details of the fit of models to density for key regions of the higher-resolution EM maps should be shown and the models should be deposited in the PDB. An example of modeling difficulty is clear in the sNS1ts dimer with bound Fab56.2 (figs 3c &amp; S7e). For this complex, the orientation of the Fab56.2 relative to the sNS1ts dimer in this submission (Fig 3c) is substantially different than in the bioRxiv preprint (Fig 3c). Regions of empty density in Fig 3c also illustrate the challenge of building a model into this map.</p>
<p>Mass spec:</p>
<p>Crosslinking-mass spec was used to detect contacts between NS1 and ApoA1, providing strong validation of the sNS1-HDL association. As the crosslinks were detected in a bulk sample, they show that NS1 is near ApoA1 in many/most HDL particles, but they do not indicate a specific protein-protein complex. Thus, the data do not support the model of an NS1-ApoA1 complex in Fig 4d. Further, a specific NS1-ApoA1 interaction should have evidence in the EM maps (helical density for ApoA1), but none is shown or mentioned. If such exists, it could perhaps be visualized after focused refinement of the map for sNS1ts-HDL with Fab56.2 (Fig S7d). The finding that sNS1-ApoA1 crosslinks involved residues on the hydrophobic surface of the NS1 dimer confirms previous data that this NS1 surface engages with membranes and lipids.</p>
<p>Sample quality:</p>
<p>The paper lacks any validation that the purified sNS1 retains established functions, for example the ability to enhance virus infectivity or to promote endothelial dysfunction. Peculiarities include the gel filtration profiles (Fig 2a), which indicate identical elution volumes (apparent MWs) for sNS1wt-HDL bound to Ab562 (~150 kDa) and to the ~3X smaller Fab56.2 (~50 kDa). There should also be some indication of sNS1wt-HDL pairs crosslinked by the full-length Ab, as can be seen in the raw cryoEM micrograph (Fig S5b).</p>
<p>Obtaining high quality structures is often more demanding of sample integrity than are activity assays. Given the low quality of the cryoEM maps, it's possible that the acidification step in immunoaffinity purification damaged the HDL complex. No validation of HDL integrity, for example with acid-treated HDL, is reported. Acid treatment is perhaps discounted by a statement (line 464) that another group also used immunoaffinity purification in a recent study (ref 20) reporting sNS1 bound to HDL. However the statement is incorrect; the cited study used affinity purification via a strep-tag on recombinant sNS1.</p>
<p>Discussion:</p>
<p>The Discussion reflects a view that the NS1 secreted from virus-infected cells is a 1:1 sNS1dimer:HDL complex with the specific NS1-ApoA1 contacts detected by crosslinking mass spec. This is inconsistent with both the neg-stain 2D class average with 2 sNS1 dimers on an HDL (Fig S1c) and with the recent study of Flamand &amp; co-workers showing 1-3 NS1 dimers per HDL (ref 20). It is also ignores the propensity of NS1 to associate with membranes and lipids. It is far more likely that NS1 association with HDL is driven by these hydrophobic interactions than by specific protein-protein contacts. A lengthy Discussion section (lines 461-522) includes several chemically dubious or inconsistent statements, all based on the assumption that specific ApoA1 contacts are essential to NS1 association with HDL and that sNS1 oligomers higher than the dimer necessarily involve ApoA1 interaction, conclusions that are not established by the data in this paper.</p>
