<title>Abstract</title><p>Cysteine-bound sulfane sulfur atoms in proteins have received much attention as key factors in cellular redox homeostasis. However, the role of sulfane sulfur in zinc regulation has been underinvestigated. We report here that cysteine-bound sulfane sulfur atoms serve as ligands to hold and release zinc ions in growth inhibitory factor (GIF)/metallothionein-3 (MT-3) with an unexpected C–S–S–Zn structure. Oxidation of such a zinc/persulfide cluster in Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT-3 results in the release of zinc ions, and intramolecular tetrasulfide bridges in apo-GIF/MT-3 efficiently undergo S–S bond cleavage by thioredoxin to regenerate Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT-3. Three-dimensional molecular modeling confirmed the critical role of the persulfide group in the thermostability and Zn-binding affinity of GIF/MT-3. The present discovery raises the fascinating possibility that the function of other Zn-binding proteins is controlled by sulfane sulfur.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sulfane sulfur is a chemical state of the sulfur atom with six valence electrons that are covalently bound to sulfur atoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Growing evidence supports the widespread existence of hydropersulfidated and polysulfidated proteins in all cell types, referred to as sulfane sulfur-binding proteins (SSBPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Protein sulfuration occurs via post-translational and co-translational pathways. Rhodanese is known to catalyze the production of sulfane sulfur and attach it to the thiol group of the protein itself using thiosulfate as a substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). 3-Mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase is a rhodanese-like enzyme that uses 3-mercaptopyruvate as the preferred sulfur donor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Cystathionine β-synthase and cystathionine γ-lyase use cystine as a substrate and catalyze the production of sulfane sulfur-containing cysteine hydropersulfide (CysSSH)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>), whose terminal sulfane sulfur can be reversibly transferred to other thiols such as glutathione (GSH) or protein-SH to form GSH hydropersulfide (GSSH) or protein hydropersulfides (protein-SSH), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase 2 catalyzes the production of CysSSH from CysSH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>), thereby producing CysSSH-integrated nascent proteins. The biological function of sulfane sulfur has received considerable attention in redox biology because of its antioxidant/anti-electrophilic capacity. However, the role of sulfane sulfur in proteins is not fully understood; therefore, further mechanistic investigation is required. Although several SSBPs have been identified using various methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), in the present study we used β-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl iodoacetamide (HPE-IAM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>) to derivatize the sulfane sulfur because we herein found that HPE-IAM has ability to extract sulfane sulfur atoms from SSBPs to form bis-S-HPE-AM adduct at a certain condition, thereby enabling quantitative analysis using LC-MS/MS with a stable isotope-labeled standard, bis-S<sup>34</sup>-HPE-AM.</p>
<p>In biological systems, cysteine-rich proteins can act as “redox switches” which sense accumulated oxidative stressors and free zinc ions, store excess metals, control the activity of metalloproteins, and serve as triggers for the activation of cellular redox signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Metallothionein (MT), discovered in 1957 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), is an important cysteine-rich metal-binding protein involved in three major biological processes: homeostasis of essential metals, detoxification of toxic metals, and protection from oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). It is recognized that metal binding to MT is thermodynamically stable, but oxidation of the thiolate cluster readily leads to metal release and formation of intramolecular MT-disulfide linkages. Zinc ions released from zinc/thiolate clusters of MT are suggested to function as signaling molecules for cellular redox homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Simultaneously, reduction of MT-disulfide by cellular reducing agents can occur in a process called the “MT redox cycle” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). However, the biochemical features of MT related to these functions have not been fully characterized. In addition, although the gas chromatography–flame photometric detector technique showed that MT isoforms contain sulfide ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), it remains unclear if these sulfides are indeed sulfane sulfur atoms that act as essential factors in controlling protein redox states, thereby regulating cellular zinc homeostasis. Because of its constitutive expression, this study focused on MT-3, which was originally identified as a growth inhibitory factor (GIF) in the human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). This study aimed to clarify the existence and content of sulfane sulfur in GIF/MT-3, the redox regulation of sulfane sulfur in holo- and apo-GIF/MT-3 in association with zinc release, and the effect of sulfane sulfur on the thermostability and metal binding affinity of GIF/MT-3. We found that sulfane sulfur atoms provide a redox-dependent switching mechanism for zinc/persulfide cluster formation in GIF/MT-3.</p>

<title>Existence of persulfide and polysulfide groups in apo-GIF/MT-3</title>
<p>It is well recognized that GIF/MT-3 is able to bind seven zinc ions. To determine if GIF/MT-3 is an SSBP, we used an <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> expression system to prepare recombinant human Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT-3 protein, from which apo-GIF/MT-3 was subsequently prepared (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). To detect sulfur modification in GIF/MT-3, we attempted to first measure the molecular weight of the whole protein with and without bound zinc. Using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR)-MALDI-TOF/MS, Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT-3 was mainly detected at <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> = 7071 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), which corresponded to the mass of zinc-free apo-GIF/MT-3 and indicated that zinc dissociates from protein in the acidic conditions used for MALDI sample preparation. However, apo-GIF/MT-3 showed several peaks at <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> = 7071, 7085, 7103, and 7117, with a main peak at <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> = 7053 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>) that corresponded to oxidized GIF/MT-3 with nine intramolecular cysteine disulfide bonds, which presumably release the molecular weight equivalent of nine molecules of H<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Thus, the peaks at <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> = 7085 (oxidized GIF/MT-3 plus one sulfur atom), 7103 (apo-GIF/MT-3 plus one sulfur atom), and 7117 (oxidized GIF/MT-3 plus two sulfur atoms) suggested that oxidized apo-GIF/MT-3 contains sulfane sulfur-like species that presumably exist as intramolecular cysteine trisulfide or tetrasulfide bridges (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Note that an increase in mass of 32 Da can also result from addition of two oxygen atoms.</p>

<p>Raman spectroscopy is used to detect bonding changes in proteins, including MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). The Raman shift of Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT-3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) contained a peak at 307 cm<sup>−1</sup>, which is attributable to both S-terminal and S-bridging ligands (e.g., S–Zn, S–Zn–S) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Also, the peaks at 761 cm<sup>−1</sup> and 778 cm<sup>−1</sup> presumably corresponded to cysteine–metal bonds (e.g., C–S–Zn) and backbone vibrations, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Overall loss of zinc was indicated by the decrease in the intensity of these peaks in the Raman spectra of apo-GIF/MT-3 and GIF/MT-3 treated with HPE-IAM to consume sulfane sulfur atoms (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) and also confirmed using inductively-coupled plasma (ICP)-MS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The peak around 400 cm<sup>−1</sup> is reported to correspond to vibrations of metal–S bridges (e.g., Zn–S–Zn) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>); however, loss of such a peak was not observed for apo-GIF/MT-3 and HPE-IAM-treated GIF/MT-3. The Raman peaks within the 510–520 cm<sup>−1</sup> range reportedly indicate disulfide bonds in MT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>); in our spectra, an intense peak at 511 cm<sup>−1</sup> was observed for apo- GIF/MT-3 but not Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT-3 and HPE-IAM-treated GIF/MT-3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p>

<p>In general, the S–S bonds of polysulfides are strong Raman scatterers due to the high polarizability of the bonding and lone pair electrons at the two-coordinate sulfur atoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). It was also shown that S–S, S–S–S, and S–S–S–S structures exhibit different Raman shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) and the different Raman bands reported for polysulfide may correspond to different geometrical forms of the molecule. To confirm the origin of the Raman peak at 511 cm<sup>−1</sup>, quantum chemical calculations were made based on three-dimensional (3D) homology modeling, as described later, of apo-GIF/MT-3 structures with and without persulfides; the free cysteines and their persulfides were assumed to be protonated and some of the neighboring cysteines formed disulfides or tetrasulfides, depending on the model. The details of the model structures (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B–E</xref>) and the calculation schemes are described in the Experimental procedures section. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref> shows the calculated Raman spectra of apo-GIF/MT-3 with thiol (–SH) groups and disulfide (S–S) bonds (apo-GIF/MT-3_S2 model), and of apo-GIF/MT-3 persulfide (–SSH) groups and tetrasulfide (S–S–S–S) bonds (apo-GIF/MT-3_S4 model). Although the theoretical and experimental Raman spectra exhibited different overall shapes, owing to computational limitations, it is clear that the peak near 511 cm<sup>−1</sup> was markedly more intense for the apo-GIF/MT-3_S4 model than the apo-GIF/MT-3_S2 model. The normal mode vectors were evaluated, and the resulting assignments of these peaks are summarized in Table S1. The peaks mainly corresponded to the stretching and bending of disulfide and tetrasulfide bonds. The commensurate increase in peak intensity with the number of S–S bonds was consistent with the fact that the apo-GIF/MT-3_S4 model has several S–S and S–S–S–S bonds, while the apo-GIF/MT-3_S2 model has only S–S bonds. The Zn-binding models with/without persulfide also showed that the peaks around 500 cm<sup>−1</sup> were almost lost in Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT-3 without persulfide (Fig. S1 and Table S2), indicating that the peak near 488 cm<sup>−1</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>) for Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT-3 corresponded to the S–S structure of persulfide. Taken together, these results suggest the existence of sulfane sulfur atoms in both Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT-3 and apo-GIF/MT-3.</p>

<title>Determination of sulfane sulfur atoms in Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT-3</title>
<p>HPE-IAM is a relatively inert electrophile that allows the detection of sulfur atoms (e.g., H<sub>2</sub>S) by forming a bis-S-β-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl acetamide (bis-S-HPE-AM) adduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Our rationale was that if GIF/MT-3 is an SSBP, the interaction of HPE-IAM with Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT-3 should eventually form a bis-S-HPE-AM adduct that can be quantified using LC-MS/MS with the stable isotope-labeled standard bis-S<sup>34</sup>-HPE-AM (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Small molecules such as H<sub>2</sub>S were removed during the purification of Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT-3 to exclude their contribution to the measured bis-S-HPE-AM adduct concentration. In a preliminary examination, a negligible amount of sulfane sulfur in Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT-3 could be detected after 36 h incubation with HPE-IAM at 37°C. Stillman and coworkers reported that it was difficult for <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide to access an apo-MT isoform at 37°C because of its folded structure, whereas heat treatment allowed such an electrophile to covalently bind the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Therefore, as expected, the amount of sulfane sulfur detected in Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT-3 depended on the HPE-IAM concentration (plateauing at 5 mM), the amount of Zn<sub>7</sub> GIF/MT-3 (up to 10 µM), and the reaction temperature and duration (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B–D</xref>). We performed the reaction with 5 mM HPE-IAM at 60°C for 36 h. Under these optimized conditions, each MT isoform (each containing 20 cysteine residues) possessed approximately 20 sulfane sulfurs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). None of the Cys-to-Ala mutants of GIF/MT-3 possessed sulfane sulfur (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>), indicating that all 20 sulfane sulfurs were bound to cysteine residues of Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT-3. Although the form of binding (e.g., 20 RSSH, 10 RSSSH, RSS<sub>20</sub>SR, 2 RSS<sub>10</sub>SR) was not identified, persulfide (20 RSSH) was suggested to be formed rather than polysulfide for reasons described in the discussion section.</p>

<p>Because this assay was performed at relatively high temperatures (60°C), we also examined the sulfane sulfur levels of several mutant proteins using chemically synthesized α- and β-domains of GIF/MT-3 to eliminate false-positive results. As shown in Fig. S2A, sulfane sulfur (less than 1 molecule per protein) was undetectable in chemically synthesized α- and β-domains of GIF/MT-3, whereas several molecules of sulfane sulfur per protein were detected in recombinant α- and β-domains exhibited (Fig. S2B, left panel). These findings indicated that the sulfane sulfur detected in our assay was derived from biological processes executed during the production of GIF/MT-3 protein. We further analyzed mutant proteins with β-Cys-to-Ala and α-Cys-to-Ala substitutions and found that their sulfane sulfur levels were comparable with those of the α- and β-domains of GIF/MT-3, respectively (Fig. S2B, left panel). Additionally, Ser-to-Ala mutation did not affect the sulfane sulfur levels of GIF/MT-3. The zinc content of each mutant protein was also determined under these conditions (Fig. S2B, right panel).</p>

<title>Redox-based GIF/MT-3 recycling system during oxidative stress</title>
<p>To explore the functional role of sulfane sulfur in GIF/MT-3, we examined the stability of sulfane sulfur in the protein with or without bound zinc. Freshly prepared Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT-3 and apo-GIF/MT-3 possessed almost the same amount of sulfane sulfur (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Unexpectedly, sulfane sulfur content in Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT-3 remained unchanged for up to 28 days in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) at 37°C (data not shown). In contrast, in apo-GIF/MT-3, sulfane sulfur content decreased markedly within 12 h of incubation, and the addition of zinc blocked any further decrease (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). This suggests that zinc ions are rapidly re-coordinated by the persulfide group in apo-GIF/MT-3, thereby stabilizing sulfane sulfur atoms. To examine the possibility of forming intramolecular cysteine tetrasulfide, which is stable and cannot react with iodoacetamide in the absence of a reducing agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>), apo-GIF/MT-3 left in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) for 36 h (i.e., oxidized apo-GIF/MT-3) was incubated with the reducing agent tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP). The presence of free SH/SSH groups in oxidized apo-GIF/MT-3, determined using 5,5′-ditiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>), was negligible but increased following TCEP incubation, leading to a complete recovery of sulfane sulfur atoms (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). These observations led us to assume that the time-dependent disappearance of persulfide in apo-GIF/MT-3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) was not due to the oxidative degradation of sulfane sulfur but rapid closure of a ring that can be cleaved by TCEP. Moreover, our method, based on TCEP-mediated reduction of tetrasulfide and subsequent trapping of sulfane sulfur atoms by HPE-IAM, was validated using the model compounds <italic>N</italic>-acetylcysteine-tetrasulfide (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>) and diallyltetrasulfide (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). In the absence of TCEP, minimal amounts of bis-S-HPE-AM adducts were detected in all the compounds examined. However, incubation with TCEP resulted in the stoichiometric detection of sulfane sulfur but not oxidized-<italic>N</italic>-acetylcysteine and diallyl disulfide, suggesting that sulfane sulfur was stably trapped by HPE-IAM during the 36 h TCEP incubation. A possible mechanism of reaction between tetrasulfide compounds and HPE-IAM is shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>. Thus, we confirmed that sulfane sulfur atoms of cysteine tetrasulfide in apo-GIF/MT-3 could be preserved after zinc release and oxidation.</p>

<p>Several reports have indicated that oxidative modification of MTs results in the release of zinc involved in zinc signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Incubation with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and <italic>S</italic>-nitroso-<italic>N</italic>-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), a nitrosonium ion donor, induced zinc release from Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT-3 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Under these conditions, the numbers of free SH/SSH groups and sulfane sulfur atoms in GIF/MT-3 were also decreased by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and SNAP treatment. However, subsequent TCEP treatment nearly restored the original levels of free SH/SSH and sulfane sulfur (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). The persulfide in apo-GIF/MT-3 appeared to be resistant to TCEP-induced release of sulfane sulfur, although tetrasulfide was not. Overall, it seems likely that sulfane sulfur in Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT-3 acts as a reserve of sulfur to be modified under physiological oxidative stress and a component of the redox-active closed-ring structure regulated by reductants (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>).</p>

<p>The interaction of sulfane sulfur species with KCN to yield thiocyanate and thiol products (cyanolysis) has been used as evidence of the presence of protein hydropersulfides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Therefore, we used KCN to eliminate the sulfane sulfur atoms from Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT-3. KCN treatment decreased the sulfane sulfur atom content of Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT-3 by approximately 75% (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). After removing KCN, the reducing agent TCEP was subsequently added because intramolecular cysteine disulfide/tetrasulfide bridges can be formed under the condition. TCEP did not recover the level of sulfane sulfur in GIF/MT-3 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>), indicating that KCN indeed removed sulfane sulfur from GIF/MT-3. In addition to eliminating the sulfane sulfur atoms, KCN treatment also reduced the zinc content of GIF/MT-3 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). To examine the role of sulfane sulfur in zinc retention, sulfane sulfur-diminished apo-GIF/MT-3 was incubated with zinc after TCEP treatment to reconstruct zinc-bound GIF/MT-3.

Therefore, we hypothesized that the zinc/persulfide clusters in Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT-3 may block the interaction of the protein with Trx and that the zinc ions bound to GIF/MT-3 may act as a repressor of Trx-mediated S–S bond cleavage. In addition, apo-GIF/MT-3 was a poor substrate for Trx-related proteins 14 (TRP14) and 32 (TRP32) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>). Furthermore, HPE-IAM trapping assay analysis confirmed that the Trx/Trx reductase (TR) system recovered sulfane sulfur content in apo-GIF/MT-3 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>) but not in the low-molecular-weight (&lt;3 kDa) fraction (data not shown). These observations indicate that Trx is a powerful enzyme that cleaves the tetrasulfide bond in apo-GIF/MT-3 and that persulfide formation derived from apo-GIF/MT-3 seems to be resistant to Trx as well as TCEP. Notably, a small amount of sulfane sulfur in apo-GIF/MT-3 was observed even in the absence of Trx and TR, thereby supporting our conclusion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B–E</xref>) that some persulfides or their deprotonated forms exist in apo-GIF/MT-3.

<p>We generated a 3D homology model of human Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT-3 using the Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) software and the Protein Data Bank (PDB) structures 4MT2 and 2F5H as templates (Fig. S3). Then we created a 3D structure of sulfane sulfur-bound Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT-3 (one sulfane sulfur per cysteine residue), Zn<sub>7</sub>S<sub>20</sub>GIF/MT-3 (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>), which was also used for Raman spectra modeling (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-E</xref>). The predicted 3D structure of Zn<sub>7</sub>S<sub>20</sub>GIF/MT-3 was almost the same as that of Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT-3 (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>), with the root-mean-square deviation of atom positions being only 0.789 Å. Similar results were obtained for Zn<sub>7</sub>MT1 and Zn<sub>7</sub>MT2 (Fig. S4). Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT-3 contains a cyclohexane-like Zn<sub>3</sub>Cys<sub>9</sub> cluster in the β domain and a bicyclononane-like Zn<sub>4</sub>Cys<sub>11</sub> cluster in the α domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). The structures of both clusters were mostly maintained even when all thiol groups were changed to persulfides by adding one sulfane sulfur atom to each (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref>). Schematic structures of the generated Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT-3 with or without sulfane sulfurs are shown in Fig. S5. Addition of two sulfane sulfur atoms, corresponding to cysteine trisulfide, disrupted each cluster structure (cf. Fig. S6 and <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref>). When they contained one sulfane sulfur in each cysteine, the thermostability scores of MT1, MT2, and GIF/MT-3 in the presence of zinc ions were higher than those in the absence of zinc ions (Table S3), indicating that these ions are key to the thermostability of MT isoforms, including those containing sulfane sulfur atoms. The thermostabilities and Cd<sub>7</sub>, Cu<sub>7</sub>, Hg<sub>7</sub>, and Zn<sub>7</sub> binding affinities of S<sub>20</sub>GIF/MT-3 were more favorable than the corresponding values of the sulfane sulfur-free protein (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Conversely, placing more than one sulfane sulfur on each cysteine residue decreased the thermostability and zinc binding affinity (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9C</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that zinc ions contribute to protection against persulfide oxidation and MT thermostability, while sulfane sulfur atoms participate in cysteine tetrasulfide formation, enhancement of metal binding affinity. Therefore, our study provides evidence for an interdependence of zinc and sulfane sulfur and for unique structural and functional roles of the persulfide groups in GIF/MT-3.</p>

<p>To confirm the presence of SSBPs in mouse brain, we attempted to isolate them from the high-molecular-weight fraction (&gt;3 kDa) of the cytosol using diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-Sepharose CL-6B column chromatography. Surprisingly, an abundance of SSBPs were detected, and approximately half of them were tightly bound to the column and eluted in buffer containing 0–0.4 M NaCl (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10A</xref>). Although SSBPs from other proteins with iron/sulfur clusters may have also been detected, this possibility remains to be explored in future studies. Eluate corresponding to the peak concentration of SSBPs (fractions 40 to 44) was further separated using Sephacryl S-100 column chromatography (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10B</xref>), which resolved two major SSBP-related peaks. We collected eluate corresponding to the latter (fractions 40 to 43), which contained proteins with high SSBP content and a mass of approximately 13 kDa, even though its total protein concentration was low. These proteins were then separated using Blue Sepharose chromatography. While proteins that bound tightly to the Blue Sepharose resin did not contain sulfane sulfur, an SSBP that eluted in fractions 3 to 5 migrated as a single band (16 kDa) using SDS-PAGE (data not shown). This 16 kDa SSBP was confirmed to be GIF/MT-3 using nano ultra-performance LC-MS/MS (Table S4).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>MT isoforms are believed to possess a zinc/thiolate cluster characterized by strong Zn–S bonds but facile release of zinc ions occurs under oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Here, we developed a reliable assay involving prolonged (36 h) incubation with HPE-IAM at 60°C to extract sulfane sulfur from Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT-3 and isotope-dilution LC-MS/MS analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The present study provided evidence that MTs are SSBPs containing a sulfane sulfur atom on each of their 20 cysteine residues, which form a zinc/persulfide cluster. Although Capdevila et al. previously showed evidence for existence of sulfide ions in recombinant MT1, MT2, and MT4, they detected only one to four sulfide ions liberated from MTs as H<sub>2</sub>S gas using gas chromatography–flame photometric detection in strongly acidic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). These observations suggest that unlike our assay, this method is likely to underestimate the sulfane sulfur content of proteins. While our assay has difficulty detecting sulfane sulfur in oxidized polysulfide bridges such as cysteine tetrasulfide, which is supported by a recent observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>), a TCEP cleavage step enabled this problem to be overcome (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). However, FT-ICR-MALDI-TOF/MS analysis failed to detect sulfur modifications in GIF/MT-3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), suggesting that sulfur modifications in the protein were dissociated during laser desorption/ionization. Therefore, we postulate that the small amount of sulfur detected in oxidized apo-GIF/MT-3 is derived from the effect of laser desorption/ionization rather than any actual modification of the minority component.</p>
<p>Sulfane sulfur modification of MTs appears to be universal because similar sulfane sulfur contents were observed in recombinant human MT-1, MT-2, and GIF/MT-3 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). Although MTs have been mainly studied in vertebrates, their diversity and distribution have been widely reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). So far, three functional MT forms (reduced apoprotein, oxidized apoprotein, and metalated protein) are known. In this current study, we propose that sulfane sulfur is another key factor involved in regulation of MT function that may have major implications for several biological functions.</p>
<p>Oxidation of sulfane sulfur in GIF/MT-3 is a fascinating mechanism of zinc release that does not involve direct thiol oxidation. There is little doubt that zinc release from the zinc/persulfide cluster in GIF/MT-3 will be sensitive to mild oxidative stress because the p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> value of cysteine persulfide is lower than that of cysteine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). However, formation of cysteine tetrasulfides following zinc release from the oxidized GIF/MT-3 (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9D</xref>) represents a paradigm shift in GIF/MT-3 biochemistry. The sulfane sulfur atoms of MT-tetrasulfide are stably retained and can reacquire zinc after they are reduced, as shown in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9D</xref>. Tetrasulfides, whose presence in apo-GIF/MT-3 was shown (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), are presumably formed in response to structural frustration of the disulfide form, as reported for the sulfide-responsive transcriptional repressor, SqrR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). In our preliminary study, we failed to directly identify cysteine tetrasulfide during reaction of apo-GIF/MT-3 with pronase because alkaline hydrolysis of polysulfide makes it unstable in water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). We therefore speculate that cysteine tetrasulfide groups exist in an acidic local environment of apo-GIF/MT-3 and that Trx rapidly interacts with and cleaves tetrasulfide S–S bonds because of their markedly low p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> values, resulting in the regeneration of persulfide groups.</p>
<p>It is believed that the function of the sulfane sulfur moiety in proteins is to protect cysteine thiols from irreversible oxidation (e.g., to sulfinic acid and sulfonic acid) because such oxidative modifications of cysteine persulfides can be reversed by Trx-mediated reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). In other words, sulfane sulfurs act as “sacrificial” sulfur atoms. However, in this study, we discovered that sulfane sulfur has a higher affinity for zinc than thiol (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9C</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and is stored in non-sacrificial tetrasulfide groups when oxidized (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9D</xref>). As a result, tetrasulfides in oxidized-apo-GIF/MT-3 are reduced by the Trx system, with Trx being regenerated to a reduced form by NADPH and TR, thereby enabling reacquisition of zinc ions by the persulfide moiety. This suggests that the persulfide moiety in GIF/MT-3 appears to be relatively stable against Trx reduction. In contrast, Trx has been proposed to reduce the persulfide moiety of PTP1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>) and albumin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that apo-GIF/MT-3-persulfide is rapidly changed into a different conformation that is topologically resistant to Trx reduction. In other words, Trx may exhibit substrate specificity.</p>
<p>While our proposed mechanism of MT redox regulation is consistent with that proposed by Maret et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), discovery of sulfane sulfur in MTs explains unknown features of MT redox biochemistry. Maret and coworkers showed that approximately 50% of MT existed in the apo form in the rat brain, although they did not examine specific isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). A reasonable explanation for this observation is that reduced apo-MT can undergo redox-coupled reactions with oxidized proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>), leading to the formation of apo-MT-tetrasulfide, which loses its zinc ion-binding capability. GIF/MT-3 is a constitutive form predominantly expressed in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>) and protects against Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Notably, several studies have indicated that Trx acts as a protection factor in Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). Although the involvement of GIF/MT-3 and Trx in regulating this disorder has not been elucidated, Trx-mediated reduction of apo-GIF/MT-3 may lead to the reduction of unknown proteins that might suppress the onset of Alzheimer’s disease because of the high antioxidant capabilities of apo-MT persulfides. Further studies are required to identify the redox-coupled protein dynamics associated with the reduced form of apo-GIF/MT-3 and their relevance to the molecular basis of Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to perform 3D structural modeling of an SSBP with or without sulfane sulfur. Our structural modeling studies revealed that, like Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT-3, the seven zinc ions of Zn<sub>7</sub>S<sub>20</sub>GIF/MT-3 were tetrahedrally coordinated by the array of 20 sulfane sulfurs but not by cysteine thiols, thereby forming two zinc/persulfide clusters (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figs. 9A</xref> and S3, cyclohexane-like Zn<sub>3</sub>S<sub>9</sub> and bicyclononane-like Zn<sub>4</sub>S<sub>11</sub> clusters were conserved even in the presence of 20 sulfane sulfurs without affecting the overall structure of the MTs. Nevertheless, sulfane sulfur is important for both metal binding affinity and protein stability (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and thus MT function. We suggest that the 20 sulfane sulfurs are evenly distributed among 20 cysteine residues in GIF/MT-3 for the following reasons: i) zinc binding of Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT-3 was suggested to involve a C–S–S–Zn rather than Zn–S–Zn structure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>); ii) addition of two or three sulfane sulfurs to each cysteine residue in Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT-3 decreased its stability (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9C</xref>); iii) the polysulfide form of sulfane sulfur seems to have difficulty maintaining zinc/sulfur clusters in GIF/MT-3 (Fig. S6). However, one of the limitations of our study is that we did not directly obverse such zinc-persulfide cluster itself.</p>
<p>Because protein sulfuration occurs during nascent protein translation, SSBPs appear to be ubiquitous in cells. In fact, we previously reported that a variety of cellular proteins were per/poly-sulfidated, as determined using a tag-switch-tag assay. We have recently characterized several SSBPs such as GSH S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), alcohol dehydrogenase 5 (ADH5), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), ethylmalonic encephalopathy 1 (ETHE1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>), and now MT1, MT2, and GIF/MT-3. As shown in <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>, the present assay also confirmed that there are numerous SSBPs in addition to GIF/MT-3 in the cytosol of the mouse brain. Notably, 3,207 zinc-binding proteins in the human proteome have been identified with three and four zinc ligands, with 40% of the latter category consisting of Cys4 coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). Once oxidants react with thiols in a zinc finger domain, zinc is released from the coordination site, resulting in inhibition of the zinc finger protein function. However, disulfide formation in the zinc finger domain is reversed by reducing agents such as GSH. We speculate that sulfane sulfur is a key component of such a “zinc redox switch”, enabling it to provide high-affinity for zinc and protection against excess oxidative/electrophilic stress. Supporting our notion, zinc finger proteins such as tristetraprolin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>), androgen receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>), and prolyl hydroxylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>) were reported to undergo persulfidation by H<sub>2</sub>S. In this context, H<sub>2</sub>S inhibits enzymatic activity of tristetraprolin and androgen receptor, but increases enzymatic activity of prolyl hydroxylase. A possible explanation for this difference is that excess exogenous H<sub>2</sub>S may cause protein polysulfidation, thereby disturbing the native protein structure. Our findings provide structural and mechanistic insights into the role of sulfane sulfur in hold-and-release regulation of zinc ions by zinc-binding proteins. A future research goal is to investigate the universal role of sulfane sulfur atoms in redox regulation of all zinc-finger proteins.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have provided evidence that S-sulfuration based on addition of sulfane sulfur plays a central role in hold-and-release regulation of zinc by GIF/MT-3. Our study has further revealed a fascinating redox-dependent switching mechanism of a zinc/persulfide cluster involving formation of a cystine tetrasulfide bridge. The biological significance of sulfane sulfur in MTs lies in its ability to 1) contribute to metal binding affinity, 2) provide a sensing mechanism against oxidative stress, and 3) aid in the regeneration of the protein. We believe that our findings open new directions of research in redox and metals biology.</p>

The column was washed with buffer B at a flow rate of 1 mL/min, then SSBPs were eluted using 200 mL buffer B with a linear gradient of 0–0.4 M NaCl and 5 mL fractions were collected. The major SSBP-containing fractions (fractions 40–44 in <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10A</xref>) were filtered using a 3 kDa Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter unit and centrifugation at 14,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 30 min at 4°C with buffer A seven times to concentrate the protein and exchange the buffer.

Eluate containing SSBP (fractions 3–5 in <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10C</xref>) was concentrated to a volume of 0.2 mL using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter units.

Then, low-molecular-weight molecules were removed using a 3 kDa Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter unit. The resulting protein was concentrated to ≈4 mg/mL using a 5 kDa centrifugal concentrator (Vivaspin; Sartorius, Gottingen, Germany). For drop-deposition Raman spectroscopy, 0.5 μL of each protein sample was first dried onto a hydrophobic quartz coverslip for up to 15 min under vacuum. Spectra were then collected from the “coffee ring” of each drop, where proteins were found in the absence of bulk salt, using a Raman microscope system with a charge-coupled-device detector (InVia, Renishaw, New Mills, UK). Each sample was excited using a 785 nm diode laser focused through a Leica 50× (0.75 numerical aperture) short-working-distance air objective, with ≈100 mW power incident on each sample. The laser was focused onto the sample using an on-screen camera. WiRE software (v4.1, Renishaw) was used for spectral acquisition, data collection, and cosmic ray removal. The Raman system was calibrated against the 520 cm<sup>−1</sup> reference peak of silicon prior to each experiment.

The background was carefully subtracted from the spectra using blank quartz spectra, then the background-corrected spectra were smoothed using a wavelet denoising function.

HPE-AM adducts were diluted four-fold with 0.1% v/v formic acid containing known amounts of isotope-labeled internal standard (bis-S<sup>34</sup>-HPE-AM<sup>6</sup>) and the sulfane sulfur concentrations were determined using LC-ESI-MS/MS. A triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (EVOQ Qube, Bruker) coupled to an ultra-high-performance LC system (Advance, Bruker) was used to perform LC-ESI-MS/MS. Sulfane sulfur-derived bis-S-HPE-AM was separated using a YMC-Triart C<sub>18</sub> column (50 mm × 2.0 mm i.d.) at 40°C. Mobile phases A (0.1% v/v formic acid) and B (0.1% v/v formic acid in methanol) were linearly mixed at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min using a gradient system as follows: 3% B for 3 min; linear increase to 95% B over 12 min; constant 95% B for 1 min; linear decrease to 3% B. MS spectra were obtained using a heated ESI source with the following settings: spray voltage, 4000 V; cone temperature, 350°C; heated probe temperature, 250°C; cone gas flow, 25 psi; probe gas flow, 50 psi; nebulizer gas flow, 50 psi.</p>

<title>Measurement of free SH/SSH content</title>
<p>Ellman’s reagent (DTNB) was used to estimate the concentration of sulfhydryl groups in GIF/MT-3 by comparison with a standard curve of the sulfhydryl-containing compound GSH. Briefly, after removal of low-molecular-weight molecules, GIF/MT-3 protein (1 µM) was incubated with DTNB (500 µM) in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mM EDTA at room temperature for 5 min, and the absorbance at 412 nm was measured. A putative reaction scheme for DTNB with RSSH is shown in Fig S8.</p>

<p>To study the kinetics of reduction of human apo-GIF/MT-3 by Trx, 200 µL reaction mixtures containing 100 mM KPi (pH 7.5), 100 µM NADPH, 1 µg human Trx (0.5 µM), 0.7 µg rat TrxB (50 nM), and the concentrations of oxidized apo-GIF/MT-3 indicated in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref> were used. To study the reduction of human apo-MT-3 or human insulin by Trx, 200 µL reaction mixtures containing 100 mM KPi (pH 7.5), 100 µM NADPH, 1 µg human Trx (0.5 µM), 0.7 µg rat TrxB (50 nM), and the concentrations of oxidized apo-GIF/MT-3 or human insulin indicated in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref> were used. To compare the reduction of human apo-GIF/MT-3 or Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT-3 by Trx, TRP14, or TRP32, 200 µL reaction mixtures containing 100 mM KPi (pH 7.5), 100 µM NADPH, 6 µg of human Trx, TRP14, or TRP32, 1 µg of rat TrxB, and 6 µg of oxidized apo-GIF/MT-3 or Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT-3 were used (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). Reactions were performed at room temperature and NADPH oxidation was monitored by measuring the absorbance of NADP<sup>+</sup> at 340 nm. To restore sulfane sulfur in apo-GIF/MT-3 after incubation with the Trx/TR system (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>), apo-GIF/MT-3 (5 µM) was incubated with Trx (6 µM), TrxB (72 nM), and NADPH (100 µM) at 25°C for 30 min in 100 mM KPi (pH 7.5) and then with 5 mM HPE-IAM. Sulfane sulfur content in apo-GIF/MT-3 was determined using LC-ESI-MS/MS after 3 kDa filtration, with the peak intensity obtained without apo-GIF/MT-3 being subtracted from that obtained with the complete mixture.</p>

<title>Homology modeling of MT isoforms</title>
<p>Homology modeling of human GIF/MT-3 was performed using MOE software (2018.01; Chemical Computing Group ULC, 1010 Sherbrooke St. West, Suite #910, Montreal, QC, Canada, H3A 2R7, 2018). To construct a model of GIF/MT-3 (National Center for Biotechnology Information reference sequence: NP_005945.1), the crystal structure of rat MT-2 (PDB code: 4MT2) and the NMR structure of the α domain of human GIF/MT-3 (PDB code: 2F5H) were used as templates. Following the alignment of the primary structures (Fig. S3A), the sequence similarities of the templates were 67.7% and 100% compared with the β domain and α domain of GIF/MT-3, respectively. The metals in the templates were changed as desired or deleted to model apo-GIF/MT-3. To construct the GIF/MT-3 model, 100 independent models of the target protein were built using the segment-matching procedure in MOE. Refinement of the model with the lowest generalized Born/volume integral (GVBI) was achieved by energy minimization of outlier residues in Ramachandran plots generated within MOE. The final model of GIF/MT-3 exhibited a 3D structure similar to those of MT2 and the α domain of GIF/MT-3 (Fig. S3B). The same method was used to construct homology models of human MT-1A and MT-2, with rat MT-2 as the template for MT-1, and both rat MT-2 and the α domain of human MT-2 (PDB code: 1MHU) as templates for MT2 (Fig. S4).</p>

<title>Generation of sulfane sulfur-bound 3D model of MT</title>
<p>All cysteine residues in the homology model of MT were replaced with cysteine persulfide or polysulfides by performing a residue scan using the Protein Design module of MOE, and the resultant changes in metal binding affinities and complex stabilities were evaluated. The orientation of cysteine persulfide was manually modified to increase its interaction with the metals. Supplementary data file containing homology model of GIF/MT-3 with replacement of all cysteine residues by cysteine persulfide in PDB format (*.pdb) was linked to the article (Data S1).</p>

<title>Protein thermostability and metal-binding affinity scoring</title>
<p>We assessed the influence of sulfane sulfur on protein unfolding free energy using the Protein Design module of MOE, which computed a stability scoring function, ΔΔGs, based on the GBVI and weighted surface area:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="563042v3_eqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where ΔE<sub>vdw</sub> is the AMBER van der Waals interaction energy, ΔE<sub>coul</sub> is the AMBER Coulomb interaction energy, ΔE<sub>sol</sub> is the change in solvation energy calculated using the GBVI, and E<sub>SS</sub> is the change in energy due to the presence of a disulfide bond. ΔSAsc and ΔSApol are the changes in the side-chain and polar surface areas, respectively. α is a scaling factor accounting for configurational entropy effects, and ΔGsu<sup>WT→Mut</sup> is the change in stability of the unfolded states. The affinity score was also calculated using MOE software as the difference between the potential energy values of the protein, free zinc, and metal–protein complex.</p>

<title>Quantum chemistry calculations</title>
<p>Since the whole structure of the GIF/MT-3 is quite large, we divided GIF/MT-3 into two domains (α-domain and β-domain) in the quantum chemistry calculations in order to assign the observed Raman spectra. We have independently constructed α-domain and β-domain models of apo-GIF/MT-3 with disulfide bonds between neighboring cysteines or tetrasulfide bonds. These models are referred to as apo-GIF/MT-3_S2 and apo-GIF/MT-3_S4, respectively, and are shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E–H</xref>. The initial structures were taken from the results of the homology modeling by MOE (see <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>). H atoms were placed instead of Zn-S bonds in the models. To consider apo-GIF/MT-3 models, the nearest S atoms are supposed to form disulfide or tetrasulfide bond. The Raman spectra were computed by frequency calculation. All quantum chemical calculations were carried out at B3LYP/6-31G(d) level by GAUSSIAN16 (Revision C.01, Gaussian, Inc., Wallingford CT, 2016). After obtaining the Raman spectra for the α- and β-domains, these spectra are summed to obtain the Raman spectra of the apo-GIF/MT-3 as illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>. The corresponding Zn-binding models were constructed and evaluated the Raman spectra with the same manner.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> work provides <bold>solid</bold> evidence that a neuronal metallothionein, GIF/MT-3, incorporates metal-persulfide clusters. A variety of well-designed assays support the authors' hypothesis, revealing that sulfane sulfur is released from MT-3. However, the sufane sulfur content in the canonical induced MT-1 and MT-2 has not been demonstrated. Thus, the biological role of the persulfidated form is not yet clearly defined. There are caveats to the findings that limit the study, but the work will nevertheless prompt major follow-up work.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors reveal that GIF/MT-3 regulates the zinc homeostasis depending on the cellular redox status. The manuscript technically sounds, and their data concretely suggest that the recombinant MTs, not only GIF/MT-3 but also canonical MTs such as MT-1 and MT-2, contain sulfane sulfur atoms for the Zn-binding. The scenario proposed by the authors seems to be reasonable to explain the Zn homeostasis by the cellular redox balance.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The data presented in the manuscript solidly reveal that recombinant GIF/MT-3 contains sulfane sulfur.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>It remains unclear whether native MTs, in particular induced MTs in vivo contain sulfane sulfur or not.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>Although the authors have revealed the sulfane sulfur content in native MT-3, my question, namely, whether canonical MT-1 and MT-2 contained sulfane sulfur after the induction has been left.</p>
<p>
The authors argue that the biological significance of sulfane sulfur in MTs lies in its ability to contribute to metal binding affinity, provide a sensing mechanism against oxidative stress, and aid in the regulation of the protein. Due to their biological roles, induced MT-1 and MT-2 could contain sulfane sulfur in their molecules. Thus, I expect the authors to evaluate or explain the sulfane sulfur content in induced MT-1 and MT-2.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors were trying to show that a novel neuronal metallothionein of poorly defined function, GIF/MT3, is actually heavily persulfidated in both the Zn-bound and apo (metal-free) forms of the molecule as purified from a heterologous (bacterial) or native host. Evidence in support of this conclusion is strong, with both spectroscopic and mass spectrometry evidence strongly consistent with this general conclusion. The authors would appear to have achieved their aims.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The analytical data in support of the author's primary conclusions are strong. The authors also provide some modeling evidence that supports the contention that MT3 (and other MTs) can readily accommodate a sulfane sulfur on each of the 20 cysteines in the Zn-bound structure, with little perturbation of the overall structure. This is not the case with Cys trisulfides, which suggests that the persulfide-metallated state is clearly positioned at lower energy relative to the immediately adjacent thiolate- or trisulfidated metal coordination complexes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The biological significance of the findings is not entirely clear. On the one hand, the analytical data are solid (albeit using a protein derived from a bacterial over-expression experiment), and yes, it's true that sulfane S can protect Cys from overoxidation, but everything shown in the summary figure (Fig. 9D) can be done with Zn release from a thiol by ROS, and subsequent reduction by the Trx/TR system. In addition, it's long been known that Zn itself can protect Cys from oxidation. I view this as a minor shortcoming that will motivate follow-up studies.</p>
<p>Impact:</p>
<p>The impact will be high since the finding is potentially disruptive to the MT field for sure. The sulfane sulfur counting experiment (the HPE-IAM electrophile trapping experiment) may well be widely adopted by the field. Those in the metals field always knew that this was a possibility, and it will interesting to see the extent to which metal binding thiolates broadly incorporate sulfane sulfur into their first coordination shells.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The revised manuscript is only slightly changed from the original, with the inclusion of a supplementary figure (Fig. S2) and minor changes in the text. The authors did not choose to carry out the quantitative Zn binding experiment (which I really wanted to see), but given the complexities of the experiment, I'll let it go.</p>

<p>Thank you for your valuable comments. In this study, we were not able to examine the role of sulfane sulfur in the induced forms of MT-1 and MT-2. However, this topic is undoubtedly important and intriguing; therefore, we will continue to explore it in future studies.</p>

<p>Fig. 9: the authors imply in the mechanistic &quot;redox-switch&quot; figure that Trx/TR can not reduce persulfide linkages. A number of groups have shown this to be the case. I recommend modifying the figure legend or text to make this clear to the reader.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your understanding. Regarding the &quot;redox-switch&quot; figure, although some groups have demonstrated the ability of Trx to reduce persulfide moieties, as you pointed out, we have addressed this discrepancy in the Discussion section as follows (lines 357-361): “In contrast, Trx has been proposed to reduce the persulfide moiety of PTP1B (37) and albumin (38, 39). A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that apo-GIF/MT-3-persulfide is rapidly changed into a different conformation that is topologically resistant to Trx reduction. In other words, Trx may exhibit substrate specificity.” Additionally, we have inserted the following sentence just before the above discussion to further clarify this point:“This suggests that the persulfide moiety in GIF/MT-3 appears to be relatively stable against Trx reduction.”</p>
