<title>Abstract</title><p>Ferroptosis is a distinct iron-dependent programmed cell death and plays important roles in tumor suppression. However, the regulatory mechanisms of ferroptosis need further exploration. RUNT-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), a transcription factor, is essential for osteogenesis. RUNX2 has two types of transcripts produced by two alternative promoters. In the present study, we surprisingly find that RUNX2 isoform II is a novel ferroptosis suppressor. RUNX2 isoform II can bind to the promoter of peroxiredoxin-2 (<italic>PRDX2</italic>), a ferroptosis inhibitor, and activate its expression. Knockdown of RUNX2 isoform II suppresses cell proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic> and tumorigenesis <italic>in vivo</italic> in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Interestingly, homeobox A10 (HOXA10), an upstream positive regulator of RUNX2 isoform II, is required for the inhibition of ferroptosis through the RUNX2 isoform II/PRDX2 pathway. Consistently, RUNX2 isoform II is overexpressed in OSCC, and associated with OSCC progression and poor prognosis. Collectively, OSCC cancer cells can up-regulate RUNX2 isoform II to inhibit ferroptosis and facilitate tumorigenesis through the novel HOXA10/RUNX2 isoform II/PRDX2 pathway.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ferroptosis, a form of non-apoptotic programmed cell death, is an iron-dependent death and is characterized by the accumulation of lipid peroxidation and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>). Ferroptosis has sparked great interest as targeting ferroptosis might provide new therapeutic opportunities in treating cancers. Emerging evidence indicates that ferroptosis may function as a potent tumor suppressor in the progression of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Li, Jin, Zhang, Ma, &amp; Yang, 2022</xref>; T. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lu et al., 2022</xref>), including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Sun et al., 2022</xref>; J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Yang, Cao, Luan, &amp; Huang, 2021</xref>). Furthermore, triggering ferroptosis can overcome OSCC-acquired drug resistance such as cisplatin-induced resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Han, Li, &amp; Wu, 2022</xref>). Therefore, the induction of ferroptosis is an attractive strategy for OSCC therapy. Multiple extrinsic or intrinsic pathways regulate the ferroptotic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Tang &amp; Kroemer, 2020</xref>). The extrinsic pathways are initiated by the inhibition of cell membrane transporters such as the cystine/glutamate transporter system xc<sup>-</sup> or by the activation of the iron transporters transferrin (TF) and lactotransferrin (LTF). The intrinsic pathway is activated by the blockade of intracellular antioxidant enzymes like glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Although the principal regulatory mechanisms of ferroptosis have been explored in the past few years, other potential molecular mechanisms remain to be uncovered.</p>
<p>The RUNT-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), a member of the RUNT-related transcription factor family, is critical for osteogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bruderer, Richards, Alini, &amp; Stoddart, 2014</xref>), and has been extensively studied in the development of bone and tooth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Wen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ziros, Basdra, &amp; Papavassiliou, 2008</xref>). Previous studies revealed that RUNX2 promotes cancer metastasis and invasion in a variety of cancers, including breast cancer (C. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Chang et al., 2014</xref>), thyroid cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Sancisi et al., 2012</xref>), colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ji et al., 2019</xref>), prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akech et al., 2010</xref>), lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Herreno et al., 2019</xref>) and HNSCC (W. M. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chang et al., 2016</xref>). However, the potential roles of RUNX2 in other aspects of tumorigenesis remain largely unclear. <italic>RUNX2</italic> gene is composed of two promoters that in turn generate two types of isoforms, isoform II derived from promoter 1 (P1) and isoform I from promoter 2 (P2). These isoforms contain distinct N-terminal sequences. Whether these isoforms play distinct roles in tumorigenesis remains unknown.</p>
<p>OSCC is one of the most common malignant cancers in the world, especially in areas with low Human Development Index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Sung et al., 2021</xref>). The treatment of OSCC has progressed over time from surgery alone to comprehensive series of therapies including radiation, chemotherapy and immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chi, Day, &amp; Neville, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kang, Kiess, &amp; Chung, 2015</xref>). Despite a lot of advances in treatment modalities, the five-year overall survival rate is around 50-60% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Jawert et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, it is still challenging to improve the therapy of OSCC.</p>
<p>In this study, to have a well-defined understanding of the relationship between RUNX2 isoform II and ferroptosis, we examined the effects of isoform II-knockdown or -overexpression on total ROS levels and lipid peroxidation, and the effects of isoform II-knockdown on mitochondrial morphology in OSCC cells. And mechanically, peroxiredoxin-2 (PRDX2), a ferroptosis suppressor, was identified to be a target gene of RUNX2 isoform II. Meanwhile, we analyzed the effect of RUNX2 isoform II overexpression or knockdown on OSCC cell ferroptosis, cell proliferation and tumor growth.</p>

<title>RUNX2 isoform II is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis in OSCC</title>
<p>Given that the expression levels as well as the functions of RUNX2 isoforms (isoform I and II) produced by two alternative promoters (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) in tumors are unclear, we explored their expression and roles in OSCC in this study. The expression levels of total RUNX2 were slightly higher in TCGA OSCC tissues than those in normal controls, but there was no statistically significant difference (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). However, isoform I and II were significantly differently expressed in OSCC. The expression levels of isoform II (indicated by PSI, percent-splice-in, the usage of exon 1.1 in total RUNX2 transcripts) in OSCC patients were 1.46-fold significantly higher than those in normal controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, the expression levels of isoform I were lower than those in normal controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Moreover, patients with clinical stage I, II, and III showed lower levels of isoform II compared with those with stage IV (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Patients with higher isoform II showed significantly shorter overall survival (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). These evidences suggested that isoform II was highly expressed in OSCC tissues and positively correlated with the progression of OSCC.</p>

<p>Consistently, the expression levels of isoform II were also significantly upregulated in breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) (Figure 1-figure supplement 1A), colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) (Figure 1-figure supplement 1B), prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) (Figure 1-figure supplement 1C), and stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) (Figure 1-figure supplement 1D) patients of TCGA database, suggesting that isoform II might play extensive roles in multiple cancers.</p>
<p>To verify the results from TCGA, we analyzed the expression levels of RUNX2 isoforms in 11 OSCC tissues and adjacent normal controls by RT-PCR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). As expected, the ratios of isoform II vs I and the expression levels of isoform II were also significantly higher in these OSCC tissues than those in adjacent normal tissues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">I</xref>). These results suggested that RUNX2 isoform II may play important roles in OSCC.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>RUNX2 isoform II is required for OSCC cell proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic> and tumorigenesis <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>Then, we explored the roles of RUNX2 isoform II in OSCC cells. Overexpression of either FLAG tagged isoform II significantly promoted the proliferation of OSCC cells, CAL 27 and SCC-9 cell lines (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Interestingly, isoform II overexpression showed enhanced cell proliferation compared with isoform I overexpression in OSCC cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Consistently, knockdown of isoform II significantly inhibited cell proliferation in both cell lines (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">D</xref>), as well as colony formation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Cells with isoform II-knockdown showed significantly higher apoptosis than those control cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). However, the overexpression of isoform II or isoform I had no obvious effect on the cellular apoptosis of OSCC (Figure 2-figure supplement 1). Importantly, CAL 27 cells stably transfected with shRNA against isoform II showed significantly reduced tumor growth and weight than those transfected with non-specific control shRNA in nude mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G-J</xref>). These results suggested that RUNX2 isoform II is required for the proliferation and tumorigenicity of OSCC cells.</p>

<title>RUNX2 isoform II suppresses ferroptosis</title>
<p>Next, we explored how RUNX2 isoform II enhanced the proliferation of OSCC cells. Ferroptosis is an important form of programmed cell death and plays an important role in the suppression of tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ouyang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Wei et al., 2021</xref>). We found that OSCC tissues had positive 4-hydroxynonenalince (4-HNE, a metabolite of lipid peroxidation) staining in variant levels, suggesting that ferroptosis might be present in OSCC tissues (Figure 3-figure supplement 1A). Ferroptosis is characterized by the accumulation of lipid peroxidation and ROS. We found that isoform II-knockdown significantly enhanced total ROS production (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) and lipid peroxidation accumulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>) in CAL 27 and SCC-9 cells. Consistently, isoform II overexpression suppressed ROS production (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>) and lipid peroxidation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>) in these cells. In addition, we found that isoform II-knockdown induced shrunken mitochondria with vanished cristae with transmission electron microscopy (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). These results suggest that RUNX2 isoform II may suppress ferroptosis. To further figure out the relationship between isoform II and different types of cell death, especially ferroptosis, we performed the rescue experiments with some inhibitors of cell death including ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1, a ferroptosis inhibitor), Z-VAD (an apoptosis inhibitor) and necrostatin-1 (Nec-1, a necroptosis inhibitor) upon isoform II-knockdown. As expected, Fer-1 treatment partially rescued the reduction of cell proliferation caused by isoform II-knockdown (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref> and Figure 3-figure supplement 2A). We also found that Z-VAD and Nec-1 could partially rescue the reduction of cell proliferation caused by isoform II-knockdown (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref> and Figure 3-figure supplement 2B) and Z-VAD also could partially decrease apoptosis induced by isoform II-knockdown (Figure 3-figure supplement 3), which suggested that both apoptosis and necroptosis were also involved in the cell death caused by RUNX2 isoform II-knockdown. Fer-1 treatment reduced the increased levels of ROS production (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>) and lipid peroxidation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>) caused by isoform II-knockdown. RSL3, a ferroptosis activator, could cause cell death in CAL 27 and SCC-9 cells (Figure 3-figure supplement 4A), and increase the production of cellular ROS (Figure 3-figure supplement 4B) and lipid peroxidation (Figure 3-figure supplement 4C). As expected, overexpression of isoform II could partially reduce the increased levels of ROS production (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>) and lipid peroxidation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>) caused by RSL3. Consistently, tumors formed by CAL 27 cells with isoform II-knockdown showed a significantly increased staining of 4-HNE compared with the control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3L</xref>). In summary, these results suggested that RUNX2 isoform II can suppress ferroptosis in OSCC cells.</p>

<title>RUNX2 isoform II promotes the expression of PRDX2</title>
<p>To understand the regulatory mechanisms of how RUNX2 isoform II suppresses ferroptosis, we screened some ferroptosis-suppressive genes including several antioxidant enzymes in CAL 27 treated with isoform II siRNAs. <italic>PRDX2</italic> is the most significantly down-regulated gene upon isoform II-knockdown in CAL 27 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Furthermore, both mRNA and protein expression levels of PRDX2 were reduced in CAL 27 and SCC-9 cells with isoform II-knockdown (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). Consistently, tumors formed by CAL 27 cells with isoform II-knockdown also showed a significantly reduced expression of PRDX2 compared with the control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Isoform II overexpression increased PRDX2 mRNA and protein expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). Whereas, isoform I overexpression has no significant effect on PRDX2 expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). These results indicated that PRDX2 was a target of RUNX2 isoform II. One of the important characteristics of ferroptosis is the imbalance in iron homeostasis, and iron transporter transferrin receptor (TFRC) has an important role in maintaining iron homeostasis. We found that RUNX2 isoform II-knockdown in OSCC cells had no obvious effect on the expression of TFRC (Figure 4-figure supplement 1A and B). And the expression level and localization of TFRC did not change in the tumors formed by CAL 27 with or without isoform II-knockdown (Figure 4-figure supplement 1C). These results indicated that RUNX2 isoform II might not regulate the cellular transport of iron.</p>

<p>To explore the regulatory mechanisms of how RUNX2 isoform II promotes PRDX2 expression, we applied the JASPAR to predict possible binding sites of RUNX2 on the <italic>PRDX2</italic> promoter. We analyzed 0-2440 bp upstream regions of the <italic>PRDX2</italic> transcription start site and found 6 potential binding sites for RUNX2 on the <italic>PRDX2</italic> promoter (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>).

<p>To further verify whether PRDX2 mediated the effect of isoform II on ferroptosis, we stably overexpressed FLAG-tagged PRDX2 in CAL 27 cells.

<title>HOXA10 is required for RUNX2 isoform II expression and cell proliferation in OSCC</title>
<p>Next, we tried to understand the molecular mechanism of RUNX2 isoform II overexpression in OSCC cells. HOXA10 is an oncogenic transcription factor (L. M. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Guo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Song et al., 2019</xref>). Mouse Hoxa10 has been reported to bind to Runx2 P1 promoter and then activate Runx2 isoform II expression in mouse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hassan et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, we speculated that RUNX2 isoform II overexpression in OSCC may be also caused by HOXA10. Indeed, HOXA10 knockdown significantly reduced isoform II expression in both CAL 27 and SCC-9 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), whereas isoform I expression was not significantly affected (Figure 5-figure supplement 1A). In line with the function of isoform II in OSCC cells, HOXA10 knockdown also significantly suppressed cell proliferation and colony formation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">C</xref>), and increased cellular apoptosis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). The expression levels of HOXA10 in TCGA OSCC patients were also significantly higher than those in normal controls (Figure 5-figure supplement 1B). Consistently, the expression levels of isoform II were positively correlated with HOXA10 expression levels in TCGA OSCC patients (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). These results suggested that HOXA10 can promote RUNX2 isoform II expression.</p>

<title>HOXA10 inhibits ferroptosis through RUNX2 isoform II</title>
<p>Since RUNX2 isoform II was a ferroptosis suppressor, we speculated that HOXA10 could act as a ferroptosis inhibitor through upregulating the expression of isoform II. We found that the expression levels of PRDX2 mRNA and protein significantly decreased in parallel with the reduction in isoform II expression caused by HOXA10 knockdown (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Importantly, HOXA10 knockdown increased cellular ROS production (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>) and lipid peroxidation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>) in CAL 27 and SCC-9 cells. Moreover, Fer-1, a ferroptosis inhibitor, could partially rescue the retarded cell proliferation caused by HOXA10 knockdown (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref> and Figure 6-figure supplement 1A). We also found that Z-VAD (an apoptosis inhibitor) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref> and Figure 6-figure supplement 1B), Nec-1 (a necroptosis inhibitor) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref> and Figure 6-figure supplement 1B) could partially rescue the reduction of cell proliferation, and Z-VAD could also partially rescue the elevated apoptosis induced by HOXA10 knockdown (Figure 6-figure supplement 2). Fer-1 could partially decrease the cellular ROS levels (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>) and lipid peroxidation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>) caused by HOX10-knockdown.

<label>3.</label><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Ferroptosis is a new form of programmed cell death and is caused by massive lipid peroxidation-mediated membrane damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Stockwell et al., 2017</xref>). Emerging evidence has proved that ferroptosis contributes to the suppression of tumor progression. p53 could suppress the transcription of amino acid antiporter solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLCA711) to sensitize cells to ferroptosis, which may contribute to the anti-tumor role of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>). Tumor inhibition by BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) could be achieved in part by inhibiting SLC7A11 and thereby promoting ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). In HNSCC, Inhibition of xCT could suppress cell proliferation by inducing ferroptosis (M. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Li et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, caveolin-1 (CAV-1) also could promote HNSCC progression through inhibiting ferroptosis (T. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lu et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, enhancing ferroptosis could be an attractive strategy for OSCC treatment. In this study, we discovered a novel ferroptosis suppressor, RUNX2 isoform II, in OSCC. Isoform II overexpression or knockdown inhibited or promoted OSCC cell ferroptosis by decreasing or increasing total ROS levels and lipid peroxidation, respectively. One of the characteristics of ferroptosis is elevated cellular ROS levels, thus ferroptosis can be modulated by antioxidants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Tang, Chen, Kang, &amp; Kroemer, 2021</xref>). For example, peroxiredoxin-6 (PRDX6) is a negative regulator of ferroptosis (B. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lu et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, we identified a new target gene for isoform II, the ferroptosis suppressor PRDX2. PRDX2 is a typical 2-Cys antioxidant enzyme belonging to the peroxiredoxin family and plays an important role in scavenging ROS levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">De Franceschi et al., 2011</xref>) through consuming H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (W. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lu et al., 2014</xref>). We found that isoform II overexpression or knockdown promoted or suppressed PRDX2 expression, respectively. Moreover, isoform II could specifically bind to the promoter of <italic>PRDX2</italic> and then transactivate the PRDX2 expression, thereby inhibiting OSCC cell ferroptosis.</p>
<p>In this study, we also found that RUNX2 isoform II was overexpressed in OSCC tissues and was associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. In the past years, it has been reported that RUNX2 was overexpressed in tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akech et al., 2010</xref>; Z. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Guo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hong et al., 2020</xref>). Chang et al. demonstrated that RUNX2 was overexpressed in HNSCC samples (W. M. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chang et al., 2017</xref>) and could serve as a poor prognostic marker in HNSCC (W. M. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chang et al., 2016</xref>). However, only a few articles have addressed the expression levels of isoforms. For example, isoform I is the major variant in papillary thyroid carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Sancisi et al., 2012</xref>), and isoform II is highly expressed in non-small cell lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Herreno et al., 2019</xref>). However, the expression levels of isoforms in OSCC are unknown. Surprisingly, our results showed that there was no statistically significant difference in expression levels of total RUNX2 between OSCC patients and normal controls from the TCGA database. Interestingly, we discovered that the expression levels of isoform I were lower in TCGA OSCC patients than in normal tissues, while the expression levels of isoform II were overexpressed in TCGA OSCC tissues. Furthermore, we proved with clinical samples that the relative expression levels of isoform II were higher in OSCC tissues than those in normal tissues.</p>
<p>Next, we uncovered the underlying mechanisms of RUNX2 isoform II to improve proliferation in OSCC cell lines. In the past, it has been reported that overexpression or knockdown of total RUNX2 in HNSCC cell lines could promote or inhibit cell proliferation, respectively (W. M. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chang et al., 2017</xref>). In this study, we found that isoform II overexpression or specific isoform II-knockdown could promote or suppress OSCC cell proliferation, respectively. In addition, we also demonstrated that isoform II was required for <italic>in vivo</italic> OSCC tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>Subsequently, we discovered that HOXA10 knockdown inhibited the expression of RUNX2 isoform II and led to ferroptosis. HOXA10, a transcription factor, plays an important role in tumor progression (J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Song et al., 2019</xref>). HOXA10 was reported to transactivate Runx2 P1 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hassan et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, we found that the relative expression levels of HOXA10 were positively associated with the expression levels of isoform II in OSCC patients from TCGA and HOXA10 knockdown led to the downregulation of isoform II in OSCC cells. It has been demonstrated that HOXA10 knockdown suppressed cell proliferation and enhanced apoptosis in Fadu cells (L. M. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Guo et al., 2018</xref>). We found that HOXA10 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and promoted cellular apoptosis in CAL 27 and SCC-9. Interestingly, we discovered that HOXA10 knockdown induced ferroptosis through suppressing RUNX2 isoform II and PRDX2 expression, which suggested a new regulatory pathway of anti-ferroptosis.</p>
<p>In summary, we identified RUNX2 isoform II as a novel ferroptosis inhibitor in OSCC cells by transactivating PRDX2 expression. RUNX2 isoform II plays oncogenic roles in OSCC. Moreover, we also found that HOXA10 is an upstream regulator of RUNX2 isoform II and is required for suppressing ferroptosis through RUNX2 isoform II and PRDX2. Our results suggest a new regulatory mechanism of ferroptosis through HOXA10/RUNX2 isoform II/PRDX2 pathway (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7I</xref>) and may provide the novel diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for OSCC.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this paper, authors investigated the role of RUNT-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) in oral squamous carcinoma (OSCC) growth and resistance to ferroptosis. They found that RUNX2 suppresses ferroptosis through transcriptional regulation of peroxiredoxin-2. They further explored the upstream positive regulator of RUNX2, HOXA10 and found that HOXA10/RUNX2/PRDX2 axis protects OSCC from ferroptosis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The study is well designed and provides a novel mechanism of HOXA10/RUNX2/PRDX2 control of ferroptosis in OSCC.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>According to the data presented in (Figure 2F, Figure 3Fand G, Figure 5D and Figure 6E and F), apoptosis seems to be affected in the same amount as ferroptosis by HOXA10/RUNX2/PRDX2 axis, which raises questions on the authors' specific focus on ferroptosis in this study. Reasonably, authors should adapt the title and the abstract in a way that recapitulates the whole data, which is HOXA10/RUNX2/PRDX2 axis control of cell death, including ferroptosis and apoptosis in OSCC.</p>
<p>Comments:</p>
<p>- In the description of the result section related to Figure 3E, the author wrote &quot;In addition, we found that isoform II-knockdown induced shrunken mitochondria with vanished cristae with transmission electron microscopy (Figure 3E). These results suggest that RUNX2 isoform II may suppress ferroptosis.&quot; The interpretation provided here is not clear to the reviewer. How shrunken mitochondria and vanished cristae can be linked to ferroptosis?</p>
<p>
- The electron microscopy images show more elongated mitochondria in the RUNX2 isoform II-KO cells than in RUNX2 isoform II positive cells, which might result from the fusion of mitochondria. These images should completed with a fluorescent mitochondria staining of these cells.</p>
<p>
- What is the oxygen consumption rate in RUNX2 KO cells?</p>
<p>
- The increase in cell proliferation after RUNX2 overexpression in Figure 2A is not convincing, is there any differences in their migration or invasion capacity?</p>
<p>
- The in vivo study shows 50% reduction in primary tumor growth after RUNX2 inhibition by shRNA in CAL 27 xenografts, but only one shRNA is shown. Is this one shRNA clone? At least 2 shRNA clones should be used.</p>
<p>
- Apoptosis and necroptosis seem to be affected in the same amount as ferroptosis by HOXA10/RUNX2/PRDX2 axis. This is evident from experiments in Figure 3E, F and from Figure 6E, F and Figure 3G. Either Fer-1, Z-VAD,or Nec-1 used alone, were not able to fully restore cell proliferation to control cell level, which implies an additive effect of ferroptosis, apoptosis and necrosis. The author should verify potential additive or synergistic effect of the combination of Fer-1 and Z-VAD in these assays after si-RUNX2 in Figure 3 F and G and after si-HOX assays.</p>
<p>
- What is the effect of PRDX2 or HOXA10 depletion on tumor growth?</p>
<p>
- What is the clinical relevance of HOXA10 in OSCC patients?</p>

<p>This paper reports the role of the Isoform II of RUNX2 in activating PRDX2 expression to suppress ferroptosis in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).</p>
<p>
The following major issues should be addressed.</p>
<p>A major postulate of this study is the specific role of RUNX2 isoform II compared to isoform I.</p>
<p>Figure 1F shows association between patient survival and Iso II expression, but nothing is shown for Iso I, this should be added, in addition the number of patients at risk in each category should be shown.</p>
<p>
The authors test Iso I and Iso II overexpression in CAL27 or SCC-9 model cell lines. In Fig. 2A in CAL27, the overexpression of Iso II is much stronger than Iso I so it seems premature to draw any conclusions. More importantly, however, no Iso I silencing is shown in either of the cell lines nor the xenografted tumours. This is absolutely essential for the authors hypothesis and should be tested using shRNA in cells and xenografted tumours.</p>
<p>A major conclusion of this study is that Iso II expression suppresses ferroptosis. To support this idea, the authors use the inhibitor Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1). While Fer-1 typically does not lead to a 100% rescue, here the effect is only marginal and as shown in Figures 3F and G only marginally better than Z-VAD or Necrostatin 1. These data do not support the idea that the major cause of cell death is ferroptosis. Instead, Iso II silencing leads to cell death through different pathways. The authors should acknowledge this and rephrase the conclusion of the paper accordingly.</p>
<p>
Moreover, the authors consistently confound cell proliferation with cell death.</p>
<p>In Fig. 4A the authors investigate GPX1 expression, whereas GPX4 is often the key ferroprosis regulator, this has to be tested. This is important as the authors also test the effect of the GPX4 inhibitor RSL3, however, the authors do not determine IC50 values of the different cell lines with or without Iso II overexpression or silencing or compared to other RSL3 sensitive or resistant cells. Without this information, no conclusions can be drawn.</p>
<p>In summary, while the authors show that RUNX2 Iso II expression enhances cell survival, the idea that cell death is principally via ferroptosis is not fully established by the data. The authors should modify their conclusions accordingly.</p>
