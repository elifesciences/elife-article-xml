<title>Summary</title><p>Ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) are key for regulating protein function and turnover via ubiquitination but it remains undetermined which E2s maintain proteostasis during aging. Here, we find that E2s have diverse roles in handling a model aggregation-prone protein (huntingtin-polyQ) in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> retina: while some E2s mediate aggregate assembly, UBE2D/effete (eff) and other E2s are required for huntingtin-polyQ degradation. UBE2D/eff is key for proteostasis also in skeletal muscle: eff protein levels decline with aging, and muscle-specific eff knockdown causes an accelerated buildup in insoluble poly-ubiquitinated proteins (which progressively accumulate with aging) and shortens lifespan. Transgenic expression of human UBE2D2, homologous to eff, partially rescues the lifespan and proteostasis deficits caused by muscle-specific eff<sup>RNAi</sup> by re-establishing the physiological levels of eff<sup>RNAi</sup>-regulated proteins, which include several regulators of proteostasis. Interestingly, UBE2D/eff knockdown in young age reproduces part of the proteomic changes that normally occur in old muscles, suggesting that the decrease in UBE2D/eff protein levels that occurs with aging contributes to reshaping the composition of the muscle proteome. Altogether, these findings indicate that UBE2D/eff is a key E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that ensures protein quality control and helps maintain a youthful proteome composition during aging.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Protein degradation regulates many cellular functions, and its derangement is the underlying cause of many human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Most proteins are regulated via degradation to ensure dynamic adjustments in their concentrations in response to cellular challenges and to maintain physiologic homeostasis. Moreover, damaged and misfolded proteins are degraded to avoid toxicity caused by their interaction with native proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Because of these important functions, protein degradation is tightly controlled. In most cell types, the ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS) is responsible for most of the protein degradation in the nucleus and cytoplasm whereas the autophagy/lysosome system degrades cellular organelles, protein aggregates, and long-lived proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). In addition, several proteases and peptidases cooperate with the proteasome and autophagy in degrading target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>).</p>
<p>To route proteins for degradation, the UPS relies on ubiquitination, a post-translational modification that also regulates protein function and localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Through the concerted actions of a single ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ∼35 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s), and ∼620 E3 ubiquitin ligases, the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) orchestrates the specific poly-ubiquitination of protein substrates in humans, which can lead to their degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Depending on the ubiquitin lysine residue employed to build poly-ubiquitin chains, poly-ubiquitinated proteins can be preferentially degraded by the proteasome or by the autophagy-lysosome system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). E2s have a pivotal role in the ubiquitination cascade and direct the recruitment of E3 ubiquitin ligases and target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to regulating normal protein turnover, E2s can also ensure proteostasis. For example, the E2 enzyme UBE2B and its associated E3 ligase UBR4 have been found to regulate muscle protein quality during aging in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). The capacity of E2s to maintain proteostasis may derive from their capacity to guide the ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of misfolded and aggregation-prone proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>) and to trigger autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Moreover, because some E2s are physically associated with the proteasome, it has been proposed that they may directly regulate its proteolytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). For example, the E2 enzymes Ubc1/2/4/5 interact with the proteasome and this association further increases with heat stress in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>), a condition where proteasome function is modulated by ubiquitination of proteasome components, such as Rpn13, mediated by the proteasome-associated E3 UBE3C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). While E2s may regulate proteostasis via several mechanisms, it remains largely undetermined which E2s are crucial for maintaining protein quality control during aging.</p>
<p>Here, we have utilized a model aggregation-prone protein (GFP-tagged pathogenic huntingtin, Htt-polyQ-GFP) expressed in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> retina to test the impact of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes on proteostasis. In addition, we have similarly tested a set of E3 ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) that were identified by mapping the E2 interactome in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). These analyses reveal diverse functions of E2s and associated enzymes in proteostasis. Contrary to the expectation that E2s may generally promote the proteasomal degradation of Htt-polyQ and hence reduce Htt-polyQ levels, we find that the knockdown of several E2s has the opposite effect, i.e. it decreases Htt-polyQ aggregates.</p>
<p>Knockdown of the E2 enzyme effete (eff), homologous to human UBE2D1/2/3/4 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, is one of the relatively few RNAi interventions that increase the amount of Htt-polyQ aggregates, and we find that this is due to an impediment in Htt-polyQ protein degradation. Consistent with a prevalent role of UBE2D/eff in proteostasis across aging tissues in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we find that UBE2D/eff protein levels significantly decline during aging in skeletal muscle, and that muscle-specific eff knockdown increases the age-associated accumulation of insoluble poly-ubiquitinated proteins and reduces lifespan. Interestingly, the proteostasis deficits caused by UBE2D/eff knockdown are partially rescued by transgenic expression of one of its human homologs, UBE2D2, suggesting that UBE2D ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes have evolutionary conserved roles in maintaining protein quality control during aging. Altogether, our study identifies diverse roles for E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes in handling aggregation-prone proteins and managing proteostasis, and that UBE2D/eff is key for ensuring protein quality control during aging.</p>

<title>Diverse roles of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes in the disposal of pathogenic huntingtin</title>
<p>Huntington disease (HD) is caused by pathogenic huntingtin with polyQ tract expansion (Htt-polyQ), a toxic, aggregation-prone protein that induces neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Previous studies have shown that ubiquitination is a conserved regulator of polyglutamine aggregation and that E2 loss can both increase and decrease the size and number of Htt-polyQ aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). However, as for other analyses of E2 function, a complete understanding of the role of E2s in polyglutamine aggregation is missing.</p>
<p>The fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> is an ideal model for studying the mechanisms of Htt-polyQ protein degradation. GFP-tagged Htt-polyQ72 can be expressed in the fly retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>) and fluorescent Htt-polyQ-GFP aggregates can be visualized from intact animals over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). In particular, the fly retina is a convenient tissue to examine Htt-polyQ because this tissue is dispensable for fly survival. With this model, it was previously found that there is an age-dependent increase in the amount of Htt-polyQ72 protein aggregates, which reflects the overall age dependency of HD phenotypes also observed in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>).</p>
<p>To test whether E2s regulate Htt-polyQ-GFP aggregation during aging, multiple RNAi lines were utilized to target each of the 21 <italic>Drosophila</italic> E2s. For these studies, transgenic RNAi was driven in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> retina with the UAS/Gal4 system and GMR-Gal4, concomitantly with Htt-polyQ-GFP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). After 30 days at 29°C, the total area of Htt-Q72-GFP fluorescent aggregates was scored with CellProfiler and compared to control RNAi interventions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-C</xref> and Supplementary Table 1). Overall, there was a trend towards decreased aggregate area upon knockdown of several E2s, including the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologs of UBE2F/M, UBE2I, UBE2QL1, and UBE2Z, suggesting that these E2s may be required for ubiquitination-dependent aggregation of Htt-polyQ-GFP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-B</xref>). Analyses of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) and E3 ubiquitin ligases identified from mapping the E2 interactome in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>) indicate that RNAi for these interactors yields overall similar phenotypes as those found by knocking down the interacting E2s (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-C</xref>). For example, RNAi for E3s and DUBs that interact with Ubc10 (UBE2L3) and CG7656 (UBE2R1/2) reduce the area of Htt-polyQ-GFP aggregates, as found for knockdown of these E2s (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). The decreased polyglutamine aggregation that is observed upon E2 RNAi may indicate that E2-mediated ubiquitination is required for Htt aggregate formation. Consistent with this model, it was previously reported that K48 linkage-specific ubiquitination drives Htt degradation by the proteasome whereas K63 ubiquitination promotes Htt aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Our comprehensive analysis now highlights the differential effects of distinct E2s on Htt disposal and suggests that this may occur because of the specificity in the E3s and DUBs interacting with each E2.</p>

Specifically, RNAi for Ubc6 (homologous of UBE2A/B) and for its associated E3 ubiquitin ligases Ubr4 and Kcmf1 increases the amount of Htt-polyQ72-GFP protein aggregates. Similar increases are also seen with knockdown of eff/UBE2D and the associated E3 HUWE1, and with RNAi for Ubc10/UBE2L3, Ubc84D/UBE2L6, and for the associated E3 enzyme BTBD8. Positive controls include Akt RNAi, which reduces protein aggregates, and Hsp83 RNAi, which increases them.

<title>UBE2D/eff knockdown increases aggregates of pathogenic huntingtin in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> retina</title>
<p>In addition to RNAi lines that decrease the amount of Htt aggregates, we found that RNAi-mediated knockdown of other E2s causes an increase in Htt aggregates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-C</xref>). Specifically, RNAi for Ubc6 (UBE2A/B), eff (UBE2D), Ubc10 (UBE2L3), and Ubc84D (UBE2L6) increased the total area of protein aggregates. Likewise, RNAi for E3/DUBs that physically associate with these E2s (such as Ubr4 and Kcfm1, associated with UBE2A/B; and HUWE1, associated with UBE2D) led to higher levels of polyglutamine aggregates. A possible interpretation of these results is that these E2s are necessary for the degradation of aggregation-prone Htt and, consequently, their loss leads to the accumulation of detergent-insoluble polyglutamine aggregates. To test this hypothesis, we further characterized the molecular mechanisms by which eff/UBE2D regulates Htt proteostasis. We first measured by qRT-PCR the levels of Htt-polyQ-GFP and found that there are no changes in its expression upon eff RNAi compared to controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), indicating that increased levels of Htt-polyQ-GFP aggregates observed upon eff RNAi do not arise from increased transgenic expression of Htt-polyQ-GFP. Next, we utilized western blot to analyze the levels of Htt-polyQ-GFP monomers (∼50 kDa) and high-molecular-weight (HMW) Htt-polyQ-GFP aggregates that accumulate in the stacking gel (&gt;250 kDa). Remarkably, 2 different RNAi lines targeting eff/UBE2D increase HMW Htt-polyQ-GFP levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>), suggesting that eff/UBE2D-mediated ubiquitination may be required for Htt degradation. In summary, these findings indicate an extensive role of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes in modulating Htt-Q72-GFP aggregation during aging in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> retina.</p>

<title>Retinal degeneration caused by UBE2D/eff knockdown is rescued by human UBE2D2/4</title>
<p>Compared to controls, we find that RNAi for Ubc6 and for eff induces retinal degeneration, as indicated by the “rough eye” appearance (indicative of photoreceptor death and derangement of inter-ommatidial bristles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>)), the increase in the eye area occupied by necrotic patches, and/or the loss of pigmentation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). On this basis, we next examined whether concomitant transgenic expression of the human homologs of these <italic>Drosophila</italic> E2s rescues retinal degeneration. On this basis, we expressed human UBE2B (homologous to Ubc6, DIOPT homology score=13) and human UBE2D2 and UBE2D4 (homologous to eff, DIOPT scores of 13 and 10, respectively) and compared their capacity to rescue retinal degeneration compared to mock mcherry overexpression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). As expected based on the sequence homology, hUBE2B (but not mcherry, hUBE2D2, and hUBE2D4) rescued retinal degeneration (i.e. necrotic patches and depigmentation) induced by Ubc6 RNAi. Similarly, hUBE2D2 and to a lower extent hUBE2D4 rescued depigmentation caused by eff knockdown. Altogether, these findings indicate that Ubc6 and eff loss can be rescued by transgenic expression of their respective human homologs UBE2B and UBE2D2/4 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p>

<p>On this basis, we next examined whether hUBE2D can rescue the defects in Htt-polyQ proteostasis caused by eff RNAi. Specifically, we compared eff RNAi versus control RNAi, with the concomitant expression of either mcherry or hUBE2D2. Image analysis of Htt-poly-GFP aggregates indicates that hUBE2D2 impedes the accumulation of Htt-polyQ-GFP aggregates which are otherwise increased by eff RNAi (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Similar results were also obtained by western blot: there was lower accumulation of HMW Htt-polyQ-GFP in eff<sup>RNAi</sup>+hUBE2D2 versus eff<sup>RNAi</sup>+mcherry and the other controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). In summary, these findings indicate that eff/UBE2D has an evolutionary-conserved function in maintaining proteostasis in a Huntington’s disease model.</p>

<title>UBE2D/eff protein levels decline with aging, and UBE2D/eff knockdown impairs skeletal muscle proteostasis as observed during aging</title>
<p>The comprehensive analysis reported above has revealed a range of diverse roles for E2s in modulating polyglutamine aggregates in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. UBE2D/eff appears to be one of the E2s with the most striking effects in preserving proteostasis, i.e. it is required for preventing the accumulation of HMW Htt-polyQ-GP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). On this basis, we further probed the role of UBE2D/eff in protein quality control. To this purpose, we examined skeletal muscle aging, which is characterized by a progressive decline in proteostasis and by the age-related accumulation of detergent-insoluble poly-ubiquitin protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>).</p>

Immunostaining and confocal microscopy of skeletal muscle of flies at 3 weeks of age indicate that UBE2D/eff RNAi significantly increases the size of poly-ubiquitin protein aggregates and that there is an overall trend towards a higher total area of aggregates, compared to control RNAi (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C-D</xref>).

<p>Curated analyses revealed that, as expected, eff protein levels declined in response to eff RNAi compared to control RNAi (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). The levels of several other proteins were increased upon eff RNAi but reduced by concomitant rescue with hUBE2D2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). These proteins include Arc1 and Arc2 (activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein 1 and 2), which regulate starvation-induced locomotion, the neuromuscular junction, and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>); the glycine N-methyltransferase Gnmt enzyme, which generates sarcosine and controls the amount of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>); and CG4594, which encodes for an enzyme involved in fatty acid beta oxidation. In addition to rescuing protein changes induced by eff RNAi, overexpression of hUBE2D2 by itself reduced the levels of Arc1, Arc2, Gnmt, and CG4594. Altogether, these proteomics analyses identify protein targets that are modulated by eff/UBE2D in skeletal muscle (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). Improper eff/UBE2D-mediated turnover of these proteins and their consequent accumulation may contribute to derange muscle protein quality control and in turn to reduced survival. In agreement with this hypothesis, it was previously found that elevation of Arc1 protein levels in Alzheimer’s disease models causes cytotoxicity and contributes to neuronal death in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>).</p>
<p>Conversely, there were other proteins that were induced in muscles with eff/UBE2D knockdown and that may represent a protective response that mitigates the derangement of proteostasis due to eff/UBE2D knockdown. These included Pomp, involved in proteasome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>), the chaperones Hsp22, Hsp23, and Hsp26, and the ubiquitin-like protein UBL3 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, these studies indicate that eff/UBE2D knockdown induces several proteomics changes, some of which are rescued by hUBE2D2.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we have examined the role of the 21 <italic>Drosophila</italic> E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes in modulating polyglutamine protein aggregation. By analyzing pathogenic huntingtin in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> retina, we found that E2s have diverse functions in regulating Htt-polyQ-GFP. Specifically, the knockdown of many E2s reduces polyglutamine protein aggregates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), suggesting that ubiquitination by these E2s promotes sequestration of pathogenic huntingtin into aggresomes, as found in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Aggregation of Htt has been previously found to decrease its toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>), and therefore E2s that drive Htt aggregation may protect from polyglutamine disease via this mechanism. However, there were also RNAi interventions for other E2s, such as eff/UBE2D, and associated enzymes (DUBs and E3s) that increased the levels of high-molecular-weight assemblies of Htt-polyQ-GFP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), suggesting that these E2s and interacting partners are necessary for Htt-polyQ-GFP degradation. Likewise, eff/UBE2D knockdown compromises protein quality control also in <italic>Drosophila</italic> skeletal muscle (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), as indicated by the accumulation of insoluble poly-ubiquitinated proteins, and this is in part re-established via overexpression of one of its human homologs, UBE2D2.</p>
<p>Considering that UBE2D/eff is one out of 21 different E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes in Drosophila, it is unlikely that UBE2D/eff RNAi alone reduces the total ubiquitination capacity of the cell. In fact, UBE2D/eff knockdown paradoxically increases the levels of poly-ubiquitinated proteins, and such a generalized increase may result from an overall derangement in protein quality control. In agreement with this scenario, the protein categories that are modulated by UBE2D/eff<sup>RNAi</sup> include regulators of proteostasis such as proteasome components and chaperones (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Therefore, derangement in the levels of a wide range of proteostasis regulators may lead to a generalized loss of protein quality control and to the accumulation of insoluble poly-ubiquitinated proteins upon UBE2D/eff RNAi.</p>
<p>Previously, UBE2D ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (UBE2D1/2/3/4) were found to contribute to several cellular processes that impact proteostasis. These include the association of UBE2Ds with the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP to promote the degradation of misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Likewise, UBE2Ds were found to confer resistance to elevated temperatures in yeast by promoting the selective ubiquitination and degradation of misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>). Moreover, UBE2Ds can interact with the E3 ligase parkin to promote mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>) and with the E3 ligase RNF138 to mediate DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>). In addition to these cellular functions, UBE2D also plays a key role in protein import into peroxisomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>).</p>
<p>We have found that eff/UBE2D knockdown leads to the accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins and that eff/UBE2D is an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that is key for maintaining protein quality control during aging. Because eff/UBE2D knockdown impedes eff/UBE2D-mediated ubiquitination, the poly-ubiquitinated proteins that accumulate upon eff/UBE2D RNAi likely consist of proteins different from eff/UBE2D ubiquitination substrates. How eff/UBE2D knockdown deranges proteostasis and promotes the accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins may occur via multiple mechanisms. One possibility is that proteostasis is deranged by eff/UBE2D knockdown because of the previously-reported roles of eff/UBE2D in mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>) and in the removal of misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>) in concert with the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Accumulation of such faulty proteins may clog or burden the proteasome and hence generally impair the degradation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins.</p>
<p>In an alternative model, proteostasis and survival are reduced by eff/UBE2D knockdown because of the accumulation of specific UBE2D protein targets that directly perturb these processes. While many substrates of eff/UBE2D ubiquitination accumulate and may play such role, Arc1 and the related Arc2 protein are of particular interest. Specifically, Arc1 and Arc2 protein levels increase upon UBE2D/eff knockdown and, conversely, they are reduced by hUBE2D2. Interestingly, Arc1 upregulation was found to be cytotoxic and to drive neurodegeneration in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> Alzheimer’s disease model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). This suggests that the accumulation of Arc1/2 in response to eff/UBE2D knockdown may derange proteostasis and reduce survival. Arc1 and Arc2 protein levels increase also in response to aging in skeletal muscle (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). More globally, eff RNAi induces many proteomic changes reminiscent of aging: ∼70% of the proteins that are significantly modulated by eff RNAi in young age are also consistently regulated by aging (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). These findings, therefore, indicate that UBE2D/eff maintains a youthful proteome and that the age-dependent decline in UBE2D/eff protein levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) may contribute to the proteomic changes that occur with aging.</p>
<p>In addition to reshaping the composition of the muscle proteome and impairing proteostasis, we have found that muscle-specific eff/UBE2D knockdown reduces organismal survival: while muscle-specific eff/UBE2D RNAi reduces lifespan, this is partially rescued by concomitant expression of an RNAi-resistant human UBE2D2 transgene which re-establishes the physiological levels of eff/UBE2D-regulated targets such as Arc1/2. These findings, therefore, reinforce the notion that skeletal muscle is a key tissue that influences systemic aging, and that preserving muscle protein quality control is necessary for optimal organismal survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, our study highlights the important role of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme eff/UBE2D in maintaining protein quality control during aging, suggesting that interventions that promote UBE2D function may contrast age-related diseases that arise from the loss of proteostasis.</p>

<p>Flies were kept (∼25 flies/tube) at 25°C, 60% humidity, and a 12h/12h light-dark cycle in tubes containing cornmeal/soy flour/yeast fly food. Survival analysis was done at 25°C and the fly food was changed every 2-3 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>). All experiments were done with male flies. Fly stocks were obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center (BDSC), the Vienna Drosophila Resource Center (VDRC), and the National Institute of Genetics (NIG-Fly, Japan).

<title>Analysis of pathogenic Huntingtin aggregation</title>
<p>Pathogenic huntingtin-polyQ72-GFP protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>) were imaged with an epifluorescence ZEISS SteREO Discovery V12 microscope with consistent exposure time and settings. The acquired grayscale images were then analyzed in an automated manner by using Cell Profiler 3.0.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cellprofiler.org">cellprofiler.org</ext-link>) to determine the number and/or total area of protein aggregates (Huntingtin-polyQ72-GFP speckles) normalized by the retinal tissue area. Background fluorescence not corresponding to Huntingtin-polyQ72-GFP aggregates was excluded by thresholding. This analysis was done with male flies after aging at 25°C for 30 days; the same conditions were applied to all the samples and the respective controls in any given experiment. The raw values for each set of flies were normalized by the corresponding raw values of the negative control RNAi intervention from the same fly stock collection.</p>

<title>Protein sample preparation, protein digestion, and peptide isobaric labeling by tandem mass tags</title>
<p>For each TMT <italic>Drosophila</italic> sample, 50 thoraces (consisting primarily of skeletal muscle) from 1-week-old and 8-weeks-old male <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> flies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) and from 2-weeks-old male flies of the genotypes indicated (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) were collected and homogenized in 8M urea lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 8.5, 8 M urea) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>). After homogenization with zirconium beads in a NextAdvance bullet blender, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate was added to the tissue homogenates, which were then pelleted to remove fly debris. The resulting supernatant was submitted for TMT mass spectrometry and digested with LysC (Wako) at an enzyme-to-substrate ratio of 1:100 (w/w) for 2 hours in the presence of 1 mM DTT. Following this, the samples were diluted to a final 2 M Urea concentration with 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.5), and further digested with trypsin (Promega) at an enzyme-to-substrate ratio of 1:50 (w/w) for at least 3 hours. The peptides were reduced by adding 1 mM DTT for 30 min at room temperature (RT) followed by alkylation with 10 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) for 30 minutes in the dark at RT. The unreacted IAA was quenched with 30 mM DTT for 30 minutes. Finally, the digestion was terminated and acidified by adding trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to 1%, desalted using C18 cartridges (Harvard Apparatus), and dried by speed vac. The purified peptides were resuspended in 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.5) and labeled with 16-plex Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) reagents (ThermoScientific) following the manufacturer’s recommendations and our optimized protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>).</p>

TMT tags on Lys and N-termini (+304.20715 Da) were used for static modifications and Met oxidation (+15.99492 Da) was considered as a dynamic modification. Matched MS/MS spectra were filtered by mass accuracy and matching scores to reduce protein false discovery rate to ∼1%.

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study presents findings on the role of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2D/eff in maintaining proteostasis during aging. The evidence supporting the conclusions is <bold>solid</bold>, although one reviewer had concerns about the readout for protein aggregation and the loss-of-function studies. In the future, mechanistic insights explaining the impact of UBE2D/eff deficiency on the accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins and in shortening lifespan would be interesting. The present study is of broad interest to cell biologists working in aging and age-related diseases.</p>

<p>In this study, Hunt et al investigated the role of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2D/effete (eff) in maintaining proteostasis during aging. Utilizing Drosophila as a model, the researchers observed diverse roles of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes in handling the aggregation-prone protein huntingtin-polyQ in the retina. While some E2s facilitated aggregate assembly, UBE2D/eff and other E2s were crucial for degradation of htt-polyQ. The study also highlights the significance of UBE2D/eff in skeletal muscle, showing that declining levels of eff during aging correlate with proteostasis disruptions. Knockdown of eff in muscle led to accelerated accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins, shortened lifespan, and mirrored proteomic changes observed in aged muscles. The introduction of human UBE2D2, analogous to eff, partially rescued the deficits in lifespan and proteostasis caused by eff-RNAi expression in muscles.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>In this revised manuscript, the authors have addressed some of my concerns, yet several significant caveats remain unaddressed.</p>
<p>One major concern stems from the unexpected outcome observed in the UBE2D/eff loss-of-function experiment. Despite its known role as a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), reducing UBE2D/eff levels led to an increase in poly-ubiquitinated proteins and p62 accumulation, suggesting a more complex and multifaceted phenotype seemingly unrelated to the expected role of UBE2D/eff. The authors proposed that an overall disruption of protein quality control, indirectly caused by effRNAi, could explain these phenotypes. However, while the authors noted that effRNAi does not affect proteasome activity, they have not explored other possibilities, leaving a mechanistic explanation still missing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the comparative analysis of the old versus young proteome identified 10 out of 21 E2 enzymes, suggesting that other E2s may also contribute to age-related changes in proteostasis and lifespan. In this context, the authors mentioned that overexpression of human UBE2D2 in skeletal muscle does not influence lifespan, indicating that the reduced Eff levels observed during aging may not necessarily contribute to the aging phenotype.</p>
<p>
At this point, I believe the manuscript remains largely descriptive.</p>

<p>The authors screened 21 E2 enzymes for their role in HTTExon1Q72-mCherry (HTT) aggregation in the Drosophila eye. They identified UBE2D, whose knockdown leads to increased HTT aggregation that can be rescued by ectopic expression of the human homolog. The protein levels of UBE2D decrease with aging and knockdown of UBED2 leads to an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and a shortened lifespan that can be rescued by ectopic expression of the human homolog. Knockdown of UBE2D leads to proteomic changes with up- and down-regulated proteins that include both components of the proteostasis network.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>The authors have not addressed a single critical point experimentally. Their explanations are not resolving my concerns and hence the following critical points remain:</p>
<p>• The readout of HTT aggregation (with methods that are not suitable) as proxy for the role of UBE2D in proteostasis is not convincing.</p>
<p>• UBE2D knockdown increases the number of HTT foci (Fig. 1A), but the quantification is less convincing as depicted in Fig. 1B and other E2 enzymes show a stronger effect (e.g. Ubc6 that is only studied in Figs. 1 + 2 without an explanation and Ubc84D). It does not help or add anything to this study that the authors refer to a previous publication. This review assesses this manuscript.</p>
<p>• The quantification of the HTT fluorescence cannot be used as proxy for HTT aggregation. The authors should assess HTT aggregation by e.g. SDD-AGE, FRAP, filter retardation etc. The quantification of the higher MW species of HTT in the SDS-PAGE is not ideal either as this simply reflects material that is stuck in the wells that could not enter the gel. Aggregation and hence high MW size could be one reason, but it can also be HTT trapped in cell debris etc. This point is critical and I disagree with the response of the authors.</p>
<p>• Does UBE2D ubiquitinate HTT? And thus, is HTT accumulation a suitable readout for the functional assessment of the E2 enzyme UBE2D? The authors state that UBE2D does not ubiquitinate HTT. Thus, HTT accumulation is an indirect consequence of perturbed proteostasis. There are certainly better readouts for the role of UBE2D once they have identified substrates.</p>
<p>• The proteomic analyses could help to identify potential substrates for UBE2D. I think its is a missed chance to not follow up on the proteomic analysis to identify substrates and define the role of UBE2D in maintainig proteostasis.</p>
<p>• Are there mutants available for UBE2D or conditional mutants? One caveat of RNAi are: first not complete knockdown and second, variable knockdown efficiencies that increases variability. So mutants are available and yet the authors refuse to use those.</p>
<p>• The analysis of the E3 enzymes does not add anything to this manuscript and the author's response that this manuscript is a follow-up study on a previous publication of the lab is certainly not a valid argument.</p>
<p>• The manuscript remains at this stage rather descriptive.</p>

<p>This is an interesting paper that defines E2 and E3 genes in Drosophila that can impact the accumulation of the Q72-GFP protein in the fly eye. The authors then focus on the eff gene, showing which human homolog can rescue fly knockdown. They extend to skeletal muscle during natural aging to show that eff by TMT mass spec decreases with age normally in the fly muscle and that there is a significant overlap of proteins that are disrupted with eff knockdown in young animals in muscle vs aged animals normally in muscle.</p>
<p>Overall these data suggest that eff decrease with age may contribute to the increase in ubiquitinated proteins in muscle with age, and that upregulation of eff activity might be of interest to extend lifespan. Because eff function can be performed by a human homologue the findings may also apply to human situations of aging.</p>
<p>These data are overall interesting and of relevance for those interested in neurodegenerative disease and aging.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>In this study, Hunt et al investigated the role of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2D/effete (eff) in maintaining proteostasis during aging. Utilizing Drosophila as a model, the researchers observed diverse roles of E2 ubiquitinconjugating enzymes in handling the aggregation-prone protein huntingtin-polyQ in the retina. While some E2s facilitated aggregate assembly, UBE2D/eff and other E2s were crucial for degradation of hL-polyQ. The study also highlights the significance of UBE2D/eff in skeletal muscle, showing that declining levels of eff during aging correlate with proteostasis disruptions. Knockdown of eff in muscle led to accelerated accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins, shortened lifespan, and mirrored proteomic changes observed in aged muscles. The introduction of human UBE2D2, analogous to eff, partially rescued the deficits in lifespan and proteostasis caused by eff-RNAi expression in muscles.</p>
<p>The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by data, although a more precise mechanistic explanation of phenotypes associated with UBE2D/eff deficiency would have strengthened the study. Additionally, some aspects of image quantification and data analysis need to be clarified and/or extended.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank reviewer #1 for the thoughtful assessment of our work. We have amended the discussion to better explain the phenotypes associated with UBE2D/eff deficiency. We have also improved the methods describing the procedures for image quantification and data analysis.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Important findings:</p>
<p>- Knockdown of UBE2D increases HTT aggregation.</p>
<p>- Knockdown of UBE2D leads to an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and reduces the lifespan of Drosophila, which is rescued by an ectopic expression of the human homolog.</p>
<p>- UBE2D protein levels decline with aging.</p>
<p>- UBE2D knockdown is associated with an up- and downregulation of several different cellular pathways, including proteostasis components.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for reviewing our manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Caveats:</p>
<p>- The readout of HTT aggregation (with methods that are not suitable) as a proxy for the role of UBE2D in proteostasis is not convincing. It would probably improve the manuscript to start with the proteomic analysis of UBE2D to demonstrate that its protein levels decrease with aging. The authors could then induce UBE2D in aged animals to assess the role of UBE2D in the proteome with aging.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While presenting the data in a different order would be possible, we prefer to keep the current order in which from a general screen with a proteostasis readout (HTT aggregates; see the answer below for a discussion on the methods) we proceed to identify a candidate (UBE2D) which is then studied in more detail with additional focused analyses in the retina and skeletal muscle during aging. Concerning the induction of UBE2D in aged animals, our analyses in Figure 4E demonstrate that muscle-specific induction of UBE2D2 throughout life does not increase lifespan alone: this could be explained by UBE2D2 only partially recapitulating the function and substrate diversity of Drosophila eff/UBE2D due to divergence from a single Drosophila UBE2D enzyme (eff) to multiple UBE2D enzymes in humans (UBE2D1/2/3/4).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- UBE2D knockdown increases the number of HTT foci (Figure 1A), but the quantification is less convincing as depicted in Figure 1B, and other E2 enzymes show a stronger effect (e.g. Ubc6 that is only studied in Figures 1 and 2 without an explanation and Ubc84D). The graph is hard to interpret. What is the sample size and which genetic conditions show a significant change? P values and statistical analyses are missing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The full data underlying this genetic screen is reported in Supplementary Table 1. The role of UBC6/UBE2A/B is thoroughly examined in Hunt et al 2021 (PMID: 33658508). We agree that Ubc84D has an important effect and that it should be considered for future studies. We have amended the legend of Figure 1 to indicate that each data point in the graph represents a single RNAi line targeting the corresponding gene. The mean of 5 biological replicates is shown for each RNAi, with each biological replicate representing a single eye imaged from a distinct fly. Therefore, the data points that do not show large magnitude changes may indicate RNAi lines that were not effective at knocking down the target protein (or that did not affect HTT aggregates). The E2s worth pursuing were identified because of multiple RNAi lines scoring consistently: this is the case of UBC6 (studied previously in PMID: 33658508) and eff/UBE2D (pursued in this study). This screen was therefore utilized to identify and select candidate genes (i.e. eff/UBE2D) for more in-depth studies on proteostasis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- The quantification of the HTT fluorescence cannot be used as a proxy for HTT aggregation. The authors should assess HTT aggregation by e.g. SDD-AGE, FRAP, filter retardation, etc. The quantification of the higher MW species of HTT in the SDS-PAGE is not ideal either as this simply reflects material that is stuck in the wells that could not enter the gel. Aggregation and hence high MW size could be one reason, but it can also be HTT trapped in cell debris, etc.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the use of multiple methods is a good way to assess the impact of E2 enzymes on HTT protein aggregation. In this regard, we estimated HTT aggregates by fluorescence microscopy and by western blot. Microscopy-based analyses demonstrate both the accumulation of the HTT-GFP pathogenic protein into aggregates (HTT polyQ polypeptides aggregating into one spatial region; Fig. 1 and Fig. 2B) as well as their potential cytotoxicity, resulting in the disruption of the ommatidial ultrastructure and cellular degeneration (Fig. 2A). Similar to native gels and filter retardation, we have utilized SDS-PAGE and western blotting of cellular samples isolated with strong chaotropic and denaturing reagents (8M urea plus detergents and reducing reagents used in the lysis). These experimental conditions maintain the higher-order organization of HTT into high-molecular-weight aggregates that are not broken down into individual polypeptides and that therefore do not readily travel through a gel or filter. Therefore, the biochemical methods we have used are equivalent to those proposed by the reviewer. In addition to combining microscopy-based and biochemical approaches to examine the impact of eff/UBE2D on the HTT aggregates, we have analyzed eff/UBE2D during skeletal muscle aging and found consistent phenotypes as those observed in the HTT model: RNAi for eff/UBE2D leads to the accumulation of detergent-insoluble ubiquitinated proteins that associate with protein aggregates.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Does UBE2D ubiquitinate HTT? And thus, is HTT accumulation a suitable readout for the functional assessment of the E2 enzyme UBE2D?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We propose that the accumulation of HTT in response to eff/UBE2D RNAi may be due to a generalized loss of protein quality control rather than to a direct decline in the ubiquitination of HTT by eff/UBE2D. In a previous study that examined the UBE2D interactome (Hunt et al. 2023; PMID: 37963875), we did not find an interaction between UBE2D and HTT, suggesting that HTT may not be directly modulated by eff/UBE2D via ubiquitination.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- The proteomic analyses could help to identify potential substrates for UBE2D.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The proteomic analyses in Figure 5 identify several proteins that are modulated by RNAi for eff and by its human homolog, UBE2D2. Such eff/UBE2D2-modulated proteins may indeed be potential substrates for UBE2D-mediated ubiquitination. For example, this is the case for Pex11 and Pex13, which were found to be upregulated upon UBE2D RNAi also in human cells, where they are ubiquitinated in a UBE2D-dependent manner (Hunt et al. 2023; PMID: 37963875).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Are there mutants available for UBE2D or conditional mutants? One caveat of RNAi is: first not complete knockdown and second, variable knockdown efficiencies that increase variability.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There are potential hypomorphic alleles of eff/UBE2D that may be available, but they would present the same caveats of incomplete loss of eff/UBE2D function as RNAi. Given the strong phenotype that we find with partial eff knockdown, a caveat of full eff/UBE2D knockout is that this could be lethal.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- The analysis of the E3 enzymes does not add anything to this manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The analysis of E3 enzymes relates to our recent publication (Hunt et al. 2023; PMID: 37963875) that reports the physical interactions between E2 and E3 enzymes. Analysis of these E2-E3 pairs in the genetic screen in Fig.1 therefore follows this IP-MS study to provide insight into the functional interaction between these E2-E3 pairs in proteostasis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Figure 2B: the fluorescence intensities in images 2 and 4 are rather similar, yet the quantification shows significant differences.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please note that some of the GFP fluorescence in image 4 is not punctate, but rather diffuse fluorescence that is not related to HTT-GFP aggregates. Our image quantitation methods utilized thresholding to identify GFP-positive puncta while eliminating background fluorescence not corresponding to HTT-GFP puncta.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- The proteomic analyses could provide insights into the functional spectrum of UBE2D or even the identification of substrates. Yet apart from a DAVID analysis, none of the hits were followed up. In addition, only a few hits were labelled in the volcano plots (Figure 5). On what basis did the authors select those?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please see the previous answer above regarding the identification of eff/UBE2D protein substrates from our proteomic analysis in Fig. 5. Only some of the top-regulated hits could be labeled in Fig.5 to avoid overcrowding.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- The manuscript remains at this stage rather descriptive.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our study has demonstrated a key role for the eff/UBE2D ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in regulating protein quality control during aging in the Drosophila retina and skeletal muscle. Our study has identified key proteins that are modulated by eff/UBE2D RNAi in Drosophila muscle, that are rescued by expression of human UBE2D2, and that may underlie the accelerated decline in proteostasis that occurs upon eff/UBE2D RNAi. While more could be known about the regulation of these eff/UBE2D-modulated proteins in Drosophila, we have previously demonstrated that some of the proteins that are upregulated by UBE2DRNAi in human cells (e.g. some peroxins) are indeed direct ubiquitination targets of UBE2D via associated E3 ubiquitin ligases (Hunt et al. 2023; PMID: 37963875).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>This is a potentially quite interesting paper that defines E2 and E3 genes in Drosophila that can impact the accumulation of the Q72-GFP protein in the fly eye. The authors then focus on the eff gene, showing which human homolog can rescue fly knockdown. They extend to skeletal muscle, from the hL protein, to show that eff by TMT mass spec decreases with age normally in the fly muscle and that there is a significant overlap of proteins that are disrupted with eff knockdown in young animals in muscle vs aged animals normally in muscle.</p>
<p>Overall these data suggest eff decrease with age may contribute to the increase in ubiquitinated proteins in muscle with age, and that upregulation of eff activity might be of interest to extending lifespan. Because eff function can be performed by a human homologue, the findings may also apply to human situations of aging.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These data are overall interesting and are of relevance for those interested in neurodegenerative disease and aging, although a number of points from the figures seem confusing and need more explanation or clarity.</p>
<p>Thank you for reviewing our manuscript, we have improved the explanations and clarity of the manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to keep the manuscript title as it is currently to report the partial overlap in the proteomic changes induced by aging and effRNAi (Fig. 6).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) A significant concern arises from the unexpected outcome observed in the UBE2D/eff loss-of-function experiments. Despite its role as a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), the reduction in UBE2D/eff levels paradoxically increased polyubiquitinated proteins and p62 accumulation, presenting a more intricate and seemingly unrelated phenotype to its anticipated function.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>eff/UBE2D represents one out of 21 different Drosophila E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and therefore eff RNAi alone is unlikely to reduce the total pool of ubiquitinated proteins. The generalized increase in insoluble polyubiquitinated proteins results from an overall derangement of protein quality control caused by effRNAi. In agreement with this scenario, the protein categories that were found to be modulated by effRNAi (Fig. 5) include proteins associated with protein quality control such as proteasome components and chaperones. Therefore, derangement in the levels of a wide range of regulators of proteostasis may lead to a generalized loss of protein quality control upon effRNAi.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I believe elucidating the mechanisms underlying the impact of UBE2D/eff deficiency on the observed phenotypes would contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the study's implications. For instance, investigating whether the loss of UBE2D/eff influences muscle proteostasis by impeding proteasome assembly or function, modulating autophagy, etc.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have previously utilized luciferase assays to measure the proteolytic activity of the proteasome in human cells treated with siRNAs targeting UBE2D1/2/3/4 but found no effect of UBE2D knockdown compared to control nontargeting siRNAs (Hunt et al. 2023; PMID: 37963875). In Drosophila muscles, we have examined the levels of GFP-CL1 (a GFP fused with a proteasomal degron) and found that effRNAi does not impact GFP-CL1 levels (data shown in author response image 1). Overall, these results suggest that effRNAi reduces protein quality control without affecting proteasome activity.</p>

<p>(2) Related to Figures 1B-C: It is not clear to this reviewer the quantification methodology used in the experiment. Does each point represent the Average +/- SD for each replicate? If so, it appears that not all cases align with the n=5 as indicated in the figure legend. Additionally, how many animals per replicate were quantified?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have amended the legend of Figure 1 to indicate that each data point in the graph represents a single RNAi line targeting the corresponding gene. The mean of 5 biological replicates is shown for each RNAi line, with each biological replicate representing a single eye imaged from a distinct fly. Therefore, the data points that do not show large magnitude changes may indicate RNAi that were not effective at knocking down the target protein (or with no effect on HTT aggregates).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Related to the previous point: The analysis of pathogenic Huntingtin aggregation in the Materials and Methods section lacks information regarding the number of individuals, replicates, etc.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please see the response above.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Related to Figure 1 B: In the case of eff/UBE2D, it appears that 3 out of 9 replicates demonstrate a significant increase in HL-polyQ aggregates. Considering the strength of this result, it raises questions about whether it justifies using eff for future analyses.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please see the response to point (2) above. These results indicate that 3 distinct UAS-RNAi lines targeting eff/UBE2D produced the same effect whereas 6 other effRNAi lines did not, possibly because they are less efficacious in knocking down eff/UBE2D. We have now amended the legend of Fig. 1B to better explain these results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Related to Figure 1 D-E: Could the authors provide clarification regarding the tissue type and animal age utilized in these experiments?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Whole flies were utilized at 1 week of age.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Related to Figure 3: Incorporating the normal accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins during aging could provide context to better interpret the effect of eff/UBE2D KD at 3 weeks of age.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Several papers from us and others have previously demonstrated a progressive increase in the insoluble levels of poly-ubiquitinated proteins during aging in Drosophila skeletal muscle (PMID: 36640359; PMID: 31249065; PMID: 33773104; PMID: 33658508; PMID: 24092876; PMID: 21111239; PMID: 24244197; PMID: 25199830; PMID: 28878259; PMID: 36213625). Our analyses now indicate that such age-related loss of protein quality control is accelerated by eff/UBE2D knockdown.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Related to Figure 3: Would it be possible for the authors to include a list or table detailing the specific E2, deubiquitinating enzymes, and E3s identified in the comparative analysis of the old vs young proteome? This would provide a clear reference for the identified regulatory proteins involved in the age-related proteomic changes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added a tab to Supplementary Table 2 to report the list of age-regulated deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) and E1, E2, and E3 enzymes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Related to Figures 3 and 4: Given that the comparative analysis of the old versus young proteome identified 10 out of 21 E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, exploring the impact of eff/UBE2D overexpression becomes pivotal to understanding its role in age-related changes in proteostasis and lifespan. Conducting an experiment involving eff overexpression could provide valuable insights into whether restoring eff levels mitigates aging-related phenotypes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although we have not done this experiment with eff overexpression, Fig. 4E reports that the overexpression of human UBE2D2 in skeletal muscle does not appear to influence lifespan by itself (green line in Fig. 4E), although it can partially rescue the short lifespan of flies with muscle-specific effRNAi (purple line in Fig. 4E).</p>

<p>(9) Providing a more detailed description of the Supplementary Tables would significantly enhance the reader's comprehension of their content.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>In addition, to the points listed above:</p>
<p>- The title does not reflect the content of the manuscript and should be changed. There is no evidence that UBE2D maintains a &quot;youthful&quot; (needs to be changed as well) proteome. Rather, its expression declines with aging and its depletion leads to an increase of ubiquitinated proteins. This is true for essentially the entire proteostasis network.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While proteostasis generally declines with aging, it is incompletely understood what specific components of the proteostasis network are dysregulated with aging. Our study now identifies the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme eff/UBE2D as a key regulator of proteostasis that is transcriptionally downregulated with aging. Comparison of the proteomic changes induced by aging versus those induced by effRNAi in young age indicates a partial overlap (Fig. 6), indicating that eff/UBE2D is, at least in part, necessary to maintain the proteome composition that is found in young age (“youthful”). On this basis, we would like to keep the current title but have amended the manuscript to indicate that such regulation of the proteome composition is only in part dependent on eff/UBE2D.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Molecular weight markers are missing for the gels/western blot depicted in Fig 1E, 2C, 3E, and 4A.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out, these have been added.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Fig. 4A, the Ponceau staining for the detergent insoluble samples shows almost no signal for lane 7 and the data should hence not be analyzed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The western blot membrane in Fig. 4A shows a reliable signal in all lanes (including lane 7) when probed with antibodies for ubiquitin, Ref(2)P, and tubulin. Therefore, there is no reason for excluding lane 7 from the analysis. Ponceau S staining is provided as an additional loading control but was not used to normalize the data.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>There are a number of confusing or not sufficiently explained points in the figures that require clarity.</p>
<p>In Figure 1, panels B and C, one assumes the gray broad line across means no difference from control. For the genes, many have points that are scattered both above and below that control line. What do the dots and range represent for each gene, and why are the data so scattered. How do the authors explain data ranging from no effect, to a negative effect to a positive effect, all for the same gene? Akt1 and Hsp83 are controls but are not quantitated to appreciate how variable the assay is. Can they explain the figure better, and also why the data for any one gene are so variable?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have amended the legend of Figure 1 to indicate that each data point in the graph represents a single RNAi line targeting the corresponding gene. The mean of 5 biological replicates is shown for each RNAi line, with each biological replicate representing a single eye imaged from a distinct fly. Therefore, the data points that do not show large magnitude changes may indicate RNAi lines that were not effective at knocking down the target protein (or that did not affect HTT aggregates). Therefore, the variability in the analysis of a single gene arises because different RNAi lines targeting that gene may have different efficacy. RNAi lines for Akt1 and Hsp83 are merely used as controls (these have been quantified in Jiao et al. 2023; PMID: 36640359).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Figure 2A, it is not clear which animals have the hL-Q72-GFP (which eyes are &quot;rough eyes&quot;?). Also, do ubc6-RNAi and eff-RNAi have an impact on the normal eye? That is, can they explain the images and genotypes more clearly.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>UBC6 and eff RNAi produce these rough eye phenotypes in the absence of HTT-polyQ and these are rescued by the expression of their human homologs. The panel images indicated in bold here below are those that have “rough eye” phenotypes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 (a green R has been added to these panels in Fig. 2A).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Figure 2B, panel 3 looks very different from 1 and 4 and yet is not different from them by quantitation. Can they replace it with a more representative panel or is 3 lower (but not significantly so)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please note that some of the GFP fluorescence in image 4 is not punctate, but rather diffuse fluorescence that is not related to HTT-GFP aggregates. Our image quantitation methods utilized thresholding to identify GFP-positive puncta while eliminating background fluorescence not corresponding to HTT-GFP puncta.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Figures 3E and F, it would be helpful in F to put the detergent soluble bar graphs all on the left so that those data are on the left in both E and F, and then detergent-insoluble in E and F to the right. This would make the figure and quantitation easier to follow.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Done.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The same point as above for Figures 4 A and B.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Done.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Figure 3A, CG7656 is nearly as reduced with age as eff. One wonders if that gene would give a different or similarly overlapping proteome with age as eff. Was CG7656 not focused on because not conserved?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As indicated in Figure 1B, CG7656 is orthologous to UBE2R1 (also called CDC34) and UBE2R2 in humans. In this screen, however, RNAi targeting CG7656 did not appear to influence HTT aggregates and therefore was not selected for further analyses. However, it may play a role in skeletal muscle proteostasis during aging.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Figure 6, the R2 value correlating age with eff-RNAi is weak. Although they discuss this in the text, it might also be helpful to include Venn diagrams for gene overlaps and the significance to make the argument more clear that there is a significant correlation in proteins up and down to indicate that eff largely recapitulates the changes of aging. Correlating this with proteins that are restored with UBE2D in muscle in a more clear manner may also be helpful for readers interested in aging.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have amended the text to indicate that this relatively low correlation (R2=~0.2, but corresponding to a consistent regulation of 70% of proteins by aging and effRNAi) could indicate that eff/UBE2D is only in part responsible for maintaining a youthful composition of the muscle proteome during aging. Other changes that occur with aging likely account for non-correlated alterations in protein levels. We have also added Venn diagrams (Fig. 6E) to further display the overlap in protein regulation by aging vs. effRNAi.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Figure 7, they might indicate that the accumulated insoluble protein is ubiquitinated. That is left out of the figure, although indicated in the legend.</p>

<p>Done.</p>
