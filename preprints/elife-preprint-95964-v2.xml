<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The epidemic of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), caused by human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1), is still a huge challenge for global public health, with approximately 39 million people living with HIV-1 as of 2022. To date, there is neither a curable drug nor a prophylactic vaccine for clinical use against HIV-1 infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sun et al., 2023b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sun et al., 2023a</xref>). Antiretroviral therapy (ART) can effectively control HIV-1 replication to an undetectable level, but the termination of ART usually results in prompt viral rebound from latent viral reservoirs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Archin et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Looker et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Calistri et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Heng et al., 1994</xref>). Thus, it is of great priority to explore novel strategies for curing HIV latency. The “Shock and Kill” strategy is considered a promising approach for purging HIV-1 reservoirs, involving the activation of latently infected cells to express viral products (Shock), followed by viral cytopathic effects or specific cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs) to eliminate the activated cells (Kill) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wu et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Yang et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kim et al., 2018</xref>). Numerous latency-reversing agents (LRAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Yang et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wu et al., 2022</xref>), including methylation inhibitors, histone deacetylase (HADC) inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Archin et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lehrman et al., 2005</xref>), and bromodomain and extra terminal domain (BET) protein inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Li et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bisgrove et al., 2007</xref>), have been identified to reactivate latent HIV-1 in preclinical studies, but there is no ideal LRA available for clinical patients yet.</p>
<p>Herpes simplex virus (HSV), a human herpesvirus, features a 152-kb double-stranded DNA genome encoding over 80 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Poh, 2016</xref>). Owing to its distinctive genetic background, high capacity, broad tropism, thermostability, and excellent safety profile, the modified HSV constructs have extensive applications in gene therapy and oncolytic virotherapy. For example, talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC), an HSV-1 variant with ICP34.5 deletion and GM-CSF insertion, received FDA approval in 2015 for treating malignant melanoma, showcasing notable safety and efficacy in clinical practice. Recombinant HSV-based constructs have also emerged as efficacious gene delivery vectors against infectious diseases. Early studies indicated that prophylactic vaccines based on HSV, expressing simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) antigens, could elicit robust antigen-specific CTL responses in mice and monkeys, providing enduring and partial protection against pathogenic SIVmac239 challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kaur et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Murphy et al., 2000</xref>). Moreover, increasing data suggest the crucial role of HIV-specific CTL in controlling viral replication and eliminating potential HIV reservoirs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Collins et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Leitman et al., 2017</xref>). Significantly, epidemiological research suggests a synergistic effect between HSV and HIV infections, with HSV infection in HIV patients being associated with increased HIV-1 viral load and disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Looker et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Calistri et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Heng et al., 1994</xref>). Some studies have further unveiled the ability of HSV to activate HIV latent reservoirs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Amici et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Amici et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Pierce et al., 2023</xref>). Given the potential of HSV to simultaneously induce antigen-specific immune responses and reactivate latent viral reservoirs, we propose a proof-of-concept strategy to achieve an HIV functional cure using a modified bifunctional HSV-vectored therapeutic vaccine.</p>

<title>The modified HSV-ΔICP34.5-based constructs reactivated HIV latency more efficiently than wild-type HSV counterparts</title>
<p>The J-Lat 10.6 cell line, derived from Jurkat T cells containing latent HIV-1 provirus, was infected with wild-type HSV-1 Mckrae strain at different multiplicities of infection (MOI) to assess its capability to reactivate HIV latency. Flow cytometry analysis showed a dose-dependent increase in green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), indicating that HSV-1 can reactivate latent HIV. Subsequently, we infected J-Lat 10.6 cells with an HSV-1 17 strain containing GFP (HSV-GFP) and found significant upregulation of mRNA levels of HIV-1 LTR, Tat, Gag, Vif, and Vpr, demonstrating that the attenuated HSV-1 strain can reactivate latent HIV at different MOIs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>).Using the bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)/galactokinase (galK) system, we then constructed the recombinant HSV deleted with ICP34.5 (HSV-ΔICP34.5) based on HSV-GFP. Notably, we discovered for the first time that the HSV-ΔICP34.5 reactivated HIV latency more efficiently than its parental strain (HSV-GFP). Specifically, mRNA levels of HIV genes (LTR, Tat, Gag, Vpr, Vif) were significantly higher in J-Lat 10.6 cells infected with HSV-ΔICP34.5 compared to those treated with HSV-GFP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), despite the weaker replication ability of HSV-ΔICP34.5 in these cells,as indicated by the mRNA level of HSV UL27 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref><italic>, Figure S1</italic>).</p>

(<bold>I-K</bold>) Primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from people living with HIV (PLWH) were infected with HSV-GFP or HSV-ΔICP34.5.

</fig>
<p>Furthermore, this finding was validated in ACH-2 cells, which are derived from T cells latently infected with replication-competent HIV-1. A significantly higher level of p24 protein, a key indicator of HIV replication, was found in the HSV-ΔICP34.5-infected ACH-2 cells compared to HSV-GFP-treated cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>), and the mRNA levels of HIV-related genes (LTR, Tat, Gag, Vpr, Vif) were also significantly increased (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Subsequently, we generated J-Lat 10.6 cells stably expressing ICP34.5-Flag-Tag (J-Lat 10.6-ICP34.5) using a recombinant lentivirus system and confirmed the expression of the ICP34.5 protein. Our research revealed that HSV-ΔICP34.5 displayed a reduced capacity to reverse HIV latency in J-Lat 10.6-ICP34.5 cells compared to J-Lat 10.6 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). Moreover, in J-Lat 10.6-ICP34.5 cells, the potency of latent reversal agents such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and TNF-α was notably reduced when contrasted with J-Lat 10.6 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). We also confirmed the enhanced reactivation of HIV latency by HSV-ΔICP34.5 in primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from people living with HIV (PLWH) (<italic>Figure S2</italic>). In addition, HSV-ΔICP34.5 induced a lower level of inflammatory cytokines (including IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α) in primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from PLWH compared to HSV-GFP stimulation, likely due to its lower virulence and replication ability (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I-K</xref>). Thus, these data suggested that the safety of HSV-ΔICP34.5 in PLWH might be tolerable. In addition, both adenovirus and vaccinia virus cannot reactivate HIV latency in this study (Figure S3), and the deletion of ICP0 gene from HSV-1 diminished the reactivation effect of HIV latency by HSV-1 (Figure S4), implying this reactivation might be virus-specific. Overall, these findings indicate that the recombinant HSV-ΔICP34.5 construct specifically reactivate HIV latency with high efficiency.</p>

<title>The modified HSV-based constructs effectively reactivated HIV latency by modulating the IKKα/β-NF-κB pathway and PP1-HSF1 pathway</title>
<p>Next, based on RNA-seq analysis for HSV-ΔICP34.5-induced signaling pathways (Figure S5) and previous literature, we explored the mechanism of reactivating viral latency by HSV-ΔICP34.5-based constructs. J-Lat10.6 cells were infected with HSV-GFP or HSV-ΔICP34.5, and results showed that HSV-ΔICP34.5 significantly enhanced the phosphorylation of IKKα/β, promoted the degradation of IKBα, and thus led to the accumulation of p65 in the nucleus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). NF-κB is a well-known host transcription factor that exists in the form of the NF-κB-IκB complex in resting cells, but IκB can degrade and release the NF-κB dimer to enter the nucleus and promote gene transcription in response to external stimulation. Using the coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay, we verified that the ICP34.5 protein had a specific interaction with IKKα/β, and then ICP34.5 could dephosphorylate IKKα/β. Moreover, the overexpression of ICP34.5 effectively inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced NF-κB pathway activation by inhibiting p65 entry into the nucleus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B-C</xref>).</p>

<p>To further clarify the underlying mechanism, we performed the immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) analysis in ICP34.5 overexpressing cells to identify other potential molecules contributing to this reactivation, and we found that ICP34.5 can also interact with heat shock 1 protein (HSF1) (<italic>Table S1</italic>). HSF1 has been reported as a transcription factor correlated with the reactivation of HIV latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Xu et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lin et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zeng et al., 2017</xref>). To test whether HSF1 contributes to the reactivation of HIV latency by HSV-ΔICP34.5-based constructs, KRIBB11, an inhibitor of HSF1, was administered to HSV-ΔICP34.5-infected J-Lat 10.6 cells. The results indicated that the reactivation ability of HSV-ΔICP34.5 was significantly inhibited by KRIBB11 treatment in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D-E</xref>). Furthermore, a significant enhancement of the binding of HSF1 to the HIV LTR was observed upon HSV-ΔICP34.5 infection, leading to an increase in the reactivation of HIV latency (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). The direct interaction between ICP34.5 and HSF1 was also identified by Co-IP assay. Importantly, HSF1 was effectively dephosphorylated at Ser320 as a result of the overexpression of ICP34.5, while no influence on the level of HSF1 expression was observed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G-H</xref><italic>, Figure S6</italic>). Considering that protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) can interact with ICP34.5 and dephosphorylate eIF2α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2011</xref>), we then investigated the interaction between PP1α and ICP34.5 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). Additionally, a direct interaction between PP1α and HSF1 was found, allowing for the dephosphorylation of HSF1 and then affecting its ability to reactivate HIV latency (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J-L</xref>). Collectively, these findings demonstrated that our modified HSV-ΔICP34.5-based constructs effectively reactivated HIV latency by modulating the IKKα/β-NF-κB pathway and PP1-HSF1 pathway.</p>

<title>Recombinant HSV-ΔICP34.5 constructs expressing SIV antigens elicited robust immune responses in mice</title>
<p>Subsequently, we explored the potential of HSV-ΔICP34.5 as a bifunctional therapeutic vector to not only reactivate latent viral reservoirs but also induce antigen-specific immune responses against viral replication. To achieve this, SIV antigen genes were introduced into HSV-ΔICP34.5 vector based onBAC/ galK system. Additionally, the ICP47 gene was ablated to augment the immunogenicity of the HSV vector (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref><italic>, Figure S7</italic>). A series of recombinant HSV-ΔICP34.5ΔICP47-based vectors expressing SIV gag and env antigen were constructed, and the antigen expression of these constructs was confirmed by Western blotting assay (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B and C</xref>). Furthermore, to improve the immunogenicity of the targeted antigen, we fused the SIV gag with soluble PD1 (sPD1), enabling it to competitively bind with PD-L1 and thereby block the PD1/PD-L1 immune inhibitory pathway (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Consistent with the above findings, these HSV-ΔICP34.5ΔICP47-based SIV vaccines also efficiently reactivated HIV latency (<italic>Figure S8</italic>). Then, the immunogenicity of the above modified HSV-ΔICP34.5ΔICP47-based SIV vaccine was assessed in mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Our results showed that these constructs effectively elicited SIV antigen-specific T cell immune responses using the interferon γ (IFN-γ) ELISpot assay and the intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay. Of note, the frequency of SIV Gag-specific IFN-γ -secreting spot-forming cells (SFCs) in the HSV-sPD1-SIVgag group (1350 SFCs per 10<sup>6</sup> splenocytes) was significantly higher than that in the HSV-SIVgag group (498 SFCs per 10<sup>6</sup> splenocytes) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). The frequency of SIV Env2-specific IFN-γ -secreting SFCs in the HSV-SIVenv group was significantly higher than the HSV-empty group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). Furthermore, the polyfunctionality of antigen-specific T cell subsets in response to SIV antigen stimulation was confirmed using the ICS assay (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H-M</xref>). Consistently, the HSV-sPD1-SIVgag group showed a significantly higher frequency of SIV-specific CD3<sup>+</sup> T, CD4<sup>+</sup> T, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets secreting IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α cytokines compared to the HSV-SIVgag group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I-K</xref>). Notably, a heightened proportion of Gag-specific effector memory T cells (Tem) of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell subset in HSV-sPD1-SIVgag group was observed in comparison to the HSV-Gag group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3L</xref>). In addition, a higher frequency of SIV-Env2-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells secreting IFN-γ was observed in the HSV-SIVenv group than in the HSV-empty group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3M</xref>). These data indicated that the vaccines constructed in this study elicited a robust T cell immune response in mice. Moreover, the blockade of PD1/PDL1 signaling pathway effectively enhanced vaccine-induced T cell immune responses, which was consistent with our and other previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wu et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pan et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>).</p>

<title>The modified HSV-based constructs efficiently elicited SIV-specific immune responses in chronically SIV-infected macaques</title>
<p>Next, the immunogenicity of these HSV-vectored SIV vaccines was further investigated in chronically SIV<sub>mac239</sub>-infected rhesus macaques (RMs). To mimic chronically infected HIV patients in clinic practice, all RMs used in this study were chronically infected with SIV and received ART treatment for several years, as reported in our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pan et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Yang et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wu et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wu et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">He et al., 2023</xref>). Based on sex, age, viral load, and CD4 count, nine RMs were assigned into three groups: ART+saline group (n=3), ART+HSV-empty group (n=3), and ART+HSV-sPD1-SIVgag/SIVenv group (n=3) (<italic>Table S2)</italic>. All RMs received ART (FTC/6.7 mg/kg/once daily, PMPA/10 mg/kg/once daily) treatment to avoid the interference of free SIV particles. On day 33 and day 52, these RMs were immunized with saline, HSV-empty, or HSV-sPD1-SIVgag/SIVenv respectively. On day 70, ART treatment in all RMs was discontinued to evaluate the time interval of viral rebound. Samples were collected at different time points to monitor virological and immunological parameters (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). To reduce the impact of individual RM variations, the difference in SIV-specific IFN-γ-secreting SFCs between post-immunization and pre-immunization (ΔSFCs) was used to evaluate the immune response induced by HSV-vectored SIV vaccines. The results showed that SIV Gag-specific ΔSFCs in the ART+HSV-sPD1-SIVgag/SIVenv group were greatly increased when compared with those in the ART+HSV-empty group and ART+saline group (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B-D</xref>). A similar enhancement of SIV Gag-specific TNF-α -secreting CD4<sup>+</sup> T and CD8<sup>+</sup> T subsets was also verified by ICS assay (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>).

<title>The modified HSV-based constructs effectively reactivated SIV latency <italic>in vivo</italic> and delayed viral rebound in chronically SIV-infected, ART-treated macaques</title>
<p>Finally, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy of HSV-sPD1-SIVgag/SIVenv in chronically SIV-infected, ART-treated RMs. Consistent with our previous studies, the plasma viral load (VL) in these RMs was effectively suppressed during ART treatment, but rebounded after ART discontinuation. The VL in the ART+saline group promptly rebounded after ART discontinuation, with an average 8.63-fold increase in the rebounded peak VL compared with the pre-ART VL (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref><italic>, D and E</italic>). However, plasma VL in the ART+HSV-empty group and the ART+HSV-sPD1-SIVgag/SIVenv group exhibited a delayed rebound interval (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B-D</xref>). Remarkably, there was a lower rebounded peak VL than pre-ART VL in the ART+HSV-sPD1-SIVgag/SIVenv group (average 12.20-fold decrease), while a higher rebounded peak VL than pre-ART VL in the ART+HSV-empty group (average 2.74-fold increase) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Then, we assessed the potential effect on the latent SIV reservoirs <italic>in vivo</italic> by administering our modified HSV-based SIV therapeutic constructs in these RMs. Although there were no obvious viral blips observed in these RMs, we found significant suppression of total SIV DNA and integrated SIV DNA provirus in the ART+HSV-sPD1-SIVgag/SIVenv group. However, the copies of the SIV DNA provirus were significantly improved in the ART+HSV-empty group and ART+saline group (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F-G</xref>). More interestingly, we assessed the magnitude of SIV Pol antigen-specific immune responses, which could represent to some extent the level of newly generated virions from the reactivated SIV reservoirs, because SIV Pol antigen was not included in our designed vaccine constructs. Specifically, the Pol-specific SFCs amount on Day 70 (511 SFCs/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs, post-vaccination) was higher than that on Day 33 (315 SFCs/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs, pre-vaccination) in the ART+HSV-sPD1-SIVgag/SIVenv group. In addition, there was a similar observation in the ART+HSV-empty group. In contrast, the Pol-specific SFCs gradually decreased with the duration of ART treatment in the ART+saline group (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>). In addition, the CD4<sup>+</sup> /CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell ratio (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>) and body weight (<italic>Figure S9</italic>) after treatment were effectively ameliorated in the RMs of the ART+HSV-sPD1-SIVgag/SIVenv group, but not in the ART+HSV-empty group and ART+saline group. Our data also demonstrated that there was no significant effect on the cell composition of peripheral blood in the macaques of ART+HSV-sPD1-SIVgag/SIVenv group (Figure S10). Taken together, these findings suggested that the latent SIV reservoirs might be effectively purged because of the effect of simultaneously reactivating viral latency and eliciting SIV-specific immune responses by our modified HSV-based SIV therapeutic constructs, thus resulting in a delayed viral rebound in chronically SIV-infected, ART-treated macaques.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To conquer the continuous epidemic of AIDS, exploring novel strategies to render and eliminate HIV latency should stand as a pivotal pursuit. Currently, numerous strategies, including shock and kill, block and lock, chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, therapeutic vaccination, and gene editing, have been extensively investigated to target the latent HIV reservoirs for an HIV functional cure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Deeks, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Yeh and Ho, 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Maldini et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Herzig et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dash et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dashti et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Walker-Sperling et al., 2022</xref>). However, there is no safe and effective approach for clinical use in HIV patients yet. In the present study, we occasionally found that the modified HSV-ΔICP34.5-based constructs could reactivate HIV latency more efficiently than wild-type HSV counterpart, which inspired us to develop a proof-of-concept strategy based on a bifunctional HSV-vectored therapeutic vaccine, aiming to simultaneously reactivate viral latency and elicit HIV/SIV-specific immune responses for HIV functional cure. Our results indicated that these modified HSV-based constructs efficiently elicited antigen-specific immune responses in mice and chronically SIV-infected macaques, and further therapeutic efficacy experiments showed that this strategy effectively reactivated SIV latency <italic>in vivo</italic> and delayed viral rebound in chronically SIV-infected, ART-treated macaques (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<p>The latent HIV proviruses can harbor it into the host genome with a quiescent transcription state, and thus cannot be recognized by immune surveillance or drug killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Churchill et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Pierson et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, it is critical to disrupt viral latency for developing an HIV cure strategy. Based on our experimental data, the mechanism for efficiently reactivating viral latency by the modified HSV-ΔICP34.5-based constructs may involve regulating the IKKα/β-NF-κB pathway and PP1-HSF1 pathway. Indeed, during its replication, HSV can activate the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) pathway, and thus phosphorylate the protein translation initiation regulator eIF2α, resulting in the initiation of protein translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Farassati et al., 2001</xref>). Previous studies have shown that the reactivation potential of HSV might be intertwined with NF-κB, Sp1, and other unknown transcription factors by ICP0, ICP4, and ICP27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chapman et al., 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Amici et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Vlach and Pitha, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mosca et al., 1987b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Golden et al., 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Vlach and Pitha, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mosca et al., 1987a</xref>). However, the underlying mechanism by which the ICP34.5-deleted HSV construct can greatly improve the reactivation efficacy of HIV latency remains elusive. ICP34.5 is a neurotoxicity factor that can antagonize innate immune responses, including PKR, TANK binding kinase (TBK1) signaling, and Beclin1-mediated apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">He et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Manivanh et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Orvedahl et al., 2007</xref>). ICP34.5 binds to host PP1 and mediates the dephosphorylation of eIF2α, thus allowing protein synthesis and reversing the effects of PKR and host antiviral functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">He et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">He et al., 1998</xref>). In this study, our findings further unveiled an interaction between ICP34.5 and HSF1, resulting in reduced HSF1 phosphorylation via recruitment of PP1α. Interestingly, previous reports indicated that HSF1 could positively regulate HIV gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Rawat and Mitra, 2011</xref>), which is facilitated by its nuclear entry post-phosphorylation and subsequent recruitment of p300 for self-acetylation, along with binding to the HIV-1 LTR. Studies have also shown that HSF1 could further orchestrate p-TEFb recruitment to promote HIV-1 transcriptional elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Peng et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lin et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pan et al., 2016b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Pan et al., 2016a</xref>). Under stress-induced conditions, phosphorylation triggers the formation of the HSF1 trimer, thus facilitating its nuclear entry to bind to heat shock elements (HSEs) for gene transcription regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bonner et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Timmons et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, we also demonstrated that ICP34.5 interacted with IKKα and IKKβ, thereby impeding NF-κB nuclear entry and further curbing HIV latency. Consistently, previous studies have also suggested that ICP34.5 could disrupt the NF-κB pathway and possibly affect the maturation of dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Jin et al., 2011</xref>). Intriguingly, these findings collectively indicated that ICP34.5 might play an antagonistic role in the reactivation of HIV by HSV-1, and thus our modified HSV-ΔICP34.5 constructs can effectively reactivate HIV/SIV latency through the release of imprisonment from ICP34.5. However, ICP34.5 overexpression had only a partial effect on the reduction of the HIV latency reactivation, indicating that HSV-ΔICP34.5-based constructs can also reactivate HIV latency through other yet-to-be-determined mechanisms.</p>
<p>Another observation in this study is that the HSV-sPD1-SIVgag/SIVenv construct elicited robust and persistent SIV-specific T cell immune responses in ART-treated, chronically SIV-infected macaques. Increasing evidence has indicated that HIV-specific cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs) can facilitate the suppression of latent viral reservoirs, and thus, the induction of robust and persistent HIV-specific CTL responses is essential for achieving long-term disease-free and transmission-free HIV control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Collins et al., 2020</xref>). Featured polyfunctional CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells may contribute to HIV elite controllers or long-term non-progressors, a rare proportion of HIV-infected individuals who can spontaneously control viral replication even without ART treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Owen et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ferre et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">O’Connell et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, both our previous study and others have demonstrated that strong antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell immune responses, especially effector memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, were associated with a lower viral load, and <italic>in vivo</italic> CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocyte depletion with intravenous infusion of anti-CD8 monoclonal antibody could lead to dramatical viral rebound in these vaccinated elite macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Perdomo-Celis et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Pandrea et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Sun et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Sun et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pan et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Sun et al., 2012</xref>).

Therefore, to further improve its immunogenicity <italic>in vivo</italic>, some modifications were adopted to optimize the HSV-vectored vaccine. 1) The ICP47 protein, encoded by the US12 gene, can bind to the transporter associated with antigen presentation (TAP) 1/2, inhibiting the transport of viral peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum and the loading of peptides onto nascent major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules to activate CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Orr et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, the ICP47 gene was deleted from our developed HSV vector. 2) Negatively immunoregulatory molecules, including PD1, TIM-3, and LAG-3, are usually involved in the pathogenesis of HIV infection, as well as in chronically SIV-infected macaques. Among them, PD1 upregulation can result in the exhaustion and dysfunction of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Trautmann et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, PD1 expression on memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells might be linked with HIV latency. In this study, we modified the SIV antigen by fusing to soluble PD1 (sPD1), which can block the PD1/PDL1 pathway by competitively binding with PDL1 and thus improve HIV/SIV vaccine-induced CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wu et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pan et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Although promising, there are still some limitations to our study. Firstly, this is a pilot study with a relatively small numbers of RMs, and future studies with a larger number of animals can be conducted to better verify our strategy. Secondly, the HSV-sPD1-SIVgag/SIVenv vaccine resulted in delayed viral rebound and a lower peak viral load post-rebound than pre-ART treatment but did not completely suppress SIV virus rebound in this study, which may be attributed to suboptimal doses and treatment, implying that we should further optimize this regimen for eventually achieving an HIV functional cure in future studies. The current consensus on HIV/AIDS vaccines emphasizes the importance of simultaneously inducing broadly neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune responses. Therefore, we believe that incorporating the induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies into our future optimizing approaches may lead to better therapeutic outcomes. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that our modified HSV-ΔICP34.5-based constructs potentially reactivated HIV/SIV latency by modulating the IKKα/β-NF-κB pathway and PP1-HSF1 pathway, and thereby we developed a proof-of-concept strategy based on a bifunctional HSV-vectored therapeutic vaccine, which can provide insights into the rational design of novel strategies for pursuing an HIV functional cure.</p>

<title>Mouse ethics statement and vaccination</title>
<p>Female BALB/c mice, aged six to eight weeks, were procured from the Experimental Animal Center of Sun Yat-sen University. A total of twenty-five mice were randomly divided into five groups to evaluate the immunogenicity of the recombinant HSV-vector-based SIV vaccine. During the initial week, each mouse was subcutaneously administered a vaccination of 1×10<sup>6</sup> PFU of the respective recombinant HSV-vector vaccines (HSV-empty, HSV-sPD1, HSV-SIVgag, HSV-sPD1-SIVgag, HSV-SIVenv). Following a two-week interval, a booster vaccination was administered via the subcutaneous route using 2×10<sup>6</sup> PFU of recombinant HSV-vector vaccines. The subsequent assessment of the immune response involved ELISpot and intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assays in accordance with the vaccination schedule.</p>

<sec id="s4b">
<title>Ethics statement and vaccination of macaques</title>
<p>A total of 9 chronically SIV<sub>mac239</sub>-infected rhesus macaques (RMs) were included in this study. All RMs received ART treatment (FTC/6.7 mg/kg/once daily, PMPA/10 mg/kg/once daily) for a duration of 33 days. The RMs were allocated into three groups based on their baseline plasma SIV viral loads (VL): ART + saline (n=3) as the control group, ART+ HSV-empty (n=3) as the sham group, and ART+ HSV-sPD1-SIVgag/SIVenv (n=3) as the vaccinated group. On day 0, all RMs received ART treatment. Once the VL dropped below the limit of detection (1×10<sup>2</sup> copies/mL), the vaccinated group and sham group were primed with a subcutaneous vaccination of 1×10<sup>7</sup> PFU HSV-sPD1-SIVgag/SIVenv or HSV-empty, respectively, while the control group received an injection of 0.9% saline. After three weeks of the prime vaccination, the vaccinated group and sham group RMs received a subcutaneous booster vaccination of 5×10<sup>7</sup> PFU HSV-sPD1-SIVgag/SIVenv or HSV-empty, respectively. After two weeks of booster vaccination, the ART treatment for all RMs was interrupted. The immune response was evaluated by IFN-γ ELISpot and ICS assays. Plasma viral load was regularly monitored throughout the studied period.</p>

<title>Peptide pools</title>
<p>The peptide pools, encompassing the complete sequences of SIV Gag, Env, and Pol proteins, comprising 15 amino acids with 11 overlaps, were generously provided by the HIV Reagent Program, National Institutes of Health (NIH), USA. Gag pools comprise 125 peptides, while Env and Pol pools are subdivided into Env1 (109 peptides) and Env2 (109 peptides) pools, as well as Pol1 (131 peptides) and Pol2 (132 peptides) pools. These peptide pools were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma) at a concentration of 0.4 mg/ peptide/mL for subsequent immunological assays.</p>

<title>Construction of recombinant HSV</title>
<p>For the generation of recombinant HSV-vector-based vaccines, we implemented modifications at the ICP34.5 loci through homologous recombination within the BAC-HSV-1 system. Specifically, double copies of the ICP34.5 and ICP47 genes were either deleted or inserted into the respective counterparts: sPD1, SIVgag, sPD1-SIVgag, and SIVenv genes. The sPD1-SIVgag gene was created by fusing the N-terminal region of mouse soluble PD1 (sPD1) with the C-terminal segment of SIVgag, connected by a GGGSGGG linker, which was engineered through overlapping PCR.</p>

<title>SIV viral RNA and DNA copy assays and absolute T cell count</title>
<p>Absolute T cell count and the levels of plasma mRNA and SIV total DNA were quantified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wu et al., 2022</xref>). Plasma viral RNA copy numbers were determined via SYBR green-based real-time quantitative PCR (Takara), using SIV gag-specific primers (<italic>Table S4</italic>). Viral RNA copy numbers were calculated based on the standard curve established using SIV<sub>mac239</sub> gag standards. The lower limit of detection for this assay was 100 copies/mL of plasma. Total cellular DNA was extracted from approximately 0.5 to 5 million cells using a QIAamp DNA Blood Minikit (Qiagen). PCR assays were performed with 200 ng samples of DNA, and SIV viral DNA was quantified using a pair of primers targeting a conserved region of the SIV gag gene, as previously described. Quantitation was performed by comparing the results to the standard curve of SIV gag copies. Integrated SIVmac239 DNA was measured using nested PCR with two sets of primers. The first round used SIVgag-reverse and Alu-forward primers, while the second round used primers specific to a conserved SIVgag region. Quantification was compared to a standard of CEMss/pWPXLD-rc cell genome as our previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Yang et al., 2019</xref>).</p>

<p>In this <bold>useful</bold> study, the authors tested a novel approach to eradicating HIV reservoirs by constructing a herpes simplex virus (HSV)-based therapeutic vaccine and evaluating efficacy in experimental infections of chronically SIV-infected, antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated macaques. While mean viremia at rebound was lower in the HSV vaccine-treated group, the evidence presented appears to be <bold>incomplete</bold>, as the group size was small and the viral load at rebound was highly variable. This is a revised paper, but the support for the conclusions, particularly the effect of the HSV-vectored therapeutic vaccine on the SIV reservoir in the SIV-infected macaques, remains limited.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors constructed a novel HSV-based therapeutic vaccine to cure SIV in a primate model. The novel HSV vector is deleted for ICP34.5. Evidence is given that this protein blocks HIV reactivation by interference with the NFkappaB pathway. The deleted construct supposedly would reactivate SIV from latency. The SIV genes carried by the vector ought to elicit a strong immune response. Together the HSV vector would elicit a shock and kill effect. This is tested in a primate model.</p>
<p>Strengths and weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Deleting ICP34.5 from the HSV construct has a very strong effect on HIV reactivation. The mechanism underlying increased activation by deleting ICP34.5 is only partially explored. Overexpression of ICP34.5 has a much smaller effect (reduction in reactivation) than deletion of ICP34.5 (strong activation); this is acknowledged by the authors that no full mechanistic explanation can be given at this moment.</p>
<p>(2) No toxicity data are given for deleting ICP34.5. How specific is the effect for HIV reactivation? A RNA seq analysis is required to show the effect on cellular genes.</p>
<p>A RNA seq analysis was done in the revised manuscript comparing the effect of HSV-1 and deleted vector in J-LAT cells (Fig S5). More than 2000 genes are upregulated after transduction with the modified vector in comparison with the WT vector. Hence, the specificity of upregulation of SIV genes is questioned. Authors do NOT comment on these findings. In my view it questions the utility of this approach.</p>
<p>(3) The primate groups are too small and the results to variable to make averages. In Fig 5, the group with ART and saline has two slow rebounders. It is not correct to average those with the single quick rebounder. Here the interpretation is NOT supported by the data.</p>
<p>Although authors provided some promising SIV DNA data, no additional animals were added. Groups of 3 animals are too small to make any conclusion, especially since the huge variability in response. The average numbers out of 3 are still presented in the paper, which is not proper science.</p>
<p>No data are given of the effect of the deletion in primates. Now the deleted construct is compared with an empty vector containing no SIV genes. Authors provide new data in Fig S2 on the comparison of WT and modified vector in cells from PLWH, but data are not that convincing. A significant difference in reactivation is seen for LTR in only 2/4 donors and in Gag in 3/4 donors. (Additional question what is meaning of LTR mRNA, do authors relate to genomic RNA??)</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>HSV vectors are mainly used in cancer treatment partially due to induced inflammation. Whether these are suitable to cure PLWH without major symptoms is a bit questionable to me and should at least be argued for.</p>
<p>The RNA seq data add on to this worry and should at least be discussed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this article Wen et. al., describe the development of a 'proof-of-concept' bi-functional vector based out of HSV-deltaICP-34.5's ability to purge latent HIV-1 and SIV genomes from cells. They show that co-infection of latent J-lat T-cell lines with a HSV-deltaICP-34.5 vector can reactivate HIV-1 from a latent state. Over- or stable expression of ICP 34.5 ORF in these cells can arrest latent HIV-1 genomes from transcription, even in the presence of latency reversal agents. ICP34.5 can co-IP with- and de-phosphorylate IKKa/b to block its interaction with NF-k/B transcription factor. Additionally, ICP34.5 can interact with HSF1 which was identified by mass-spec. Thus, the authors propose that the latency reversal effect of HSV-deltaICP-34.5 in co-infected JLat cells is due to modulatory effects on the IKKa/b-NF-kB and PP1-HSF-1 pathway.</p>
<p>Next the authors cleverly construct a bifunctional HSV based vector with deleted ICP34.5 and 47 ORFs to purge latency and avoid immunological refluxes, and additionally expand the application of this construct as a vaccine by introducing SIV genes. They use this 'vaccine' in mouse models and show the expected SIV-immune responses. Experiments in rhesus macaques (RM), further elicit potential for their approach to reactivate SIV genomes and at the same time block their replication by antibodies. What was interesting in the SIV experiments is that the dual-functional vector vaccine containing sPD1- and SIV Gag/Env ORFs effectively delayed SIV rebound in RMs and in some cases almost neutralized viral DNA copy detection in serum. Very promising indeed, however there are some questions I wish the authors explored to answer, detailed below.</p>
<p>Overall, this is an elegant and timely work demonstrating the feasibility of reducing virus rebound in animals, and potentially expand to clinical studies. The work was well written, and sections were clearly discussed.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work is well designed, rationale explained and written very clearly for lay readers.</p>
<p>
Claims are adequately supported by evidence and well designed experiments including controls.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) It looks like ICP0 is also involved in latency reversal effects. More follow-up work will be required to test if this is in fact true.</p>
<p>(2) It is difficult to estimate the depletion of the latent viral reservoir. The authors have tried to address this issue. A more convincing argument to this reviewer will be data to demonstrate that after the bi-functional vaccine, the animals show overall reduction in the number of circulating latent cells. The feasibility to obtain such a result is not clearly demonstrated.</p>
<p>(3) The authors state that the reduced virus rebound detected following bi-functional vaccine delivery is due to latent genomes becoming activated and steady-state neutralization of these viruses by antibody response. This needs to be demonstrated. Perhaps cell-culture experiments from specimen taken from animals might help address this issue. In lab cultures one could create environments without antibody responses, under these conditions one would expect higher level of viral loads being released in response to the vaccine in question.</p>

<p>Thank you for your kind comments and suggestions, which are very helpful in improving our manuscript. We have carefully revised our manuscript and performed additional experiments accordingly, and we now think this version has been substantially improved for your reconsideration.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Strengths and weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Deleting ICP34.5 from the HSV construct has a very strong effect on HIV reactivation. Why is no eGFP readout given in Figure 1C as for WT HSV? The mechanism underlying increased activation by deleting ICP34.5 is only partially explored. Overexpression of ICP34.5 has a much smaller effect (reduction in reactivation) than deletion of ICP34.5 (strong activation); so the story seems incomplete.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your careful review and kind reminder.</p>
<p>(1) We are sorry for the misunderstanding of Figure 1C. In the experiment of Figue 1C, we used an HSV-1 17 strain containing GFP (HSV-GFP) and HSV-DICP34.5 (recombinant HSV-1 17 strain with ICP34.5 deletion based on HSV-GFP) to reactivate the HIV latency cell line (J-Lat 10.6 cell). Since detecting GFP cannot distinguish between HSV infection and HIV reactivation, we assessed the reactivation by measuring the mRNA levels of HIV LTR upon stimulation with either HSV-GFP or HSV-ΔICP34.5. Actually, in Figure 1B, we had verified the reactivation efficacy by infecting J-Lat 10.6 cells with the HSV-1 17 strain containing GFP (HSV-GFP) and found significant upregulation of mRNA levels of HIV-1 LTR, Tat, Gag, Vif, and Vpr. We have adjusted the corresponding descriptions accordingly in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>(2) We agree with your insightful mention that the mechanism underlying increased activation by HSV-ΔICP34.5 is worthy to be further explored in the future study. In this study, we found that ICP34.5 play an antagonistic role with the reactivation of HIV latency by HSV-1 mainly through the modulation of host NF-κB and HSF1 pathways, while HSV-1 (especially HSV-ΔICP34.5) might reactivate HIV latency through NF-κB, HSF1, and other yet-to-be-determined mechanisms. Thus, ICP34.5 overexpression can only a partial effect on the reduction of the HIV latency reactivation by HSV-1. We have mentioned this issue in the revised “Discussion section”. <bold>“</bold><italic>Intriguingly, these findings collectively indicated that ICP34.5 might play an antagonistic role in the reactivation of HIV by HSV-1, and thus our modified HSV-DICP34.5 constructs can effectively reactivate HIV/SIV latency through the release of imprisonment from ICP34.5. However, ICP34.5 overexpression had only a partial effect on the reduction of the HIV latency reactivation, indicating that HSV-DICP34.5-based constructs can also reactivate HIV latency through other yet-to-be-determined mechanisms.</italic><bold>”</bold> (Lines 334 to 340).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) No toxicity data are given for deleting ICP34.5. How specific is the effect for HIV reactivation? An RNA seq analysis is required to show the effect on cellular genes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your questions and suggestions.</p>
<p>(1) It’s well known that ICP34.5 is a neurotoxicity factor that can antagonize host immune responses, and previous studies (in gene therapy and oncolytic virotherapy) have shown that the safety of recombinant HSV-based vector can be improved by deleting ICP34.5. In this study, we also found that HSV-DICP34.5 exhibited lower virulence and replication ability than its parental strain (HSV-GFP) (Figure 1D, Figure S1). In addition, HSV-DICP34.5 induced a lower level of inflammatory cytokines (including IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α) in primary CD4+ T cells from PLWH compared to HSV-GFP stimulation, likely due to its lower virulence and replication ability (Figure 1I-K). In addition, the CD4+ /CD8+ T cell ratio (Figure 5I) and body weight (Figure S9) after treatment were effectively ameliorated in the SIV-infected macaques of the ART+HSV-DICP34.5-sPD1-SIVgag/SIVenv group. Our data also demonstrated that there was no significant effect on the cell composition of peripheral blood in the SIV-infected macaques of ART+HSV-sPD1-SIVgag/SIVenv group (Figure S10). Thus, these data suggest the safety of HSV-DICP34.5 in PLWH might be tolerable. We have added the corresponding description in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>(2) In our study, we found both adenovirus and vaccinia virus cannot reactivate HIV latency (Figure S3). In addition, the deletion of ICP0 gene from HSV-1 diminished the reactivation effect of HIV latency by HSV-1 (Figure S4). Thus, these data suggested the reactivation of HIV latency by HSV-1 might be virus-specific. Of course, this might be further investigated in future studies. We have added the corresponding description in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>(3) To explore the mechanism of reactivating viral latency by HSV-DICP34.5-based constructs, we performed RNA-seq analysis (Figure S5). We have added the corresponding description accordingly in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The primate groups are too small and the results to variable to make averages. In Figure 5, the group with ART and saline has two slow rebounders. It is not correct to average those with a single quick rebounder. Here the interpretation is NOT supported by the data.</p>

<p>We agree with you that this is a pilot study with limited numbers of rhesus macaques. Although the number of macaques was relatively limited, these nine macaques were distributed evenly based on the background level of age, sex, weight, CD4 count, and viral load (VL) (Table S2). All SIV-infected macaques used in this study had a long history of SIV infection and had several courses of ART therapy, which mimics treatment of chronic HIV-1 infection in humans. These macaques were infected with SIVmac239 for more than 5 years, and highly pathogenic SIV-infected macaques have been well-validated as a stringent model to recapitulate HIV-1 pathogenesis and persistence during ART therapy in humans. Indeed, in our Chinese rhesus model, ART treatment effectively suppressed SIV infection to undetectable levels in plasma, and upon ART discontinuation, virus rapidly rebounded, which is very similar with that in ART-treated HIV patients. We think the results of this pilot study were very promising for further studies which will be expanded the scale of animals and then to preclinical and clinical study in our next projects. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
<p>As for your question regarding “the two animals with low VL and slow rebound”, our explanation is following: As mentioned above, these macaques were distributed evenly based on the background level of CD4 count and VL (Table S2), and then there were different change of viral load and viral rebound in different groups. Thus, we think these data can support our interpretation. Moreover, our conclusion can also be supported from at least three evidences.</p>
<p>(1) The VL in the ART+saline group promptly rebounded after ART discontinuation, with an average 8.63-fold increase in the rebounded peak VL compared with the pre-ART VL (Figure 5A, D and E). However, plasma VL in the ART+HSV-sPD1-SIVgag/SIVenv group exhibited a delayed rebound interval (Figure 5B-D).</p>
<p>(2) There was a lower rebounded peak VL than pre-ART VL in the ART+HSV-sPD1-SIVgag/SIVenv group (average 12.20-fold decrease), while a higher rebounded peak VL than pre-ART VL in the ART+HSV-empty group (average 2.74-fold increase) (Figure 5E).</p>
<p>(3） We found significant suppression of total SIV DNA and integrated SIV DNA provirus in the ART+HSV-sPD1-SIVgag/SIVenv group. However, the copies of the SIV DNA provirus were significantly improved in the ART+HSV-empty group and ART+saline group (Figure 5F-G).</p>

<p>Discussion</p>
<p>HSV vectors are mainly used in cancer treatment partially due to induced inflammation. Whether these are suitable to cure PLWH without major symptoms is a bit questionable to me and should at least be argued for.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your kind question comment and question. We confirmed the enhanced reactivation of HIV latency by HSV-∆ICP34.5 in primary CD4+ T cells from people living with HIV (PLWH) (Figure S2). As mentioned above, previous studies have shown that the safety of recombinant HSV-based vector can be improved by deleting ICP34.5. In this study, we also found that HSV-DICP34.5 exhibited lower virulence and replication ability than its parental strain (HSV-GFP) (Figure 1D, Figure S1). In addition, HSV-DICP34.5 induced a lower level of inflammatory cytokines (including IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α) in primary CD4+ T cells from PLWH compared to HSV-GFP stimulation, likely due to its lower virulence and replication ability (Figure 1I-K). In addition, the CD4+ /CD8+ T cell ratio (Figure 5I) and body weight (Figure S9) after treatment were effectively ameliorated in the SIV-infected macaques of the ART+HSV-DICP34.5-sPD1-SIVgag/SIVenv group. Our data also demonstrated that there was no significant effect on the cell composition of peripheral blood in the SIV-infected macaques of ART+HSV-sPD1-SIVgag/SIVenv group (Figure S10). Thus, these data suggest the safety of HSV-DICP34.5 in PLWH might be tolerable. We have added the corresponding description in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this article, Wen et. al. describe the development of a 'proof-of-concept' bi-functional vector based on HSV-deltaICP-34.5's ability to purge latent HIV-1 and SIV genomes from cells. They show that co-infection of latent J-lat T-cell lines with an HSV-deltaICP-34.5 vector can reactivate HIV-1 from a latent state. Over- or stable expression of ICP 34.5 ORF in these cells can arrest latent HIV-1 genomes from transcription, even in the presence of latency reversal agents. ICP34.5 can co-IP with- and de-phosphorylate IKKa/b to block its interaction with NF-k/B transcription factor. Additionally, ICP34.5 can interact with HSF1 which was identified by mass-spec. Thus, the authors propose that the latency reversal effect of HSV-deltaICP-34.5 in co-infected JLat cells is due to modulatory effects on the IKKa/b-NF-kB and PP1-HSF-1 pathway.</p>
<p>Next, the authors cleverly construct a bifunctional HSV-based vector with deleted ICP34.5 and 47 ORFs to purge latency and avoid immunological refluxes, and additionally, expand the application of this construct as a vaccine by introducing SIV genes. They use this 'vaccine' in mouse models and show the expected SIV-immune responses. Experiments in rhesus macaques (RM), further elicit the potential for their approach to reactivate SIV genomes and at the same time block their replication by antibodies. What was interesting in the SIV experiments is that the dual-functional vector vaccine containing sPD1- and SIV Gag/Env ORFs effectively delayed SIV rebound in RMs and in some cases almost neutralized viral DNA copy detection in serum. Very promising indeed, however, there are some questions I wish the authors had explored to get answers to, detailed below.</p>
<p>Overall, this is an elegant and timely work demonstrating the feasibility of reducing virus rebound in animals, with the potential to expand to clinical studies. The work was well-written, and sections were clearly discussed.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work is well designed, rationale explained, and written very clearly for lay readers.</p>
<p>
Claims are adequately supported by evidence and well-designed experiments including controls.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) While the mechanism of ICP34.5 interaction and modulation of the NF-kB and HSF1 pathways are shown, this only proves ICP34.5 interactions but does not give away the mechanism of how the HSV-deltaICP-34.5 vector purges HIV-1 latency. What other components of the vector are required for latency reversal? Perhaps serial deletion experiments of the other ORFs in the HSV-deltaICP-34.5 vector might be revealing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable suggestion. In fact, we are currently further exploring some potential viral genes of HSV-1 that might play a role in the reactivation of HIV latency. We have found that the deletion of ICP0 gene from HSV-1 diminished the reactivation effect of HIV latency by HSV-1 (Figure S4), showing that ICP0 might play a vital role for the reactivation. Of course, this might be further investigated in future studies. We have added the corresponding description in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(2) The efficacy of the HSV vaccine vectors was evaluated in Rhesus Macaque model animals. Animals were chronically infected with SIV (a parent of HIV), treated with ART, challenged with bi-functional HSV vaccine or controls, and discontinued treatment, and the resulting virus burden and immune responses were monitored. The animals showed SIV Gag and Env-specific immune responses, and delayed virus rebound (however rebound is still there), and below-detection viral DNA copies. What would make a more convincing argument to this reviewer will be data to demonstrate that after the bi-functional vaccine, the animals show overall reduction in the number of circulating latent cells. The feasibility of obtaining such a result is not clearly demonstrated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable mention. We have now provided more data about this issue. We found significant suppression of total SIV DNA and integrated SIV DNA provirus in the ART+HSV-sPD1-SIVgag/SIVenv group. However, the copies of the SIV DNA provirus were significantly improved in the ART+HSV-empty group and ART+saline group (Figure 5F-G). We have added the corresponding description in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors state that the reduced virus rebound detected following bi-functional vaccine delivery is due to latent genomes becoming activated and steady-state neutralization of these viruses by antibody response. This needs to be demonstrated. Perhaps cell-culture experiments from specimens taken from animals might help address this issue. In lab cultures one could create environments without antibody responses, under these conditions one would expect a higher level of viral loads to be released in response to the vaccine in question.</p>

<p>Thanks for your kind mention and suggestion. We performed the following cell experiment to address this issue. Primary CD4+ T cells from people living with HIV (PLWH) were isolated, and then infected with HSV or HSV-∆ICP34.5 constructs. As expected, we confirmed the enhanced reactivation of HIV latency by HSV-∆ICP34.5 (Figure S2). Thank you.</p>

<p>(4) How do the authors imagine neutralizing HIV-1 envelope epitopes by a similar strategy? A discussion of this point may also help.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your kind comment. We have added the corresponding discussion in the revised manuscript. “The current consensus on HIV/AIDS vaccines emphasizes the importance of simultaneously inducing broadly neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune responses. Therefore, we believe that incorporating the induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies into our future optimizing approaches may lead to better therapeutic outcomes.” (Lines 384 to 388)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) I thought the empty HSV-vector control also elicited somewhat delayed kinetics in virus rebound and neutralization, can the authors comment on why this is the case?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your careful review and mention. We agree with you that the HSV-1 empty vector does exhibit somewhat a delayed rebound. We think the possible reason is: Although the empty HSV-vector cannot elicit SIV-specific CTL responses, it effectively activates the latent SIV reserviors, and then these activated virions can be partially killed by ART drugs. Therefore, even without carrying HIV/SIV antigens, somewhat delayed kinetics in virus rebound may be observed. Thank you.</p>

<p>(1) The authors should provide toxicity data for HSV transduction after deleting ICP34.5 and provide an explanation of why overexpression of ICP34.5 has such a small effect.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your questions and suggestions. As mentioned above, we now provided data for the safety of HSV-DICP34.5-based constructs.</p>
<p>(1) It’s well known that ICP34.5 is a neurotoxicity factor that can antagonize host immune responses, and previous studies (in gene therapy and oncolytic virotherapy) have shown that the safety of recombinant HSV-based vector can be improved by deleting ICP34.5. In this study, we also found that HSV-DICP34.5 exhibited lower virulence and replication ability than its parental strain (HSV-GFP) (Figure 1D, Figure S1). In addition, HSV-DICP34.5 induced a lower level of inflammatory cytokines (including IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α) in primary CD4+ T cells from PLWH compared to HSV-GFP stimulation, likely due to its lower virulence and replication ability (Figure 1I-K). In addition, the CD4+ /CD8+ T cell ratio (Figure 5I) and body weight (Figure S9) after treatment were effectively ameliorated in the SIV-infected macaques of the ART+HSV-DICP34.5-sPD1-SIVgag/SIVenv group. Our data also demonstrated that there was no significant effect on the cell composition of peripheral blood in the SIV-infected macaques of ART+HSV-sPD1-SIVgag/SIVenv group (Figure S10). Thus, these data suggest the safety of HSV-DICP34.5 in PLWH might be tolerable. We have added the corresponding description in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>(2) We agree with your insightful mention that the mechanism underlying increased activation by HSV-ΔICP34.5 is worthy to be further explored in the future study. In this study, we found that ICP34.5 play an antagonistic role with the reactivation of HIV latency by HSV-1 mainly through the modulation of host NF-κB and HSF1 pathways, while HSV-1 (especially HSV-ΔICP34.5) might reactivate HIV latency through NF-κB, HSF1, and other yet-to-be-determined mechanisms. Thus, ICP34.5 overexpression can only a partial effect on the reduction of the HIV latency reactivation by HSV-1. We have mentioned this issue in the revised “Discussion section”. “Intriguingly, these findings collectively indicated that ICP34.5 might play an antagonistic role in the reactivation of HIV by HSV-1, and thus our modified HSV-DICP34.5 constructs can effectively reactivate HIV/SIV latency through the release of imprisonment from ICP34.5. However, ICP34.5 overexpression had only a partial effect on the reduction of the HIV latency reactivation, indicating that HSV-DICP34.5-based constructs can also reactivate HIV latency through other yet-to-be-determined mechanisms.” (Lines 334 to 340).</p>

<p>(2) How specific is the effect for HIV reactivation? An RNA seq analysis is required to show the effect on cellular genes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your questions and suggestions.</p>
<p>(1) In our study, we found both adenovirus and vaccinia virus cannot reactivate HIV latency (Figure S3). In addition, the deletion of ICP0 gene from HSV-1 diminished the reactivation effect of HIV latency by HSV-1 (Figure S4). Thus, these data suggested the reactivation of HIV latency by HSV-1 might be virus-specific. Of course, this might be further investigated in future studies. We have added the corresponding description in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>(2) To explore the mechanism of reactivating viral latency by HSV-DICP34.5-based constructs, we performed RNA-seq analysis (Figure S5). Results showed that there were numerous differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to HSV-ΔICP34.5 infection. Among them, 2288 genes were upregulated, and 611 genes were downregulated. GO analysis showed the enrichment of these DEGs in cellular cycle, cellular development, and cellular proliferation, and KEGG enrichment analysis indicated the enrichment in pathways such as cellular cycle and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. We have added the corresponding description accordingly in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>I think the authors have done due diligence to the experimental system, and collected evidence to show the feasibility of delaying virus rebound in macaques. However, I would encourage the authors to perform experiments that can back up the claim that delayed virus rebound is due to neutralization effects, or perhaps due to a reduction in viral reservoir. I believe insights into this process will add rigor, and push the relevance of the study to the next level.</p>
