<title>Abstract</title><p>The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) can trigger immune responses and directly entrap pathogens, but it is not known to encode for active immune factors. The immune system is traditionally thought to be exclusively nuclear-encoded. Here, we report the identification of a mitochondrial-encoded host defense peptide (HDP) that presumably derives from the primordial proto-mitochondrial bacteria. We demonstrate that MOTS-c (mitochondrial open reading frame from the twelve S rRNA type-c) is a mitochondrial-encoded amphipathic and cationic peptide with direct antibacterial and immunomodulatory functions, consistent with the peptide chemistry and functions of known HDPs. MOTS-c targeted <italic>E. coli</italic> and methicillin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA), in part, by targeting their membranes using its hydrophobic and cationic domains. In monocytes, IFNγ, LPS, and differentiation signals each induced the expression of endogenous MOTS-c. Notably, MOTS-c translocated to the nucleus to regulate gene expression during monocyte differentiation and programmed them into macrophages with unique transcriptomic signatures related to antigen presentation and IFN signaling. MOTS-c-programmed macrophages exhibited enhanced bacterial clearance and shifted metabolism. Our findings support MOTS-c as a first-in-class mitochondrial-encoded HDP and indicates that our immune system is not only encoded by the nuclear genome, but also by the co-evolved mitochondrial genome.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The endosymbiotic theory posits that mitochondria originate from once free-living bacteria that infected eukaryotic ancestral cells. Indeed, owing to their bacterial origin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, mitochondria still retain several prokaryotic characteristics, including N-formylated proteins and a circular DNA, that register as quasi-self damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Multiple pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) can sense DAMPs and elicit pro-inflammatory and type I interferon responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Further, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) can be actively released by neutrophils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> and eosinophils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> to physically target pathogens and by lymphocytes to signal type I interferon responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>While mtDNA itself can trigger immune responses and directly entrap pathogens, it is not known to encode for genes that yield immune factors. The continuous expansion of our proteome, powered by the characterization of short/small open reading frames (sORFs) in the nuclear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> and mitochondrial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> genomes that yield functional peptides, provides unprecedented opportunities for the discovery of host defense peptides (HDPs), also known as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. All kingdoms of life possess a vast repertoire of AMPs that are now pursued therapeutically as antibiotics, antivirals, cell-penetrating peptides, immunomodulators, and cancer targeting peptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. HDPs are microproteins of 10 to 50 amino acids in length<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. We have previously identified a mitochondrial-encoded sORF, MOTS-c (mitochondrial ORF from the twelve S rRNA type-c), which yields a 16 amino acid peptide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. MOTS-c has a key role in regulating cellular homeostasis under cellular stress and during aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, in part, by directly translocating to the nucleus to regulate adaptive gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Based on the endosymbiosis theory, early communication between the proto-mitochondria and proto-eukaryotic cell likely occurred on an immunological basis with immune factors that were encoded within both genomes. Today, bacteria still use gene-encoded peptides, known as bacteriocins, that regulate vital cellular processes (<italic>e.g.</italic> ribosomal processes, DNA replication, and cell wall synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>) to control inter- and intra-species proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. In the unique endosymbiotic context, these peptides may have served to not only protect the newly formed union from other pathogens, but also to regulate the growth and metabolism of the opposing quasi-self (<italic>i.e.</italic> the present-day mitochondria and nucleus). Thus, mitochondrial-derived peptides (MDPs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, including MOTS-c, may inherently possess immuno-metabolic functions and represent a primordial arm of the eukaryotic immune system (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) that evolved with dual roles as cellular regulators during aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>The mitochondrial-derived peptide MOTS-c compromises bacterial viability in vitro</title>
<p>HDPs are characterized by their cationic and amphipathic residues, typically with a net positive charge. Peptide analysis using the hydrophobicity scales of Kyte and Doolittle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> and Sweet and Eisenberg<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> indicated that MOTS-c is an amphipathic peptide consisting of a core that is enriched with hydrophobic residues (<sub>8</sub>YIFY<sub>11</sub>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). MOTS-c retains a +3 charge under physiological pH, largely owing to the basic tail residues (<sub>13</sub>RKLR<sub>16</sub>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), which may also serve as a heparin-binding domain (XBBXB-like moiety; B: basic residues) that can bind to cell wall carbohydrates (<italic>e.g.</italic> glucan, mannan) and mediate bacterial recognition and binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Direct bacterial targeting is a hallmark of HDPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Indeed, MOTS-c dynamically associated with bacteria immediately upon contact (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1D</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1H</xref> and S1). We mixed MOTS-c (100 µM) with <italic>E. coli</italic> suspended in water. MOTS-c levels in the media (water) decreased concomitantly with increased detection in cell lysates, indicating direct interaction with bacteria (Figure S1A). HDPs can cause bacterial aggregation, which immobilizes them to the local infection site and enhances pathogen clearance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Consistently, MOTS-c immediately aggregated <italic>E. coli</italic> and MRSA (methicillin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic>) in a dose- and growth phase-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1D</xref> and S1B-1C; Video S1). HDPs engage with bacteria through ionic and hydrophobic interactions owing to their hydrophobic and charged residues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. MOTS-c was ineffective in aggregating bacteria under higher salt concentrations (0-1% in ddH<sub>2</sub>O)(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>), which disrupts ionic interactions and HDP activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. The loss of the hydrophobic and cationic domains of MOTS-c, by substituting the residues with alanine (<italic>i.e.</italic> <sub>8</sub>YIFY<sub>11</sub>&gt;<sub>8</sub>AAAA<sub>11</sub> and <sub>13</sub>RKLR<sub>16</sub>&gt;<sub>13</sub>AAAA<sub>16</sub>), prevented bacterial aggregation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1F</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref> and S1D), consistent with the importance of these residues for HDP function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. MOTS-c did not aggregate <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> or <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (Figure S2), indicating target selectivity independent of Gram status.</p>
<p>HDPs can perturb bacterial membranes via several mechanisms, including progressive blebbing, budding, and pore formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), we visualized a time-dependent progression of MOTS-c-dependent membrane blebbing in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>) and MRSA (Figure S3). Membrane destabilization by HDPs can also cause bacterial aggregation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. We confirmed rapid compromise of bacterial membrane integrity upon MOTS-c treatment using a fluorescent nucleic acid stain that only penetrates permeabilized membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> (Figure S4A). Further, MOTS-c treatment depleted cellular ATP levels in <italic>E. coli</italic> (Figure S4B). Consistently, real-time metabolic flux analyses revealed that MOTS-c treatment perturbed respiration and glycolysis (Figure S4C), which requires intact membrane function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We next confirmed the antimicrobial effect of MOTS-c on bacterial growth.

Two intermediate doses of MOTS-c (50 µM) had comparable effects to a single high-dose treatment (100 µM) (Figure S4D), reflecting the significance of antibiotic treatment frequency in addition to absolute dose. Notably, human HDPs can reach high intracellular concentrations compared to their low circulating levels: LL-37 can reach 40 µM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> and defensins can constitute 5-7% of the total protein content of neutrophils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>.

<p>To confirm the sustained antibacterial effects of MOTS-c <italic>in vivo</italic>, we inoculated female mice with MRSA that had been treated with or without MOTS-c (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2O</xref>).

To further explore whether lethal peritonitis could be induced by high levels of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) alone or if live bacteria were necessary, we simultaneously inoculated a third group of mice with heat-killed MRSA. All mice in this group survived, indicating that live bacteria are required to cause lethal peritonitis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Notably, both the heat-killed MRSA and MOTS-c-treated MRSA groups showed complete survival; however, the group that received MOTS-c-treated MRSA lost weight during the 72-hour infection, suggesting a distinct response to the inoculation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). MOTS-c-treated MRSA, sampled from the inoculated preparation (6×10<sup>8</sup> CFU), showed a 3.4-fold reduction in CFU on LB agar plates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). This suggests that treatment with MOTS-c reduced the MRSA bacterial burden sufficiently for the mice to clear the infection and recover. To determine the level of inflammatory response to MRSA inoculation, we measured circulating cytokines (IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, IFN-γ, and TNF-α) 6 hours post-infection. Indeed, mice inoculated with MOTS-c-treated MRSA had an intermediary induction of cytokines between those of the control and heat-killed MRSA groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2L</xref>). At 72 hours post-infection, cytokine levels in the MOTS-c-treated MRSA group were significantly reduced and closer to those of the heat-killed group compared to the control group (sole surviving mouse), indicating resolution of inflammation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2L</xref>). Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), aspartate transaminase (AST), and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels in circulation indicate kidney and liver injury during lethal infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. After 72 hours, mice inoculated with MOTS-c-treated MRSA had lower BUN levels and no difference in AST and ALT levels compared to the heat-killed MRSA group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2M</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2O</xref>). This suggests that the MOTS-c-treated MRSA group induced an inflammatory immune response without significant organ damage. These results were consistent in male mice, with 20% <italic>vs.</italic> 100% survival in the control and MOTS-c-treated group, respectively, and a 19.8-fold reduction in CFU of sampled inoculated MRSA preparation (4×10<sup>8</sup> CFU) on LB agar plates (Figure S5). This indicates that, similar to other known HDPs, the antimicrobial effects of MOTS-c depend on the stoichiometric ratio of MOTS-c:MRSA and their proximity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>.

Because (i) the discovery of MOTS-c was inspired by a prior study demonstrating interferon gamma (IFNγ)-induced transcripts from the mitochondrial rRNA genes in monocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup> and (ii) MOTS-c regulates adaptive cellular responses to various types of stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that it may act as a modulator of monocyte activation and differentiation. Endogenous MOTS-c levels dynamically increased in a time-dependent manner upon monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation in (i) primary human peripheral blood monocytes by M-CSF (macrophage colony stimulating factor)(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) and (ii) a human monocytic cell line (THP-1) by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Since they recapitulated the dynamics of MOTS-c upon differentiation signals and they are a tractable cell line, we decided to perform follow-up experiments primarily in the THP-1 system. Endogenous MOTS-c was also induced in THP-1 monocytes in a time-dependent manner following stimulation with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and IFNγ (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), a combination of bacterial-derived and cytokine-dependent signals known to synergistically activate monocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>.

Consistent with our previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, exogenously treated MOTS-c readily entered THP-1 monocytes (Figure S7B); the uptake was significantly retarded at a lower temperature (4°C)(Figure S7C), indicating the potential involvement of active transport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup>. Exogenously treated MOTS-c peptide also showed strong nuclear localization (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4B</xref> and S7D). To test whether MOTS-c regulates nuclear transcriptional programming during early monocyte differentiation, we performed bulk RNA-seq on THP-1 monocytes that were treated with PMA or PMA+MOTS-c for 2 hours (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4H</xref>).

<p>Due to the impact of MOTS-c on the transcriptome of THP-1 monocytes, we then asked whether MOTS-c can regulate monocyte differentiation to produce macrophages that are functionally distinct. A single exposure to MOTS-c during differentiation enhanced monocyte adherence, an important step for extravasation and differentiation to macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref></sup>. We found that a greater number of MOTS-c-programmed primary human monocytes became adherent 3 days (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>) and 6 days (Figure S8A) after M-CSF stimulation, indicating an accelerated differentiation program, consistent with our RNA-seq analysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4G</xref>). Next, we exposed THP-1 monocytes to MOTS-c at the onset of differentiation and functionally characterized the MOTS-c-programmed macrophages 4 days later.

<p>Specifically, we used single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to determine whether early exposure (during the first 3 days of differentiation) of primary mouse bone marrow progenitors to MOTS-c may promote the emergence of transcriptionally distinct macrophage subsets. Because of the age-dependent shift in macrophage adaptive capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">119</xref></sup>, we collected bone marrow cells from young (4 mo.) and old (20 mo.) mice of both sexes and differentiated them for 7 days +/- MOTS-c into bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). MOTS-c was given only once concomitantly with M-CSF at the onset of differentiation, and the media was replaced after 3 days in both the control- and MOTS-c-treated conditions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). scRNA-seq was performed at day 7 of differentiation, generating libraries for each biological group separately (N = 5 animals per group, one library for each group obtained by equicellular mixing of BMDMs from each animal). To minimize the negative impact of batch effects, all samples were processed in parallel from bone marrow collection to library preparation and sequencing.</p>
<p>First, we asked whether there were global changes to mature BMDM transcriptomes upon only early exposure to MOTS-c, irrespective of age and sex. For this purpose, we decided to leverage a pseudobulk approach, which best controls false discovery rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">120</xref></sup>. After aggregating reads for each independent library, we normalized the data using the Variance Stabilizing Transformation from the ‘DESeq2’ R package. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) revealed that macrophages were clearly separated by age on dimension 1 and by MOTS-c treatment on dimension 2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Intriguingly, female BMDMs showed greater shift in response to MOTS-c treatment than male BMDMs; notably, female MOTS-c-treated BMDMs appeared “masculinized” (<italic>i.e.</italic> closer to male samples in MDS space, and with reduced sample-to-sample distance; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6B</xref> and S9). With limited sample number, future work will be needed to elucidate interactions of MOTS-c treatment with age and sex in the context of BMDM transcriptional programming.

<p>Using a shared nearest neighbor (SNN) modularity optimization with the ‘Seurat’ R package, we identified 8 BMDM clusters, indicative of different latent transcriptional states, consistent with a heterogeneous mature macrophage population. Importantly, the 8 distinct single-cell BMDM clusters were comprised of cells from young and old mice of both sexes [cluster labeling is shown on our data using a nonlinear dimensionality-reduction technique, UMAP (uniform manifold approximation and projection)] (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Intriguingly, 2 clusters (clusters 5 and 6) were consistently enriched in MOTS-c-treated condition and their increase was more pronounced in BMDMs derived from older animals regardless of sex (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6E</xref>; Table S3). To note, aging alone increased the proportion of clusters 5 and 6 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>; upper panels), consistent with the connection between MOTS-c signaling and aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c121">121</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">123</xref></sup>. Cluster 5 was largely enriched in the expression of genes relevant to antigen presentation, whereas cluster 6 showed increased expression of interferon-related genes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6F</xref>-<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6G</xref> and S10-S11; full analysis in Table S3); some genes were shared between these categories. Consistently, overrepresentation analysis using Gene Ontology Biological Process terms (GOBP) showed a clear signature of antigen presentation processes for cluster 5 and IFN-related processes for cluster 6 (FDR &lt; 5%; top 20 pathways in Figure S12; full analysis in Table S4). Notably, interferon signaling can be triggered not only by mtDNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, but can also induce the expression mtDNA-encoded MOTS-c (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we identify MOTS-c as a first-in-class mitochondrial-encoded HDP that can target bacteria and modulate monocyte differentiation. MOTS-c influenced nuclear gene expression during the early phase of monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation to generate distinct macrophage populations that are adapted to bacterial clearance. Our current working model is that MOTS-c initially mounts a preemptive attack on bacteria by aggregating them and preventing growth, then influences monocyte differentiation for efficient microbial clearance. Notably, HDPs possess anti-inflammatory effects upon clearing pathogens to promote a non-inflammatory post-infection resolution and alleviate over-responsive inflammation (<italic>e.g.</italic> sepsis)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">129</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">130</xref></sup>, consistent with the systemic anti-inflammatory effects of MOTS-c<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c131">131</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c143">143</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Our initial hypothesis was that interbacterial communication using peptides may still exist between bacteria-derived mitochondria and bacteria. Endosymbiosis is a form of sustained infection whereby the primal bacteria and our ancestral cell communicated to coordinate the establishment of mitochondria and eukaryotic life. Such communication was likely derived from immunological processes to regulate each other, which may have laid the foundation for cellular signal transduction. HDPs often regulate highly-conserved cellular functions, such as ribosomes and protein metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c144">144</xref></sup>, consistent with the stress-responsive regulatory functions of MOTS-c in mammalian cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c145">145</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c149">149</xref></sup>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4H</xref>). Evidence for MOTS-c as a therapeutic agent against MRSA in mice adds translational potential for mtDNA-encoded immune peptides for combating bacterial infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c150">150</xref></sup>. Further, it is likely that MOTS-c, consistent with other HDPs, may also target viruses. Human myeloblast cells that were infected with Sendai virus to induce IFN expression showed considerable induction of transcripts from the mitochondrial rRNA loci (∼75% of induced transcripts)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>, a study that influenced the discovery of MOTS-c<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Consistently, we found that MOTS-c is endogenously expressed in monocytes and that it can be induced by IFNγ stimulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>
<p>Our data supports an immunological role for mitochondrial-encoded MOTS-c and provides a proof-of-principle for mitochondrial-encoded HDPs. Together with the ever-increasing identification of sORFs in both our mitonuclear genomes, multiple unannotated HDPs may exist in humans with the potential for clinical use against a broad range of infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c151">151</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c152">152</xref></sup>.</p>

The final average sequencing depth per cell was ∼70,000 reads per cell.</p>

<title>BMDM single-cell RNA-seq data analysis</title>
<p>Reads were hard trimmed to yield the lengths expected by the CellRanger pipeline (Read1: 26bp, Read 2: 98bp) using the fastx_trimmer tool from the FASTX Toolkit v0.0.13 [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/">http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/</ext-link>]. The raw sequencing data has been deposited to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (accession number PRJNA769064). Trimmed reads were then processed using CellRanger software version 3.0.2 and the mm10 mouse genome reference for mapping, cell identification and UMI processing (10X Genomics). Analyses for single-cell RNA-seq were performed using R version 3.6.3 (single-cell level clustering and marker identification) or 4.1.2 (pseudobulk analysis).</p>
<p>Since sequencing on new generation Illumina patterned flow cells can lead to the emergence of non-physiological chimeric reads, phantom molecules were identified and removed from the cellranger h5 output using the PhantomPurge 1.0.0 R package <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c160">160</xref></sup>. After purging, data was converted to the ‘Seurat’ format for single cell analysis for analysis with Seurat 3.2.2 package <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c161">161</xref></sup>. Genes detected in at least 50 cells, and cells with greater than 1000 genes and less than 10% of mitochondrial genes were selected for downstream analysis, yielding 15,415 cells and 11,622 genes passing quality control filters. The impact of number of genes detected per cells, percentage mitochondrial read and cell cycle phase were regressed out as recommended by the Seurat package. We next leverage the DoubletFinder 2.0.3 package <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c162">162</xref></sup> to identify and filter out likely cell doublets, assuming a 2.3% doublet formation rate based on 10xGenomics estimates when capturing 3,000 cells per samples. After this, 15,060 cells were identified as singlets by DoubletFinder and used for downstream analyses. Data was normalized using the SCtransform framework. We then ran Principal Component Analysis (PCA), dimensionality reduction using UMAP using 30 principal components, and clustering with a resolution set to 0.2, yielding a total of 8 clusters. Cluster markers were identified using the “FindAllMarkers” function with a minimum 25% of cells and a log<sub>2</sub>fold change threshold of 0.25 using the Wilcoxon-test, and a significance threshold of FDR &lt; 0.05.</p>
<p>To analyze the scRNA-seq dataset with a pseudobulk approach, unnormalized counts were aggregated from cells within the same group (8 groups across age, sex, and MOTS-c treatment). Using R version 4.1.2 and the DESeq2 1.34.0 R package, differential transcriptomic profiles between the groups was estimated and visualized with multidimensional scaling (MDS). To estimate the pairwise distance between female and male pseudobulk samples, we used a distance metric based on Spearman Rank Correlation Rho (1-Rho). The distance of each female sample to both male samples was calculated in the control and MOTS-c treated conditions. To determine whether the distance between female and male samples was reduced upon MOTS-c treatment (as hypothesized based on the MDS analysis), we then used a paired one-sided Wilcoxon Rank sum test to compare the distances in control <italic>vs.</italic> MOTS-c treated conditions.</p>

<title>BMDM single cell Gene Ontology cluster marker data analysis</title>
<p>To analyze which functional categories were enriched in association to BMDMs in clusters 5 and 6, whose frequency increased upon MOTS-c treatment, we used overrepresentation analysis with clusterProfiler 3.14.3 and annotation package org.Mm.eg.db 3.10.0. Enrichment was computed against the background of all expressed genes detected in the single cell dataset.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study presents findings on the mode of action of MOTS-c (mitochondrial open reading frame from the twelve S rRNA type-c), and its impact on monocyte-derived macrophages. The authors present <bold>solid</bold> evidence for its increased expression in stimulated monocytes/macrophages, its direct bactericidal functions, as well as its role in the modulation of monocyte differentiation into macrophages. Since most of the data were generated from a cell line (THP1), future work is required to validate observations in primary cells and to further support the claims of this work.</p>

The read-out used for macrophage differentiation (adherence to plastic) is also not very robust, and the authors would need to analyze other parameters such as cell surface markers. It is also not clear whether MOTS-c could act in a cell-intrinsic fashion, as the authors have exposed cells to exogenous MOTS-c in all their experiments. The authors have also analyzed the transcriptomic changes induced by MOTS-c exposure in macrophages derived from young or old mice. While the results are potentially interesting, the differences observed seem independent from MOTS-c and mainly related to age, therefore the conclusions from this figure are not clear. The physiological relevance of this study is also unclear.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>In this work, the authors examine the mechanism of action of MOTS-c and its impact on monocyte-derived macrophages. In the first part of the study, they show that MOTS-c acts as a host defense peptide with direct antibacterial activity. In the second part of the study, the authors aim to demonstrate that MOTS-c influences monocyte differentiation into macrophages via transcriptional regulation.</p>
<p>Major strengths.</p>
<p>Methods used to study the bactericidal activity of MOTS-c are appropriate and the results are convincing.</p>
<p>Major weaknesses.</p>
<p>Methods used to study the impact on monocyte differentiation are inappropriate and the conclusions are not supported by the data shown. A major issue is the use of the THP-1 cell line, a transformed monocytic line which does not mimic physiological monocyte biology. In particular, THP-1 differentiation is induced by PMA, which is a completely artificial system and conclusions from this approach cannot be generalized to monocyte differentiation. The authors would need to perform this series of experiments using freshly isolated monocytes, either from mouse or human. The read-out used for macrophage differentiation (adherence to plastic) is also not very robust, and the authors would need to analyze other parameters such as cell surface markers. It is also not clear whether MOTS-c could act in a cell-intrinsic fashion, as the authors have exposed cells to exogenous MOTS-c in all their experiments. The authors did not perform complementary experiments using MOTS-c deficient monocytes. The authors have also analyzed the transcriptomic changes induced by MOTS-c exposure in macrophages derived from young or old mice. While the results are potentially interesting, the differences observed seem independent from MOTS-c and mainly related to age, therefore the conclusions from this figure are not clear. Another concern is the reproducibility of the experiments, as the authors do not indicate the number of biological replicates analyzed nor the number of independent experiments performed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In this study, we employed the THP-1 cell line as a proof-of-principle to elucidate the existence of a firstin-class mitochondrial-encoded host defense peptide. This peptide is expressed in monocytes and serves dual functions: i) direct targeting of bacteria, and ii) regulation of monocyte differentiation. It is noteworthy that THP-1 cells differentiated by PMA have been widely utilized as a model for monocyte differentiation by numerous research groups.  While we acknowledge the significance of utilizing primary monocytes to fully comprehend the translational implications of our findings, conducting a complete replication of our experiments in primary monocytes falls beyond the scope of this study. However, we have conducted several pivotal experiments in primary monocytes, including:</p>
<p>i) Demonstration of the induction of endogenous MOTS-c in primary human monocytes during differentiation by M-CSF (Fig 3A).</p>
<p>ii) Observation of an increased number of adhered monocytes during monocyte differentiation following MOTS-c treatment (Fig 5A).</p>
<p>iii) Examination of the transcriptional regulation in mouse primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) by MOTS-c, seven days after a single treatment at the onset of differentiation (Fig 6).</p>
<p>In addition to assessing adherence to plastic, we performed RNA-seq of THP-1 cells during early differentiation with MOTS-c as a measure of accelerated differentiation (Fig 4). The positive correlation between the effects of PMA and PMA+MOTS-c suggests that MOTS-c accelerates the transcriptional changes that occur during differentiation (Fig 4G). We consider this method a more comprehensive evaluation of differentiation as it encompasses the expression of thousands of genes rather than relying on a limited selection of cell surface markers. Future investigations should explore additional indicators of differentiation, including potential epigenetic effects of MOTS-c.</p>
<p>Our findings indicate that endogenous MOTS-c is induced during monocyte stimulation and translocates into the nucleus (Figs 3-4), implying a cell-intrinsic role for MOTS-c during monocyte differentiation. Although examining MOTS-c deficient monocytes would offer valuable insights, technical limitations currently hinder the production of such monocytes due to the mitochondrial genomic encoding of MOTSc within the 12S rRNA.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our study reveals that MOTS-c alters gene expression in macrophages similarly across age and sex groups. This observation, illustrated in Fig 6E where the fold changes in clusters 5 and 6 in response to MOTS-c were consistent across all groups, suggests that MOTS-c modulates macrophage gene expression in an age-related manner. We postulate this to be an adaptive response to age-related alterations in the monocyte and macrophage microenvironment.</p>
<p>The number of biological replicates performed for each experiment is indicated.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The different parts of the manuscript do not appear well connected and it is not clear what the main message from the manuscript would be. The physiological relevance of this study is also unclear.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The main message of our manuscript is that the mitochondrial genome encodes for a previously unknown host defense peptide that has physiological roles in modulating immune responses during infection and during aging. We have edited the ‘introduction’ to clarify this.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The research study presented by Rice et al. set out to further profile the host defense properties of the mitochondrial protein MOTS-c. To do this they studied i. the potential antimicrobial effects of MOTS-c on common bacterial pathogens E.coli and MRSA, ii. the effects of MOTS-c on the stimulation and differentiation of monocytes into macrophages. This is a well performed study that utilizes relevant methods and cell types to base their conclusions on. However, there appear to be a few weaknesses to the current study that hold it back from more broad application.</p>
<p>Comment 1: From reading the manuscript methods and results, it is unclear exactly what the synthetic MOTS-c source is. Therefore it is hard to determine whether there may be any impurities in the production of this synthetic protein that may interfere with the results presented throughout the manuscript. Though, the data presented in Supplemental Figure 4F, where E.coli expressing intracellular MOTS-c inhibited bacterial growth certainly support MOTS-c specific effects. Similarly with the experiments showing endogenous MOTS-c levels rising in stimulation and differentiated macrophages (Figure 3).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have edited our manuscript to include the source and purity of our synthetic MOTS-c peptide. The MOTS-c peptide used was synthesized by New England Peptides (now Biosynth) with a purity &gt;95% by mass spectrometry.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 2: It is interesting that the mice receiving bacteria coupled with MOTS-c lost about 10% of their body weight. It would have been interesting to demonstrate the cause of this weight loss since the effect appears to be separate from mere PAMPs as shown by using heat-killed MRSA in Supplemental Figure 5. Was inflammation changed? Is this due to changes in systemic metabolism? Would have been interesting to have seen CRP levels or circulating liver enzymes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested, we repeated this experiment to include both the heat-killed and MOTS-c-MRSA groups in the same controlled experiment for comparison (Fig 2; see below). Blood was collected from these mice for evaluation of cytokine levels and markers of organ damage. While only 1/6 controls survived, all MOTSc and heat-killed MRSA-treated mice survived. However, compared to the heat-killed group, the MOTS-cMRSA group lost more weight and had a higher inflammatory profile, but still significantly less than in the control group. We hypothesize that this is due to only partial killing of MRSA by MOTS-c, as suggested by the CFU plated after overnight incubation, leading to a non-lethal infection in these mice. Others have shown that in this peritonitis model, α-hemolysin production by live MRSA is a key factor in toxicity, rather than PAMP-induced shock (PMID: 8975909; 22802349), which is consistent with the absence of death following heat-killed MRSA inoculation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Despite these concerns, the data are well suited to answering their research question, and they open up the door to studying how mitochondrial peptides like MOTS-c could have roles outside of the mitochondria.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Suggestions for improvement</p>
<p>(1) The authors need to indicate in each legend the number of biological replicates analyzed and the number of independent experiments performed. This is essential.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have included the number of biological replicates analyzed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors need to repeat the key experiments using freshly isolated monocytes, either human or mouse. THP-1 cells are abnormal cells and findings from these cells cannot be generalized to monocytes. For instance, in Figures 3A and B, it is clear that the kinetics of MOTS-c expression are different between THP-1 cells and human blood monocytes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The kinetics of THP-1 cells compared to human monocytes are slightly different, as expected by using different cells and different differentiation cues (M-CSF vs PMA). However, our findings collectively demonstrate the same effect, that each stimulus transiently induces the expression of MOTS-c within 24 hours in monocytes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Figure 3A, the authors should show what happens in the absence of MCSF. Is MOTS-c expression upregulated by culture alone?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There is some degree of baseline expression of MOTS-c in a resting state, and MOTS-c expression is significantly increased upon stimulation. This expression may be higher in primary monocytes than THP-1 cells, given that these monocytes are inevitably stressed by being removed from the native environment and put through the purification process.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In Figure 4A, a control for cytoplasmic contamination in the nuclear fraction is missing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now include GAPDH detection in the nuclear fraction.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The RNA-seq analysis shown in Figure 4 is not very informative. What genes are differentially expressed? The authors should provide a list of these genes as supplementary information and highlight some key genes in the figure and text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The complete list of these genes is provided in Tables S1 and S2. We chose not to highlight specific genes in this paper due to the lack of sufficient evidence identifying any particular genes as key factors at this time.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) In Figure 5A, a control is missing: the authors should treat the monocytes with the same volume of 'vehicle' (presumably it is water).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In all experiments with MOTS-c treatment, the controls were treated with the same volume of vehicle (water). We have edited legends to state this.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) In Figure 6, the differences observed seem independent on MOTS-c. The conclusions from this figure are overstated and need to be rephrased and clarified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>MOTS-c shifted gene expression in macrophages in a similar manner <italic>regardless</italic> of age and sex, as shown in Fig 6E where the fold changes in clusters 5 and 6 in response to MOTS-c were similar in all groups. Independently, aging alone increases the expression of these same genes related to antigen presentation and interferon signaling, suggesting that MOTS-c shifts macrophage gene expression in an age-related manner – the expression of antigen presentation and interferon-related genes have been shown to be highly age-related (PMID: 36040389, 32669714, 36622281, 31754020). We hypothesize this to be an adaptive response to age-related changes in the monocyte and macrophage microenvironment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Adherence to plastic is not a robust read-out for monocyte differentiation into macrophages. The authors need to examine other parameters, for instance characteristic cell surface markers for macrophages.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As a read-out of accelerated differentiation, in addition to adherence to plastic we performed RNA-seq of THP-1 cells during early differentiation with MOTS-c (Fig 4). The positive correlation between the effects of PMA and effects of PMA+MOTS-c suggest MOTS-c is accelerating the transcriptional changes that occur during differentiation (Fig 4G). We believe this to be a more robust assessment of differentiation as it relies on the expression of thousands of genes rather than a limited selection of cell surface markers. Further studies are needed to assess other read-outs of differentiation, including possible epigenetic effects of MOTS-c.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) It is not clear whether MOTS-c could have a cell-intrinsic effect in monocytes. The results should be strengthened by examining the differentiation of monocytes deficient for MOTS-c (without addition of exogenous MOTS-c).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have shown that endogenous MOTS-c is induced during monocyte stimulation and translocates into the nucleus (Figs 3-4), suggesting that MOTS-c does have a cell-intrinsic role during monocyte differentiation.</p>
<p>While having MOTS-c deficient monocytes would certainly be insightful, because MOTS-c is encoded within the mitochondrial genome in the 12S rRNA there are currently technical limitations in producing these monocytes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Other points</p>
<p>(1) The paper would benefit from a more extended discussion to understand the physiological relevance of these findings. What cells would release MOTS-c in vivo, and how would that affect monocytes ? Is there a cell-intrinsic of MOTS-c in monocytes, and if so what would be the signals inducing its expression during differentiation ? These aspects should be discussed by the authors so that the readers can understand their views.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion and have edited the discussion in our revised manuscript.</p>
<p>MOTS-c has been detected in various tissue and cell types, including the liver, muscle, T cells, monocytes/macrophages, and epithelial cells. This aligns with MOTS-c being referred to in literature as a cytokine, which are typically expressed by a broad range of cell types. Consistent with this, we also propose that MOTS-c would be expressed in cells known to express HDPs.</p>
<p>We hypothesize that MOTS-c acts in both a cell-intrinsic and extrinsic manner in vivo, consistent with known HDPs, to both target bacteria directly and modulate immune cell responses. In vitro, M-CSF, PMA, LPS, and IFNγ each induced MOTS-c expression. In vivo, monocytes respond to a range of stimuli that influence their differentiation, and these stimuli may induce MOTS-c as well. We have previously published that MOTS-c acts primarily under conditions of cell stress, such as nutrient deprivation and oxidative stress, to help restore homeostasis. While MOTS-c did regulate macrophage gene expression in resting “M0-like” macrophages, we hypothesize that the physiological role of MOTS-c is to regulate cell adaptation to stress, therefore the context under which monocytes differentiate will be an important factor determining the functional effects of MOTS-c. In future studies, we plan to test whether the immuno-modulatory effects of MOTS-c are dependent on the environment during differentiation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Scale bar appear to be missing from Figure 1G.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the poor resolution of the scale bar. We have made it easily recognizable in the revised figure.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) It is not very clear what is shown in Figure S2. The authors should better explain what the images represent.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figure S2 is related to Figure 1D and Figure S1. In this experiment, <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>S. typhimurium</italic>, and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cultures were treated with MOTS-c (100uM). We observed that only <italic>E. coli</italic> aggregated immediately, while</p>
<p><italic>S. typhimurium</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> did not show aggregation. This suggests that MOTS-c exhibits specificity in targeting certain types of bacteria, although the underlying basis of this specificity is currently unknown.</p>
<p>We have revised the legend as follows: 'MOTS-c exhibits specificity in bacterial targeting. MOTS-c (100 μM) treatment causes immediate aggregation of <italic>E. coli</italic> but not <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> or <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (n=6). Representative image shown. See Figure 1D'.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>This is a beautifully executed study and a well written manuscript. I generally don't have much critical feedback to give based on my reading. The only recommendation I have to improve the completeness of the data would be in relation to Figure 5E and F. The metabolic phenotype of LPS stimulated monocytes/macrophages is more typically the Warburg effect where oxidative phosphorylation is reduced (as you show with a lowered OCR), but with a concomitant elevation in lactate production. It would have been nice to see either i. the ECAR levels from your seahorse data, or ii. separate lactate measurements on your supernatants. This would go a long way to further explaining the phenotype described in the figure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate the reviewer's positive feedback. The data provided below are ECAR measurements obtained from the Seahorse assay. However, it's important to note that the assays were originally designed for OCR measurement (<italic>e.g.</italic> buffered media unsuitable for ECAR measurements, use of mitochondrial complex inhibitors, etc.), thus rendering the ECAR data unreliable for accurately assessing glycolysis. Consequently, while we share this data with the reviewer, we believe it is inappropriate to include it in the manuscript (hence omitted in the original submission).</p>

</fig>
<p>Furthermore, we are currently engaged in a separate manuscript focusing on elucidating the immunometabolic mechanisms of MOTS-c in macrophages. We intend for this manuscript to stand alone, providing a comprehensive exploration of metabolic pathways, including a detailed untargeted metabolomics map spanning multiple time-points.</p>
