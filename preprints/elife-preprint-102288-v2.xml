<title>Abstract</title><p>Membrane-bound pyrophosphatases (mPPases) are homodimeric proteins that hydrolyse pyrophosphate and pump H<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> across membranes. They are crucial for the virulence of protist pathogens, making them attractive drug targets. In this study, we investigate the inhibitory effects of seven distinct bisphosphonates against <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic> mPPase to explore their mode of action and assist in future small molecule inhibitor development. We solved two structures of mPPase bound to the inhibitors in the enzyme active sites and probed the conformational dynamics of mPPase under multiple inhibitors and functionally relevant conditions by double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy. We found that mPPase adopts distinct conformational equilibria in solution in the presence of different inhibitors, including states consistent with asymmetric binding in the active site (closed-open), but a symmetric apo-like conformation on the periplasmic side (open-open). Combined with solid-supported membrane-based electrophysiology recordings, this revealed that during catalysis, one monomer of the dimer remains open, and Na<sup>+</sup> can only be pumped in a closed state. These results further support symmetry-breaking across the membrane, consistent with half-of-the-sites-reactivity.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>In this revised version, we summarize the main updates:
1. New DEER Data at C599R1
To address concerns about the T211R1 site, we introduced a new spin-label at C599R1 on the cytoplasmic side. This site produced high-quality DEER traces, comparable to S525R1, and revealed clear distance differences between inhibitor-bound states. These data support the presence of asymmetry in TmPPase under the tested conditions.
2. Expanded Inhibitor Panel
We added DEER measurements with alendronate and pamidronate to complement the data from etidronate, zoledronate, and IDP. This strengthens our conclusions on multimodal inhibition and shows that the observed conformational changes are not limited to weak inhibitors.
3. Focused Interpretation of T211R1 Data
We now acknowledge the limitations of the T211R1 site due to its flexible location in loop 5-6. Our conclusions on asymmetry are now based primarily on robust data from S525R1 and C599R1, which consistently show distinct distance shifts.
4. Validation of Structural Asymmetry
We performed a difference electron density analysis by swapping ETD molecules between protomers. The resulting positive and negative peaks confirm different ETD conformations in each protomer, supporting inhibitor-induced asymmetry.
5. Updated Figures and Structural Models:
Figure 7 (now Figure 6) and related models have been revised for consistency with crystal structure-derived distances. Captions now clearly indicate the membrane plane and viewing angles for better clarity.
6. Refined Interpretation of DEER Results
We revised key statements to avoid overinterpretation. Rather than claiming direct proof, we state that the data are consistent with asymmetry, integrating evidence from crystallography, DEER, and prior studies supporting half-of-the-sites reactivity.
7. Enhanced Analytical Rigor
We added supplementary DEER replicates, fitted distance distributions, and confidence intervals. We also addressed concerns about artifacts like the 2+1 echo effect by reanalyzing data in CDA and discussing limitations accordingly.
8. Add two authors

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Membrane-bound pyrophosphatases (mPPases) facilitate the transport of protons and/or sodium ions across membranes while catalysing the breakdown of pyrophosphate (PP<sub>i</sub>), a by-product generated in various cellular synthetic reactions - into inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>). These enzymes are found in plants, certain species of bacteria, protist parasites, and archaea, but are absent from multicellular animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Within these organisms, mPPases are essential for cell survival under diverse stress conditions such as osmotic stress, mineral deficiency, and extreme temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Based on their potassium dependency, mPPases are divided into two families: K<sup>+</sup>-dependent and K<sup>+</sup>- independent. While K<sup>+</sup>-independent mPPases all transport H<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>-dependent mPPases can transport H<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, or both<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Currently, mPPase structures have been reported from three different organisms: <italic>Vigna radiata (</italic>VrPPase), <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic> (TmPPase), and, most recently, a structure from <italic>Pyrobaculum aerophilum</italic> (PaPPase) in complex with imidodiphosphate (IDP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. For TmPPase, several different structural states have been determined, including the resting state (TmPPase:Ca:Mg)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, with two phosphates bound (TmPPase:2P)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, IDP bound (TmPPase:IDP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, IDP and <italic>N</italic>-[(2-amino-6-benzothiazolyl)methyl]-1<italic>H</italic>-indole-2-carboxamide (ATC) bound (TmPPase:IDP:ATC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, phosphate analogue (WO)-bound (TmPPase:WO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, and time-resolved X-ray diffraction structures (with and without substrate/product bound) showing structural asymmetry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Similarly, VrPPase has been solved in multiple states, including IDP-bound (VrPPase:IDP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, single phosphate-bound (VrPPase:P)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, two phosphates bound (VrPPase:2P), and different mutations at the hydrophobic gate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. These structures show that mPPases are homodimeric enzymes, with each monomer consisting of 16 and, as found in sequence databases, occasionally 17 transmembrane helices (TMHs), organised into two concentric rings: the inner ring (TMH5-6, 11-12, and 15-16) and the outer ring (TMH1-4, 7-10, and 13-14). Each monomer consists of four regions: a hydrolytic centre, a coupling funnel, an ion gate, and an exit channel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). To simplify residue comparison between mPPases, we employ the residue numbering scheme XΣ<sup>Y.Z</sup> (superscripts refer to Ballesteros–Weinstein numbering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>), where X represents the amino acid, Σ denotes the amino acid position in TmPPase, Y indicates the helix number, and Z specifies the offset of amino acid positions within the centrally conserved residues of the helix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>mPPases are a promising drug target for treating diseases caused by parasitic protists, such as malaria and leishmaniasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Among the currently available compounds, ATC demonstrates the most effective inhibitory activity against TmPPase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. ATC is bound to a region near the enzyme exit channel of one subunit, which induces structural asymmetry in the mPPase dimer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Functional asymmetry in K<sup>+</sup>-dependent mPPases has also previously been shown by Artukka, et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Anashkin and coworkers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> further supported this hypothesis by analysing the inhibition of <italic>Desulfitobacterium hafniense</italic> mPPase using three non-hydrolysable PP<sub>i</sub> analogues (IDP, etidronate (ETD), and aminomethane bisphosphonate). Bisphosphonates, such as risedronate (RSD) and pamidronate (PAM), serve as primary drugs currently used to combat osteoclast-mediated bone loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Unlike IDP, which contains a P-N-P bond, bisphosphonates have a P-C-P bond, with its central carbon can accommodate up to two substituents, allowing a large compound variability. Therefore, understanding their inhibition mechanism on mPPases is crucial for developing future small molecule inhibitors.</p>
<p>Our previous work on serial time-resolved X-ray crystallography and electrometric studies on TmPPase directly observed structural asymmetry, where two monomers are in different states during PP<sub>i</sub> hydrolysis upon the addition of substrate and Na<sup>+</sup>, supporting a “pumping-before-hydrolysis” energy coupling model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. However, except for the allosteric inhibitor ATC, which binds to a region near the exit channel, crystal structures of TmPPase bound to inhibitors at the active site are symmetric. To probe the proposed asymmetry caused by the inhibitor (and substrate) binding in solution, we employed double electron-electron resonance (DEER), also known as pulsed electron double resonance (PELDOR) spectroscopy. This method relies on the introduction of paramagnetic spin labels at selected protein residues, allowing for precise determination of electron-electron dipolar couplings and subsequently, inter-spin distances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, making it a powerful tool for probing the conformation and dynamics of integral membrane proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, including ion channels, transporters, outer membrane proteins, and receptors in their native environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. As an ensemble technique, DEER can probe the presence of multiple conformational species including lowly-populated protein states, which are key to protein function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Here, we solved two TmPPase structures in complex with ETD and zoledronate (ZLD) and monitored their conformational ensemble using DEER spectroscopy in solution. Overall, bisphosphonates can trigger conformational changes in the active site and near the exit channel of TmPPase in an asymmetric mode and under certain inhibitor-bound conditions; the DEER data are consistent with interspin distances predicted from an open/closed asymmetric model, and correlate with the corresponding X-ray structures. This, along with our electrometric studies detecting the Na<sup>+</sup> signal across the membrane, further suggests that ion pumping requires a fully closed state of one TmPPase monomer, supporting symmetry-breaking across the membrane, consistent with half-of-the-sites-reactivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.</p>

To understand their binding mechanism to TmPPase, we first assessed the binding ability of seven distinct bisphosphonates to TmPPase by testing their inhibitory activity using the molybdenum blue assay (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), with IDP (IC<sub>50</sub> = 56 ± 5 µM) as a positive control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Of the compounds tested, all the straight-chain primary amines (pamidronate (PAM), alendronate (ALE) and neridronate (NER)) had similar IC<sub>50</sub>s, ranging from 117 to 138 µM (<italic>P</italic> = 0.06). Substituting the -NH- of IDP with the –CCH<sub>3</sub>(OH)– of ETD resulted in a weaker IC<sub>50</sub> (&gt; 200 µM). Similarly, branched aliphatic and aromatic bisphosphonates (ibandronate (IBD), ZLD and RSD) also showed weaker inhibition (IC<sub>50</sub> &gt; 200 µM) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. EV1</xref>).</p>
<p>To confirm that the binding of bisphosphonates to TmPPase induces conformational changes in the protein structure, we incubated the enzyme with the inhibitors and performed an <italic>N</italic>-ethyl maleimide (NEM) modification assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. NEM covalently binds to exposed cysteine residues of the protein, forming a carbon-sulfur bond that can inhibit the protein activity if the residue is essential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. The binding of IDP has been reported to prevent the NEM modification of cysteine by reducing cysteine accessibility, thereby preserving TmPPase activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. In the absence of inhibitors, NEM modification resulted in a decrease in TmPPase activity by approximately 40% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>), similar to the activity reduction observed with CaCl<sub>2</sub>, an inhibitor that binds to the open form of TmPPase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Upon the addition of IDP, TmPPase adopts a closed conformation, rendering it resistant to NEM modification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. EV2</xref>); consequently, the enzyme remains largely unaffected by NEM. Although not as effective as IDP, all bisphosphonates prevent NEM modification to a comparable extent (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>

<title>TmPPase structures in complex with bisphosphonate inhibitors</title>
<p>To decipher the structural basis of bisphosphonates inhibition and their binding to TmPPase, we decided to solve their structures since all the bisphosphonates bound to TmPPase despite not being isosteres of PP<sub>i</sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). We obtained protein crystals for all the inhibitors, but they diffracted weakly, except for TmPPase in complex with ETD (TmPPase:ETD) and ZLD (TmPPase:ZLD), which diffracted to resolutions of 3.2 Å and 3.3 Å, respectively. TmPPase:ETD crystallised in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which is a well-known mPPase inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, while TmPPase:ZLD crystallised without Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Both data sets were anisotropic as analysed using the STARANISO server<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Table S1</xref>). We solved both structures by molecular replacement using the resting state structure (PDB ID: 4AV3) as the search model for TmPPase:ETD and the closed IDP-bound structure (PDB ID: 5LZQ) for TmPPase:ZLD. There were two molecules in the asymmetric unit for TmPPase:ETD and four for TmPPase:ZLD.</p>
<p>In the initial round of the refinement for the TmPPase:ETD structure, both chains displayed positive (F<sub>o</sub>-F<sub>c</sub>) density at 3<italic>σ</italic> in their hydrolytic centres that could accommodate ETD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figs. EV3A-B, upper left panel</xref>). We also observed extra density that corresponds to a calcium ion in the resting state structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figs. EV3A,B, upper left panel</xref>). Due to the high Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (0.2 M) in the crystallisation condition, we placed the same ion at this position. After placing Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions and water molecules in the difference density peaks, further rounds of refinement provided us with a reasonable 2mF<sub>o</sub>-F<sub>c</sub> density map in the active site of both monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. EV3A,B, right panel</xref>) and the POLDER (Omit) maps indicate a good fit of the compound to the density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. EV3A,B, bottom left panel</xref>). Finally, the TmPPase:ETD structure was refined to an average resolution of 3.2 Å (h = 3.1 Å, k = 3.6 Å, l = 4.3 Å) with the final R<sub>work</sub>/R<sub>free</sub> of 27.2% / 31.0 % (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Table S1</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, the initial refinement of TmPPase:ZLD revealed positive (F<sub>o</sub>-F<sub>c</sub>) density at 3<italic>σ</italic> that could accommodate ZLD in all four chains in the asymmetric unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figs.

EV4A-D, bottom left panel</xref>). The final refinement shows that the TmPPase:ZLD structure has an average resolution of 3.3 Å (h = 4.5 Å, k = 4.2 Å, l = 3.2 Å) with a final R<sub>work</sub>/R<sub>free</sub> of 25.9 % / 30.4 % (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Table S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Asymmetry in the TmPPase complex with etidronate</title>
<p>Unlike the fully open TmPPase:Ca:Mg structure (PDB ID: 4AV3), there was additional density above the hydrolytic centre in both chains that could be fitted with several residues of loop5-6 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Fig. EV5</xref>). This left eight residues (V208<sup>5.67</sup>-L215<sup>5.74</sup>) in loop5-6 of chain A and three residues (L213<sup>5.72</sup>-L215<sup>5.74</sup>) in chain B unmodeled due to the lack of extra density. In the IDP-bound structure, these loops interact with IDP and form a tightly packed structured lid over the active site. However, in the TmPPase:ETD structure, despite interacting with ETD in both chains, these loops are positioned slightly above the active site (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-D</xref>), with loop5-6 of chain A extending more toward the centre compared to loop5-6 of chain B (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p>

<p>Structural alignment between chain A and B of TmPPase:ETD yields a root mean square deviation (RMSD) per C<italic>α</italic> of 1.44 Å, approximately four times higher than the RMSD between chain A and B in the resting state (RMSD/Cα= 0.39 Å) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Table S2</xref>). Despite the overall structural similarity, further comparison between the monomers of TmPPase:ETD and those in the resting state revealed that chain B of TmPPase:ETD differs most from TmPPase:ETD chain A and from both chains in the resting state structure (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Table S2</xref>). Notably, there are clear differences on the cytoplasmic (hydrolytic) side between the monomers of TmPPase:ETD; chain B adopts a slightly more constricted conformation than chain A (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Bendix analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> showed that three (TMH11, 12 and 15) out of six inner ring helices of chain B are more curved on the cytoplasmic side, bending towards the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig. EV6</xref>). Besides that, the loops on the cytoplasmic side of chain B (loops11-12, 13-14, and 15-16) appear to be more flexible, as indicated by more unresolved residues, compared to those in chain A (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). These observations suggest structural asymmetry between chains A and B in the TmPPase:ETD structure.</p>
<p>The structural asymmetry arises because the binding of ETD<sub>A</sub> to monomer A induced conformational changes in monomer B, thereby affecting the binding pose of ETD<sub>B</sub> in monomer B. ETD comprises two phosphonate groups separated by a central carbon bonded to a hydroxyl group. Compared to the IDP location in the IDP-bound structure, ETDs are positioned above the IDP site, with the lower phosphonate group of ETDs located in the position of the upper (leaving-group) phosphonate group of IDP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). However, the upper phosphonate group of ETDs in chains A (ETD<sub>A</sub>) and B (ETD<sub>B</sub>) is distinctly positioned; ETD<sub>A</sub> is tilted approximately by 35.9° relative to the IDP orientation, while ETD<sub>B</sub> is parallel to the IDP orientation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). The lower phosphonate group position remains the same for both ETDs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). As a result, loop5-6 of the two monomers is oriented differently. In chain A, this loop protrudes towards the active centre and E217<sup>5.76</sup> interacts with ETD <italic>via</italic> a Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion, while in chain B, the loop is more constricted and interacts with ETD <italic>via</italic> D218<sup>5.77</sup>, also mediated by a Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B,C</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Furthermore, ETD<sub>A</sub> and ETD<sub>B</sub> interact with the active site <italic>via</italic> different residues (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C,D</xref>). D465<sup>11.57</sup>, D488<sup>12.39</sup> and N492<sup>12.43</sup> in TMH11 and TMH12 were involved in the interaction with ETD<sub>B</sub> <italic>via</italic> a water molecule. Consequently, these two TMHs undergo slight inward movement, resulting in a more constricted conformation of chain B. Exchanging the ETD positions between the two protomers generated corresponding positive and negative difference electron density peaks, confirming distinct conformations of ETD within each protomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. EV3C</xref>). Nonetheless, the methyl group of ETDs in both chains points towards TMH12 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C,D</xref>), which might prevent complete closure of the hydrolytic centre and downward motion of TMH12.</p>

<title>Structural distinction between zoledronate and IDP-bound TmPPase</title>
<p>In contrast to the TmPPase:ETD structure, the TmPPase:ZLD structure adopts a partially closed conformation. The overall structure is more similar to the IDP-bound structure (RMSD/Cα of 0.760 Å) than the resting state structure (RMSD/Cα of 2.32 Å) (Table. S2). However, compared to the IDP-bound structure, the TmPPase:ZLD structure exhibits noticeable movements in three of six inner ring helices (TMH11, 12 and 15) and seven of ten outer ring helices (TMH1-4 and 7-9). These movements extend outwards from the hydrolytic centre (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), leaving it only partially closed. A cross-sectional view confirms this observation, showing the tunnel extending from the hydrolytic centre to the enzyme surface unlike in the IDP-bound structure, where it is closed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B,C</xref>). This is because ZLD is sterically bulkier than IDP due to the presence of the heteroaryl group, which points towards TMH11, 12, and 15 on the cytoplasmic side.</p>

<p>Although the hydrolytic centre of TmPPase:ZLD is more open, the coordination of the Mg<sub>4</sub>ZLD complex with the active site residues closely resembles that of Mg<sub>5</sub>IDP in the IDP-bound structure (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E,F</xref>). ZLD is nonetheless positioned about 1.0 Å above IDP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>) because the steric bulk prevents it from sitting deeper into the hydrolytic centre.

<title>Probing the solution-state conformational ensemble and dynamics of TmPPase by DEER spectroscopy</title>
<p>The X-ray structures of TmPPase with the different inhibitors bound to the active site show either a closed (TmPPase:IDP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>), resting (TmPPase:Ca<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>) or asymmetric (TmPPase:ETD, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) conformation. The asymmetric structure of the TmPPase with ETD is similar to that observed in our recent time-resolved study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. To probe the TmPPase conformational ensemble in solution under various inhibitor-bound conditions, we employed DEER spectroscopy. We selected three distinct sites (periplasmic side, S525; cytoplasmic side, C599; cytoplasmic side loop region, T211) on TmPPase, which were selectively spin-labelled with 2,5-dihydro-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-[[(methylsulfonyl)thio]methyl]-1<italic>H</italic>-pyrrol-1-yloxy (MTSSL, modification denoted as R1 hereafter) to enable the measurement of interspin distances between the spin-labelled residue pairs. The selected sites were designed to capture the coupled gating transitions and conformational changes occurring on either side of the membrane (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Fig. EV8A</xref>) without interfering with the activity of TmPPase. We achieved high mPPase spin labelling efficiency with no free (<italic>i.e.</italic> unbound or non-specifically bound) MTSSL being present, as evidenced by the continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (CW-EPR) spectra recorded at room temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Fig. EV9</xref>). CW-EPR spectra, which relates to the rotational correlation time, indicated that the spin label mobility increased sequentially from C599R1 to S525R1 and further to T211R1 across several tested conditions (<italic>apo</italic>, +Ca, +Ca/ETD, +ETD, +IDP <italic>etc</italic>.). This mobility trend aligns with the location of T211R1 on an exposed loop, which explains its higher mobility, whereas spin labelling of the more buried C599R1 required the addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> during sample preparation to induce partial structural opening. Unlike DEER, which provides insights into the long-range conformational changes of membrane proteins, CW-EPR offers information on the local environment of the spin label. The results show no significant difference in the local environment between the <italic>apo</italic> and inhibitor-bound state(s).</p>

<p>In addition, we generated <italic>in silico</italic> predictions of distance distributions for the three sites (S525R1, T211R1, and C599R1) using MtsslWizard<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> and ChiLife<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, based on the X-ray structures of TmPPase bound to different molecules (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Fig. EV8</xref>). In the case of T211R1, the X-ray electron density in loop<sub>A</sub>5-6 of the TmPPase:ETD (residues V208<sup>5.67</sup>-L215<sup>5.74</sup>: VGKTELNL) and TmPPase:Ca (residues T211<sup>5.70</sup>-R221<sup>6.28</sup>: TELNLPEDDPR) structures is missing, suggesting a highly dynamic or disordered state for this region. We therefore modelled this region using the Rosetta server<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> and used that to generate <italic>in silico</italic> distance distributions. These were overlaid with the experimentally derived DEER distance distributions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D, G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Fig. EV8D</xref>) for comparison. All T211R1 distance distributions were broad, consistent with the increased spin label mobility observed by CW-EPR, and the highly dynamic nature of these loop regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Owing to the featureless raw DEER data recorded for 211R1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Fig EV8</xref>), and broad distance distributions, we refrain from interpreting equilibria shifts based on this mutant. On the other hand, TmPPase dimers labelled at positions S525R1 and C599R1, located on opposite sides of the membrane, yielded high-quality DEER traces. Under all eight conditions tested (<italic>apo</italic>, +Ca, +Ca/ETD, +ETD, +IDP, +ZLD, +PAM, +ALE) for each site, strong dipolar oscillations were observed in the raw DEER data yielding robust distance distributions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B, E</xref>). This indicates that the modal distance shifts observed within the TmPPase ensemble are highly reliable. Both DeerAnalysis2022<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> and ComparativeDeerAnalyser 2.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> were used for background correction and regularisation of the dipolar traces, and their resulting distance distributions were in good agreement (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C, F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">Fig. EV10</xref>).</p>
<p>The separation of the S525R1 pair in the <italic>apo</italic> state (with no Ca<sup>2+</sup> or inhibitor added) is broad with a modal distance of 3.8 nm (full width at half-maximum (FWHM) = 1.4 nm; σ = 0.60 nm) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). In the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the distance distribution is consistent with the predicted distances derived from the TmPPase:Ca structure, and the modal distance decreases (3.6 nm; FWHM = 1.0 nm; σ = 0.43 nm). In the presence of both Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ETD (+Ca/ETD), we observe a similar modal distance (3.7 nm; FWHM = 1.2 nm; σ = 0.51 nm) to that of the apo and Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions, and the distribution is consistent with the predicted distance for the TmPPase:ETD structure (which corresponds to the +Ca/ETD condition). Furthermore, in the presence of ETD but no Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the modal distance between the S525R1 pair on the different monomers increases to 3.9 nm (FWHM = 1.4 nm; σ = 0.60 nm). Although these shifts are relatively small, under favorable conditions DEER has the resolution to discriminate minute helical motions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. The concerted nature of the modal distance shifts with respect to multiple different conditions at a single labelling site strongly suggests that preferential rotamer orientations are not the cause.</p>
<p>Upon visual inspection of the time-domain data (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>), the first minimum of the dipolar oscillation, as indicated by the black dashed lines depicted for the <italic>apo</italic> state, shifts to shorter time (<italic>i.e.</italic>, higher frequency; shorter distance) for the TmPPase+Ca<sup>2+</sup> condition, and to longer time (<italic>i.e.</italic>, lower frequency; longer distance) for the TmPPase+ETD condition, recapitulating the trends observed in the distance domain. Interestingly, upon the addition of IDP, the resulting distribution has modal distance of 4.0 nm, (FWHM = 1.4 nm, σ = 0.60 nm); shorter than the predicted distance for the TmPPase:IDP structure (4.3 nm). Meanwhile, with the addition of PAM and ALE, the resulting distributions have modal distances (+PAM: modal distance = 4.1 nm, FWHM = 1.2 nm, σ = 0.51 nm; +ALE: modal distance = 4.3 nm, FWHM = 1.3 nm, σ = 0.55 nm) similar to the in silico distance distribution predicted from the TmPPase:IDP X-ray structure. In contrast, the addition of ZLD results in the shortest modal distance observed for the S525R1 pair, of 3.4 nm (FWHM = 1.2 nm, σ = 0.51 nm). Remarkably, this differs substantially from the <italic>in-silico</italic> distance distribution predicted from the X-ray structure of TmPPase:ZLD (4.3 nm), which is expected to be highly similar to that of TmPPase:IDP (RMSD/Cα = 0.571 Å) (see Discussion).</p>
<p>For the C599R1 dimer, the modal distance observed for all distributions under the tested conditions) is approximately 5.8 nm (<italic>apo</italic>: modal distance = 5.8 nm, FWHM = 0.80 nm, ⍰ = 0.34 nm; +Ca: modal distance = 6.0 nm, FWHM = 0.80 nm, ⍰ = 0.34 nm; +IDP: modal distance = 5.8 nm, FWHM = 1.2 nm, ⍰ = 0.51 nm; +ZLD: modal distance = 5.9 nm, FWHM = 0.80 nm, ⍰ = 0.34 nm; +ETD: modal distance = 5.9 nm, FWHM = 0.70 nm, ⍰ = 0.30 nm; +ETD/Ca: modal distance = 5.9 nm, FWHM = 0.80 nm, ⍰ = 0.34 nm; +PAM: modal distance = 5.9 nm, FWHM = 0.70 nm, ⍰ = 0.30 nm; +ALE: modal distance = 6.0 nm, FWHM = 0.70 nm, ⍰ = 0.30 nm); (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>); this is longer than the predicted 4.8 nm distance derived from the TmPPase:IDP structure – where both monomers are closed – but significantly shorter than the predicted 6.6 nm distance for the TmPPase:Ca and TmPPase:ETD structures, where both monomers are open. This deviation between prediction and experiment could be explained by the dimer adopting an asymmetric conformation under the physiological conditions used for DEER, with one monomer in a closed state and the other in an open state. To investigate the asymmetric arrangement between two TmPPase monomers, we combined chain A of the TmPPase:IDP structure with chain B of the TmPPase:Ca structure to generate an asymmetric model, termed TmPPase:IDP(A)_Ca(B). We refer to the conformation of the TmPPase:IDP structure as ‘closed’ at both sides, even for residues not in the active site, for residues as in the TmPPase:Ca structure as ‘open’ at both sides. Our asymmetric model has, for instance, S525(A) ‘closed’ but S525(B) ‘open’.</p>
<p>The asymmetric model predicts a distance distribution that agrees closely with the DEER data obtained for the majority of the eight conditions tested for both C599R1 and S525R1 pairs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">G</xref>). The distribution predicted by the asymmetric model also falls between the two conformational extremes (fully closed and fully open states) of TmPPase structures. To further delineate the best-fitting model of the S525R1 DEER data, particularly given their smaller range from 3.6-4.0 nm, which resembles both asymmetric (<italic>i.e.</italic> closed-open) and <italic>apo</italic>-state (<italic>i.e.</italic> open-open) models, Bhattacharyya coefficients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> were calculated for the two models. The values are as follows: +Ca = 0.98 (<italic>apo</italic> model), 0.90 (asymmetric model); +IDP = 0.97 (apo model), 0.98 (asymmetric model); +ETD = 1.0 (<italic>apo</italic> model), 0.97 (asymmetric model); +ZLD = 0.95 (<italic>apo</italic> model), 0.84 (asymmetric model); +Ca/ETD = 0.98 (<italic>apo</italic> model), 0.91 (asymmetric model). It was not feasible to calculate these coefficients for the 525R1 +PAM and +ALE conditions, owing to being recorded on a different instrument, with a different x-axis, which was also the case for the C599R1 dataset. These coefficients for S525R1 indicate that the <italic>apo</italic>-state (<italic>i.e</italic>. open-open) model describes the experimentally derived distributions better for +Ca, +Ca/ETD, +ETD, and +ZLD, whereas the asymmetric (<italic>i.e</italic>. closed-open) model better describes the experimental data for +IDP. Higher Bhattacharyya coefficient values (closer to unity) signify better overlap (here taken as a proxy for model agreement). The ramifications of these calculations are further elaborated in the discussion.</p>

<title>Effect of ETD and ZLD on sodium transport of TmPPase</title>
<p>Previously, we showed that IDP can facilitate a single Na<sup>+</sup> pumping cycle without hydrolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. To investigate whether pumping also occurs in the presence of ETD and ZLD, we recorded electrometric data during PP<sub>i</sub> hydrolysis and after binding of IDP, ETD and ZLD. In electrometric measurements, also known as solid-supported membrane-based electrophysiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>, a current signal is generated and recorded when Na<sup>+</sup> is transported across the membrane by the active reconstituted TmPPase. A maximal positive signal of 0.6 ± 0.03 nA was detected within 0.15 ns (excluding instrument dead time) after the addition of 100 μM substrate K<sub>4</sub>PP<sub>i</sub> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Most of the signal decayed within 1 second after K<sub>4</sub>PP<sub>i</sub> was added. Full signal recovery required several minutes before a repeat measurement could be performed on the same sensor. As expected, when 200 μM K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> was added as a negative control, there was no signal, indicating that no ion pumping had occurred. Replacing the substrate with IDP resulted in a signal about half that of K<sub>4</sub>PP<sub>i</sub>. However, in the presence of 50 μM ETD or 50 μM ZLD, the signals were barely detectable, indicating no Na<sup>+</sup> pumping was observed.</p>

<p>This observation is consistent with the DEER data described above and with the TmPPase:ETD and TmPPase:ZLD structures, where there is no density for Na<sup>+</sup> in the ion gate. Interestingly, in all solved TmPPase structures, Na<sup>+</sup> has been observed at the ion gate only in the IDP-bound structures (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B-E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Fig. EV7</xref>). In the IDP-bound structure, four key residues (D703<sup>16.46</sup>, D243<sup>6.50</sup>, S247<sup>6.54</sup> and E246<sup>6.53</sup>) in the ion gate constitute the Na<sup>+</sup> binding site (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). The formation of the site is driven by the downward motion of TMH16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Fig. EV7A</xref>), transitioning from the resting state (TmPPase:Ca) to the closed state (TmPPase:IDP). The orientation of D703<sup>16.46</sup> of the TmPPase:ETD structure resembles the structure of TmPPase:Ca, rotated away from the Na<sup>+</sup> binding site, causing a loss of Na<sup>+</sup> binding (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B,C</xref>). In the TmPPase:ZLD structure, D703<sup>16.46</sup> and K707<sup>16.50</sup> are oriented relatively similarly to the Na<sup>+</sup> binding position in the TmPPase:IDP structure (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Fig. EV7C</xref>), but no Na<sup>+</sup> density was observed despite the higher resolution compared to the TmPPase:IDP structure (3.26 Å compared to 3.5 Å for the IDP-bound structure). This might be because the inhibitor restricts the complete closure of the active site and full constriction and downward movement of the inner helices (especially TMH12 and 16) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-D</xref>), which hinder the Na<sup>+</sup> pumping.</p>

<title>Inhibition of TmPPase by bisphosphonates</title>
<p>The seven distinct bisphosphonates we tested exhibited varying levels of inhibition against TmPPase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). ETD and IBD exhibited higher IC<sub>50</sub> values compared to PAM, ALE, and NRD (<italic>p</italic> &lt;0.0001) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). This is consistent with the <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> of ETD on DhPPase (mPPase of <italic>Desulfitobacterium hafniense</italic>), which is approximately 67 times higher than that of amino methylene diphosphonate (AMDP), as measured by Viktor <italic>et al</italic>. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>.

<title>Catalytic asymmetry in mPPase</title>
<p>Some evidence for asymmetry in mPPase gating has been shown previously by kinetic studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> and captured in the time-resolved 600s and 3600s structures of TmPPase:PP <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, where in both structures, one chain is in the open state (<italic>i.e.</italic> as in the <italic>apo</italic> structure) and the other is in the closed state (<italic>i.e.</italic> as in the IDP-bound structure). Our DEER data reveal clear differences in the binding of different inhibitors leading to a variety of open-closed states: IDP generates a closed-open state on both sides of the membrane, consistent with the presence of Na<sup>+</sup> in the ionic gate and pumping, while ETD and ZLD generate a closed-open state on the cytoplasmic side, but an open-open states on the periplasmic side. These begin to explain the conformation changes upon substrate/inhibitor binding.</p>
<p>In our study, the TmPPase:ETD structure captured the asymmetric binding of ETD (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Loop5-6, which interacts with ETD, moves inward to partially close the active site, but not as deeply as observed in the TmPPase:IDP structure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, B</xref>). Here, ETD is positioned above the hydrolytic center (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) and cannot descend further due to the presence of Ca²⁺ in the active site (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C, D</xref>), similar to the TmPPase:Ca structure (PDB ID: 4AV3). Thus, although ETD induces partial closure of loop5-6 and provides some stabilization, the overall arrangement of the inner and outer helices remains more like the open state rather than the fully closed state (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p>
<p>The DEER data on C599R1 provided reliable DEER distance distributions, and across all eight conditions tested, supported an asymmetric binding mode of compounds to TmPPase at the cytoplasmic side (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E-G</xref>). The modal distance of 5.8 nm differs significantly from the predicted C599R1 modal distance in the TmPPase:Ca (6.8 nm) and TmPPase:IDP (4.8 nm) structures. The presence of a minor population at approximately 5 nm observed in the presence of IDP or ETD is consistent with the predicted distance for the TmPPase:IDP structure, where both monomers are in a fully closed conformation. The 5.8 nm major peak corresponds to the closed-open conformation for IDP and ETD. Consequently, the DEER data on the cytoplasmic side demonstrate an equilibrium of at least two states: a minor population with IDP/ETD bound to both active sites, leading to a fully closed conformation on the cytoplasmic side, and a major population with IDP/ETD only bound to one active site; yielding an asymmetric closed-open state. This corresponds to the observed mechanism of substrate inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, where binding to both active sites (<italic>i.e.</italic> closed-closed) decreases the activity of the enzyme in comparison with the half-occupied open-closed state. Under the condition tested, we did not observe ZLD, PAM, and ALE bound to both active sites, probably due to the bulkiness of the compounds.</p>
<p>We cannot completely rule out the possibility that the monomers adopt a metastable intermediate state: in such a case, we would expect the distance changes reported by DEER to be symmetric across both membrane sides. However, we observe symmetry breaking between the cytoplasmic and periplasmic TmPPase sites. Indeed, DEER data yield distance distributions similar to that of the hybrid asymmetric structure under all conditions (<italic>apo</italic>, +Ca, +Ca/ETD, +ETD, +ZLD, +IDP, +PAM, +ALE). The distance distribution for S525R1 (loop12-13) in the exit channel changes more between different conditions than C599R1 on the cytoplasmic side (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). Under +Ca, and +Ca/ETD conditions, its distance distribution remains largely unchanged, with a mean distance of ∼3.5 to 3.7 nm (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>), which is consistent with the predicted distance derived from their corresponding crystal structures. This suggests that conformational differences on the cytoplasmic side between the DEER data and crystal structures are not significantly manifested at the exit channel.</p>
<p>In the presence of IDP, however, we observed a longest distance distribution (∼4.0 nm), consistent with the predicted distance from the hybrid asymmetric TmPPase:IDP(A)_Ca(B) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>) (closed-open), but neither the open-open nor closed-closed states. The ETD distance is intermediate, at ∼ 3.9 nm (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>), suggesting that a complete change to the closed conformational state on the periplasmic side does not occur, consistent with absence of Na<sup>+</sup> in the exit channel. In contrast, with ZLD bound, the DEER distance distribution is the shortest (3.4 nm) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>), and significantly deviates from the predicted distance for TmPPase:ZLD structure. This discrepancy may arise because, in solution, while ZLD can enter the active site, its bulky heteroaryl group, which orients towards TMH 12 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>), prevents the full downward movement of this helix. This structural restriction results in a shorter DEER distance distribution. For PAM and ALE, the DEER distance distributions are even longer than those observed for IDP, closely matching the TmPPase:IDP structure. Since we do not have structures for their complexes with TmPPase, their orientation in the active site remains unknown.</p>

<title>Sodium ion pumping in TmPPase</title>
<p>Taken together, the X-ray crystallography and solution-state DEER data were used to propose a schematic for conformational transitions upon the addition of different compounds (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6</xref>). Model 1 represents an asymmetric state at the cytoplasmic side under <italic>apo</italic>, +Ca, and +Ca/ETD conditions. Loops5-6 are highly flexible, consistent with the broad distribution observed in DEER data for C211R1 and the missing electron densities in crystal structures. The periplasmic side remains in the ‘open’ state, with helices 12 and 16 ‘up’, consistent with the solved structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Model 2 describes the structural effects of ETD binding. C599R1, located at TMH14, reports a ‘closed-open’ state, with ligand binding to just one active site. However, there is no complete conformational change on the periplasmic side, the conformation is ‘open-open’. Model 3, with ZLD, features the bulky heteroaryl group of ETD pulling the TMH 12 away at the cytoplasmic side, further affecting its conformation at the periplasmic side in an ‘open-open’ state. Model 4, with IDP, which induces a ‘closed-open’ state at the cytoplasmic side, with ligand binding to just one active site, but also drives a full downward movement of TMH12 in one monomer. This conformational shift results in an asymmetric conformation at the exit channel, while the other monomer remains open, consistent with the ‘closed-open’ hybrid structure TmPPase:IDP(A)_Ca(B) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>).</p>

<p>In a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, we found that a single turnover event of Na<sup>+</sup> pumping only occurs in the presence of IDP. In our current Nanion SURFE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>R experiment, we did not observe Na<sup>+</sup> pumping (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>) upon the addition of ETD and ZLD, consistent with ETD and ZLD bound structures where no Na<sup>+</sup> was observed at the ion gate. These data are consistent with the models presented above (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>): IDP generates an asymmetric conformation in both the active site and in the exit channel, which occurs through the motion of TMH12. TMH5, TMH13 and TMH10 are key parts of intra-subunit communication between the two monomers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. (Loop12-13, where S525R1 is located, can be used to monitor the motion of TMH12.) However, neither ETD nor ZLD generate any Nanion SURFE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>R signal; the structures with these ligands do not reveal Na<sup>+</sup> at the ionic gate. This is completely consistent with the C599R1 DEER distance distributions (see results), indicating that the cytoplasmic side (C599R1) is consistent with the ‘closed-open’ asymmetric conformation but that this has not propagated fully to the periplasmic side (S525R1), which is in the symmetric ‘open-open’ conformation, consistent with the Bhattacharyya coefficients, and which does not bind Na<sup>+</sup> at the ion gate. Consequently, the distance of 4.0 nm at S525R1, as observed in the IDP-bound sample, likely represents the minimal structural arrangement distance required for Na⁺ pumping.</p>
<p>The DEER data thus provide a convincing structural explanation for why TmPPase is unable to pump Na<sup>+</sup> upon the addition of ETD or ZLD. In summary, EPR experiments in solution, coupled with new structures of inhibited forms of TmPPase, provide evidence supporting symmetry-breaking across the membrane, consistent with half-of-the-sites-reactivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. In future studies, we will use time-resolved DEER to explore the order of conformational changes and how substrate addition is correlated with the release of product phosphate and ion pumping.</p>
<p>Note: During the revision of this manuscript, Baykov <italic>et al</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>.published a stopped-flow analysis demonstrating that the proton pumping in mPPase from <italic>Desulfitobacterium hafniense</italic>only occurs in the presence of PP<sub>i</sub>, as measured by fluorescence changes in the pH-sensitive dye pyranine. In comparison, our Nanion SURFE2R can also detect signals induced by partial ion pumping or charged amino acid rearrangement, rather than solely ion pumping. The half reduction in signal in the presence of IDP may be due to Na<sup>+</sup> being translocated to the ion gate and locked there without further release, consistent with the TmPPase:IDP structure and our DEER data. The weak signals observed in the presence of ETD or ZLD are likely due to charged amino acid rearrangements induced by their binding.</p>

<p>For EPR spectroscopy measurements, we utilized a nearly Cys-less construct, retaining only endogenous cysteine C183 due to its buried location and functional importance. Residue S525, located in the periplasmic loop12-13 of the TmPPase exit channel, was mutated to cysteine and covalently modified with a methanethiosulfonate thiol-specific spin label (MTSSL) to introduce a paramagnetic centre<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup> (the labelled protein is referred to as S525R1). At the cytoplasmic side of the membrane interface, we constructed the TmPPase T211C variant, which is located in loop5-6 and above the active site (the MTSSL labelled mutant is referred to as T211R1). We also spin labelled an endogenous cysteine residue, C599, (after mutating back the S599 to cysteine) on the cytoplasmic transmembrane helix 14 (the labelled protein is referred to as C599R1).</p>
<p>The S525C, 599C, and T211C proteins were expressed as outlined above. The frozen cell pellets were lysed using cryo-milling (Retsch model MM400). 1 mM TCEP was used to replace DTT in the purification steps preceding spin labelling and the remaining purification was carried out as above. Each protein was spin-labelled with MTSSL while immobilised to the Ni-NTA resin (or mixed following Cys mutant elution) as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. Briefly, for MTSSL labelling, MTSSL was added in spin-label buffer (20 mM MOPS-NaOH, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 50 mM KCl, 3.5% glycerol, 0.03% DDM at pH 7.5) at 10-fold molar protein excess and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. For C599, 10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> was added in the buffer to increase the accessibility of the site for spin-labelling (i.e., to induce partial opening). Spin-labelled protein was eluted from the Ni-NTA resin column, concentrated and subsequently purified using size-exclusion chromatography using Superose 6 increase 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) and equilibrated in 20 mM MES-NaOH, pH 6.5, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 50 mM KCl, 3.5% glycerol, 0.05% DDM. The eluted purified protein fractions were concentrated, buffer exchanged with buffer prepared in D<sub>2</sub>O and split into aliquots for incubation with a final concentration of 2 mM of all inhibitors or 10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> (30 min, RT). The protein activity was tested as described above, and the protein samples were tested for spin labelling by CW EPR spectroscopy, and then 40 % ethylene glycol-<italic>d</italic><sub>6</sub> was added to each sample before flash freezing for DEER measurement.</p>

<title>Continuous Wave EPR (CW-EPR) spectroscopy</title>
<p>CW EPR experiments were performed on a Bruker Magnettech ESR5000 X-band spectrometer (9.4 GHz). The spin-labelled sample was loaded into a 3 mm (o.d.) quartz EPR tube before the addition of ethylene glycol-<italic>d</italic><sub>6</sub>. The samples were measured at room temperature (298 K), as TmPPase is more thermally stable than most membrane proteins. The measurements were performed in a magnetic field range, 330-345 mT, with a 60 s sweep time, 0.1 mT modulation, 100 kHz frequency, and 10 mW (10 dB) microwave power.</p>

<title>DEER distance measurements and set-up</title>
<p>EPR recordings were collected as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup> using a Bruker ELEXSYS E580 spectrometer operating at Q-band (34 GHz) frequency, equipped with a QT-II resonator in a cryogen-free variable temperature cryostat (Cryogenic Ltd.) with a temperature range 2-300 K. In brief, spin-labelled protein samples were prepared in 3 mm outer diameter quartz tubes and data was recorded at 50 K. The detection pulse sequence used was a refocused Hahn echo: π/2 - τ1 - π - τ1 - τ2 - π - τ2 - echo, with π/2 and π observer pulse lengths of 16 and 32 ns, and π inversion pulse lengths of 16-20 ns, τ1 of 380 ns and τ2 of 2000-5000 ns, depending on construct. Unless otherwise stated: the magnetic field and microwave frequency were adjusted for the maximum of the nitroxide spectrum to coincide with the pump pulse position, while the observer pulse was placed at either 65 MHz (for T211R1 and S525R1 measurements) or 80 MHz (C599R1 measurements) frequency offset. Measurements were recorded using either a 150 W (for T211R1 and S525R1 measurements) or a 300 W (for C599R1 measurements) travelling wave tube (TWT; Applied Systems Engineering). All pulses were generated using an integrated Bruker SpinJet AWG, and measurements were recorded using a 16-step phase cycle on the detection pulses was used to remove unwanted echo crossings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. Finally, electron-spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) arising from electron-nuclear coupling to deuterium was suppressed using an 8-step tau-averaging cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>, with a time-increment of 16 ns.</p>
<p>For the measurements of S525R1 TmPPase (excluding the +PAM and +ALE conditions), a 4 ns dipolar increment to yield the DEER trace. Owing to significant excitation bandwidth overlap between observer and pump pulses at low frequency offset (-65 MHz), the presence of a “2+1” artefact exacerbated data treatment. Therefore, traces were recorded using a τ2 of 5000 ns (and truncated to 4000 ns for data processing (see DEER data analysis and processing section below)), 16 shots-per-point, 647 points, and a shot repetition time (SRT) of 3060 µs. Scans were recorded until a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio was obtained, typically with datasets averaged overnight. For the measurements of S525R1 TmPPase +PAM and +ALE, a 300 W travelling wave tube (TWT; Applied Systems Engineering) was used, operating at Q-band frequency. Traces were recorded with a 12 ns dipolar increment using a τ2 of 4000 ns, 10 shots-per-point, 348 points, and SRT of 2000 µs.</p>
<p>For the measurements of C599R1 TmPPase, a 12 ns dipolar increment was used, and traces were recorded using a τ2 of 5000 ns, 10 shots-per-point, 432 points, and a SRT of 2000 µs. Scans were recorded until a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio was obtained, typically with datasets averaged overnight. For all measurements of T211R1 (excluding the apo and +Ca/ETD measurements), a 4 ns dipolar increment was used, and traces were recorded using a τ2 of 2000 ns, 32 shots-per-point, 432 points, and a SRT of 3000 µs. Finally, for the apo and +Ca/ETD measurements, a 4 ns dipolar increment was used, and traces were recorded using a τ2 of 4000 ns, 16 shots-per-point, 525 points, and a SRT of 3000 µs.</p>

<title>DEER data analysis and processing</title>
<p>Distance distributions were determined from the time traces using various methodologies as best practices to get reliable results and to ensure self-consistency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. In the present work, we used two different programs, DeerAnalysis2022<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup> and ComparativeDeerAnalyzer2.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>, with results in the main text corresponding to the DeerAnalysis2022 processing. The 525R1 and T211R1 data recorded with a low frequency offset (65 MHz) yielded strong “2+1” artefacts, owing to overlapping pulse excitation profiles. To address this, all 525R1 data sets, and the apo and +Ca/ETD measurements for T211R1, were truncated or recorded to 4000 ns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>, respectively, and then phase and background corrected using the ‘!’ automated adjustment. The background corrected traces were then transformed from the time-domain to the distance-domain using Tikhonov Regularization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>, and the quality of the fit was assessed based on the L-curve criterion and the shape of the Pake pattern. The resultant background correction was then validated using a module for Tikhonov validation implemented in DeerAnalysis2022. The validation was carried out after initial Tikhonov regularization, varying the background start time from 5% to 80% of the respective time windows of the cut data for 16 trials. From this, the raw data were re-loaded and processed (Tikhonov regularization) with the cutoff and background start time as established from the first round of validation. This is the starting point for a full validation, where the background start time was again varied from 5% to 80% of the time window for 16 trials, as well as some added &quot;white noise&quot; with a level of 1.50 for 50 trials. The resulting validation trials were pruned and yielded the distance distribution and confidence interval. The ComparativeDeerAnalyser2.0 (CDA) was used to automate data processing and reduce operator bias. The corresponding output data for S525R1 and C599R1 TmPPase are shown in EV10.</p>

The PDB structures (including the asymmetric hybrid TmPPase_Ca:TmPPase_IDP structure) were also loaded into ChiLife and R1 sidechains were introduced, individually, at S525 and C599 sites.

<title>Electrometric measurement</title>
<p>For the Nanion SURFE<sup>2</sup>R experiment, purified TmPPase was reconstituted into liposomes as previously described with some modifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Briefly, the purified protein was buffer exchanged into a reconstitution buffer (50 mM MOPS-KOH pH 7.2, 50mM KCl, 5mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 2mM DTT) to remove Na<sup>+</sup> and glycerol and then diluted to 50 mg/ml concentration. 15 ml of liposome solution (120 mg/ml soy-bean lecithin in 50 mM MOPs-KOH pH 7.2) was mixed with 1 ml of diluted protein sample. SM-2 Bio-beads were added in increments to a final concentration of 0.25 mg/ml and then placed into a mixer at 4 °C for 6 h to ensure beads stayed in suspension. The proteoliposomes were collected and frozen at -80 °C in aliquots. To ensure that the reconstituted protein was still active, the hydrolytic activity was performed using the molybdenum blue reaction assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Electrometric measurements were performed on a SURFE<sup>2</sup>R N1 instrument from Nanion Technology (Munich, Germany). The gold sensors were prepared based on the ‘SURFE<sup>2</sup>R N1 protocol’, including thiolation of the sensor surface and assembly of the lipid layer using sensor prep A2 and B solutions. 15 ml of sonicated proteoliposomes, followed by 50 ml of the rinsing buffer (50 mM MOPS-KOH pH 7.2, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) were applied directly to the sensor surface. Sensors were centrifuged for 30 minutes at 2500 g and incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. The sensors were mounted in the SURFE2R N1 and rinsed once with 1 ml of rinsing buffer (50 mM MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>). Measurements were performed for 3 s by consecutively flowing non-activating buffer B (50 mM MOPS-KOH pH 7.2, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 200 µM K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>) and activating buffer A (50 mM MOPS-KOH, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) containing substrate (100 mM K<sub>4</sub>PP<sub>i</sub>) or inhibitors (50 mM IDP, 50 mM ETD or 50 mM ZLD) across the sensor for 1 s each in a BAB sequence. Charge transport across the membrane is initiated by substrate or inhibitor in buffer A, which flows across the sensor between 1 and 2 s. The transport of positively charged ions during this period results in a positive electrical current, the signal output of the SURFE2R N1 instrument. Between each measurement, the sensor was washed with 1 ml rinsing buffer and incubated for 60 seconds. The measurements were tested in triplicates.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This work examines the binding of several phosphonate compounds to a membrane-bound pyrophosphatase using several different approaches, including crystallography, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and functional measurements of ion pumping and pyrophosphatase activity. The work synthesizes these different approaches into a model of inhibition by phosphonates in which the two subunits of the functional dimer interact differently with the phosphonate. This asymmetry in the two subunits of the dimer is consistent with past studies of this system.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This study integrates a variety of approaches, including structural biology, spectroscopic measurements of protein dynamics, and functional measurements. Overall, data analysis was thoughtful, with careful analysis of the substrate binding sites (for example calculation of POLDOR omit maps). This study agrees with previous studies that have detected functional asymmetry in the membrane PPase dimer.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Membrane-bound pyrophosphatases (mPPases) are homodimeric proteins that hydrolyze pyrophosphate and pump H+/Na+ across membranes. They are an attractive drug target against protist pathogens. Non-hydrolysable PPi analogue bisphosphonates such as risedronate (RSD) and pamidronate (PMD) serve as primary drugs currently used. Bisphosphonates have a P-C-P bond, with their central carbon can accommodate up to two substituents, allowing a large compound variability. Here authors solved two TmPPase structures in complex with the bisphosphonates etidronate (ETD) and zoledronate (ZLD) and monitored their conformational ensemble using DEER spectroscopy in solution. These results reveal the inhibition mechanism by these compounds, which is crucial for developing future small-molecule inhibitors.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Authors show that seven different bisphosphonates can inhibit TmPPase with IC50 values in the micromolar range. Branched aliphatic and aromatic modifications showed weaker inhibition. High-resolution structures for TmPPase with ETD (3.2 Å) and ZLD (3.3 Å) are determined. These structures reveal the binding mode and shed light on the inhibition mechanism. The nature of modification on the bisphosphonate alters the conformation of the binding pocket. The conformational heterogeneity is further investigated using EPR/DEER spectroscopy under several conditions. Altogether, this provides convincing evidence for a distinct conformational equilibrium of TmPPase in solution and further supports the notion of asymmetric inhibitor binding at the active site, while maintaining a symmetric conformation at the periplasmic interface.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work examines the binding of several phosphonate compounds to a membrane-bound pyrophosphatase using several different approaches, including crystallography, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and functional measurements of ion pumping and pyrophosphatase activity. The work attempts to synthesize these different approaches into a model of inhibition by phosphonates in which the two subunits of the functional dimer interact differently with the phosphonate.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study integrates a variety of approaches, including structural biology, spectroscopic measurements of protein dynamics, and functional measurements. Overall, data analysis was thoughtful, with careful analysis of the substrate binding sites (for example calculation of POLDOR omit maps).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the protein did not crystallize with the more potent phosphonate inhibitors. Instead, structures were solved with two compounds with weak inhibitory constants &gt;200 micromolar, which limits the molecular insight into compounds that could possibly be developed into small molecule inhibitors. Likewise, the authors choose to focus the spectroscopy experiments on these weaker binders, missing an opportunity to provide insight into the interaction between more potent binders and the protein.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the reviewer concern regarding the choice of weaker inhibitors. We attempted cocrystallization with all available inhibitors, including those with higher potency. However, despite numerous efforts, these potent inhibitors yielded low-resolution crystals, making them unsuitable for detailed structural analysis. Therefore, we chose to focus on the weaker binders, as we were able to obtain high-quality crystal structures for these compounds. This allowed us to perform DEER spectroscopy and monitor conformational TmPPase state ensembles in solution with the added advantage of accurately analysing the data against structural models derived from X-ray crystallography. Using these weaker inhibitors enabled a more precise interpretation of the DEER data, thus providing reliable insights into the conformational dynamics and inhibition mechanism. As suggested by the reviewer, in the revised version, we add new DEER experiments, conditions and analysis on two of the more potent inhibitors (alendronate and pamidronate) to provide additional insight into their interactions. Furthermore, we also implemented additional DEER data on the cytoplasmic side of TmPPase; at a new site we identified (with the advantage of being an endogenous cysteine residue) and spin labelled (C599R1), given the DEER data for the previous T211R1cytoplasmic site were difficult to interpret owing to the highly dynamic nature of this region. The new pair C599R1 yielded high-quality DEER traces and indicated more clearly than T211R1, distance distributions consistent with asymmetry across the sampled conditions.  Again, as suggested by the reviewer, alendronate and pamidronate DEER measurements were also recorded for this site (cytoplasmic side; C599R1) as well as the periplasmic side (525R1).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In general, the manuscript falls short of providing any major new insight into membrane-bound pyrophosphatases, which are a very well-studied system. Subtle changes in the structures and ensemble distance distributions suggest that the molecular conformations might change a little bit under different conditions, but this isn't a very surprising outcome. It's not clear whether these changes are functionally important, or just part of the normal experimental/protein ensemble variation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully disagree with the reviewer. The scale of motions particularly seen in solution (and now on a new reliable spin pair (C599R1) located on the cytoplasmic side) correspond to those seen in the full panoply of crystal structures of mPPases. Some proteins undergo very large conformational changes during catalysis – such as the rotary ATPase. This one does not, meaning that the precise motions we describe here are relevant and observed in solution for the first time. Conformational changes in the ensemble, whether large or small, represent essential protein motions which underlie key mPPase catalytic function. These dynamic transitions are extremely challenging to monitor, especially in so many conditions and our DEER spectroscopy data demonstrate the sensitivity and resolution necessary to monitor these subtle changes in equilibria, even if these are only a few Angstroms. For several of the conditions we investigated by DEER in solution, corresponding X-ray structures have been solved, with the derived distances agreeing well with the DEER distributions. This further validates the biological relevance of the structures, and reveals the complete conformational ensemble, intractable using other current approaches. Indeed, some conformational states were previously seen using serial time-resolved X-ray static structures and were consistent with asymmetry.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The ZLD-bound crystal structure doesn't predict the DEER distances, and the conformation of Na+ binding site sidechains in the ZLD structure doesn't predict whether sodium currents occur. This might suggest that the ZLD structure captures a conformation that does not recapitulate what is happening in solution/ a membrane.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that the ZLD-bound crystal structure does not predict the DEER distances. However, we believe this discrepancy arises from the steric bulkiness of ZLD inhibitor, which prevents the closure of the hydrolytic centre. Additionally, the absence of Na+ at the ion gate in the ZLD-bound structure suggests that Na+ transport does not occur, a conclusion further supported by our electrometric measurements. We agree with the reviewer; distances observed in the DEER experiments might represent a potential new conformation in solution, not captured by the static X-ray structure, thereby offering new insights into the dynamic nature of the protein under physiological conditions. This serves to emphasize the complementarity of the DEER approach to Xray crystallography and redoubles the importance of using both techniques. Finally, the static X-ray structures have not captured the asymmetric conformations that must exist to explain half-of-thesites reactivity, where DEER yields distance distributions, across all 16 cases tested here (two mutants with eight conditions each), that are consistent with asymmetry.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Crystallographic analysis revealed the asymmetric conformation of the dimer in the inhibitor-bound state. Based on this result, which is consistent with previous time-resolved analysis, authors verified the dynamics and distance between spin introduced label by DEER spectroscopy in solution and predicted possible patterns of asymmetric dimer.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Crystal structures with inhibitor bound provide detailed coordination in the binding pocket thus useful information for the mPPase field and maybe for drug development.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The distance information measured by DEER is advantageous for verifying the dynamics and structure of membrane protein in solution. However, regarding T211 data, which, as the authors themselves stated, lacks measurement precision, it is unclear for readers how confident one can judge the conclusion leading from these data for the cytoplasmic side.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for acknowledging the advantageous use of the DEER methodology for identifying dynamic states of membrane proteins in solution. In our original manuscript, we used two sites in our analysis: S525 (periplasm) and T211 (cytoplasm), in which S525R1 yielded highquality DEER data, while T211R1 yielded weak (or no) visual oscillations, leading to broad distributions for the several conditions tested. In the revised manuscript, we now added a third site at the cytoplasmic side (C599R1 located at TMH14), which yielded high-quality DEER data and comparable to S525R1. Both C599R1 and C525R1 spin pairs generated distance distributions for all 16 conditions (two mutants of eight conditions each) that were described well by the solution-state ensemble adopting a predominantly asymmetric conformation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have tailored our interpretation of the T211R1 DEER data, and refrain from using the data to draw conclusions about the TmPPase conformational ensemble in the presence of different inhibitors. However, we still opted to include the T211R1 data in the SI because they confirm an important structural feature of mPPase in solution conditions; the intrinsically dynamic behaviour of the loop5-6 where T211 is located. This observation in solution is also consistent with our previous (Kellosalo et al., Science, 2012; Li et al., Nat. Commun, 2016; Vidilaseris et al., Sci. Adv., 2019; Strauss et al., EMBO Rep., 2024) and current X-ray crystallography data. To reiterate, we excluded T211R1 from any analysis relating to mPPase asymmetry and our conclusions were entirely based on the S525R1 and new C599R1 DEER data, which allowed us to monitor both sides on the membrane.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The distance information for the luminal site, which the authors claim is more accurate, does not indicate either the possibility or the basis for why it is the ensemble of two components and not simply a structure with a shorter distance than the crystal structure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this possibility and alternative interpretation of our DEER data. We now provide further analysis to show that our DEER data from both membrane sides reporters are highly consistent with (although they cannot completely exclude) asymmetry and rephrase to be inclusive of other possibilities. Importantly, this additional possibility does not affect the current interpretation of the data in our manuscript. Furthermore, we have removed Fig. 6 from the manuscript, and we now include a direct comparison of the in silico predicted distribution coming from the asymmetric hybrid structure with the 8 conditions tested, for both mutants (i.e. S525R1 and C599R1).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Membrane-bound pyrophosphatases (mPPases) are homodimeric proteins that hydrolyze pyrophosphate and pump H+/Na+ across membranes. They are attractive drug targets against protist pathogens. Non-hydrolysable PPi analogue bisphosphonates such as risedronate (RSD) and pamidronate (PMD) serve as primary drugs currently used. Bisphosphonates have a P-C-P bond, with its central carbon can accommodate up to two substituents, allowing a large compound variability. Here the authors solved two TmPPase structures in complex with the bisphosphonates etidronate (ETD) and zoledronate (ZLD) and monitored their conformational ensemble using DEER spectroscopy in solution. These results reveal the inhibition mechanism of these compounds, which is crucial for developing future small molecule inhibitors.</p>

<p>High-resolution structures for TmPPase with ETD (3.2 Å) and ZLD (3.3 Å) are determined. These structures reveal the binding mode and shed light on the inhibition mechanism. The nature of modification on the bisphosphonate alters the conformation of the binding pocket.</p>
<p>The conformational heterogeneity is further investigated using DEER spectroscopy under several conditions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors observed asymmetry in the TmPPase-ELD structure above the hydrolytic center. The structural asymmetry arises due to differences in the orientation of ETD within each monomer at the active site. As a result, loop5-6 of the two monomers is oriented differently, resulting in the observed asymmetry. The authors attempt to further establish this asymmetry using DEER spectroscopy experiments. However, the (over)interpretation of these data leads to more confusion than any further understanding. DEER data suggest that the asymmetry observed in the TmPPase-ELD structure in this region might be funneled from the broad conformational space under the crystallization conditions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully disagree with the reviewer. The asymmetry was previously established using serial time crystallography (Strauss et al., EMBO Rep, 2024) and biochemical assays (e.g. Malinen et al., Prot. Sci., 2022; Artukka et al., Biochem J, 2018; Luoto et al., PNAS, 2013) and partially seen in one static structure (Vidilaseris et al., Sci Adv 2019). DEER data here also show that the previously proposed asymmetry is also present (and this presence of asymmetry is consistent across all DEER data) within the TmPPase conformational ensemble in solution conditions. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the TmPPase monomers adopt a metastable intermediate state, in such a case we would expect the distance changes reported by DEER to be symmetric across both membrane sides. However, we observe a symmetry breaking between the cytoplasmic and periplasmic TmPPase sites. Indeed, DEER data yield distance distributions similar to that of the hybrid asymmetric structure under all: apo, +Ca, +Ca/ETD, +ETD, +ZLD, +IDP, +PAM, +ALE conditions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>DEER data for position T211R1 at the enzyme entrance reveal a highly flexible conformation of loop56 (and do not provide any direct evidence for asymmetry, Figure EV8).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please see relevant response above. We acknowledge that T211 is indeed situated on a highly dynamic loop, which is important for gating and our DEER data confirm the high flexibility of this protein region. Given we have not observed dipolar oscillations, leading to broad distributions, we have stated in the original manuscript that we will not establish the presence of any asymmetry in solution on the basis of T211, rather relying on the S525R1 and the new C599R1 sites, for which we have acquired high-quality DEER data, as was also pointed out and has been commented on by all reviewers. We have provided data at the C599R1 position (same cytoplasmic side as 211 for which we have now limited our analysis to a minimum) which further provides evidence for asymmetry, including two new conditions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Similarly, data for position S521R1 near the exit channel do not directly support the proposed asymmetry for ETD.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer appears to suggest that we hold the S525R1 DEER data as direct proof of asymmetry; this is combative on the grounds that to directly prove asymmetry would require time-resolved DEER measurements, far beyond the scope of this work. Rather, we have applied DEER measurements to explore whether asymmetry (observed previously via time-resolved X-ray crystallography) is also present (or indeed a possibility) in solution. All our S525R1 and C599R1 DEER data (recorded for eight conditions) are consistent with asymmetry (see also detailed response above).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Despite the high quality of the data, they reveal a very similar distance distribution. The reported changes in distances are very small (+/- 0.3 nm), which can be accommodated by a change of spin label rotamer distribution alone. Further, these spin labels are located on a flexible loop, thereby making it difficult to directly relate any distance changes to the global conformation</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for recognising the high quality of our DEER data for the S525R1 site which we now complement with a new pair on the cytoplasmic facing membrane side (C599R1) with DEER data of comparable quality as for S525R1, where visual oscillations in the raw traces for both spin pairs, as in our case, reportedly lead to highly accurate and reliable distributions, able to separate (in fortuitous cases) helical movements of only a few Angstroms (Peter et al., Nature Comms 13:4396, 2022; Klose et al., Biophys J 120:4842-4858, 2021). The ability of DEER/PELDOR offering near Angstrom resolution was also previously demonstrated by the acquisition and solution of highresolution multi-subunit spin-labelled membrane protein structures (Pliotas at al., PNAS, 2012; Pliotas et al., Nat Struct Mol Biol, 2015; Pliotas, Methods Enzymol, 2017) as well as its ability in detecting small (and of similar to mPPase magnitude) conformational changes in different integral membrane protein systems (Kapsalis et al., Nature Comms, 2019; Kubatova et al., PNAS, 2023; Schmidt et al., JACS, 2024; Lane et al., Structure, 2024; Hett et al., JACS, 2021; Zhao et al., Nature, 2024), occurring under different conditions and/or stimuli in solution and/or lipid environment. The changes here are not below the detection sensitivity of DEER (e.g. ~ 7 Angstroms between the two modal distance extremes (+Ca vs +IDP for S525R1), and with all other conditions showing intermediate changes.</p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that these changes are relatively small, but they are expected for membrane ion pumps. Indeed, none of the mPPase structures show helical movements of greater than half a turn, and that only in helices 6 and 12. There appear to be larger-scale loop closing motions of the 5-6 loop that includes T211, due to the presence of E217 which binds to one of the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions that coordinate the leaving group phosphate. This is, inter alia, the reason that this loop is so flexible: it cannot order before substrate is bound.</p>
<p>The reviewer suggests that the subtle distance shifts detected arise only from changes of label rotamer distribution. However, the concerted nature of the modal distance shifts with respect to multiple different conditions at a single labelling site strongly suggests that preferential rotamer orientations are not the cause. Indeed, for so many spin labels to undergo an arbitrary shift that the modal distance of the entire distribution changes – and in the absence of any conformational change – appears improbable. Here we have the resolution to detect such subtle differences by DEER, given there are unambiguous shifts in our time domain data (i.e. the position of the minimum of the first dipolar oscillation) (Fig 4) and these are reflected in the modal distances in the distributions. We also refrain from performing any quantitative analysis and use qualitative trends in modal distance shifts only; all which support our proposed model of a symmetry breaking across the membrane face. To further belabour this point, we do not quantify the DEER data (for instance through parametric fitting) to extract populations of different conformational states and we appreciate that to do so would be highly prone to error; however we do (and can, we feel without over-interpretation) assert that the modal distances shift.</p>

<p>The interpretations listed below are not supported by the data presented:</p>
<p>(1) 'In the presence of Ca2+, the distance distribution shifts towards shorter distances, suggesting that the two monomers come closer at the periplasmic side, and consistent with the predicted distances derived from the TmPPase:Ca structure.'</p>
<p>Problem: This is a far-stretched interpretation of a tiny change, which is not reliable for the reasons described in the paragraph above.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While the authors overall agree with the reviewer assessment that ±0.3 nm is a small (not a minor) change, there are literature examples quantifying (or using for quantification) distribution peaks separated by similar Δr. (Kubatova et al., PNAS, 2023; Schmidt et al., JACS, 2024; Hett et al., JACS, 2021; Zhao et al., Nature, 2024). However, the time-domain data clearly indicate the position of the first minimum of the dipolar oscillation shifts to shorter dipolar evolution time. The sensitivity of the time-domain data to subtle changes in dipolar coupling frequency is significantly improved compared to the distance distributions.</p>
<p>Importantly, we have fitted Gaussians to the experimental distance distributions of 525R1 output by the Comparative Deer Analyzer 2.0 and observed a change in the distribution width in presence of Ca2+, implying the rotameric freedom of the spin label is restricted. However, the CW-EPR for 525R1 indicate that the rotational correlation time of the spin label is highly consistent between conditions (the spectra are almost identical); this cannot be explained simply by rotameric preference of the spin label (as asserted by the reviewer 3), as there is no (further) immobilisation observed from the CW-EPR of apo-state (Figure EV9) to that in presence of Ca2+. Furthermore, in the absence of conformational changes, it is reasonable to assume (and demonstrable from the CW-EPR data) that the rotamer cloud should not significantly change between conditions. However, Gaussian fits of the two extreme cases yielding the longest (i.e., in presence of IDP) and shortest (in presence of ZLD) modal distances for the 525R1 DEER data indicated significant (i.e., above the noise floor after Tikhonov validation) probability density for the IDP condition at 50 Å (P(r) = 0.18). This occurs at four standard deviations above the mean of the Guassian fit to the +ZLD condition, which by random chance should occur with &lt;0.007% probability.</p>
<p>As in previous response, the method can detect changes of such magnitude which are not small, but physiologically relevant and expected for integral membrane proteins, such as mPPases. Indeed, even in equal (or more) complex systems such as heptameric mechanosensitive channel proteins DEER provided sub-Angstrom accuracy, when a spin labelled high resolution XRC structure was solved (Pliotas et al., PNAS, 2012; Pliotas et al., Nat Struct Mol Biol, 2015). Despite this being an ideal case where DEER accuracy was experimentally validated another high-resolution structural method on modified membrane protein and is not very common it demonstrates the power of the method, especially when strong oscillations are present in the raw DEER data (as here for mPPase S525R1, and C599R1), even when multiple distances are present, Angstrom resolution is achievable in such challenging protein classes.</p>

<p>(2) 'Based on the DEER data on the IDP-bound TmPPase, we observed significant deviations between the experimental and the in silico distances derived from the TmPPase:IDP X-ray structure for both cytoplasmic- (T211R1) and periplasmic-end (S525R1) sites (Figure 4D and Figure EV8D). This deviation could be explained by the dimer adopting an asymmetric conformation under the physiological conditions used for DEER, with one monomer in a closed state and the other in an open state.'</p>
<p>Problem: The authors are trying to establish asymmetry using the DEER data. Unfortunately, no significant difference is observed (between simulation and experiment) for position 525 as the authors claim (Figure 4D bottom panel). The observed difference for position 112 must be accounted for by the flexibility and the data provide no direct evidence for any asymmetry.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reviewer 3 is incorrect in suggesting that we are trying to prove asymmetry through the DEER data. That is a well-known fact in the literature (e.g. Vidilaseris et al, Sci Adv 2019) where we show (1) that the exit channel inhibitor ATC (i.e. close to S525R1) binds better in solution to the TmPPase:PPi complex than the TmPPase:PPi<sub>2</sub> complex, and (2) that ATC binds in an asymmetric fashion to the TmPPase:IDP<sub>2</sub> complex with just one ATC dimer on one of the exit channels. We merely use the DEER data to support this well-established fact.</p>
<p>However, because we agree that the DEER data in presence of IDP does not provide direct proof for asymmetry; particularly for the cytoplasmic facing mutant T211R1, we have refrained from interpreting T211R1 data beyond being a highly dynamic loop region (as evidenced by the broad distributions). As pointed out by the reviewer, the differences in distance distributions between conditions observed for T211R1 likely arise from conformational heterogeneity in solution. Furthermore, we now report DEER data on another new site (C599R1), which is also on the cytoplasmic side and yields high quality DEER data comparable to the S525R1 data (commended for their quality by both the reviewers). The C599R1 measurements show that in all conditions tested, highly similar distributions are observed, inconsistent with the in silico predicted distance distributions from the symmetric X-ray structures, but consistent with an asymmetric hybrid structure (i.e. open-closed) in solution. Importantly, the difference between the fully open (6.8 nm modal distance) and fully closed (4.8 nm modal distance) states of the C599R1 dimer is larger than for the S525R1 dimer pair. Thus, delineating the asymmetric hybrid conformation from the symmetric conformations is more robust.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) 'Our new structures, together with DEER distance measurements that monitor the conformational ensemble equilibrium of TmPPase in solution, provide further solid experimental evidence of asymmetry in gating and transitional changes upon substrate/inhibitor binding.'</p>
<p>Problem: See above. The DEER data do not support any asymmetry.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We feel that the reviewer comments here are somewhat unfounded. All the DEER data (for 525R1 periplasmic and C599R1 cytoplasmic sites are described, most parsimoniously, using an asymmetric hybrid structure. In particular, the new C599R1 distance distributions are poorly described by the symmetric X-ray crystal structures, with a conserved modal distance of approx. 5.8 nm throughout the tested conditions that aligns nicely with the in silico predictions from the asymmetric hybrid structure. Additionally, all S525R1 and C599R1 data well exceed the relevant criteria of the recent white paper (Schiemann et al., 2021, JACS) from the EPR community to be considered reliably interpretable (strong visual oscillations in the raw traces; signal-to-noise ratio .r.t modulation depth of &gt; 20 in all cases; replicates have been performed and added into the maintext or supplementary; near quantitative labelling efficiency (evidenced by lack of free spin label signal in the CW-EPR spectra); analysed using the CDA (now Figure EV10) to avoid confirmation bias).</p>
<p>While the DEER data do not prove asymmetry, we do not claim proof of asymmetry in the above sentence. We concede to rephrase the offending sentence above as: “Our new structures, together with DEER distance measurements that monitor the conformational ensemble of TmPPase in solution, do not exclude asymmetry in gating and transitional changes upon substrate/inhibitor binding and are consistent with our proposed model.” We feel that this reframed conjecture of asymmetry is well founded; indeed, comparing all the 16 experimentally derived DEER distance distributions for the 525R1 and 599R1 sites with <italic>in-silico</italic> modelling performed on the hybridised asymmetric structure (i.e., comprised of one monomer bound to Ca2+ and another bound to IDP) yields overlap coefficients (Islam and Roux, JPC B, 2015) of &gt;0.85. This implies the envelope of the modelled distance distribution is quantitatively inside the envelope of the experimental distance distributions. Thus, the DEER data support asymmetry (previously observed by time-resolved XRC) in solution, and while we appreciate that ideally one would measure time-resolved DEER to directly correlate kinetics of conformational changes within the ensemble to the catalytic cycle of mPPase, (and this is something we aim to do in the future), it is far beyond the scope of this study.</p>
<p>Indeed, half-of-the-sites reactivity has been demonstrated in at least the following papers</p>
<p>(Vidilaseris et al, Sci Acv. ,2019, Strauss et al, EMBO Rep. 2024, Malinen et al Prot Sci, 2022, Artukka et al Biochem J, 2018; Luoto et al, PNAS, 2013). Half-of-the sites activity requires asymmetry in the mechanism, and therefore asymmetric motions in the active site (viz 211) and exit channel (viz 525). As mentioned above, we have demonstrated this for other inhibitors (Vidilaseris et al 2019) and as part of a time-resolved experiment (Strauss et al 2024). In fact, given the wealth of evidence showing that the symmetrical crystal structures sample a non- or less-productive conformation of the protein, it would be quixotic to propose the DEER experiments - in solution - do not generate asymmetric conformations. It certainly doesn’t obey Occam’s razor of choosing the simplest possible explanation that covers the data.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Based on these observations, and the DEER data for +IDP, which is consistent with an asymmetric conformation of TmPPase being present in solution, we propose five distinct models of TmPPase (Figure 7).</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We have redressed the proposed models and limited them to four asymmetric models to clearly illustrate the <italic>apo</italic>/+Ca/+Ca:ETD-state (model 1) and highlight the distinct binding patterns of various inhibitors (ETD, ZLD and IDP; model 2-4), which result in a variety of closed/open-open states. In this version, we clarify that the proposed models are not solely based on the DEER data but all DEER data recorded for multiple conditions, inhibitors and for two opposite membrane side facing reporters are highly consistent, and are grounded in both current and previously solved structures, with the DEER data providing additional consistency with these models.</p>

<p>(5) 'In model 2 (Figure 7), one active site is semi-closed, while the other remains open.

<p>Problem: Neither convincing nor supported by the data</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully disagree with the reviewer. However, owing to the conformational heterogeneity of T211R1, we now exclude T211R1 data from quantitative interpretation of changes to the conformational ensemble. Instead, we include new DEER data from site C599R1, which provides high-quality and convincing data that is consistent with asymmetry at the cytoplasmic face, and inconsistent with in silico distance distributions derived from symmetric X-ray crystal structures. Furthermore, the S525R1 distance distributions for the +ETD (corresponding to +Ca/ETD) and +ZLD conditions were directly compared with both the <italic>apo</italic>-state distance distribution (corresponding to a fully open, symmetric conformation) and the in silico predicted distributions of the asymmetric hybrid structure (corresponding to an open-closed conformation). Overlap coefficients were calculated (given in the main text) that indicated the +ETD (corresponding to +Ca/ETD) and +ZLD S525R1 distributions were more consistent with the apo-state distance distribution. This suggests that while on the cytosolic face of the membrane, an open-closed conformation is favoured, on the periplasmic face, a symmetric open-open conformation is favoured.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the reviewer concern regarding the choice of weaker inhibitors. We chose to focus on the weaker binders, as we were able to obtain high-quality crystal structures for these compounds. This allowed us to perform DEER spectroscopy with the added advantage of accurately analysing the data against structural models derived from X-ray crystallography. In the revised version, we also include results from alendronate and pamidronate, two of the tighter inhibitors, which show similar and consistent results to the others.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

<p>The information is already mentioned in the Method section on sample preparation for EPR spectroscopy (page 24), where we indicated that the protein aliquots were incubated with a final concentration of 2 mM inhibitors or 10 mM CaCl2 (30 min, RT). However, we recognise that this may not have been sufficiently clear. To clarify, we now explicitly state that the concentration of ETD and ZLD (amongst other inhibitors) used for the DEER experiments is 2 mM.</p>

<p>(3) There should be additional detail about the electrometry replicates. Does &quot;triplicate&quot; mean three measurements on the same sensor, three different sensors, and different protein preparations? At a minimum, data should be collected from three different sensors to ensure that the negative results (lack of current) for ETD and ZLD are not due to a failed sensor prep. In addition, Data from the other replicates should be shown in a supplementary figure, either the traces, or in a summary figure. Are the traces shown collected on the same sensor? They could be, in principle, since the inhibitor is washed away after each perfusion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, by 'triplicate', we mean three measurements taken on the same sensor. All traces shown were collected from a single sensor. Thank you for your advice; we now show here additional data from other sensors that display the same pattern. As for the possibility of a failed sensor preparation, this is unlikely since we always ensure the sensor quality with the substrate (PPi) as a positive control after each measurement.</p>

<p>(4) I'm confused by the NEM modification assay, and I don't think there is enough information in this manuscript for a reader to figure out what is happening. Why is the protein active if an inhibitor is present? I understand that there is a conformational change in the presence of the inhibitor that buries a cysteine, but the inhibitor itself should diminish function, correct? Is the inhibitor removed before testing the function? In addition, it would be clearer if the cysteines that are modified are indicated in the main text. I don't understand what is being shown in Figure Ev2. Shouldn't the accessible cysteines in the apo form be shown? Finally, the sentence &quot;IDP has been reported to prevent the NEM modification...&quot; does not make sense to me. Should the word &quot;by&quot; be removed from this sentence?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the confusion. Yes, the inhibitors were removed before testing the protein function. In Figure EV2, the accessible cysteines are shown for both the apo and IDP-bound states. As seen, the accessible cysteines in the IDP-bound states are fewer than those in the apo state, meaning fewer cysteines are available for modification. Consequently, more activity is retained when IDP binds due to the reduction in accessible cysteines. We have addressed this in the manuscript (see the method section on the NEM modification assay).</p>

<p>(5) Why does the model in Figure 7 show the small molecules bound to only one subunit, when they are crystallized in both subunits?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We propose that the small molecules bound to the two subunits in the crystal structure is likely a result of substrate inhibition, given the excess inhibitor used during crystallisation (e.g. Artukka, et al., Biochemical Journal, 2018; Vidilaseris, et al., Science Advances, 2022). Our PELDOR data indicate that in solution, the small molecules bound to TmPPase are in an intermediate state between both subunits being closed and both being open, most likely with at least one subunit in an open state. This is also consistent with previous kinetic studies (Anashkin, V. A., et al., International Journal of Molecular Sciences, 22, 2021), which showed that the binding constant of IDP to the second subunit is around 120 times higher than that of the first subunit.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The authors argue that the two ETDs bound in the two protomers adopt distinct conformations. Can this be further supported, for example, by swapping the position of the two ETDs between the two protomers and calculating a difference map (there should be corresponding negative/positive density if the modelling of the two different conformations is robust)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As per the reviewer suggestion, we swapped the positions of the two ETDs between the protomers and calculated the difference electron density map. This analysis, presented in Figure EV3, reveals corresponding negative and positive electron density peaks, indicating that the ETDs indeed adopt distinct conformations in each protomer, supporting the accuracy of our modeling.</p>

<p>We acknowledge the reviewer’s concern regarding the flexibility of the T211 region for spin labelling. Given the challenges associated with TmPPase, including reduced protein expression, loss of function, or inaccessibility upon spin labelling at certain sites, we have explored alternative residues.

<p>It is hard to imagine that in a crystal lattice, the straight inhibitor always binds to monomer A, and the neighboring monomer is always attached to a slightly tilted inhibitor, which causes asymmetry. For example, wouldn't it mean that it would first bind to one of them, which would then affect the neighboring monomer via 5-6 Loop, which would then affect its binding pose? So in this case, the inhibitor did not ARAISE asymmetry, and this is where it is misleading for readers.</p>

<p>We apologize for the confusion. What we intended to convey is that the first inhibitor binds to one protomer, which then affects the conformation of the neighbouring monomer, ultimately influencing its binding pose. This is required for half-of-the-sites reactivity, which is well-established in this system. This is reflected in our crystal structure, where we observed asymmetry in the loop 5-6 region and the ETD orientation between the two protomers.

For example, in the Ca/ETD data, there is a peak near 50A, but it would be difficult for TM5 to move away from this distance unless the protein unfolds.

We also mention in the methods section that owing to the intense “2+1” artefact, the decision was made to truncate the artefact away, to minimise the impact on data treatment. As for motivation to use the lower offset of 65 MHz, we did so to maximise the achievable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), as particularly for the T211R1 data, the detected echo was quite weak. This was further exacerbated by the poor transverse relaxation time observed at that site.</p>
