<abstract>
<p>The Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle (CBBC) performs carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms. Among the eleven enzymes that participate in the pathway, sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (SBPase) is expressed in photo-autotrophs and catalyzes the hydrolysis of sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphate (SBP) to sedoheptulose-7-phosphate (S7P). SBPase, along with nine other enzymes in the CBBC, contributes to the regeneration of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate, the carbon-fixing co-substrate used by ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco). The metabolic role of SBPase is restricted to the CBBC, and a recent study revealed that the three-dimensional structure of SBPase from the moss <italic>Physcomitrium patens</italic> was found to be similar to that of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), an enzyme involved in both CBBC and neoglucogenesis. In this study we report the first structure of an SBPase from a chlorophyte, the model unicellular green microalga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>. By combining experimental and computational structural analyses, we describe the topology, conformations and quaternary structure of <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> SBPase (<italic>Cr</italic>SBPase). We identify active site residues and locate sites of redox- and phospho-post-translational modifications that contribute to enzymatic functions. Finally, we observe that <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase adopts distinct oligomeric states that may dynamically contribute to the control of its activity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Photosynthetic carbon fixation is performed by eleven enzymes that collectively operate the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle (CBBC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Calvin 1962</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Johnson 2016</xref>), wherein Rubisco plays the prominent role in catalyzing fixation of inorganic carbon onto a pentose acceptor: ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP). The net gain of the CBBC is one triose in the form of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) for every three carboxylation reactions catalyzed by Rubisco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Johnson and Alric 2013</xref>). Regeneration of RuBP is ensured by the other ten enzymes of the CBBC, among which phosphoribulokinase (PRK) and sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (SBPase) are the only enzymes that are exclusively involved in this pathway. The remaining eight enzymes are paralogs of those involved in cytoplasmic glycolysis, gluconeogenesis or the pentose-phosphate pathway. Hence, Rubisco, PRK, and SBPase are expressed in photosynthetic organisms and fulfill biochemical functions so far uniquely attributed to the photosynthetic carbon fixation.</p>
<p>Pioneering studies on SBPase were carried out using the native enzyme purified from wheat chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Woodrow 1982</xref>) and corn leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Nishizawa and Buchanan 1981</xref>), allowing quantitative assays of its catalytic function. This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphate (SBP) into sedoheptulose-7-phosphate (S7P) and requires magnesium ions for both catalysis and activation. In addition, SBPase activity is modulated by pH and redox switching mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Anderson 1974</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Woodrow and Walker 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cadet and Meunier 1988</xref>). Redox control is exerted through dithiol/disulfide interchanges dependent upon the ferredoxin-thioredoxin cascade arising from the activity of the illuminated photosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Schürmann and Buchanan 1975</xref>). In tobacco leaf extracts, SBPase reaches its maximal activity after 10 minutes illumination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zimmer, Swart et al. 2021</xref>), and this activation kinetics is consistent with the slow reduction pattern of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> SBPase <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Yoshida and Hisabori 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>The crystal structure of SBPase from the moss <italic>Physcomitrium patens</italic> (<italic>Pp</italic>SBPase) has been solved at a resolution of 1.3 Å (Protein Data Bank entry : 5iz3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gutle, Roret et al. 2016</xref>). <italic>Pp</italic>SBPase fold is highly similar to that of moss fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), yet the protein was shown to distinctively oligomerize as a homodimer and to form a disulfide bridge in a different motif than that found in plant FBPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chiadmi, Navaza et al. 1999</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gütle, Roret et al. 2016</xref>). In spite of their homology, the sequences of FBPase and SBPase seem to have evolved different regulatory and catalytic properties that allow different contributions to the CBBC. Indeed, both enzymes specifically recognize their respective 6-carbon and 7-carbon sugar substrates (<italic>i.e.</italic>, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and SBP, respectively), with only SBPase capable to hydrolyze the other substrate with a resulting catalysis lower than that measured with SBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gütle, Roret et al. 2016</xref>). To date, the structural components contributing to active site selectivity (<italic>i.e.</italic>, substrate recognition) can be retrieved from two studies reporting the crystal structure of the dual function fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase/sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (F/SBPase) from <italic>Thermosynechococcus elongatus</italic> in complex with SBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cotton, Kabasakal et al. 2015</xref>) and from <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC 6803 in complex with FBP (PDB entry 3RPL). Recently, it was proposed that the CBBC can bypass fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) altogether, by only relying on SBP, glycolysis and the oxidative pentose-phosphate pathway paralogs to regenerate the substrate of Rubisco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ohta 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Several studies have reported that SBPase, along with Rubisco, FBPase, aldolase and transketolase, constitute a metabolic bottleneck for the CBBC ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Raines 2022</xref>) and references therein). Overexpression of SBPase was found to effectively enhance photosynthesis and growth in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lefebvre, Lawson et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Feng, Han et al. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Feng, Wang et al. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Rosenthal, Locke et al. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Simkin, Lopez-Calcagno et al. 2017</xref>) and in the green microalga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hammel, Sommer et al. 2020</xref>), indicating that SBPase can be considered as a limiting factor for the photosynthetic carbon fixation. Based on these evidences, it is plausible to consider that SBPase is a good target to improve the photosynthetic capacity by means of metabolic engineering coupled to synthetic biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kubis and Bar-Even 2019</xref>), especially in the experimentally convenient multi-omic model alga Chlamydomonas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mettler, Muhlhaus et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Schmollinger, Mühlhaus et al. 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>In Chlamydomonas, SBPase is encoded by a single nuclear gene (Cre03.g185550), and the protein (Uniprot entry P46284) is addressed to the chloroplast by a 54-residue amino-terminal peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Emanuelsson, Brunak et al. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Almagro Armenteros, Salvatore et al. 2019</xref>). SBPase abundance in the algal cell was quantified by mass spectrometry as 1.1-1.3 ± 0.3 amol/cell, representing 0.15% of total cell proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hammel, Sommer et al. 2020</xref>). In Chlamydomonas protein extracts, SBPase was shown to undergo post-translational modifications by phosphorylation of serines and threonines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Werth, McConnell et al. 2017</xref>), and redox modifications of cysteine thiols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Zaffagnini, Bedhomme et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Morisse, Zaffagnini et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Pérez-Pérez, Mauriès et al. 2017</xref>). However, the mechanisms by which post-translational modifications affect the catalytic activity of CrSBPase is still lacking. Here, we describe the crystal structures of <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase in two redox states, examine the catalytic activity of recombinant CrSBPase, and investigate the correlation between the redox state and the oligomerization of the protein. Our results suggest that a redox control over oligomer equilibrium could represent a novel mechanism to regulate enzymatic activities in the CBBC.</p>

<title>Cloning and mutagenesis of <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase expression plasmids</title>
<p>The sequence coding for full-length mature SBPase was amplified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> total ribonucleic acids extract and inserted at sites 5’-NdeI and BamHI-3’ into expression vector pET3c modified for the fusion of an amino-terminal hexa-histidine tag in the recombinant protein, yielding plasmid pSL-175-His<sub>6</sub>-<italic>Cr</italic>SBPase-WT.

The encoded protein encompasses 331 amino acids, with a molar mass of 36,176.7 Da and a theoretical extinction coefficient of 24,722.5 M<sup>-1</sup>.cm<sup>-1</sup>. Unless otherwise stated, amino acid residues numbering is that of GenBank entry DAA79954.1. Point mutants of cysteines 115 and 120 singly substituted with serines were generated by site-directed PCR mutagenesis with primers listed in <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">supplementary table 1</xref>, producing plasmids pSL-181-His6-<italic>Cr</italic>SBPase-C115S, and pSL-182-His6-<italic>Cr</italic>SBPase-C120S.</p>

<title>Recombinant <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase purification</title>
<p>Plasmids pSL-175, -181, and -182 were used to transform <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21(DE3). The transformants were grown at 37 °C in 2YT supplemented with 150 µg/mL ampicillin. When cultures reached an OD<sub>600</sub> of ∼0.6, T7-dependent <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase overexpression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 0.2 mM for 3 h.</p>
<p>Harvested cell pellets were resuspended in 20 mM Tris pH 7.9, 100 mM NaCl (buffer A) and lyzed by 1 sec / 1 sec pulsed sonication for 3 min. The soluble fraction of the lysate was separated by 20 min centrifugation at 20,000 <italic>g</italic> and loaded on 2 mL Ni-NTA resin for His-tag mediated affinity chromatography. The resin was washed in four steps with 25 mL buffer A, 25 mL buffer A supplemented with 10, 20, and 30 mM imidazole, and <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase was eluted in three steps with 10 mL buffer A supplemented with 100, 200, and 300 mM imidazole. Pooled eluates containing <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase were loaded on HiLoad Superdex 200 26/600 size-exclusion chromatography column and eluted in buffer A. Protein purity was assessed by electrophoresis on 12% acrylamide gel under denaturing and reducing conditions (supplementary figure 1). Peak fractions were assembled and concentrated by ultrafiltration on Amicon units of MWCO 30,000 Da cut-off. Final concentrations of purified proteins were in the 1-10 mg/ml range as measured by Nanodrop ND-2000 spectrophotometer using an ε<sub>280</sub> of 24,722.5 M<sup>-1</sup>.cm<sup>-1</sup>.</p>

<p>Polyclonal antibodies were generated by immunization of rabbits with pure recombinant <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase (Genecust, Boynes France). Analyzed fractions were separated by denaturing polyacrylamide electrophoresis and transferred to 0.2 µm nitrocellulose membrane for detection with primary antibody subsequently detected by secondary anti-rabbit antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase. Detection was done with commercial ECL peroxidase assay (GE Healthcare, Chicago IL USA) with a Chemidoc (Bio-Rad, Hercules CA USA).</p>

<title>Crystallization and structure determination</title>
<p>Pure recombinant His6-<italic>Cr</italic>SBPase-WT concentrated at 3-6 mg/mL was tested for crystallization on screens JCSG I-IV in 200 nL sitting drops. Single crystals were obtained and optimized with mother liquor 0.1 M sodium HEPES pH=7.5, 2% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 400, 2.0 M ammonium sulfate, flash-frozen in mother liquor supplemented with 25% glycerol and tested for X-ray diffraction. Complete X-ray diffraction datasets were collected at SOLEIL beamline Proxima-2A and allowed the determination of the crystal structure by model replacement with 5iz3, the structure of ortholog SBPase from the moss <italic>Physcomitrium patens.</italic> Model building in COOT and refinement in the PHENIX software suite yielded structure deposited under PDB ID 7b2o (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Emsley, Lohkamp et al. 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Adams, Afonine et al. 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Liebschner, Afonine et al. 2019</xref>). After we obtained our experimental structure, the European Bioinformatics Institute (Hinxton, UK) communicated high-accuracy prediction models computed by Deepmind ALPHAFOLD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jumper, Evans et al. 2021</xref>), including a prediction of <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase structure (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/P46284">https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/P46284</ext-link>) that matches chain A in 7b2o crystal structure with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.453 Å. Hence, X-ray crystallography and AlphaFold independently contribute to the proposed structural analysis.</p>
<p>In order to obtain the structure of <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase in a reduced state, crystals were grown in the presence of 10 mM of the reducing agent tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) in condition JCSG IV E8/56 0.2 M lithium sulfate, 0.1 M Tris pH 7.0, and 1.0 M sodium/potassium tartrate. Crystals were cryo-protected in mother liquor supplemented with 25% ethylene glycol, flash-frozen and tested for X-ray diffraction at SOLEIL beamline Proxima-2A. A complete dataset was collected that allowed the determination of the structure by molecular replacement with 7b2o as a template, resulting in structure 7zuv. Among the eight <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase copies of the asymmetric unit, two had their disulfides absent as a consequence of the TCEP treatment while the others six subunits were essentially identical to untreated structures in entry 7b2o (<italic>i.e.</italic>, fully oxidized form).</p>

<title>Enzymatic assays</title>
<p>The catalytic activity of 10-200 nM pure recombinant <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase was spectrophotometrically assayed in buffer A by coupling the hydrolysis of 1 mM FBP into F6P to the reduction of 0.5 mM NADP<sup>+</sup> into NADPH through isomerization of F6P into glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) by 0.5 U.mL<sup>-1</sup> phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) and the oxidation of G6P into 6-phosphogluconolactone (6PGL) by 0.1-0.5 U.mL<sup>-1</sup> glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH). Reporter assay is coupled in a molar ratio FBP:F6P:G6P:6PGL of 1:1:1:1 to the oxidation of one molar equivalent of NADP<sup>+</sup> into NADPH that we recorded over 20 minutes by measuring the absorbance at 340 nm using a UVIKON spectrophotometer. Pre-treatments with 0-100 mM reduced dithiothreitol (DTTred), 0-30 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, and 0-15 µM recombinant <italic>Cr</italic>TRX-f2 supplemented with 1 mM DTTred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lemaire, Tedesco et al. 2018</xref>) were carried out for 30 min at room temperature before measuring enzyme activity as described above.</p>

<p>Quantification of free reactive cysteines on recombinant CrSBPase was performed with 5,5ʹ-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB, Ellman’s reagent) mixed with the purified recombinant protein in a 200:1 molar ratio in a 1 mL reaction volume containing 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9 as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Meloni, Fanti et al. 2024</xref>). Reaction of DTNB with solvent-exposed cysteine thiols produces 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate (TNB<sup>-</sup>) that we quantified by monitoring the absorbance at 412 nm and a molar extinction coefficient of TNB<sup>-</sup> of 14.15 mM<sup>-1</sup>.cm<sup>-1</sup>.

<title>Molecular dynamics</title>
<p>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed with the Gromacs package (v2021.4). A dimer of CrSBPase was solvated in a rhombic dodecahedron box with at least 8 Å between the protein atoms and the box edges, which corresponds to ∼64000 atoms in total (∼18000 water molecules) and a triclinic box of 97x97x68 Å<sup>3</sup>. The box was neutralized with 18 sodium atoms to make it neutral. The starting conformation was the crystallized structure of oxidized CrSBPase, and we protonated C115 and C120 to manually create the reduced state. The protein was described with the Amber14SB force field and water with the TIP3P model. Non-bonding interactions were described with standard parameters: van der Waals interactions had a cut-off of 8 Å, and electrostatic interactions were computed with PME with default parameters with a separation between spaces at 8 Å. Bonds containing a hydrogen atom were restrained with the LINCS algorithm with default parameters. After an energy minimization, the system was equilibrated under the NPT conditions with a δt=1 fs timestep, the velocity-rescale thermostat and the Berendsen barostat. Velocities were generated at 100 K and the system was heated up to 300 K in 400 ps before performing 100 ps at 300 K. We then ran simulations of 20 µs under the NPT conditions with a δt=2 fs timestep, the velocity-rescale thermostat and the Parrinello-Rahman barostat.</p>

<title>Crystal structure of <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase</title>
<p>Pure recombinant <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase crystallized in space group P2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2 and provided a complete X-ray diffraction dataset at a resolution of 3.09 Å. The asymmetric unit is composed of six polypeptide chains packing as three dimers and four water molecules could be modeled. All chains align within a root mean square deviation (RMSD) &lt;0.25 Å and can be considered identical. 309 out of the 331 residues were built in the electron density, the unmodelled sequences are in the disordered extensions at the amino- and carboxy-termini of the model. <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase folds into two distinct domains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1A-B</xref>). The amino-terminal domain (NTD, residues 73-247) is composed of helices 1, 2, and 3 and a mixed β-sheet formed by strands 3-9. The carboxy-terminal domain (CTD, residues 248-383) is composed of helices 4, 5, and 8 and helices 6 and 7 that sandwich a mixed β-sheet formed by strands 10-13. α-helices 1-3 pack on the amino-terminal end of the seven-strand sheet, while α-helices 4,5, and 8 pack on the carboxy-terminal end of the four-strand sheet. α-helices 6 and 7 are sandwiched in between the two sheets. <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase chain A aligns with previously reported crystal structure of <italic>Pp</italic>SBPase with an RMSD of 0.478 Å (Gütle et al. 2018 PDB 5IZ3). This close structural similarity between orthologues indicates common structural properties supporting a conservation of the SBPase function in the evolutionary time separating the microalga Chlamydomonas from the land moss <italic>P. patens</italic>. A short antiparallel β-sheet is constituted of 4-residue strands 1 and 2 separated by a β-turn and preceded by loop A<sub>113</sub>SCAGTAC<sub>120</sub>. This motif projects to solvent from α-helices 2 and 3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1C-D</xref>). Residues 113-130 forming the loop and β-hairpin (LBH) motif are positioned away from the core of the protein, at 15.3 Å from water molecule 401 (W401), and will be further discussed in the next sections.</p>

<title>CrSBPase catalytic pocket</title>
<p><italic>Cr</italic>SBPase is structurally similar to its ortholog from the moss <italic>Physcomitrium patens</italic> (RMSD=0.478 Å) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gutle, Roret et al. 2016</xref>). SBPase is a homolog of FBPase, another enzyme involved in the CBBC in photosynthetic organisms and also ubiquitously involved in neoglucogenesis. Cytosolic isoforms of FBPase from non-plant sources have been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Moorhead, Hodgson et al. 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lee and Hahn 2003</xref>). For instance, the crystal structure of human muscle FBPase complexed with its substrate (FBP) was solved (PDB entry: 5l0a, to be published). We aligned the structure <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase onto this human FBPase:FBP complex from entry 5l0a, confirming their similarity (RMSD = 0.824 Å) with the notable exception of the LBH motif which is absent in FBPase. In a 4-Å distance to FBPase co-crystallized with FBP we aligned 12 residues that are likely available for FBP or SBP binding by <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1E</xref>): E155, D173, D176, G177, Y287, G289, G290, M291, K317, L318, R319, and E323. These residues are exposed to the solvent in a continuous surface (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1F</xref>). W401 could be modelled at the center of the putative SBPase catalytic pocket, in the vicinity of E155, D173, D176, R319, and E323, in the catalytic pocket predicted from alignment with human FBPase bound to FBP. W401 specifically is in bonding distance to catalytic residues D178, D181, and E328. W401 is likely to hydrolyze the substrate SBP.</p>

<title>Sites of redox post-translational modifications</title>
<p>Ten cysteines could be located in each monomer of <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase (C115, C120, C149, C153, C169, C222, C231, C340, C355, C362). Previous redox-based proteomic studies exploiting Chlamydomonas cells or protein extract established that <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase undergoes redox modifications by thioredoxin-dependent dithiol/disulfide exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lemaire, Guillon et al. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Pérez-Pérez, Mauriès et al. 2017</xref>),S-glutathionylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Zaffagnini, Bedhomme et al. 2012</xref>), or S-nitrosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Morisse, Zaffagnini et al. 2014</xref>). While the putative Cys sites for S-glutathionylation are not known, thioredoxin and S-nitrosylation Cys targets were identified as being C222/C231/C355/C362, and C355/C362, respectively. DTNB-based thiol titration on the native purified SBPase indicates that 4.0 ± 0.6 cysteines are likely reactive owing to their relative exposure to solvent in a free thiol form. Amino acid residue accessible surface area and accessibility (ASA) calculation is consistent with DTNB titration, with C149, C153, C231, and C355 exposed to the solvent (ASA respective areas: 0.154 Å², 0.113 Å², 0.308 Å², and 10.083 Å²), and the six others either shielded from solvent (C169, C222, C340, and C362) or engaged in a disulfide bridge (C115, C120) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ahmad, Gromiha et al. 2004</xref>). In <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase crystal structure, C222 and C231 are positioned on neighboring strands of the amino-terminal domain, exposing their thiol 3.5 Å away from each other (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1G</xref>, supplementary figures 2A-B). The formation of an intramolecular disulfide bridge at this cysteines pair is possible if local main chain rearrangements allow a closer contact. C362 thiol is positioned 10.5 Å away from the nearest thiol group of C340. Additionally, C340 and C362 are exposed on an opposite side of the carboxy-terminal β-sheet, disfavoring the formation of an internal disulfide bridge. C355 points its side chain towards C153 and C169 with a thiol-thiol distance of 4.6 Å and 10.1 Å, respectively. Although not observed in our model, a C355-C153/C169 dithiol-disulfide exchange is thus plausible, as described for plant FBPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jacquot, Lopez-Jaramillo et al. 1997</xref>). Local rearrangements that occur upon FBPase disulfide reduction causes a larger scale relaxation of the active site required to reach maximal catalytic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chiadmi, Navaza et al. 1999</xref>) as kinetically characterized for enzymes from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Yoshida and Hisabori 2018</xref>) and <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zimmer, Swart et al. 2021</xref>). In Chlamydomonas and Physcomitrium SBPases, the FBPase-type regulatory disulfide is not observed but the SBPase-type C115-C120 bridge is conserved in a nearly identical position in the LBH motif where it may regulate the enzyme by alternative conformational rearrangements. Indeed, the disulfide-bonded cysteines constrain Chlamydomonas SBPase loop A<sub>113</sub>SCAGTAC<sub>120</sub> into a compact lasso that could open into a relaxed conformation hypothetically activating catalysis.</p>

<title>Sites of post-translational phosphorylations</title>
<p><italic>Cr</italic>SBPase was reported to be phosphorylated from algae extracts at residues T112, S114, T118, S123, T310, S311, and T313 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wagner, Gessner et al. 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Werth, McConnell et al. 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">McConnell, Werth et al. 2018</xref>). Consistently with the proximity of these residues in two sectors of the sequence (supplementary figure 3), the candidate modification sites are located in two contiguous regions in the three-dimensional structure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1H</xref>). T112, S114, T118, and S123 are exposed to the solvent of the amino-terminal domain. The residues belong to or are located nearby the A<sub>113</sub>SCAGTAC<sub>120</sub> motif where phosphorylations may cross-signal with redox modifications on C115 and C120. T310, S311, and T313 are located on the other edge of the enzyme, at the solvent exposed tip of the carboxy-terminal domain. Their co-localization at the T<sub>310</sub>SPT<sub>313</sub> motif likely facilitates a coordinated phosphorylation of the three residues by the same kinase. Because both groups of potential phospho-sites are located at 17-18 Å from the catalytic pocket (W401 taken as a reference point), there is no straightforward mechanism by which such modifications would exert a control over <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase activity. Analysis of phospho-mimicking mutants along with the identification of the actual kinases/phosphatases couples that control <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase phosphorylation state would allow to comprehend the role of this putative regulatory mechanism.</p>

<title><italic>Cr</italic>SBPase enzymatic activity</title>
<p>Recombinant <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase was assayed for its capacity to catalyze FBP hydrolysis into F6P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gutle, Roret et al. 2016</xref>), a proxy for the hydrolysis of SBP into S7P that we could not test by lack of available substrate and kinetic reporter method. Previous studies demonstrated that plant SBPase requires the cofactor Mg<sup>2+</sup> and a chemical reductant (DTTred) to be fully activated <italic>in vitro</italic>, reaching a K<sub>M</sub> value of 0.05 mM and a k<sub>cat</sub> of 81 sec<sup>-1</sup> in optimal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Anderson 1974</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Woodrow and Walker 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cadet and Meunier 1988</xref>). In agreement with this, we found a total absence of activity in the untreated <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase (data not shown), whereas pre-incubation of the enzyme with DTTred and Mg<sup>2+</sup> resulted in a strong activation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). By testing different concentrations of MgSO<sub>4</sub> (3, 10, 15, and 20 mM) and DTTred (1, 10, 25, 50, and 100 mM), we established that 10 mM of DTT and 10 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub> are the optimal conditions to attain the maximum specific activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2A</xref> and 2B). Unexpectedly, DTTred concentrations above 10 mM had an inhibitory effect, causing a drastic drop in activity that probably resulted from structural effects leading to denaturation of the enzyme (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2A</xref>). In contrast, we observed no such inhibitory effect in the presence of magnesium at concentrations above 10 mM (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2B</xref>). Under physiological conditions, the light-dependent redox regulation of plant SBPase is specifically exerted by f-class thioredoxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gutle, Roret et al. 2016</xref>), which are reduced by the ferredoxin-thioredoxin cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Schürmann and Buchanan 1975</xref>). The chloroplast TRX-f2 from <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> was thus tested and validated for its capacity to activate <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase by reduction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2C</xref>). The maximum activity, corresponding to 12.15 ± 2.15 µmol(NADPH) min<sup>-1</sup> mg(SBPase)<sup>-1</sup>, was obtained by pre-incubating the enzyme with 1 µM <italic>Cr</italic>TRX-f2 supplemented with 1 mM DTT and 10 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, and maintained even at higher <italic>Cr</italic>TRX-f2 concentrations (<italic>i.e.</italic>, 5 and 10 µM) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2C</xref>). <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase specific activity that we report is comparable to that reported for spinach SBPase with FBP as substrate (3.5 µmol min<sup>-1</sup> mg<sup>-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Seuter, Busch et al. 2002</xref>)) and to that reported for another recombinant Chlamydomonas SBPase with SBP as substrate (7.15 ± 0.61 µmol min<sup>-1</sup> mg<sup>-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tamoi, Nagaoka et al. 2005</xref>)).</p>

<p>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the reduced structure were performed by starting from a dimer of the crystallized oxidized form and forcing C115 and C120 residues to be reduced in the thiol state (-SH). We then ran two independent replicas of 20 µs of MD. In addition, we also ran two independent replicas of 2 µs of MD in the oxidized form. In one of the replicas of the reduced form (MD1), the protein structure barely changed as observed in the SG(C115)/SG(C120) distance that plateaued at ∼7 Å, as well as in the RMSD with respect to the starting conformation that stayed around 2 Å (see supplementary figures 8-9 for plots and 12 for images of the structures). However, in the other replica of the reduced form (MD2), significant changes of conformation appeared: the SG(C115)/SG(C120) distance ended up at ∼10 Å with peaks at 20 Å and the RMSD values ended up at 3.7 and 2.8 Å (supplementary figures 8-9). The difference between MD1 and MD2 is stronger when one focuses on the RMSD of the mobile motif (residues 112 to 131, supplementary figure 10). We observed that after 17 µs of MD all chains adopted an equilibrated conformation and then fluctuated around that conformation (supplementary figure 10); representative structures extracted from MD were thus obtained from a clustering on the time frame (or block) 17-20 µs.</p>
<p>The two chains A and B from MD2 adopt a different final conformation (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4A</xref> for the overlap with the crystallized oxidized structure and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4B</xref> for the overlap with the crystallized reduced structure), and we cannot directly conclude on which one is the most stable. Moreover, the residues 115 to 128 of each chain from MD1/2 do not overlap well with the crystallized reduced structure which means that neither of the two chains conformations from MD simulations has converged towards the crystallized state. However, we can observe in the reduced crystallized structure that residues 134-148 form an α-helix which is also present in chain B from MD2 whereas this structure is not kept in chain A from MD2 (see green chain on the right of <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figures 4A-B</xref>). In addition, mobile motif from chain B seems to open towards the solvent in a similar way with what was observed for FBPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chiadmi, Navaza et al. 1999</xref>). Thus, we conclude that chain B from MD2 is more representative of the true reduced conformation than chain A from MD2. If we compare the mobility of chain B from MD2 in the reduced state with one chain in the oxidized state (also chain B from MD2), we can see that the mobile motif is overall more flexible in the reduced state, which is especially true for residues around C120 (residues 118 to 123, supplementary figure 11). We then analyzed the RMSD of residues 112 to 131 from chain B during MD2 (supplementary figure 12): residues 112, 130 and 131 barely move which is expected since they belong or are directly connected to the two α-helixes flanking the mobile motif. At ∼6 µs of the trajectory almost all other residues (113-129 residues with the sole exception of C120) display an abrupt change of conformation, with a different magnitude though: starting from ∼2 Å, the RMSD jumped to 3 Å for some residues (residue 129) and to 15 Å for other residues (residues 125, 126) (supplementary figures 9, 10, and 12). At ∼13.5 µs, another change occurs which involves C120 but not all the other residues. Thus, we conclude that the opening of the mobile motif happens in a concerted way and not sequentially residue per residue.</p>

A third <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase species elutes at an apparent molecular mass of 145 kDa, that fits with a homotetramer. According to the absorbance of each peak and considering that they represent all states of purified and oxidized <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase in solution, we estimate a repartition percentage of species of 10:53:37 for the tetramer:dimer:monomer mixture (total = 100%). Re-injection of the dimer peak fraction over size-exclusion chromatography yielded a similar mixed profile, supporting a dynamic equilibrium over the time of the experiment (&gt;2 h) (data not shown).</p>
<p><italic>Cr</italic>SBPase was crystallized in space groups P2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2 or P12<sub>1</sub>1 with respectively 6 and 8 protomers in the asymmetric unit. Proteins Interfaces Structures and Assemblies (PISA) analysis reveals that protomers of both crystals pack as homodimers with extensive subunit interface of buried area 4,170 Å² in a similar manner (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">figure 5A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Krissinel and Henrick 2007</xref>). In the asymmetric unit of <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase crystallized in reducing conditions (7zuv) or within crystallographic neighboring units of <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase in oxidized state (7b2o), <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase further packs into a homotetramer, a dimer of dimers (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">figure 5B</xref>). The apparent molecular mass of SBPase extracted from <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> cultures cultivated in TAP medium under 40 µE.m<sup>-</sup>².s<sup>-1</sup> illumination is comprised between 130 and 40 kDa with the homodimer representing the predominant state as supported by immunoblot analysis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">figure 6B</xref>).</p>

<p>To further investigate the oligomeric dynamics of CrSBPase, we performed small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis of purified (untreated) or reduced enzyme <italic>in vitro</italic> which reveals an increase in the protein radius of gyration from 39 to 62 Å upon reduction (supplementary figure 6). This observation implies a change in the oligomeric state of <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase correlating with the redox state. As a matter of fact, purified <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase tends to precipitate into amorphous aggregates that can be turned into droplets of liquid-liquid phase separation by treatment with 10 mM TCEP (supplementary figure 7). Since the LBH redox module is positioned at the homodimer interface (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">figure 5C</xref>), we postulated that the reduction of the C115-C120 disulfide bond and the subsequent local conformation changes depicted by MD affect the oligomer equilibrium of the enzyme. As a matter of fact, we observed that protein mutants C115S or C120S, which are unable to form the C115-C120 disulfide bond, elute in a different oligomer ratio than wild-type CrSBPase (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">figure 6A</xref>). Indeed, we observed a relative accumulation of monomer and tetramer species at the expense of the dimer state in both mutants. This suggests that C115-C120 is involved in the stabilization of the dimer. Meanwhile, the activity of the two Cys mutants still responded to DTT/Mg-dependent activation resembling the response of the wild-type protein. No activity was detected for native and untreated forms, while specific activities of C115S and C120S mutants upon treatment with DTT and MgSO<sub>4</sub> (10 mM for both compounds) were respectively 96% and 107% with respect to wild-type maximum activity (13.3 ± 2.5 and 14,9 ± 0,9 µmol(NADPH) min<sup>-1</sup> mg(SBPase)<sup>-1</sup> for C115S and C120S mutants, respectively, supplementary figure 14). Based on these data, we can thus conclude that C115-C120 disulfide bond is not the sole thiol-dependent regulatory mechanism involved in the modulation of <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase activity and that the redox dependency of <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase catalysis likely depends on other cysteine pairs. Future studies are required to shed light on the identity of cysteine residues that contribute to <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase catalytic modulation other than C115 and C120.</p>

<title>Conclusions and perspectives</title>
<p>We report the first crystal structure of an SBPase from the microalga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, a model for the molecular and cell biology of plants. SBPase is a photosynthetic enzyme involved in the regeneration phase of the CBBC cycle proved to be target of multiple regulations that we map onto our structural model. The native folding of <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase is highly similar to that of SBPase from the moss <italic>Physcomitrium patens</italic> and to FBPase from chloroplast or cytoplasmic origins. Notwithstanding its propensity to form crystals, recombinant <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase encompasses a range of oligomeric states, dominated by a homodimeric form susceptible to exchange for monomers, tetramers and higher-order assemblies. This oligomer equilibrium is dynamic and correlates with the presence of a disulfide bridge at the vicinity of the monomer-monomer interface, in the SBPase-specific LBH motif. We postulate that the reversible reduction/oxidation of the C115-C120 pair modulates the oligomerization of <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase, through the induction of a local disorder that we observed in the crystal structure of the protein under reducing conditions and that correlates with computations of molecular dynamics.</p>
<p>How this oligomeric exchange impacts the actual activity of the enzyme is an open question but should be aligned with previous reports on the allosteric character of the structurally similar FBPase enzyme which follows dimer/tetramer exchanges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Barciszewski, Wisniewski et al. 2016</xref>) with a Hill cooperativity coefficient close to 2 representing positive cooperativity in the context of a homodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Giudici-Orticoni, Buc et al. 1990</xref>). Recent <italic>in vivo</italic> proteome mapping in <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> localized SBPase in a punctate region surrounding the Rubisco pyrenoid nearby five other CBBC enzymes: phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases (GAP1, GAP3), fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA3), ribulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase (RPE1), and phosphoribulokinase (PRK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wang, Patena et al. 2022</xref>). Based on our structure-function study on recombinant SBPase, we can speculate that the altered redox state of SBPase may influence the movement to or from the liquid partition of the stroma, where SBPase is metabolically required to provide its contribution to CBBC reactions near other enzymes of the pathway.</p>

<p>In this study, Le Moigne and coworkers shed light on the structural details of the Sedoheptulose-1,7-Bisphosphatase (SBPase) from the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The SBPase is part of the Calvin cycle and catalyzes the dephosphorylation of sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphate (SBP), which is a crucial step in the regeneration of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP), the substrate for Rubisco. The authors determine the crystal structure of the CrSBPase in an untreated, oxidized state. Based on this structure, potential active site residues and sites of post-translational modifications are identified. Furthermore, the authors determine the CrSBPase structure in a reduced state revealing the disruption of a disulfide bond in close proximity to the dimer interface. The authors then use molecular dynamics (MD) to gain insights into the redox-controlled dynamics of the CrSBPase and investigate the oligomerization of the protein using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and size-exclusion chromatography. Despite the difference in oligomerization, disruption of this disulfide bond did not impact the activity of CrSBPase, suggesting additional thiol-dependent regulatory mechanisms modulating the activity of the CrSBPase.</p>
<p>The authors provide interesting new findings on a redox-mechanism that modulates the oligomeric behavior of the SBPase. Comparisons of the Chlamydomonas structure to the previously determined SBPase structure from the moss Physcomitrium patens confirm a high structural similarity between the two proteins suggesting that this mechanism might be evolutionary conserved. Future research will have to address this question experimentally, also considering potential cooperativity between the subunits to confirm the link between oligomerization and SBPase activity.</p>

<p>The central theme of the manuscript is to report on the structure of SBPase - an enzyme central to the photosynthetic Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle. The authors claim that the structure is the first of its kind from a chlorophyte Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a model unicellular green microalga. The authors use a number of methods like protein expression, purification, enzymatic assays, SAXS, molecular dynamics simulations and x-ray crystallography to resolve a 3.09 A crystal structure of the oxidized and partially reduced state. The results are supported by the claims made in the manuscript. While the structure is the first from a chlorophyte, it is not unique. Several structures of SBPase are available and a comparison has been made between the structure reported here and others that have been previously published.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors provide interesting new findings on a redox-mechanism that modulates the oligomeric behavior of the SBPase, however without investigating this potential mechanism in more detail. The conclusions of this manuscript are mostly supported by the data, but they should be more carefully evaluated in respect to what is known from other systems as e.g. the moss Physcomitrella patens. This is especially of interest, as SBPase was previously reported to be dimeric, whereas for FBPase a dimer/tetramer equilibrium has been observed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank reviewer 1 for his/her comments on the novel or confirmatory character of our structure-function analysis on<italic>Cr</italic>SBPase. We address the questions of oligomeric states later in this response.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) Given that PpSBPase has been already characterized in detail, the authors should provide a more rigorous comparison to the existing data on SBPases. This includes a more conclusive structural comparison but also the enzymatic assays should be compared to the findings from P. patens. Do the authors observe differences between the moss and the chlorophyte systems, maybe even in regard to the oligomerization of the SBPase?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, a previous study conducted by one of the authors of the current manuscript (Stéphane D. Lemaire) and collaborators determined the structure and regulatory properties of SBPase from the moss <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> (Gütle <italic>et al.</italic> 2018 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1606241113">https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1606241113</ext-link>). We added a clearer reference to this earlier work. The differences that we observed regarding the oligomeric states of SBPase from <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> principally stem from our analytical method <italic>in vitro</italic> through size-exclusion chromatography, in comparison with crystal packing analysis in the reference study. We detailed <italic>Pp</italic>SBPase/<italic>Cr</italic>SBPase oligoimeric state comparison in the paragraph 'Oligomeric states of CrSBPase'. Besides, the asymmetric unit of our <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase crystal structure is also a homodimer, similarly to <italic>Pp</italic>SBPase, and we suggest that <italic>Pp</italic>SBPase is also likely to adopt several oligomeric states <italic>in vitro</italic>. If this were confirmed by experiments, SBPase in several organisms would behave analogously to FBPase regarding the dimer/tetramer equilibrium.</p>
<p>In paragraph 'Crystal structure of CrSBPase' we added a comparison by alignment of our <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase crystal structure to the previously reported _Pp_SBPase crystal structure, stating that with RMSD=0.478 Å the proteins are essentially identical.</p>
<p>In paragraph '<italic>Cr</italic>SBPase enzymatic activity' we compared the value we obtained for enzyme specific activity to those previously published on other SBPase from Chlamydomonas or the land plant <italic>Spinacia oleracea</italic>, highlighting the similarity of results in three different systems and teams (Seuter <italic>et al.</italic> 2002 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1019297521424">https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1019297521424</ext-link> and Tamoi <italic>et al.</italic> 2005 DOI: 10.1271/bbb.69.848).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors should include the control experiments (untreated SBPase) and the assays performed with mutant versions of the SBPase, which are currently only mentioned in the text or not shown at all.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We add supplementary figure 14 in order to illustrate that since SBPase C115S or C120S mutants are still activated by reducing agent, the disulfide bridge between cysteines 115 and 120 is not the single control over SBPase activity but rather a control over the oligomeric exchange of the enzyme indirectly contributing to redox activation of the active site.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The representation of the structure in figures (especially Figures 1 and 3) should be adjusted to match the author's statements. In Figure 1, the angle from which the structure is displayed changes over the entire figure making it difficult to follow especially as a non-structural biologist. Furthermore, important aspects of the structure mentioned in the text are not labeled and should be highlighted, by e.g. a close-up. Same holds true for Figure 3 that currently mostly shows redundant information.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank reviewer 1 for his/her advise on how to improve Figure 1. We drew new images for the complete figure, hopefully providing more consistent and clearer visual support to our text. For simplicity, protein is now always represented centered around its active site in the same orientation. We represent co-crystallized water in all projections as a guide to the eye.</p>
<p>Figure 3 and supplementary figure 3 were switched in order to better represent the experimental evidence provided by the resolution of SBPase structure under reducing conditions, i.e., the increase in local disorder around C115-C120 pair of cysteines in the 113-130 stretch forming a redox-conditionally dynamic loop and β-hairpin motif.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors state that mutation of C115 and C120 to serine destabilize the dimer formation, while more tetramer and monomer is formed. As the tetramer is essentially a dimer of dimers, the authors should elaborate how this might work mechanistically. In my opinion, dimer formation is a prerequisite for tetramer formation and the two mutations rather stabilize the tetramer instead of destabilizing the dimer.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Time-dependent dynamic character of SBPase oligomer exchange is not resolved by the current study because we essentially combined size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and X-ray crystallography to define quaternary structures at equilibrium. Overall, homodimer is the dominant state of wild-type SBPase by abundance in the purified recombinant form and by forming the constitutive asymmetric unit in all crystal packings. Dimer is indeed present in the tetramer state, a dimer of dimers, as pertinently stated by reviewer 1.</p>
<p>This being recognized, we tried to explain the systematic co-elution of the principal dimeric form with an additional species of smaller size on SEC (supplementary figure 1, right-side shoulder of the peak), at the apparent mass of a monomer. When solving the crystal structures of SBPase we realized that the dimer interface is contributed by residues 113-130 forming a loop and β-hairpin motif. Notably, in this loop cysteine 115 (C115) maps at bonding distance of 3.9 Å of side chain of arginine 220 (R220) from dimer partner subunit. In loop 113-120, cysteine pair C115 and C120 are subject to redox switching between disulfide (closed) and dithiol (open) conformations, as shown in our structures 7B2O and 7ZUV, respectively. Given that the reduction of C115-C120 disulfide bridge correlates with a higher flexibility of this motif that contributes to dimer interface (figure S3), we hypothesized that reduction of SBPase would destabilize dimer state to the benefit of transitory monomer state, and indeed point mutagenesis of C115S or C120S caused a large modification of oligomer equilibrium in favour of the monomer (figure S1C).</p>
<p>Mechanistically, we suggest two scenarios for the tetramer formation: either monomers first interact as in the crystallographic dimer before pairing such dimers into tetramers (as proposed by reviewer 1), or monomers start tetramerization by favoring the alternative subunit interface (figure 5B, between cyan and magenta chains) before stabilizing the crystallographic homodimer interface. In this latter case, monomerization would be necessary to efficiently re-arrange SBPase dimers into tetramers.</p>
<p>In physiological conditions the re-arrangement switch would be controlled by C115-C120 reduction through ferredoxin-thioredoxin redox cascade. Structural studies in dynamic conditions like native mass spectroscopy/photometry would be necessary to solve this speculation unambiguously although at this stage of our investigation there seem little doubt to us that C115-C120 disulfide-dithiol exchange is essential to control a dimer/monomer balance in first instance.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The central theme of the manuscript is to report on the structure of SBPase - an enzyme central to the photosynthetic Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle. The authors claim that the structure is first of its kind from a chlorophyte Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a model unicellular green microalga. The authors use a number of methods like protein expression, purification, enzymatic assays, SAXS, molecular dynamics simulations and xray crystallography to resolve a 3.09 A crystal structure of the oxidized and partially reduced state. The results are supported by the claims made in the manuscript. One of the main weakness of the work is the lack of wider discussion presented in the manuscript. While the structure is the first from a chlorophyte, it is not unique. Several structures of SBPase are available. As the manuscript currently reads, the wider context of SBPase structures available and comparisons between them is missing from the manuscript. Another important point is that the reported structure of crSBPase is 0.453A away from the alphafold model. Though fleetingly mentioned in the methods section, it should be discussed to place it in the wider context.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank reviewer 2 for his/her assessment of our manuscript. In response to his/her suggestion to better compare our SBPase structure from the model microalga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> to that of the ortholog from <italic>Physcomitrium patens</italic> previously reported by an author of this manuscript (Stéphane D. Lemaire) and collaborators (Gütle et al. 2018), we wish to point out that paragraph 3 of the introduction was dedicated to this reference along with a mention to related <italic>Thermosynechococcus elongatus</italic> dual function fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (F/SBPase). We nevertheless follow his/her suggestion to better detail comparison between chloroplastic SBPase structures in the first result section 'Crystal structure of CrSBPase', consistently with response 1 to reviewer 1 (see above).</p>
<p>Regarding the integration of AlphaFold (AF) computational models in a general discussion about SBPase molecular structure, we wish to point out that our initial 7B2O crystallographic model of <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase was deposited in PDB on 2020-11-27 before AlphaFold2 was available for the scientific community (Jumper <italic>et al.</italic> publication date is 15 July 2021).</p>
<p>AF2 entry AF-P46284-F1-model_v4 from AlphaFold Protein Structure Database aligns with our crystal structure 7B2O chain E with RMSD = 0.434 Å, showing excellent agreement between experiment and prediction at the level of protein main chain. It must still be pointed out that it is the AF2 model which is at 0.434 Å away from the experiment, and not the opposite. Exceptions of alignments are in local differences in several loops conformations and in the length of secondary structure elements. Many amino acid residues side chains adopt distinct orientations between the computational model and the experimental structure.</p>
<p>AF3 was recently communicated (Abramson <italic>et al.</italic> 2024) along with its online prediction server hosted at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://golgi.sandbox.google.com">https://golgi.sandbox.google.com</ext-link>. <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase model from AF3 align to our crystal structure 7B2O chain A with RMSD = 0.489 Å showing again their strong similarity and with a smaller discrepancy between AF2 and AF3 of RMSD = 0.216 Å. The only significant deviations between 7B2O and AF3 are in the orientation of several side chains and notably on the conformation of region 114-131 that contain the redox sensor motif.</p>
<p>We added the last two paragraphs to the revised version of the manuscript, after the results section presenting our crystallographic work.</p>

<p>We addressed all minor points listed.</p>

<p>Line 220: The asymmetric unit only contains three dimers. The dimer of dimer or tetramer can only be reconstituted by displaying the symmetry mates.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We corrected our sentence for 'The asymmetric unit is composed of six polypeptide chains packing as three dimers'.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I also suggest that the authors separate the description of the asymmetric unit content from the modeled water molecules and rephrase e.g. „..and four water molecules could be modeled.&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We rephrased as suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I appreciate that the authors uploaded the structure in advance of this article, which allowed to evaluate the quality of the structure. Although this does not add valuable information, I have identified several unmodeled blobs, which possibly also account for waters.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Unmodeled blobs were tentatively assigned to water but had to be removed during later refinements. We used Coot Validate tools 'Unmodelled blobs' and 'Check/Delete water' to progress towards the current optimal refinement statistics. We admit that the resolution of the crystallographic dataset (3.09 Å) is limiting to reliably model mobile or less resolved elements like water molecules. Overall, we estimate that the functional elements of the structure are modeled to the best of our knowledge and with minimal subjectivity.</p>

<p>Line 223: The structure representation in Figure 1A/B has to be improved. The authors might consider labeling the two domains &amp; color them in two colors instead of the rainbow color coding. Furthermore, the 90{degree sign} rotation does not add much information. Here, turning the model in a different direction that allows to see the central b-sheet of domain 2 might be better suited. Furthermore, instead of describing b-strands first, followed by a-helices, I suggest describing which secondary structure elements form the two domains.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We improved Figure 1A as suggested while keeping Figure 2B with 90° rotation as rainbow color gradient in order to display with clarity the secondary structure content and connectivity. The orientation was tilted to better display the central β-sheet. This new version of Figure 1A/B should facilitate the text description of SBPase architecture that we amended as suggested.</p>

<p>Modified version of figure 1 now shows SBPase in the same orientation for panels A, E, F, G, H for simplicity. Domains labeling is indicated in panel A with NTD/CTD distinct colors as suggested.

</disp-quote>
<p>We modified figure 1 to show all equivalent panels (ie. A-E-F-G-H) with the same orientation. In this new form we think that solvent accessibility and the relative position of significant residues is easier to interpret for the reader. W401 is consistently labeled throughout figure 1 panels.</p>

<p>In the modified version of figure 1 we estimate that C222 and C231 are more easily visible. We added a close-up view of C22-C231 environment in a new supplementary figure 2. Since we do not explore further the functional relevance of this redox pair we chose not include C222-C231 close-up view in main figure 1. We added legends and modified supplementary figures numbering accordingly.</p>

<p>Line 276: As already mentioned earlier, none of the panels in Figure 1 provide a close-up of this loop. This should be added.</p>

<p>This loop is now displayed as a close-up view in panels C and D of main figure 1.</p>

<p>Line 284: It is difficult to follow the relative positions of the potential modification sites if the model is always depicted from a different angle in Figure 1. The authors might want to change this across Figure 1 or show the rotation angle.</p>

<p>This problem was addressed in the revised figure 1, panels A-E-F-G-H are in the same orientation now. Panel B was kept at a rotation of 90° with corresponding annotation.</p>

<p>For comparative reasons, a full kinetic measurement (determination of Km and kcat) of the SBPase would also be helpful here.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We resolved to avoid a full kinetic measurement of <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase because we could neither identify a reliable chemical provider nor synthesize ourselves the physiological substrate sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphate (SBP) and only characterized the reaction with fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. However, in the revised form of the manuscript we added in main text paragraph '<italic>Cr</italic>SBPase enzymatic activity' the kinetic constants from the previous reference study conducted on spinach SBPase (Cadet and Meunier, Biochem. J. 1988) with KMSBP=0.05 mM and kcatSBP=81 sec-1 of fully active enzyme with SBP as a substrate. For comparison, the authors of this study report that activity of SBPase on FBP is in the same range but lower, with KMFBP=0.38 mM and kcatFBP=21 sec-1. We also added a comparison of specific activities of our <italic>Cr</italic>SBPase and spinach SBPase in the main text, showing that our enzyme behaves as previously reported ortholog from land plant.</p>

<p>Line 303: How much MgSO4 was used for the experiment shown in Figure 2A?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>10 mM of MgS04 was used for experiment shown in Figure 2A. We added this information in the figure legend. We also added in the legend that 10 mM DTT is present in the experiment of Figure 2B and that 10 mM of MgSO4 and 1 mM of DTT are present in the experiment of Figure 2C.</p>

<p>Line 321: In my opinion it is not necessary to show the regions of all molecules here. I was rather expecting a superposition of the two structures (oxidized and reduced) with a close-up of the respective disulfide in the two states.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the initial version of Figure 3 panels showing side-by-side all conformational variants of the redox motif appear redundant. We switched initial Figure 3 to supplementary data and replaced it with the crystallographic b-factor mapping of the redox motif, in the variable conditions resolved by the crystals. We would like to stress that all these conformations were experimentally determined through X-ray crystallography, whether of the crystal of pure inactive enzyme that proved to be oxidized on the redox motif, or of the equivalent crystals submitted to activating treatment by the chemical reductant TCEP. As an attempt to clarification we added visual boxes to better appreciate this reduction-induced conformational plasticity that we interpreted as a local <italic>conditional</italic> disorder.</p>

<p>Line 331: Could the authors provide movies of the MD simulation? Otherwise, interpretation of the MD simulation results might be difficult for non-experts.</p>

<p>We added two movies of 20-µsec MD simulations as supplementary data to help non-expert readers.</p>

<p>Line 343: It might be helpful to label the structure elements in Figure 4 accordingly (e.g. residues, etc.)</p>

<p>Line 381: Should be changed to Figure 5A.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We changed reference to figure 6 that is a renumbering of figure 5 with changes included from suggestions below. Figure 6 now includes chromatograms of recombinant SBPase in panel A and chromatogram and western blot analysis of Chlamydomonas extracts in panel B.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 383: See above, figure 5B. Which structure is shown in the figure? 7zuv or 7b2o? Maybe include both structures in the figure in a side-by-side view. The authors might also want to include the SEC chromatograms in the main figure. Especially the purification from Chlamydomonas is helpful to estimate whether post-translational modifications have an impact on the oligomerization. This should also be mentioned in the text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>7b2o and 7zuv are illustrated side-by-side in panels A and B of figure 5. This was indicated in the figure legend, we now added the information on the figure. As suggested above we included chromatograms initially presented as supplementary material in a new main figure 6, panel A for recombinant proteins and panel B for proteins extracted from Chlamydomonas. Initial figures 5D-E, showing surface conservation of the dimeric SBPase, is moved to supplementary figure 5.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 385: I don't find the cultivation of Chlamydomonas in the method section. It should be added.</p>

<p>We added a methods paragraph dedicated to « Cultivation of Chlamydomonas for native SBPase analysis ».</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 390-392: This information is not really helpful. Concentrated purified proteins might precipitate after a week storage without physiologically relevant effects being the reason.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the observation of a precipitate building up <italic>in vitro</italic> after a week of storage bears no particular physiological implications. We rather intended to report that an aggregated form of purified protein can be turned to droplets under the redox conditions that activate the enzyme. We reformulated these lines for clarification.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 397: I would appreciate having the SEC-chromatograms of the mutants also in the main figure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Size-exclusion chromatograms that were initially in supplementary figures are now shown in main text figure 6 panel A, with the profiles WT and mutants aligned.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 402: Where are these data shown? They should be included in Figure 5.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added a figure to present these data, not shown in the initial version of the manuscript. We preferred to place it as supplementary material because C115S and C120S mutant catalytic activity is essentially the same as WT and do not reveal a direct mechanistic effect of C115-C120 reduction over the catalytic pocket.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 427: Did the authors look into a possible cooperativity of their SBPase?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did not observe direct positive cooperativity that could be ascribed to allostery in our enzymatic assays. It was previously reported for spinach SBPase that SBP saturation functions were hyperbolic with no evidence of homotropic interactions in the enzyme oligomer (Cadet and Meunier Biochem J. 1988 253, 249-254). The authors of this kinetic study however present a clear sigmoid response of SBPase to Mg2+ concentration, suggestive of an activating cross-talk between active sites in the oligomer. We consider this hypothesis of interest and wish we could further investigate allosteric conformational changes when SBP physiological substrate would be available.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 428-434: I don't really understand how the proteome mapping fits in here. Do the authors speculate that SBPase is recruited by some of the identified enzymes or directly interacts with them or that rather the spatial distribution optimizes the reaction kinetics?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We indeed want to correlate our <italic>in vitro</italic> observations of CrSBPase conditions of activity to those recently published by the group of Dr. Martin Jonikas in a physiological, <italic>in vivo</italic> setup of <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> (Wang, Patena <italic>et al.</italic> Cell 2023 186, 3499–3518). We have no experimental evidence demonstrating the first suggestion that SBPase is recruited or directly interacts with partner enzymes but we privilege the second suggestion that local spatial distribution in the chloroplast stroma optimizes enzyme reaction kinetic thanks to Calvin-Benson-Bassham enzymes proximity. We rephrased these lines to clarify our hypothesis and express its speculative character.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>To make the manuscript stronger, the authors are recommended to do the following:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We followed given recommendations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) include a wider discussion on the other SBPase structures that are available. A detailed comparison should be made between the oxidized and reduced structures present in the PDB with the structures that are being reported in the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Consistently with reviewer #1 suggestion, and as detailed in response to public review above, we followed the recommendation to better report previous structural studies of SBPase in the results section. We also added comparisons with computational models from AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold3.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors mention co-operativity between the subunits. With excellent sampling from molecular dynamics simulations, the authors should demonstrate co-operativity between the subunits.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our molecular dynamic (MD) simulations span 20 µsec of SBPase in the dimeric state, starting from the experimental structures determined by XRC. In the considered time window, the only significant events that we observed are the local reorganization of the LBH motif that is a prerequisite for dimer rearrangement. We infer that local disorder contributes a separation of the pair of subunits in order to later allow for the building of the active homotetramer, at longer time scales that are outside the capacities used in this work. Moreover, demonstrating cooperativity with MD simulations would require more than a single event to ensure that results are significant, and performing series of 20µs-MD of SBPase is also outside the available capacities.</p>
