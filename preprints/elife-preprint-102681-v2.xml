<title>Abstract</title><p>We recently discovered the expression of a long noncoding RNA, lnc-FANCI-2, coinciding with cervical lesion progression from CIN1, CIN2-3 to cervical cancer. Viral E7 of high-risk HPVs and host transcription factor YY1 are two major factors promoting lnc-FANCI-2 expression. To explore possible roles of lnc-FANCI-2 in HPV-induced cervical carcinogenesis, we ablated the expression of <italic>lnc-FANCI-2</italic> in the HPV16-positive cervical cancer cell line, CaSki. Knock-out (KO) single cell clones expressed HPV16 oncogenes normally but displayed altered cell morphology and proliferation when compared with the parental cells. Proteomic profiling of cytosolic and secreted proteins from the parental and KO cells showed that lnc-FANCI-2 regulates expression of a subset of cell soluble receptors responsible for cell signaling, epithelial mesenchymal transition, and IFN responses. RNA-seq analyses revealed that, relative to the parental cells, lnc-FANCI-2 KO cells exhibited significantly increased RAS signaling but decreased IFN pathways. In the KO cells, phosphorylated Akt and Erk1/2, two important RAS pathway effectors, were increased more than 3-fold, accompanied by increase of IGFBP3, MCAM, VIM, and CCND2 (cyclin D2) and decrease of RAC3 expression. High levels of lnc-FANCI-2 and lower levels of MCAM in cervical cancer patients are associated with improved survival. We found that lnc-FANCI-2 interacts specifically with 32 host proteins, including H13, HNRH1, K1H1, MAP4K4, and RNPS1, and knockdown of MAP4K4 in CaSki cells led to an increase of phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and somewhat Akt. In summary, a key function of lnc-FANCI-2 is to intrinsically regulate RAS signaling to impact cervical lesion progression and affect cervical cancer prognosis.</p>

<title>Significance</title>
<p>Expression of lnc-FANCI-2 is related to cervical lesion progression. Knock-out (KO) or knock-down (KD) of lnc-FANCI-2 expression in HPV16-positive cervical cancer cells CaSki significantly increases RAS signaling, phosphorylation of Akt and Erk1/2, and the epithelial mesenchymal transition factors. lnc-FANCI-2 KO also regulates the expression of a subset of cell soluble receptor proteins IGFBP3 and MCAM. A high level of lnc-FANCI-2 and lower level of MCAM in cervical cancer patients are associated with improved survival. lnc-FANCI-2 in CaSki cells interacts specifically with 32 host proteins, including MAP4K4. KD of MAP4K4 expression in CaSki cells led to an increase in phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and Akt. Thus, one lnc-FANCI-2 function is to intrinsically regulate RAS signaling to impact cervical lesion progression.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cervical cancer is a leading cause of mortality in women worldwide. It is the second most diagnosed cancer among women, with an estimated 661,000 new cases worldwide each year, and the third most frequent cause of cancer-related death, accounting for 348,000 deaths annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Persistent infections in the cervical epithelium with the cancer-associated alpha human papillomaviruses (high-risk HPVs), in particular HPV16 and HPV18 with the sustained expression of viral oncoproteins, E6 and E7, contribute to squamous epithelial cell tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Approximate 31.3% of high-grade neoplastic cervical lesions progress to invasive cervical cancer in 30 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], while most lesions resolve spontaneously. The progression to cervical cancer typically takes 15 to 20 years after initial infection (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cervical-cancer">https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cervical-cancer</ext-link>). These observations suggest that active host defense systems play important roles in preventing malignant transformation of neoplastic cervical lesions, and additional factors besides E6 and E7 are necessary for cervical cancer development. Indeed, one tumor suppressor network, the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], can be activated by HPV-induced DNA damage. FA proteins including FANCA, FANCD2 and FANCI are elevated upon HPV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] and the activated FA pathway restricts HPV replication and guards host genome stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. FANCD2 mutation stimulates HPV16 and HPV31 genome amplification and also promotes cervical and vaginal cancer development in HPV16 E7 transgenic mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>].</p>
<p>HPV-positive cervical cancer tissues in general exhibit wild-type p53, wild-type K-RAS, and no overexpression of RAS genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Viral oncoprotein E7 plays a major role in the immortalization of primary epithelial cells mainly by inactivation of pRb family of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], whereas E6 mediates degradation of tumor suppressor p53 and activation of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. However, high-risk E6 and E7 are necessary but not sufficient to transform fully the immortalized cells into malignant cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] and additional oncogenic stress is needed. For example, the HRAS<sup>G12V</sup>, a constitutively activated RAS GTPase mutation, triggers malignant transformation of E6/E7-expressing keratinocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Normal RAS regulates cell proliferation, cell differentiation and cell adhesion through cellular signal transduction from growth-factor receptors such as insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBP1-6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Thus, overactive RAS signaling might facilitate transformation of E6/E7-expressing keratinocytes. In transgenic mice, HPV16 E6 and E7 can promote the development of spontaneous epithelial skin tumors, but not spontaneous tumors of the reproductive tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Prolonged estrogen treatment is required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Estrogen receptor (ER) activation stimulates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK/Erk) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (Pl3K/Akt) pathways, both of which are mediated by RAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. However, the molecular mechanism underlying estrogen-induced cervical cancer in E6 and E7 transgene mice is not fully understood.</p>
<p>Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are RNAs over 200 nucleotides (nt) in length lacking a coding capacity for translation into functional proteins. Although several lncRNAs have been proposed to function in diverse biological processes, evidence is still lacking to support the functionality of the majority of lncRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>].</p>
<p>We recently reported an increased level of lnc-FANCI-2 expression in high-risk HPV-positive cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and invasive cervical cancer (ICC) tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. At least 14 RNA isoforms of lnc-FANCI-2 are expressed by usage of two alternative promoters, alternative RNA splicing, and alternative selection of two polyadenylation sites from the genomic locus adjacent to the FANCI on Chr5. Ironically, the lnc-FANCI-2 was wrongly annotated by NCBI as a <italic>MIR9-3HG</italic> in the recently updated RefSeq database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/</ext-link>) and two alternative lnc-FANCI-2 promoters identified for expression of lnc-FANCI-2 are ∼10 kb downstream of the non-expressible miR9-3 gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Both lnc-FANCI-2 and FANCI are up-regulated simultaneously in neoplastic cervical lesions and cervical cancer by high-risk HPV infections. E6 but, in particular E7 are responsible for the enhanced expression of lnc-FANCI-2, the transcription of which is also regulated by YY1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. HPV infection increases YY1 levels but decreases the expression of p53-dependent miR-29a which targets the YY1 3ʹ UTR. Viral E7 interacts with YY1 and facilitates YY1 transactivation of lnc-FANCI-2 promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. In situ hybridization has revealed that lnc-FANCI-2 is preferentially cytoplasmic, but its function in HPV infected cells has not been characterized. In this report, we demonstrate that lnc-FANCI-2 in HPV16-infected cells controls RAS signaling by interaction with MAP4K4 and other RNA-binding proteins. Ablation of lnc-FANCI-2 in the cells promotes RAS signaling and phosphorylation of Akt and Erk. High levels of lnc-FANCI-2 and low level of MCAM expression in cervical cancer patients correlate with improved survival, indicating that lnc-FANCI-2 plays a critical role in regulating RAS signaling to affect cervical cancer progression and patient outcomes.</p>

<title>Differential expression of lnc-FANCI-2 in cervical cancer tissues and its derived cell lines</title>
<p>As lnc-FANCI-2 expression is up-regulated along with cervical lesion progression by high-risk HPV infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], we further verified the increased expression of lnc-FANCI-2 in cervical cancer tissues by RNAscope single molecule RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (RNA-ISH) using a lnc-FANCI-2 antisense probe spanning over the major isoform of lnc-FANCI-2 nt 359-1713 region (GenBank MT669800.1). We found both cytoplasmic and nuclear locations of the increased lnc-FANCI-2 ISH signals within the tumor nest in HPV16-infected cervical squamous cell carcinoma tissues, but not much so in its adjacent tissue areas (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>/B). The increased expression of lnc-FANCI-2 became obvious in human foreskin keratinocytes with HPV16 or HPV18 infection when compared to the HFK cells without HPV infection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>However, we subsequently demonstrated the high expression of lnc-FANCI-2 in two HPV16-infected cervical cancer cell lines (SiHa and CaSki) and two HPV16-infected low-grade cervical lesion-derived cervical keratinocyte subclone lines (W12 20861 and W12 20863 cells), but not in two HPV18-infected cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa and C4II cells), nor other HPV-negative cell lines of HCT116 (colorectal cancer cells), BCBL-1 (body cavity B lymphoma cells), HEK293 (Ad5 E1/E2-immortalized human kidney cells), and HaCaT (spontaneously immortalized human epidermal cells) (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>). Interestingly, the high expression of lnc-FANCI-2 was observed in a HPV-negative cervical cancer cell line C33A cells with mutations of both p53 and RB genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>] (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>). Northern blot confirmed the increased expression of lnc-FANCI-2 in C33A cells but no expression in HeLa cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>).</p>
<p>Subcellular distribution of lnc-FANCI-2 was characterized by cell fractionation and Western blot assays using nuclear SRSF3 and cytoplasmic GAPDH protein as an indication of fractionation efficiency (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C</xref>). By RT-qPCR analysis of the fractionated total RNA, we demonstrated that lnc-FANCI-2 RNA is mainly cytoplasmic in HPV16-positive CaSki cells, but nuclear in HPV16-positive SiHa and HPV-negative C33A cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C</xref>). The differential subcellular distributions of lnc-FANCI-2 RNA from CaSki to SiHa and C33A cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1D</xref>) were further confirmed by RNAscope RNA-ISH using the lnc-FANCI-2 antisense probe described above.</p>

<title>lnc-FANCI-2 regulates proliferation of HPV-transformed cervical cancer cells</title>
<p>lnc-FANCI-2 RNA is transcribed mainly from a proximal promoter TSS2, but also from an alternative minor, distal promoter TSS1. Two highly conserved YY1 binding motifs upstream of the TSS2 are essential for the TSS2 transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). To elucidate the function of lnc-FANCI-2 in high-risk HPV-infected cervical cancer cells, we knocked out (KO) lnc-FANCI-2 expression in HPV16-positive CaSki cells using CRISPR/Cas9 deletion of either a 3-kb promoter region encompassing both TSS1 and TSS2 or an 86-bp region containing two YY1-binding motifs in the TSS2 promoter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Two tested gRNAs with high KO efficiency were selected and cloned into a modified CRISPR/Cas9 expression vector to express both 5ʹ-specific gRNA and 3’-specific gRNA simultaneously for efficient genome editing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. CaSki cells stably transfected with the dual gRNA expression vector were generated. Through a serial dilution, several single cell clones were isolated and verified for homozygous deletion by PCR screening. PCR genotyping indicated successful homozygous deletion of the promoter or YY1-binding motifs, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>

<p>Loss of lnc-FANCI-2 expression in the single-cell clones was examined by RT-qPCR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). When compared to all control clones transfected and selected from an empty vector containing no gRNA, all single cell clones with deletion of YY1-binding motifs (ΔYY1) showed 70-80% reduction of lnc-FANCI-2 expression, whereas the single cell clones with deletion of both TSS1 and TSS2 promoters (ΔPr) showed &gt;90% reduction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Northern blot analysis confirmed the decrease in levels of the two major lnc-FANCI-2 isoforms (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>), with an abundant 4-kb lnc-FANCI-2 RNA derived from a distal polyadenylation site pA2 and a less abundant 2-kb of lnc-FANCI-2 RNA derived from a proximal polyadenylation site pA1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). Reduced lnc-FANCI-2 RNA expression was also confirmed by RNAscope RNA-ISH (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>). The parental (WT) CaSki cells expressed ∼10 copies of lnc-FANCI-2 RNA per cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], whereas the copy number of lnc-FANCI-2 RNA in the ΔYY1-D5 cells dropped to ∼5 copies and to ∼2 copies per cell in the ΔPr-A9 cells (each averaged from 200 cells).</p>
<p>Although the WT CaSki cells preferentially grow as distinct cluster cell islands, the lnc-FANCI-2 KO cells displayed a dispersed cell growth pattern and some cells exhibited an irregular or spindle-like cell morphology (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). The KO cells also grew slower than the parental CaSki cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>), formed fewer colonies with reduced size (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>), and showed decreased migration capacities (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>), with ΔPr-A9 cells having a more severe phenotype than ΔYY1-D5 cells. Subsequently, the ΔPr-A9 and ΔPr-B3 cells were further examined for their HPV16 E6 and E7 expression and the ΔPr-A9 for cell senescence. We found both ΔPr-A9 and ΔPr-B3 cells, when compared with parental WT CaSki cells, exhibited some small, variable changes in the expression of E6, E7, p53 (E6 downstream target) and E2F1 (E7 downstream target) proteins (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A</xref>), most likely from sampling in the assays, but the ΔPr-A9 cells displayed significant increase in cell senescence (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3B</xref>).

<title>lnc-FANCI-2 regulates the expression and secretion of cell soluble receptors</title>
<p>Considering that the altered expression of cell membrane proteins and secreted factors in the lnc-FANCI-2 KO cells might contribute to the observed different cell morphology and growth properties, we performed a Proteome Profiler Human sReceptor Array analysis to examine possible changes in expression of 105 well-characterized soluble protein receptors being involved in cell signaling using total cell lysates and cell culture supernatants from ΔPr-A9 and WT CaSki cells.</p>

<title>lnc-FANCI-2 regulates RAS GTPase activities to phosphorylate RAS signaling effectors Akt and Erk</title>
<p>RAS activation triggers two major downstream signal transduction pathways, Raf/Mek/Erk and PI3K/Akt (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>), to transduce signals from extracellular stimuli to the cell nucleus where specific effector genes are activated for their corresponding functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. To further confirm the GSEA data and verify that two major signaling pathways of RAS are activated, we first examined and compared the RAS GTPase activities in ΔPr-A9 cells and the WT CaSki cells. We found a significant increase in RAS GTPase activity in ΔPr-A9 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, top bar graphs), indicating that the endogenous lnc-FANCI-2 RNA in CaSki cells suppresses not only the expression of IGFBP3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4G</xref>), the most abundant IGFBP, but also RAS activation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, top bar graphs). Since ΔPr-A9 cells had undergone long term selection and adaption during single cell screening, the increased RAS GTPase activity might result from selection pressure for cell survival. However, by transient siRNA knockdown (KD) of lnc-FANCI-2 expression in the WT CaSki cells, we obtained a similar, albeit weaker, increase of RAS GTPase activity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, lower bar graphs). This result suggests that the increased RAS GTPase activity in ΔPr-A9 cells was unrelated to the persistent selection pressure, but rather the deficiency of lnc-FANCI-2.</p>

We observed a 3-fold increase in phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) and 2.5-fold increase of p-Erk1/2 (p44/p42 MAPK), after being normalized to total Akt and Erk levels, in ΔPr-A9 cells over the WT CaSki cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). These results were confirmed in ΔYY1-D5 cells (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6A</xref>). The increased p-Akt and p-Erk (mostly p-Erk2/p42) was accompanied by elevated expression of MCAM, VIM, and CCND2, and decreased expression of RAC3 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6A</xref>). These randomly chosen potential RAS effector proteins facilitate soluble receptor functions, cell proliferation, and EMT. Moreover, transient siRNA knockdown of lnc-FANCI-2 in the WT CaSki cells also led to the increased levels of p-Akt and p-Erk (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>) and increased expression of MCAM and VIM at 48 h and 96 h post-transfection (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). These observations indicate that a transient loss of lnc-FANCI-2 in CaSki cells is sufficient to trigger RAS signaling. The same siRNA transfection in HeLa cells, a lnc-FANCI-2 negative cell line (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1B</xref>), exhibited no effect on p-Akt or p-Erk1/2 levels (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6B</xref>), but in SiHa cells containing mainly nuclear lnc-FANCI-2 (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1D</xref>) enhanced the expression of p-Akt and p-Erk1/2 (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6B</xref>), verifying the specific effect of lnc-FANCI-2 depletion on RAS signaling pathways independently of predominant cellular distribution of lnc-FANCI-2.

The negative correlation at R= −0.321 (with p-value=1.02e-08) of Inc-FANCI-2 with MCAM in cervical cancer patients was obtained from the RNA-seq data from the TCGA CESC tumors downloaded from the TCGA data portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/">https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/</ext-link>). Only primary solid tumor samples (n=304 after exclusion of 2 metastatic samples and 3 normal samples) were subjected to analysis, with the data showing as a Scatter plot (H). Kaplan-Meier plot with log rank test p-value at 5.74e-05 (I) shows MCAM as a biomarker for poor prognosis of cervical cancer survival with a lower quartile group cutoff. RNA-seq and survival data are derived from the TCGA CESC cancer patients. (J/K) AKT and ERK phosphorylation is partially regulated by MCAM and IGFBP3 in CaSki cells. KD of MCAM (J) and IGFBP3 (K) expression in WT parental CaSki or ΔPr-A9 cells was treated with MCAM siRNA or IGFBP3 siRNA along with or without lnc-FANCI-2 siRNA for 48 h. Expression levels of individual proteins were immunoblotted using the corresponding antibodies. The level of MCAM, p-Akt, or p-Erk1/2 was calculated after normalizing to tubulin.

<p>As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref> and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7B</xref>, the increased RNA expression of MCAM (CD146 or MUC18) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>] appears to be transcriptional or posttranscriptional in both ΔPr-A9 and ΔYY1-D5 cells. We confirmed by RT-PCR the lnc-FANCI-2 KO-mediated increase of MCAM RNA expression in ΔPr-A9 cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). A rescue experiment was further performed by transient expression of one major isoform of lnc-FANCI-2 RNA (a-PA2, GenBank: MT669800.1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] in ΔPr-A9 cells to determine both nuclear and cytoplasmic MCAM expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>] in individual lnc-FANCI-2 expressing cells. ΔPr-A9 cells ectopically expressing diffused cytoplasmic lnc-FANCI-2 RNA, as detected by RNAscope RNA-ISH, exhibited a marked reduction in nuclear MCAM protein (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>-<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7E</xref>). Quantitative analyses of the ΔPr-A9 cells with or without transient lnc-FANCI-2 RNA expression showed significant reduction of nuclear MCAM protein in the 35 cells with rescued lnc-FANCI-2 expression when compared to the 54 cells expressing no lnc-FANCI-2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>). Due to RNAscope procedures, the membrane-bound and cytoplasmic MCAM protein was mostly removed by protease III treatment when RNA-ISH was performed and thus only the nuclear signal of MCAM protein remained was detectable by IF staining. Using cell fractionation, we detected a cleaved MCAM of ∼46 kDa mainly in the nuclear fraction by Western blot (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G</xref>). The increased nuclear MCAM expression in ΔPr-A9 cells was proportional to the cytoplasmic and total MCAM levels when compared with the WT CaSki cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G</xref>). The nuclear MCAM signal appeared as a proteolytic cleavage product presumably by the increased metalloprotease ADAM9 and ADAM10 proteins and decreased metalloprotease inhibitor TIMP2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), as observed in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>].</p>
<p>The significance of an inverse correlation of lnc-FANCI-2 and MCAM in CaSki cells was further investigated by analyzing their expression in 304 cervical cancer samples from the TCGA dataset. There was a significant negative correlation in lnc-FANCI-2 (being wrongly assigned as LINC00925 by NCBI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] and MCAM RNA levels (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7H</xref>). The opposite effects of lnc-FANCI-2 and MCAM on cervical cancer survival (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7I</xref> and <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8</xref>) show that the cervical cancer patients with a higher level of lnc-FANCI-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] but a lower level of MCAM in the cervical tissue (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7I</xref>) exhibited a better survival prognosis.</p>

<title>Regulatory roles of lnc-FANCI-2-mediated increase of MCAM and IGFBP3 on RAS signaling</title>
<p>To further dissect the lnc-FANCI-2-associated expression of MCAM and IGFBP3 on RAS signaling, we examined MCAM and IGFBP3 on phosphorylation of Akt and Erk1/Erk2 in CaSki cells in the presence or absence of lnc-FANCI-2. As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7J</xref>, we found, although KD or KO of lnc-FANCI-2 promotes phosphorylation of Akt and Erk (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7J</xref>, lane 2), that KD of MCAM expression in the parental WT CaSki cells in the absence of lnc-FANCI-2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7J</xref>, lane 3) or in ΔPr-A9 cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7J</xref>, lane 5) led to reduction of Akt and Erk phosphorylation. These data suggest that MCAM is a lnc-FANCI-2 effector but also could be a trigger of signal transduction as reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>].</p>
<p>IGFBP3 protein has been viewed as a RAS signaling regulator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], but recent studies show that IGFBP3 has a variety of intracellular ligands involved in many unexpected functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. Thus, KD or KO of lnc-FANCI-2-mediated IGFBP3 expression on RAS signaling in the parental WT CaSki cells or ΔPr-A9 cells was examined by Western blot after siRNA KD of IGFBP3 expression. As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7K</xref>, KD of IGFBP3 expression was found to increase phosphorylation of Erk1/2 by ∼70% (lane 4) to ∼60% (lane 6), but not much so for Akt phosphorylation (lanes 4 and 6). Instead, KD of IGFBP3 expression could prevent lnc-FANCI-2 KD-enhanced Akt phosphorylation in the parental WT CaSki cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7K</xref>, compare lane 2 and lane 3). These data suggest a separate role of IGFBP3 on phosphorylation of Erk1/2 from Akt in the presence or absence of lnc-FANCI-2.</p>

<title>MAP4K4 association with lnc-FANCI-2 RNA in CaSki cells regulates RAS signaling and phosphorylation of Akt and Erk</title>
<p>We speculated lnc-FANCI-2 restriction on RAS signaling through interactions with cellular proteins. Subsequently, comprehensive identification of lnc-FANCI-2-binding proteins in the parental WT CaSki cells was performed by an IRPCRP protocol (modified from published ChIRP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]) in combination with mass spectrometry (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>). In this protocol, the lnc-FANCI-2-binding proteins in the parental WT CaSki cells were covalently crosslinked to lnc-FANCI-2 RNA via UV irradiation and pulled down by pooled 30 antisense oligos crossing over the entire lnc-FANCI-2. The RNA extracted from the pulldowns were verified to be lnc-FANCI-2 specific by RT-PCR in the absence (-) or presence (+) of reverse transcriptase (RT) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>). The lnc-FANCI-2-binding proteins in the pulldowns were then subjected to LC-MS/MS analyses. We identified 32 specific lnc-FANCI-2-binding proteins, including H13, HNRH1, K1H1, MAP4K4, and RNPS1 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>, Table S4).</p>

<p>(A) The lnc-FANCI-2-associated proteins in the WT CaSki cells were identified by isolation of <underline>R</underline>NA-<underline>p</underline>rotein <underline>c</underline>omplexes using <underline>R</underline>NA <underline>p</underline>urification (IRPCRP)-mass spectrometry technology. (B) lnc-FANCI-2 RNA in the IRPCRP-1 and IRPCRP-2 pulldowns had the pooled antisense biotinylated oligos (pool 1 with oligos in even numbers and pool 2 with oligos in odd numbers) immobilized to avidin-beads first before mixed with cell lysates, while the IRPCRP-3 and IRPCRP-4 pulldowns had the oligos pool 1 and 2 separately mixed with cell lysates first before addition to the avidin-beads for the RNA pull-downs. RT-PCR in the absence (-) or presence (+) of reverse transcriptase (RT) was carried out using the RNA isolated from the individual IRPCRP experiments using a primer pair of oHBL5 and oHBL12 (Table S5) specific for lnc-FANCI-2 RNA detection. Beads only (no oligos) IRPCRP experiments served as a negative control. Total RNA from the WT CaSki cells after sonication was used as an input control. The arrow indicates the detected lnc-FANCI-2 RNA. (C) Proteins associated with lnc-FANCI-2 RNA identified from lnc-FANCI-2 IRPCRP pulldowns. A total of 32 proteins were specifically pulled down from lnc-FANCI-2 IRPCRP reactions 1-4 (PSM≥2 from two separate pulldowns, Table S4), with top 10 proteins binding lnc-FANCI-2 shown in the order by the number of identified PSM (peptide spectrum match) in LC-MS/MS. (D) Expression of p-Akt and p-Erk from CaSki WT cells 48 h after siRNA KD of MAP4K4 or lnc-FANCI-2 was immunoblotted by the corresponding antibodies. GAPDH served as a sample loading control. Fold change of the indicated proteins in the cells with KD of MAP4K4 or lnc-FANCI-2 over the cells treated by a non-targeting siRNA (siNS) was calculated after normalizing to GAPDH. (E) A proposed model illustrates how lnc-FANCI-2-protein complexes inhibit the RAS signaling pathway to control Akt/Erk phosphorylation and expression of host genes. RAS signaling can be regulated by integrating external and internal factors. In HR-HPV infected cells, viral oncoprotein E7-YY1 complex transactivates lnc-FANCI-2 expression. By interactions with cellular RBPs, the lnc-FANCI-2-protein complex inhibits RAS signaling. In the absence of lnc-FANCI-2, increased RAS signaling leads to phosphorylation of Akt and Erk and cascaded responses of transcription factors (TFs) and thus regulates the expression of RAS signaling responder genes, such as IGFBP3, MCAM, etc. Consequently, this brings fundamental biochemical and biological processes under control by finetuning the RAS pathway.</p></caption>

<p>MAP4K4, a serine/threonine protein kinase, stimulates cancer cell proliferation, invasion and migration, and is recently characterized as a novel MAPK/ERK pathway regulator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>] and negatively regulates RAS signaling by binding to Ras p21 protein activator 1 or RASA1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]. Although the exact MAK4K4 binding site on lnc-FANCI-2 was not explored, many enzymes turn out an RNA-binding enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>]. Thus, whether MAP4K4 association with lnc-FANCI-2 could regulate PI3K/Akt or MAPK/Erk signal transduction was investigated in the parental WT CaSki cells. We demonstrated that siRNA KD of MAP4K4 expression in the parental WT CaSki cells, as seen for KD of lnc-FANCI-2, led to ∼40% or more increase of phosphorylation of both Akt and Erk1/2 and increased expression of MCAM and IGFBP3 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>, compare lane 2 to lane 3). Interestingly, siRNA KD of MAP4K4 expression in the lnc-FANCI-2 KO ΔPr-A9 cells had no effect on expression of IGFBP3, only a minimal effect on MCAM, but strongly on pErk1/2 (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7C</xref>). The data suggest that, through RNA-protein interactions, the increased lnc-FANCI-2 RNA in cells and their association with MAP4K4 and other cellular proteins could be one arm to control RAS signaling and gene expression of its effectors (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>HPV oncoproteins E6 and E7 are necessary but not sufficient for development of cervical cancer. Indeed, early studies indicated that other oncogenic stress, such as activated RAS mutant, is needed to trigger malignant transformation of E6 and E7 expressing cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>] and tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>]. Moreover, E7 has been also reported to repress phosphorylation of Akt and Akt-mediated signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>]. In this study, we show that lnc-FANCI-2, whose expression is highly dependent on E7 and YY1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], intrinsically restricts RAS GTPase activities and phosphorylation of Akt and Erk presumably by interacting with cellular factors in HPV16-positive CaSki cells. Interestingly, early reports indicated that p-Akt attenuation by E7 could be abolished by introduction of H73E mutation in the E7 CR3 domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>]. This E7 CR3 domain is also essential to interact with transcription factor YY1 to activate lnc-FANCI-2 transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Thus, it would be presumable that the reported p-Akt attenuation by E7 might be mediated by the increased expression of lnc-FANCI-2. More importantly, these findings also suggest that additional oncogenic stress, such as activated RAS mutant, is required to overcome the lnc-FANCI-2 restriction on RAS signaling for the early observed malignant transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>] and tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>] of E6 and E7 expressing cells. In CaSki cells, loss of lnc-FANCI-2 in this report was found to promote RAS signaling but reduction of IFN responses. However, high RAS-AKT-ERK signaling induces cell senescence and inhibits tumor cell survival as shown in this report and in a lung cancer study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>].</p>
<p>Some lncRNAs function as RAS regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>] by their ability to sequester RAS-targeting miRNAs, including MALAT1/ miR-217, RMRP/miR-206, and KRAS1P/miR-143/let-7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>]. Conceivably, lncRNAs may also regulate RAS signaling through other mechanisms beyond miRNAs. In this report, loss of lnc-FANCI-2 in HPV16-positive CaSki and SiHa cells promotes RAS signaling and expression of RAS signaling effectors (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>). By profiling the proteins associated with lnc-FANCI-2 in CaSki cells, we identified a serine/threonine protein kinase MAP4K4 as one of major lnc-FANCI-2-binding proteins that may partially mediate the lnc-FANCI-2 restriction on RAS signaling. MAP4K4 is a negative RAS signaling regulator in the context of the early embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>] and lymphatic vascular development by interacting with RASA1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]. Indeed, silencing of MAP4K4 in parental WT CaSki cells, like KD or KO of lnc-FANCI-2, led to partially increase of both p-Akt and p-Erk1/2 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>) as reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>].</p>
<p>Interestingly, KD of MAP4K4 in ΔPr-A9 cells led to further increased expression of p-Erk1/2 but not p-Akt, suggesting a negative correlation of MAP4K4 activity in interaction with lnc-FANCI-2 on Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Thus, our data suggest that MAP4K4 protein may function coordinately with lnc-FANCI-2 RNA in the CaSki cells to restrict one arm but not the other of RAS signaling.</p>
<p>All HR-HPVs are capable of inducing lnc-FANCI-2 expression by experimental infection of keratinocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. HPV<sup>+</sup> cervical cancer tissues express high level of lnc-FANCI-2. As expected, all HPV16<sup>+</sup> cervical cancer and pre-cancer cell lines examined, such as CaSki, SiHa, W12 subclone cells 20861(HPV16<sup>+</sup>, integrated) and 20863 (HPV16<sup>+</sup>, episomal), produce lnc-FANCI-2. Unexpectedly, we found no expression of lnc-FANCI-2 in isogenic HPV18<sup>+</sup> HeLa and C4II cells, nor in colorectal cancer cell line HCT116, adenovirus 5 DNA-transformed human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293, spontaneously transformed aneuploid immortal keratinocyte cell line HaCaT, and KSHV-infected B cell lymphoma cell line BCBL-1 cells which are all HPV-negative cell lines. It remains to know what negatively regulates lnc-FANCI-2 expression in those cell lines and more HPV18<sup>+</sup> cell lines should be examined for lnc-FANCI-2 expression. However, we did find that a HPV-negative cervical cancer cell line, C33A cells expressing mutant p53 and mutant pRB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>], produce a high level of lnc-FANCI-2 (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1B</xref>). Using dual luciferase report assays, we did find lnc-FANCI-2 promoter activity in response to YY1 binding in CaSki and C33A cells, but not in HeLa and HCT116 cells, suggesting the presence of a repressive factor (s) in the latter two cell lines (data not shown). KD of E2F1 had no effect on lnc-FANCI-2 promoter activity in CaSki cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. In the lnc-FANCI-2 producing cells, we noticed that cellular location of lnc-FANCI-2 also varies from cell types, with lnc-FANCI-2 predominantly in the nucleus in SiHa and C33A cells, but in the cytoplasm in CaSki cells, although both cytoplasmic and nuclear lnc-FANCI-2 restrict RAS signaling. This suggests that a variety of nuclear and cytoplasmic functions of lnc-FANCI-2 remains to be explored.</p>
<p>IGFBP3 is a major IGF carrier and enhances both IGF- and EGF-RAS signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>] to activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>]. Surprisingly, we find a suppressive role of IGFBP3 on Erk phosphorylation, but not much on Akt, in the presence or absence of lnc-FANCI-2 in HPV16-positive CaSki cells. Although ∼99% of circulating IGF-1 is bound to IGFBPs, predominantly to IGFBP-3, the most abundant IGFBP in human serum, case-control studies showed significantly lower IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 serum levels in the patients with invasive cervical cancer over the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>]. A reduced expression of IGFBP-3 mRNA level appears to be associated with progression to cervical cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. Consistently with lnc-FANCI-2’s suppressive effect on IGFBP3 expression in our study, an increased level of lnc-FANCI-2 expression is associated step-wisely with high-risk HPV-positive cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and invasive cervical cancer tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>].</p>
<p>It is obvious from our RNA-seq and human soluble receptor array analysis that KO of lnc-FANCI-2 in CaSki cells affects the expression of a large set of genes, including the expression of increased NECTIN2, ADAM9, ADAM10, ITGA5, MCAM, PODXL2, ECM1, but decreased ADAM8, TIM2, and ITGB6, which are responsible for RAS signaling, EMT pathway, and IFN responses. For example, the dysregulation of RAS signaling and ADAM protein activity is implicated in various cancers. ADAM proteins can modulate RAS signaling by cleaving and releasing ligands that activate or inactivate RAS-related pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>]. Some ADAM proteins are Involved in the migration and invasion of cancer cells, and its loss can promote the degradation of KRAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>]. ADAMs are essential for extracellular signaling and regulation of cell adhesion and their catalytic activity is strongly correlated to Src-homology 3 (SH3) domain binding of SH3 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>]. In addition to the notified activation of PI3K/Akt and Raf/Mek/Erk pathways, one of the major RAS signaling effectors in lnc-FANCI-2 KO or KD cells was found to be MCAM.</p>
<p>MCAM binds various cellular surface receptors or co-receptors to trigger signal transduction, cell proliferation and motility, tumor angiogenesis, and tumor cell metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. It is an integral, highly glycosylated membrane protein with three common protein isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>]. Two membrane-anchored forms with a long (p113) or short (p76) cytoplasmic tail produced by alternative RNA splicing and a proteolytically cleaved soluble form without transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>]. In addition to its roles in cell signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>], the short isoform produced by an intramembrane cleavage may be directed towards the nucleus to regulate gene transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]. We found that CaSki cells express mainly a cytoplasmic form of full-length MCAM (∼113 kDa) and a small nuclear form (∼46 kDa), but not the short ∼76 kDa isoform. Moreover, lnc-FANCI-2 KO cells exhibit high MCAM levels, which was most likely a result of the increased RAS signaling. Consistently, lnc-FANCI-2 and MCAM levels are negatively correlated in cervical cancer patients, and low levels of MCAM and high levels of lnc-FANCI-2 indicate better prognosis. This suggests that increased MCAM might promote cervical tumorigenesis in vivo. Given that the cells with Inc-FANCI-2 KO exhibit increased levels of IGFBP3 and MCAM and the ΔPr-A9 cells with rescued lnc-FANCI-2 RNA expression displayed remarkable reduction of IGFBP3 and MCAM expression, our current model (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>) highlights how the HPV16-enhanced expression of lnc-FANCI-2 in cervical cancer cells might function as a negative regulator by binding to various RNA-binding proteins to block RAS signaling and reduce the expression of RAS signaling effectors such as IGFBP3 and MCAM, etc.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study provides the first evidence that one of lnc-FANCI-2 functions is to maintain epithelial functional integrity by repressing RAS signaling in preventing malignant transformation of neoplastic cervical lesions. In addition, more extensive studies are undergoing to elucidate the role of lnc-FANCI-2 in regulation of IFN responses, which are not covered in this report. Since transactivation of lnc-FANCI-2 expression is largely dependent on host transcription factor YY1 of which expression is regulated by HPV oncoproteins and host miR-29a, dissecting their transcription network on lnc-FANCI-2 and its effectors may further provide novel insights involved in host homeostasis against HPV infection-induced carcinogenesis. Our observations also highlight additional, unexpected players beyond viral E6 and E7 that drive cells toward malignant transformation.</p>

<title>siRNAs, plasmid constructions and transfections</title>
<p>Synthetic double-stranded siRNA targeting the lnc-FANCI-2 transcript is listed in a supplementary Table S5. Human MAP4K4 siRNA (#M-003971), human IGFBP3 siRNA (#M-004777) and non-targeting control siRNA(#D-001210-01) were purchased from Dharmacon, Inc (Lafayette, CO). Each siRNA transfection into CaSki or other type of cells was carried out by LipoJet in vitro transfection reagent (SignaGen, Frederick, MD, USA). Plasmid pHBL03 has a short isoform of lnc-FANCI-2 cDNA (lnc-FANCI-2a-PA1, GenBank Acc. No. MT669801). Overlapping PCR products generated from 5’ and 3’ RACE PCR products with a primer pair of oHBL 17 and oHBL 18 were digested and inserted into pcDNA3 at Hind III and Xba I sites. The insertion was verified by sequencing. Plasmid pHBL05 has a long isoform of lnc-FANCI-2 (lnc-FANCI-2a-PA2, GenBank Acc. No. MT669800). PCR products generated from genomic DNA with oHBL 19 and oHBL 23 were digested and swapped into pHBL03 to replace lnc-FANCI-2a-PA1 at Bsmb I and Xba I sites.</p>
<p>CRISPR/Cas9 system was used to knockout lnc-FANCI-2 gene from CaSki cells. Two lnc-FANCI-2 specific guide RNAs (gRNAs) were designed by an on-line CRISPR design tool developed by the Zhang lab (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://crispr.mit.edu">http://crispr.mit.edu</ext-link>). A modified cloning strategy was used to clone the two gRNA into pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro vector (Addgene, <underline>Watertown, MA</underline>, #62988) and described in our previous publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. This strategy allows all three components (two gRNAs and Cas9) express from the same plasmid to ensure the transfected cells expressing two gRNAs simultaneously knocking out the targeted gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. The sequences of primers to make guide RNAs were listed in Supplementary Table S5.</p>

<title>Knockout of lnc-FANCI-2 gene in CaSki cells, PCR screening and genotyping</title>
<p>Two gRNAs each under control by a U6 promoter in a pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro vector were used to create deletion in CaSki cells. Plasmid pHBL25 which contains gRNA 1 and 6 was used to delete the entire promoter region of lnc-FANCI-2 and plasmid pHBL27 which contains gRNA 3 and 4 was used to delete only two YY1-binding motifs spanning over an 87-bp region in the lnc-FANCI-2 promoter. CaSki cells transfected with the gRNA-expressing vectors were then under 2 weeks of puromycin selection (0.1 µg/ml). The puromycin-resistant CaSki cells were diluted to a final concentration of 0.5 cells per 100 μl, plated 100 μl of diluted cells into each well of a 96-well plate, and grew under continuous purymycin selection. The colonies were inspected to ensure the clones were grown from one cell, and refed or re-plated as needed in 3 weeks of expansion.</p>
<p>A direct PCR was performed for number of single cell clones as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. Briefly, several hundreds of cells expanded from a single cell clone were resuspended in 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then frozen-thawed on dry ice for three times. Cell lysates were treated with 4 μl of Qiagen protease (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany, #1017782,) at 56°C for 10 min, and the protease was inactivated at 95°C for 5 mins. The resulting product was directly used for PCR screening. P1 + P5 were used for verification of promoter deletion and P3 + P4 for YY1 motifs deletion. To ensure the selected single cell clones displaying homozygous knockout of lnc-FANCI-2, total cell DNA was isolated using a QIAamp DNA Blood Minikit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany, #51106) and then the homozygous deletion was screened and the cells with homozygous KO were selected and confirmed by PCR. The primers used for genotyping are listed in supplementary Table S5. At least two single cell clones either with lnc-FANCI-2 promoter deletion or with YY1 motif deletion were selected. Three single cell clones from the cells transfected with an empty vector, pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro, were also selected and served as controls for the genotyping screening.</p>

<title>Cell proliferation and viability assay</title>
<p>Cell proliferation and viability were determined by a CCK-8 assay (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Rockville, MD). For proliferation assay, 500 µl of cell suspension (50,000 cells/well) were dispensed into individual wells in a 24-well plate. Cells were then treated with inhibitors (20 μM LY294002, or 10 μM U0126 respectively) after 24 h culture. At each time point of 24 h, 48 h and 72 h, 50 µl of CCK-8 solution was added in three wells of each group and incubated for 1 h in a cell culture incubator at 37°C. Cell proliferation was determined by absorbance at 450 nm, and normal medium was used to subtract background. Percentage of cell viability was calculated by the following formula: cell viability % = OD450 of inhibitors treated sample / OD450 of untreated sample × 100%.</p>

After 24 h of cell growth, the culture medium in each well was replaced by DMEM containing 1% methylcellulose and 10% FBS. The plates were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and stained with 1% crystal violet in 2 weeks. Transwell cell migration assay was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>]. Briefly, CaSki cells were re-suspended in serum free DMEM containing 0.1% BSA. 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells in 100 ul were then plated on top of the filter membrane in a transwell insert (SARSTEDT, Nümbrecht, GERMANY, # 83.3932.800) and incubate for 10 min at 37 °C to allow the cells to settle down, then 600 μl of complete media containing 10% FBS were added into the bottom of the lower chamber in a 24-well plate. After 24 h in culture, the cells on the top of the insert membrane were removed, and cells on the bottom were fixed, stained by 0.2% crystal violet and then counted.</p>
<p>Cell senescence was determined by Cellular Senescence Assay (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, # QIA117-1KIT).

<title>RNA-seq and data analysis</title>
<p>Total RNA was from WT CaSki cells, ΔYY1-D5 and ΔPr-A9 cells were extracted using TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, #15596018). Total ribo-minus RNA-seq libraries, four samples in each group, were prepared with TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Kit and then subjected to pair-end sequencing using Illumina-HiSeq3000/4000 platform.</p>
<p>The obtained reads were processed using the CCBR Pipeliner utility (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/CCBR/Pipeliner">https://github.com/CCBR/Pipeliner</ext-link>). Briefly, reads were trimmed from adapters and low-quality bases using Cutadapt (version 1.18) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bioweb.pasteur.fr/packages/pack@cutadapt@1.18">https://bioweb.pasteur.fr/packages/pack@cutadapt@1.18</ext-link>) before alignment to the custom reference genome described below. The transcripts were aligned using STAR v2.5.2b in two-pass mode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref>]. Expression levels were quantified using RSEM (RNA-Seq by Expectation-Maximization) (version 1.3.0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref>] with a custom gene annotation described below.</p>
<p>The custom reference genome allowing quantification of both HPV16 and host expression used in this alignment consisted of the human reference genome (hg38/Dec. 2013/GRCh38) with a HPV16 FASTA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pave.niaid.nih.gov/">https://pave.niaid.nih.gov/</ext-link>) sequence added as an additional pseudochromosome. The custom gene annotation used for gene expression quantification consisted of a concatenation of the hg38 GENCODE annotation version 30 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref>] and the HPV16 genome, with one other notable alteration. The hg38 v30 gene annotation is incorrect at the location of the lnc-FANCI-2 locus in the hg38 genome at chr15:89378104-89398487, which affects quantification of this gene. To correct this annotation and provide accurate quantification, therefore, we first performed BLAST against hg38 using the sequences of the 14 known isoform transcripts of lnc-FANCI-2 (MT669800 for lnc-FANCI-2a-PA2, MT669801 for lnc-FANCI-2a-PA1, MT669802 for lnc-FANCI-2b-PA2, MT669803 for lnc-FANCI-2b-PA1, MT669804 for lnc-FANCI-2c-PA2, MT669805 for lnc-FANCI-2c-PA1, MT669806 for lnc-FANCI-2d-PA2, MT669807 for lnc-FANCI-2d-PA1, MT669808 for lnc-FANCI-2e-PA2, MT669809 for lnc-FANCI-2e-PA1, MT669810 for lnc-FANCI-2f-PA2, MT669811 for lnc-FANCI-2f-PA1, MT669812 for lnc-FANCI-2g-PA2, and MT669813 for lnc-FANCI-2g-PA1). The results were used to determine the precise exon start and stop sites for each of the isoforms. These were then used to manually adjust the default hg38 v30 gene annotations at the locus indicated above to account for the correct structure of the lnc-FANCI-2 locus and its 14 isoforms.</p>
<p>Downstream analysis and visualization were performed within the NIH Integrated Analysis Portal (NIDAP) using R programs developed on the Foundry platform (Palantir Technologies). Briefly, raw counts data produced by RSEM were imported into the NIDAP platform, genes were filtered for low counts (&lt;1 cpm) and the voom algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref>] from the Limma R package (version 3.40.6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref>] was used for quantile normalization and calculation of differentially expressed genes.

The cell lysis was then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min to remove cell debris. Protein concentration of cell lysis was measured by Micro BCA Protein Assay (PIERCE, Waltham, MA, #23235). Next, two sets of N and C membranes were blocking by Buffer 8/1 in 4-Well Multi-dish for 1 h on a rocking platform. 500 μl of culture supernatant or 100 μg cell lysate generated from the WT CaSki cells or ΔPr-A9 cells were diluted in 3 ml of Buffer 8/1 and then applied to each membrane after three washes with 1× Wash Buffer. The membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rocking platform and washed three times to remove unbound materials followed by incubation with their specific cocktail of biotinylated detection antibodies for 2 h at room temperature on a rocking platform. 2 ml of diluted Streptavidin-HRP was then applied to each membrane for 30 min at room temperature on a rocking platform after three times of wash. 1 ml of the prepared Chemi Reagent Mix was added onto the membranes after three times of wash. The signal was then captured by ChemiDoc Touch Imaging System (Bio-Rad). Quantification of the relative protein expression in ΔPr-A9 cells compared to the WT cells was determined in Image Lab software (Bio-Rad).

<p>To identify the lnc-FANCI-2 RNA-associated proteins, we pulled down lnc-FANCI-2 RNA from WT CaSki cells using IRPCRP, a modified ChIRP protocol from the published method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref>], followed by mass spectrometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]. Briefly, a total of 30 lnc-FANCI-2 anti-sense oligo probes (oLLY496-oLLY525), each with biotinTEG at 3’ end, across entire lnc-FANCI-2 RNA (GenBank Acc. No MT669800.1) were designed using the online probe designer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://singlemoleculefish.com">singlemoleculefish.com</ext-link>). Two probe pools were used in IRPCRP assays: the probe pool 1 was the mixed oligos in even numbers (oLLY496 /498/500/502/504/506/508/510/512/514/516/518/520/522/524) and the probe pool 2 mixed with the oligos in odd numbers (oLLY497/499/501/503/505/507/509/511/513/515/517/519/521/523/525) (Table S5). CaSki cells were seeded and harvested at 24 h and the cell lysates from 200 million cells were used for each IRPCRP reaction. Instead of formaldehyde crosslink in the standard protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref>], UV cross-linking (254 nm, energy at 480 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>) was applied in our study to minimize non-specific binding. After UV cross-linking, the cells were lysed on ice in 1× radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (Boston Bioproducts, Ashland, MA, #BP-115) (50 mM Tris base/Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS], 1% NP-40) supplemented with protease inhibitors (complete mini-EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail, Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA, #469315900) and RNase inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #AM2694) for 30 min, followed by a brief sonication. The obtained cell lysates were spin for 10 min of centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C and the collected cell lysate supernatants were pre-absorbed with C-1 magnetic beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #65002) for 1 h at room temperature before proceeding to oligo probe hybridization.</p>
<p>Two different hybridization protocols were used to pull down lnc-FANCI-2 RNA. One had the pre-absorbed cell lysate incubated with two separate probe pools in hybridization buffer (750 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA, 15% formamide) at room temperature overnight and the pre-washed C-1 magnetic beads was then added and incubated for additional 4 h; the other had two separate oligo probe pools immobilized onto pre-washed C-1 magnetic beads first at room temperature for 1 h and then mixed with the pre-absorbed cell lysates in hybridization buffer overnight at room temperature, along with the negative control-beads only IRPCRP reaction without oligo probes serving as a control in the modified protocol. After hybridization, the beads were washed with 1× wash buffer (2× NaCl and sodium citrate, 0.1% SDS) for 5 times and resuspend in 1 ml lysis buffer. 100 µl beads from each IRPCRP were set aside for RNA isolation of lnc-FANCI-2 pulldown efficiency and the leftover beads were sent for mass spectrometry analysis. The input and IRPCRP RNA were isolated using a MIRNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, #217004) following the standard protocol after proteinase K (Millipore Sigma, #71049) digestion.</p>
<p>For mass spectrometry analysis, the IRPCRP beads were processed for trypsin/LysC digestion before submitted to Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Exploris 240 Mass Spectrometer and a Thermo Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano System for Proteinomics. Peptides from trypsin digestion were loaded onto a peptide trap cartridge at a flow rate of 5 µl/min. The trapped peptides were eluted onto a reversed-phase Easy-Spray Column PepMap RSLC, C18, 2 µM, 100A, 75 µm × 250 mm (Thermo Scientific) using a linear gradient of acetonitrile (3-36%) in 0.1% formic acid. The elution duration was 110 min at a flow rate of 0.3 µl/min. Eluted peptides from the Easy-Spray column were ionized and sprayed into the mass spectrometer, using a Nano Easy-Spray Ion Source (Thermo Fisher Scientific) under the following settings: spray voltage, 1.6 kV, Capillary temperature, 275 °C. Other settings were empirically determined. Raw data files were searched against human protein sequences database using the Proteome Discoverer 2.4 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) based on the SEQUEST algorithm. All the protein peptides identified in the IRPCRP pulldowns were summarized in Table S4.</p>

(B) HeLa cells express no lnc-FANCI-2 when compared with C33A cells by Northern blot. (C) lnc-FANCI-2 is mainly cytoplasmic in CaSki but nuclear in SiHa and C33A cells. Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractionation efficiency was blotted for nuclear SRSF3 (serine- and arginine-rich splicing factor 3) and cytoplasmic GAPDH. Total fractionated cytoplasmic and nuclear RNAs were quantified for lnc-FANCI-2 by RT-qPCR in triplicates, with GAPDH RNA serving as an internal control for RNA fractionation efficiency. (D) Subcellular lnc-FANCI-2 (red) localization in CaSki, SiHa, and C33A cells determined by RNAscope RNA ISH analysis. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue).

<caption><title>Pathway map of RAS Initiative with highlighted differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in ΔPr-A9 cells vs parental wild type cells.</title>
<p>DEGs are mainly distributed and clustered in two main branches of RAS pathway: MAPK signaling branch and PI3K/AKT branches. DEGs were derived from RNA-seq data at cutoff of adjusted p-value &lt;=0.01 and fold change&gt;1.5 for both up- and down-regulated genes (indicated by red and blue arrows respectively) between ΔPr-A9 vs WT CaSki cells using three common analysis methods (DESeq2, edgeR, and limma-voom) and in-house BRB analysis pipeline from NCI. Highlighted genes in the pathway map are derived as DEGs in at least three of the analysis methods, although in most cases, these DEGs behaved consistently across all 4 methods. MAPK signaling branch is highlighted in transparent green box and PI3K/AKT branch is highlighted in transparent yellow box within the pathway map of RAS signaling pathway, which was collectively collated from community inputs that were organized and stimulated by RAS Initiative, and maintained as a common knowledge basis at URL below: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/ras/ras-central/blog/2015/ras-pathway-v2">https://www.cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/ras/ras-central/blog/2015/ras-pathway-v2</ext-link>, which was also described in recent review (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> in Nissley and McCormick, 2022).

<caption><title>Expression levels of lnc-FANCI-2 and MCAM are significantly associated with TCGA CESC (cervical squamous cell carcinoma) cancer patients’ survival outcome.</title>
<p>The expression of Inc-FANCI-2 (A) and of MCAM (B) along with survival of the same group of 304 cervical cancer patients were analyzed by our in-house GradientScanSurv pipeline (Yi et al 2018, PLoS One 13:e0207590). The <bold>open grey circles</bold> in each plot are ranked expression levels from high (left) to low (right) of Inc-FANCI-2 (A) and MCAM (B) from all patient samples as indicated by y-axis at the right side of the plot (in RSEM normalized value of RNAseq data). At each breaking point denoted by patient number (x-axis), the log rank test (y-axis at the left side of the plot) was performed between the higher expression group at the left side of the cut-point vs the lower expression group at the right side of the cut-point and the indicated log rank p-values (<bold>blue dots</bold>) are shown as at each cut-point at x-axis. The <bold>horizontal red line</bold> is the p=0.05 cutoff line for the log rank test p-values. If a log rank p-value (<bold>blue dot</bold>) at a cut-point is below the cutoff (p&lt;0.05), there will be a <bold>vertical green line</bold> shown at the corresponding cut-point, indicative of a significant log rank test p-value, and also a <bold>brown</bold> diamond plotted either at the bottom part of the <bold>vertical green line</bold> (A) if higher expression of lnc-FANCI-2 led to less severe outcome (dying slower than the lower expressors), or at the top part of the <bold>vertical green line</bold> (B) if higher expression of MCAM led to more severe outcome (dying faster than the lower expressors). The original GoodCount was defined as the number of significant log rank tests (the default significance level was set as 0.05) across all possible cut-points for the original dataset. We employed the bootstrap approach to permutate the data for 1000 times in this case. A similar procedure each time was performed like the original dataset and a permutated GoodCount was obtained for each permutated dataset. The GoodCount p-value was derived as the proportion of the times that the GoodCounts of permutated datasets were no less than that of the original dataset (Yi et al 2018, PLoS One 13:e0207590) and shown at the left top corner of each plot, 0.011 for Inc-FANCI-2 in panel A and 0.002 for MCAM in panel B. A significant GoodCount p-value (<bold>blue dots</bold> in both panels A and B) is indicative of significant association of the expression levels with the corresponding survival outcomes of the analyzed patient samples. Not shown in the panels A and B are the coxph p-value from univariant expression-based cox regression models (coxph p-value: derived by original gene expression values; or coxph p-value by rank: derived by corresponding ranks of gene expression values) and the cut-point-specific FDR and FDR2. FDR for each cut-point was defined as the portion of cases of permutated datasets that have log rank test p-values no higher than that of original dataset. FDR2 for each cut-point was defined as the portion of cases of permutated datasets that have log rank test p-values no higher than default setting of significance as 0.05.</p></caption>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>A long noncoding RNA, lnc-FANCI-2, was reported to be regulated by HPV E7 oncoprotein and a cell transcription factor, YY1 by this group. The current study focuses on the function of lnc-FANCI-2 in HPV-16 positive cervical cancer is to intrinsically regulate RAS signaling, thereby facilitating our further understanding additional cellular alterations during HPV oncogenesis. Authors used the advanced technical approaches such as KO, transcriptome and (IRPCRP) and LC- MS/MS analyses in the current study and concluded that KO Inc-FANCI-2 significantly increase RAS signaling, especially phosphorylation of Akt and Erk1/2.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) HPV E6E7 are required for full immortalization and maintenance of malignant phenotype of cervical cancer, but they are NOT sufficient for full transformation and tumorigenesis. This study helps further the understanding of other cellular alterations in HPV oncogenesis.</p>
<p>
(2) lnc-FANCI-2 is upregulated in cervical lesion progression from CIN1, CIN2-3 to cervical cancer, cancer cell lines and HPV transduced cell lines.</p>
<p>
(3) Viral E7 of high-risk HPVs and host transcription factor YY1 are two major factors promoting lnc-FANCI-2 expression.</p>
<p>
(4) Proteomic profiling of cytosolic and secreted proteins showed inhibition of MCAM, PODXL2 and ECM1 and increased levels of ADAM8 and TIMP2 in KO cells.</p>
<p>
(5) RNA-seq analyses revealed that KO cells exhibited significantly increased RAS signaling but decreased IFN pathways.</p>
<p>
(6) Increased phosphorylated Akt and Erk1/2, IGFBP3, MCAM, VIM, and CCND2 (cyclin D2) and decreased RAC3 were observed in KO cells.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The revised manuscript has been significantly improved. The authors addressed all my concerns.</p>

<p>As the lnc-FANCI-2 as a novel lncRNA had never been explored for any functional study, our report found that it regulates RAS signaling. Thus, this report focuses on lnc-FANCI-2 and RAS signaling pathway but also includes some important screening data, which are important for our readers to understand how we could reach the RAS signaling.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>The study by Liu et al provides a functional analysis of lnc-FANCI-2 in cervical carcinogenesis, building on their previous discovery of FANCI-2 being upregulated in cervical cancer by HPV E7.</p>
<p>The authors conducted a comprehensive investigation by knocking out (KO) FANCI-2 in CaSki cells and assessing viral gene expression, cellular morphology, altered protein expression and secretion, altered RNA expression through RNA sequencing (verification of which by RT-PCR is well appreciated), protein binding, etc. Verification experiments by RT-PCR, Western blot, etc are notable strengths of the study.</p>
<p>The KO and KD were related to increased Ras signaling and EMT and reduced IFN-y/a responses.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your positive comments. It did take us a few years to reach this scientific point for understanding of lnc-FANCI-2 function.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Although the large amount of data is well acknowledged, it is a limitation that most data come from CaSki cells, in which FANCI-2 localization is different from SiHa cells and cancer tissues (Figure 1). The cytoplasmic versus nuclear localization is somewhat puzzling.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Regarding lnc-FANCI-2 localization, it could be both cytoplasmic and nuclear in cervical cancer tissues, HPV16 or HPV18 infected keratinocytes, and HPV16+ cervical cancer cell line CaSki cells which contain multiple integrated HPV16 DNA copies. But surprisingly, it is most detectable in the nucleus in HPV16+ SiHa cells which contain only one copy of integrated HPV16 DNA (Yu, L., et al. mBio 15: e00729-24, 2024). No matter what, knockdown of lnc-FANCI-2 expression from SiHa cells induces RAS signaling leading to an increase in the expression of p-AKT and p-Erk1/2 (suppl. Fig. S6B).</p>

<p>Thanks for your positive comments. It has taken us almost nine years to reach this point to gradually understand lnc-FANCI-2 functions, which are more complex than our initial thoughts.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors observed the increased Inc-FANCI-2 in HPV 16 and 18 transduced cells, and other cervical cancer tissues as well, HPV-18 positive HeLa cells exhibited different expressions of Inc-FANCI-2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Both HPV16 and HPV18 infections induce lnc-FANCI-2 expression in keratinocytes (Liu H., et al. PNAS, 2021). However, HPV18+ cervical cancer cell lines HeLa and C4II cells (Figure S1A and S1B) do not express lnc-FANCI-2 as we see in HPV-negative cell lines such as HCT116, HEK293, HaCaT, and BCBL1 cells. Although we don’t know why, our preliminary data show that the lnc-FANCI-2 promoter functions well and is sensitive to YY1 binding in lnc-FANCI-2 expressing CaSki and C33A cells in our dual luciferase assays but is much less sensitive to YY1 binding in HeLa and HCT116 cells, indicating some unknown cellular factors negatively regulating lnc-FANCI-2 promoter activity.</p>

<p>(2) Previous studies and data in the current showed a steadily increased Inc-FANCI-2 during cancer progression, however, the authors did not observe significant changes in cell behaviors (both morphology and proliferation) in KO Inc-FANCI-2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks. We do see decreases in cell proliferation, colony formation, and cell migration, accompanied by increased cell senescence, from the lnc-FANCI-2 KO cells to the parent WT cells.  These data are now added to the revised Fig. 1 and the revised supplemental Fig. S3.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors observed the significant changes of RAS signaling (downstream) in KO cells, but they provided limited interpretations of how these results contributed to full transformation or tumorigenesis in HPV-positive cancer.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As we stated in the title of this function of lnc-FANCI-2, the lnc-FANCI-2 intrinsically restricts RAS signaling and phosphorylation of Akt and Erk in HPV16-infected cervical cancer. Presumably, high RAS-AKT-ERK signaling inhibits tumor cell survival due to senescence induction as we show in our new Figure 1 and supplemental Fig. S3. A similar report was found in a lung cancer study (Patricia Nieto, et al. Nature 548: 239-243, 2017).</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>(1) A major issue is that parts of the manuscript read like a collection of experimental results. However, some of the results do not contribute directly to the central story. Besides confusing the reader, the large amount of apparently disparate results can raise more questions. For example:</p>
<p>a) Why is lnc-FANCI-2 highly expressed in HPV16-infected cervical cancer cell lines (but not in HPV18-infected cells)?</p>
<p>b) How do p53 and RB repress the expression of lnc-FANCI-2?</p>
<p>c) What regulates the sub-cellular localization of lnc-FANCI-2?</p>
<p>d) How does lnc-FANCI-2 negatively regulate RAS signalling?</p>
<p>e) How does MAP4K4 bind to lnc-FANCI-2?</p>
<p>f) Do lnc-FANCI-2 and MAP4K4 require each other to regulate RAS signalling?</p>
<p>g) How does RAS signalling regulate the transcription of MCAM and IGFBP3?</p>
<p>h) How does MCAM feedback on RAS? Do the different MCAM isoforms impact on RAS signalling differently?</p>
<p>i) How does IGFBP3 feedback on ERK but not AKT?</p>
<p>j) How do the other mentioned proteins like ADAM8 fit into the regulatory network?</p>
<p>k) Each question will require a lot more work to address. I think it would be good if the authors could think through carefully what the key message(s) in the current manuscript should be and then present a more focused write-up.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the critical comments. Because this study is the first time to explore lnc-FANCI-2 functions, we would like to be collective. We believe these data are important to guide any future studies. We really appreciate our reviewer listing many questions related to HPV infection, cell biology, RAS signaling, cancer biology from questions a to k. To address each question in a satisfactory way will be a separate study, but fortunately, our report has pointed out such a direction with some preliminary data for future studies. Here below are our responses to each question from a to k:</p>
<p>a) Both HPV16 and HPV18 infection induce lnc-FANCI-2 expression in keratinocytes (Liu H., et al. PNAS, 2021). However, HPV18+ cervical cancer cell lines HeLa and C4II cells (Figure S1A and S1B) do not express lnc-FANCI-2 as we see in HPV-negative cell lines such as HCT116, HEK293, HaCaT, and BCBL1 cells. Although we don’t know why, our preliminary data show that lnc-FANCI-2 promoter functions well and is sensitive to YY1 binding in lnc-FANCI-2 expressing CaSki and C33A cells but is much less sensitive to YY1 in HeLa and HCT116 cells, indicating some unknown cellular factors negatively regulating lnc-FANCI-2 promoter activity.</p>
<p>b) We don’t know whether p53 and pRB could repress the expression of lnc-FANCI-2 although C33A cells bearing a mutant p53 and mutant pRB express high amount of lnc-FANCI-2. However, KD of E2F1 had no effect on lnc-FANCI-2 promoter activity in CaSki cells (Liu, H., et al. PNAS, 2021).</p>
<p>c) RNA cellular localization can be affected by many factors, including splicing, export, and polyadenylation. As lnc-FANCI-2 is a long non-coding RNA, its regulation of cellular location could be more complicated than mRNAs and thus could be a future research direction.</p>
<p>d) The conclusion that lnc-FANCI-2 negatively regulates RAS signaling is based on both lnc-FANCI-2 KO and KD studies.  Please see the proposed hypothetic model in Figure 8E.</p>
<p>e) The MAP4K4 binding to lnc-FANCI-2 was demonstrated by our IRPCRP-Mass spectrometry (Fig. 8A and 8C), although the exact binding site on lnc-FANCI-2 was not explored. As you probably know, many enzymes today turn out an RNA-binding enzyme (Castello A., et al. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 26: 746-757, 2015; Hentze MW., et al. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 19: 327-341, 2018)</p>
<p>f) Yes, they are slightly relied on each other in regulating RAS signaling. We found that KD of MAP4K4 in parent CaSki cells (Figure 8D) led to more effect on RAS signaling (MCAM, IGFBP3, p-Akt) than that in lnc-FANCI-2 KO ΔPr-A9 cells. In contrast, the latter displayed more p-Erk1/2 than that induced by KD of lnc-FANCI-2 in the parental CaSki cells (Figure S7C).</p>
<p>g) We believe RAS signaling regulates most likely the transcription of MCAM and IGFBP3 through phosphorylated transcription factors (Figure 8E diagram).</p>
<p>h) As a signal molecule with at least 13 ligands/coreceptors (Joshkon A., et al. Biomedicines 8: 633, 2020), the increased MCAM appears to sustain RAS signaling (Fig. 7J and Fig. 8E). We are assuming the full-length cytoplasmic MCAM plays a predominant role in RAS signaling due to its abundance than the cleaved nuclear MCAM missing both transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions. Plus, RAS signaling mainly occurs in the cytosol.</p>
<p>i) Exact mechanism remains unknown. Lnc-FANCI-2 KO cells exhibit high expression levels of IGFBP3 RNA and protein and p-Erk1/2, but not so much for p-Akt, possibly due to IGFBP3 regulation of MAPK for Erk phosphorylation, but not much so on PI3K for Akt phosphorylation.</p>
<p>j) The dysregulation of RAS signaling and ADAM protein activity is implicated in various cancers. ADAM proteins can modulate RAS signaling by cleaving and releasing ligands that activate or inactivate RAS-related pathways (Schafer B., et al. JBC 279: 47929-38, 2004; Ohtsu H., et al. Am J Physiol Cell Physiol 291: C1-C10, 2006; Dang M, et al. JBC 286: 17704-17713, 2011; Kleino I, et al. PLoS One 10: e0121301, 2015). Some ADAM proteins are Involved in the migration and invasion of cancer cells, and its loss can promote the degradation of KRAS (Huang Y-K., et al. Nat Cancer 5: 400-419, 2024). In this revision, we have a brief discussion on ADAMs and RAS signaling.</p>
<p>k) We agree with our reviewer that each question will require a lot more work to address. As this study is to explore the lnc-FANCI-2 function for the first time, however, we prefer to include all of these data that have been selectively included in this write-up. We hope reviewer 1 will be satisfied with our response to each question from a to j.</p>

<p>(2) Figures S1A &amp; S1C - Replicates are needed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, we have repeated all of the experiments. The quantification shown in Figure S1A and S1C was performed in triplicate, and error bars have been added to the updated figure.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Figure S1D - There seems to be some lnc-FANCI-2 RNA in the nucleus of CaSki cells as well. Please quantify the relative amount of lnc-FANCI-2 in the nucleus vs cytoplasm.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, a small fraction of lnc-FANCI-2 is in the nucleus of CaSki cells as we reported (Liu H., PNAS, 2021, Movies S1 and S2). We did quantify by fractionation and RT-qPCR the relative amount of lnc-FANCI-2 in the nucleus vs cytoplasm in Figure S1C.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Figure S2B - (a) For ΔPr-A9 cells, it looks like there is an increase in E6 and a decrease in E7, instead of &quot;little change&quot; as the authors claimed. (b) I suggest checking the protein levels for all the control and KO clones.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the questions. We had some variation in E6 and E7 detection and the submitted one was one representative.  We grew again the lnc-FANCI-2 KO clones A9 and B3 and reexamined the expression of HPV16 E6/E7 proteins and their downstream targets, p53 and E2F1. As shown in new Figure S3A expt II, we saw again some variations in the detections (~20-30%) and these variations do not reflect a noticeable change for their downstream targets. Thus, we do not consider these changes significantly enough to draw a conclusion in our study, but rather most likely from sampling in the assays.</p>

<p>(5) In the Proteome Profiler Human sReceptor Array analysis, multiple proteins were highlighted as having at least 30% change. But it is unclear how they relate to RAS signaling.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for this comment.  Cellular soluble receptors are essential for RAS signaling, EMT pathway and IFN responses. For example, the dysregulation of RAS signaling and ADAM protein activity is implicated in various cancers. ADAM proteins can modulate RAS signaling by cleaving and releasing ligands that activate or inactivate RAS-related pathways (Schafer B., et al. JBC 279: 47929-38, 2004; Ohtsu H., et al. Am J Physiol Cell Physiol 291: C1-C10, 2006; Dang M, et al. JBC 286: 17704-17713, 2011; Kleino I, et al. PLoS One 10: e0121301, 2015). Some ADAM proteins are Involved in the migration and invasion of cancer cells, and its loss can promote the degradation of KRAS (Huang Y-K., et al. Nat Cancer 5: 400-419, 2024). In this revision, we have a brief discussion on ADAMs and RAS signaling.</p>

<p>(6) Does knockdown of MAP4K4 lead to an increase in MCAM and IGFBP3?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, the MAP4K4 KD from parental WT CaSki cells does lead an increase in MCAM (~70%) and IGFBP3 (~30%) which is like the knockdown of lnc-FANCI-2 shown in the revised Figure 8D.</p>

<p>(9) The last sentence of the introduction feels a little abrupt. It would be good to elaborate a little more on the key findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for this critical comment. We have revised as in the following: In this report, we demonstrate that lnc-FANCI-2 in HPV16-infected cells controls RAS signaling by interaction with MAP4K4 and other RNA-binding proteins. Ablation of lnc-FANCI-2 in the cells promotes RAS signaling and phosphorylation of Akt and Erk. High levels of lnc-FANCI-2 and low level of MCAM expression in cervical cancer patients correlate with improved survival, indicating that lnc-FANCI-2 plays a critical role in regulating RAS signaling to affect cervical cancer progression and patient outcomes.</p>

<p>The paper contains a vast amount of data and would greatly benefit from an expanded version of the schematic of Figure 8E summarizing the main results. Including additional details on FANCI-2 regulation by HPV (primarily from previous studies) and its implications for HPV16-driven carcinogenesis would provide a more comprehensive overview.</p>

<p>(10) Both protein and RNA expression analysis have been performed on WT CaSki cells and FANCI-2 KO cells. If I am correct there is little overlap between the significantly changed gene products. What does this mean? Have you looked into the comparison?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The DEGs identified from RNA-seq indicated a genome wide transcriptome change, while the protein array we used only covered 105 soluble protein receptors. However, we did find 9/15 (60%) membrane proteins in cell lysates (PODXL2, ECM1, NECTIN2, MCAM, ADAM9, CDH5, ADAM10, ITGA5, NOTCH1, SCARF2, ADAM8, TIMP2, LGALS3BP, CDH13, and ITGB6) exhibited consistent changes in expression (underlined) by both RNA-seq and protein array assays. We have revised the text with this information (page 11). Other six proteins (40%) had inconsistent expression correlation in two assays could be due to post-translational mechanisms, such as protein stability, modifications and secretion, etc.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) Figure S7, which represents TCGA data and survival is quite complex. It would be more effective to display a similar figure for FANCI-2, as was done for MCAM in Figure 7I, to simplify the comparison and enhance clarity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks. However, the suggested figure for lnc-FANCI-2 was published in PNAS paper already (Liu H., et al. PNAS, 2021).  The Figure S8 in this revision is the result from our in-house GradientScanSurv pipeline, a new way to correlate the expression and survival more accurately.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>What do the Figures look like if you analyse only HPV16+ patients versus HPV18+ patients, considering that FANCI-2 upregulation in cell lines is related to HPV16 and not 18? Is there an effect of histotype? Or tumor stage?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>HPV18 infected keratinocytes express high level of lnc-FANCI-2. Two HPV18<sup>+</sup> HeLa and C4II cell lines and HPV-negative cell lines, such as HCT116 cells, which do not express lnc-FANCI-2 could be due to the presence of some unknow repressive factors. We found that lnc-FANCI-2 promoter functions well in responding to YY1 binding in CaSki and C33A cells expressing lnc-FANCI-2 but does not so in HeLa and HCT116 cells in our dual luciferase assays.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(12) It remains puzzling that FANCI-2 upregulation was previously shown to already occur in CIN lesions and increase further in cervical cancer, while the current data indicate that FANCI-2 suppresses AKT activation. If I am correct Akt activation has been linked to cervical carcinogenesis. Similarly, line 434 states that increased MCAM might promote cervical tumorigenesis, implying that low FANCI-2 would stimulate tumorigenesis. If I understand correctly, the increase in FANCI-2 observed in CIN lesions would reflect a &quot;brake&quot; on the carcinogenic pathway and its sustained increase in cancer might indicate that growth is still (partly) controlled. As mentioned earlier, a Figure illustrating the relation between FANCI-2, HPV, and the carcinogenic process would be beneficial for clarity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes. Increased MCAM, but low level of lnc-FANCI-2, correlates with poor cervical cancer survival. We have revised Figure 8E to illustrate this relation better.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(13) May part of the potentially conflicting findings be explained by CaSki cells being of metastatic origin? Related to this, does the expression of FANCI-2 or MALM depend on the tumor stage?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for this important suggestion. Unfortunately, we found that the expression of lnc-FANCI-2 and MCAM is not associated with cervical cancer stage based on the TCGA data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/index.html">http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/index.html</ext-link>).

<graphic mime-subtype="jpg" xlink:href="elife-102681-sa3-fig2.jpg" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>Despite some lingering uncertainty, the extensive experiments conducted using KO and KD cells do provide compelling evidence that lnc-FANCI-2 function is linked to RAS signaling and EMT.</p>
<p>Thanks for your positive review and instructive comments.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The authors observed the increased Inc-FANCI-2 in HPV 16 and 18 transduced cells, and other cervical cancer tissues as well, HPV-18 positive HeLa cells exhibited different expressions of Inc-FANCI-2. I suggest authors provide more discussions on this difference, for example, HPV genotypes. HPV genome status in host cells? Cell types?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks. We found the keratinocyte infections with HPV16, HPV18, and other HR-HPVs could induce lnc-FANCI-2 expression (Liu H., et al. PNAS, 2021). In this report, we found HPV18<sup>+</sup> HeLa and C4II cells and other HPV-negative cell lines do not. Our preliminary data on lnc-FANCI-2 promoter activity assays showed the presence of a negative regulatory factor (s) in non-lnc-FANCI-2 expressing cells. See the data in Author response image 1.</p>
<p>We have revised our discussion by inclusion these sets of the luciferase data as data not shown.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) I suggest the authors discuss more details on how the changes of RAS signaling in KO cells help our further understanding of the molecular mechanisms for HPV-associated full-cell transformation and malignancy in addition to the well-known functions of HPV E6 and E7.</p>
