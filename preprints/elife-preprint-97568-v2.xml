<title>Abstract</title><p>How bacterial pathogens exploit host metabolism to promote immune tolerance and persist in infected hosts remains elusive. To achieve this, we show that <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA),</italic> a recalcitrant pathogen, utilizes the quorum sensing (QS) signal 2-aminoacetophenone (2-AA). Here, we unveil how 2-AA-driven immune tolerization causes distinct metabolic perturbations in macrophages’ mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics. We present evidence indicating that these effects stem from decreased pyruvate transport into mitochondria. This reduction is attributed to decreased expression of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC1), which is mediated by diminished expression and nuclear presence of its transcriptional regulator, estrogen-related nuclear receptor alpha (ERRα). Consequently, ERRα exhibits weakened binding to the MPC1 promoter. This outcome arises from the impaired interaction between ERRα and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α). Ultimately, this cascade results in diminished pyruvate influx into mitochondria and, consequently reduced ATP production in tolerized macrophages. Exogenously added ATP in infected macrophages restores the transcript levels of <italic>MPC1</italic> and <italic>ERR-</italic>α <italic>and</italic> enhances cytokine production and intracellular bacterial clearance. Consistent with the <italic>in vitro</italic> findings, murine infection studies corroborate the 2-AA-mediated long-lasting decrease in ATP and acetyl-CoA and its association with <italic>PA</italic> persistence, further supporting this QS signaling molecule as the culprit of the host bioenergetic alterations and <italic>PA</italic> persistence. These findings unveil 2-AA as a modulator of cellular immunometabolism and reveal an unprecedented mechanism of host tolerance to infection involving the PGC-1α/ERRα axis in its influence on MPC1/OXPHOS-dependent energy production and <italic>PA</italic> clearance. These paradigmatic findings pave the way for developing treatments to bolster host resilience to pathogen-induced damage. Given that QS is a common characteristic of prokaryotes, it is likely that 2-AA-like molecules with similar functions may be present in other pathogens.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Host tolerance is a fundamental mechanism of innate immunity. Studies have shown that innate immune cells following infection or exposure to microbial products may enter a state of immune tolerance characterized by reduced responsiveness towards microbial re-exposure a few hours later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Epigenetic and signaling-based mechanisms have been proposed to be involved in host immune tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. In recent years, several reports have highlighted the complex interplay between metabolic reprogramming and immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. It was suggested that specific metabolic programs are activated in monocytes and macrophages upon exposure to infection and microbial products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. However, in host tolerance, the molecular mechanisms underlying immunometabolic reprogramming mediated by bacterial pathogens remain poorly understood.</p>
<p>Metabolic pathways are essential for generating energy for various cellular functions, including those performed by immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Macrophages use metabolic pathways to generate energy and metabolites to adapt to changing environments and stimuli, thereby enabling them to cope with the needs of a fluctuating immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Thus, properly functioning metabolic pathways are vital for immune cells to counteract pathogens. For instance, the crucial energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is required to phagocytose pathogen-derived molecules efficiently.</p>
<p><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA)</italic>, a recalcitrant ESKAPE (<italic><underline>E</underline>nterococcus faecium, <underline>S</underline>taphylococcus aureus, <underline>K</underline>lebsiella pneumoniae, <underline>A</underline>cinetobacter baumannii, <underline>P</underline>A,</italic> and <italic><underline>E</underline>nterobacter sp.</italic>) pathogen that causes acute and persistent infections, secretes virulence-associated low molecular weight signaling molecules, several of which are regulated by quorum sensing (QS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>] and able to modulate host immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. QS is a cell density-dependent signaling system bacteria use to synchronize their activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. MvfR (a.k.a. PqsR), a critical QS transcription factor of <italic>PA,</italic> regulates the synthesis of many small molecules, including signaling molecules such as 2-aminoacetophenone (2-AA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. <italic>In vivo</italic> studies have demonstrated that 2-AA enables <italic>PA</italic> to persist in infected murine tissues by promoting innate immune tolerance through histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1)-mediated epigenetic reprogramming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. 2-AA tolerization reprograms the host inflammatory signaling cascade by maintaining chromatin in a “silent” state through increased HDAC1 expression and activity and decreased histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. These changes also impact the protein-protein interaction between HAT and cyclic AMP response element-binding protein/HDAC1 and p50/p65 nuclear factor (NF)-κB subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. The 2-AA-mediated tolerization permits <italic>PA</italic> to persist in infected tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], underscoring the difference from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated tolerization, which instead leads to bacterial clearance and involves different HDACs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Mitochondria, the “powerhouse” of the cells, are crucial for the regulation, differentiation, and survival of macrophages and other immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Our group’s previous <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies indicated that 2-AA affects metabolic functions in skeletal muscle, which contains a high concentration of mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Injection of 2-AA in murine skeletal muscle dampens the expression of genes associated with OXPHOS and the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1 beta (PGC-1β) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Another <italic>PA</italic> QS molecule, 3-oxo-C12-HSL, attenuates the expression of PGC-1α [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. PGC-1α and PGC-1β belong to the PPARγ family of inducible transcriptional coactivators and are known regulators of mitochondrial metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. The coactivator PGC-1 proteins are involved in various cellular energy metabolic processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], including but not limited to mitochondrial metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Recent studies have also emphasized the role of estrogen-related nuclear receptor α (ERRα) in coordinating metabolic capacity with energy demand in health and disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. PGC-1α activates ERRα transcriptional activity through protein-protein interaction, which enhances the expression of ERRα [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>] and other mitochondrial genes involved in lipid metabolism and OXPHOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. PGC-1α/ERRα axis has been extensively studied in cancer and established as a central regulatory node of energy metabolism that induces the global expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. ERRα has been shown to occupy the promoter regions of many genes participating in the TCA cycle and OXPHOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>], including the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC1). In human renal carcinoma cells, PGC-1α/ERRα interaction results in efficient activation of MPC1 expression and transport of pyruvate into mitochondrion for efficient OXPHOS and energy production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>].</p>
<p>Given that our previous studies pointed to the 2-AA effect on mitochondrial functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] and that mitochondria are crucial for the regulation, differentiation, and survival of macrophages and other immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], we investigated how 2-AA may mediate cellular metabolic reprogramming in tolerized immune cells by examining the link between the PGC-1α/ERRα axis and 2-AA-mediated immune tolerance. Our findings uncovered the crucial action of 2-AA on energy homeostasis and metabolism in tolerized immune cells through perturbances of the ERRα/PGC-1α interaction, MPC1-mediated pyruvate transport and the production of the key energy metabolism molecules, ATP and acetyl-CoA and their association with the persistence of <italic>PA</italic> in mammalian tissues.</p>

<title>Tolerization by 2-AA impacts the generation of crucial energy metabolites in macrophages</title>
<p>Following infection or exposure to microbial products, innate immune cells may enter a state of tolerance several hours later, as depicted by their diminished responsiveness or unresponsiveness to microbial re-exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. Given that 2-AA tolerized cells are non-responsive to 2-AA re-exposure, we investigated the impact of 2-AA on energy homeostasis and metabolism in non-tolerized and tolerized BMDM cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). We quantified the levels of ATP and acetyl-CoA, which is a fuel for ATP production, in a series of <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments in which murine BMDM cells were exposed to 2-AA (1<sup>st</sup> 2-AA exposure) or re-exposed (2<sup>nd</sup> 2-AA exposure) to respectively determine their activation, and tolerance as well as memory to this QS molecule (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Initially, following the 1<sup>st</sup> 2-AA exposure (black bars), a significant increase in the concentrations of intracellular ATP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) and acetyl-CoA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>) was observed in BMDM cells exposed to 2-AA for 1 and 6 h compared to their corresponding naïve control cells (grey bars). However, cells exposed to 2-AA for 48 h (black bar) appeared to have entered a state of tolerance as ATP and acetyl-CoA levels were decreased compared to 2-AA exposures for a shorter time (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). The tolerance of these cells as well as their memory to 2-AA was determined by their responsiveness to a 2<sup>nd</sup> 2-AA exposure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). To achieve this, these cells were washed to remove 2-AA and allowed to rest for 24 or 106 h in the absence of 2-AA before receiving the 2<sup>nd</sup> 2-AA exposure for 1 or 6 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref> (red bars) show the unresponsiveness of BMDM cells to 2-AA re-exposure as evidenced by the similar levels of ATP and acetyl-CoA compared to cells exposed to 2-AA for 48 h (1<sup>st</sup> exposure black bars). The sustained unresponsiveness of the cells to re-exposure indicates that the cells exhibited innate immunological memory, which could not be reverted by 2-AA re-exposure. Similar responsiveness patterns of ATP and acetyl-CoA as with BMDM cells were observed in murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figs. S1A</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1B</xref>) or human monocyte THP-1 cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figs. S1C</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1D</xref>) following exposure or re-exposure to 2-AA. These findings further support our observations with BMDM cells and confirm that either cell type can be used to study responses to 2-AA. These results reinforce the notion that 2-AA impacts crucial energy metabolites in macrophages.</p>

<caption><title>2-AA tolerization decreases crucial metabolites of cellular energy and affects mitochondrial respiration in mouse BMDM.</title>
<p>(A) Schematic representation showing experimental design: naïve cells were exposed to 2-AA for 1, 6, or 48 h (black). Cells exposed to 2-AA (400 µM) for 48 h were washed, rested for 24 or 106 h, and re-exposed (200 µM) for 1 or 6 h (red), respectively. The same color code, black cells after 1<sup>st</sup> exposure and red cells after 2nd exposure, was kept throughout the manuscript with corresponding controls in grey and pink, respectively. The levels of (B) ATP and (C) acetyl-CoA in BMDM cells after 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> 2-AA exposure. (D) Real-time oxygen consumption rate (OCR) traces were recorded using a Seahorse XF analyzer and normalized to protein content. Cells were exposed to 2-AA for 1 or 24 h (black), washed and rested for 24 h and re-exposed for 1 h (red). Mitochondrial respiratory parameters, (E) basal respiration, and (F) maximal respiration.

<p>Moreover, we sought to determine whether 2-AA-tolerized BMDM cells would respond to heterologous stimulus. To test this, we re-exposed the cells to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an outer membrane bacterial component that strongly induces macrophages. LPS re-exposure of the 2-AA tolerized BMDM cells did not significantly (<italic>p</italic> = 0.9) increase ATP levels (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>), indicating that 2-AA cross-tolerized the cells to this heterologous bacterial immunostimulant. On the other hand, as expected, we observed increased ATP levels following LPS stimulation of the non-tolerized BMDM cells (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). The broad spectrum of 2-AA cross-tolerization strongly suggests an interplay of epigenetic mechanism rather than ligand-receptor mediated signaling-based mechanism in bringing out the observed 2-AA-mediated tolerance.</p>

<p>To further investigate the 2-AA’s impact on the bioenergetics of macrophages, we assessed by Seahorse assay the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) as an index of OXPHOS in 2-AA exposed (for 1 and 24 h) and re-exposed (2<sup>nd</sup> exposure for 1 h) BMDM cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Values of basal (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>) and maximal (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>) mitochondrial respiration and spare respiratory capacity (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>) interpreted from these measurements revealed that 1 h 2-AA exposure of naïve cells significantly increased OCR compared to naïve control cells. At 24 h post-2-AA exposure, cells had a significantly reduced basal OCR level than the control BMDM cells, indicating decreased OXPHOS and an overall quiescent phenotype of tolerized macrophages. Re-exposure of tolerized macrophages with 2-AA also did not augment maximal and basal OCR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1D</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>), indicating the unresponsiveness of tolerized BMDM cells. Ultramicroscopic examination of RAW 264.7 cells exposed to 2-AA for 48 h although shows the same number of mitochondria as in control cells, their mitochondrial morphology is altered, appearing smaller and round and having reduced cristae indicating dysfunctional mitochondria (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>).</p>
<p>These OCR data are consistent with previous direct measurements of ATP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) and acetyl-CoA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>) and support the notion that 2-AA tolerization induces a quiescent phenotype in these cells characterized by defective OXPHOS. These findings confirm that 2-AA mediates energy homeostatic and metabolic alterations in the immune cells and that 2-AA tolerization arrests these cells in a sustained 2-AA-unresponsive state.</p>

<title>The pyruvate transport into mitochondria is decreased in tolerized macrophages</title>
<p>Since acetyl-CoA and ATP levels were reduced due to 2-AA tolerization, we investigated whether the mitochondrial dysfunction observed is related to pyruvate metabolism. Pyruvate links glycolysis with mitochondrial production of acetyl-CoA and ATP <italic>via</italic> the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and OXPHOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. RAW 264.7 cells initially exposed to 2-AA for 1 or 3 h (black bars) exhibited significantly higher concentrations of cytosolic and mitochondrial pyruvate compared to the corresponding naïve control cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Pyruvate significantly decreased over time in cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions as cells were entering into the tolerized state (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Tolerized cells remain unresponsive to 2-AA re-exposure (red bars), exhibiting no significant change in the concentration of pyruvate in the cytosolic or mitochondrial fraction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>).

<p>To gain a better understanding of the 2-AA-mediated reductions in mitochondrial pyruvate, ATP production, and acetyl-CoA levels, we sought to determine the involvement of the MPC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>] that is crucial in transporting pyruvate from the cytosol into the mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. Western blot studies of whole cell lysates of RAW 246.7 cells exposed to 2-AA showed a significant decrease over time in the abundance of MPC1 protein, and tolerized cells remain unresponsive to 2-AA re-exposure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that 2-AA tolerization dysregulates MPC1-mediated transport of the pyruvate into mitochondria.</p>

<title>2-AA tolerization suppresses ERRα binding to the <italic>MPC1</italic> promoter and the interaction between PGC-1α and ERRα</title>
<p>Given that the PGC-1α/ERRα axis is the transcriptional regulatory node that activates the expression of MPC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], we determined the protein levels of ERRα. Western blot studies of whole cell lysates showed a significant decrease over time in the abundance of ERRα protein following 1<sup>st</sup> exposure of RAW 246.7 cells to 2-AA, while tolerized cells remain unresponsive to 2-AA re-exposure (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>).

<p>Furthermore, because an ERRα binding putative DNA motif (TNAAGGTCA) has been identified upstream of the <italic>MPC1</italic> promoter in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>], and we found the same motif to be present 1.5 kB upstream of the transcription start site of mouse <italic>MPC1</italic> promoter, we analyzed if tolerization led to reduced ERRα binding to the <italic>MPC1</italic> promoter motif TNAAGGTCA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay followed by qPCR analysis revealed that in tolerized cells, ERRα binds approximately 4-fold less efficiently to the putative binding site on the <italic>MPC1</italic> than in corresponding control cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the transcriptional activity of ERRα is regulated through a protein-protein interaction with the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], we assessed whether the formation of the PGC-1α/ERRα complex is affected in 2-AA tolerized cells. Using paraformaldehyde fixed nuclear lysates of RAW 264.7 tolerized and naïve cells, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) of PGC-1α and reversed co-IP with ERRα followed by immunoblotting (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref> less ERRα was detected when PGC-1α was pulled down in presence of 2-AA than in naïve control cells. Moreover, reverse co-IP with ERRα protein showed lower levels of PGC-1α in the presence of 2-AA than in naïve control cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Control IgG showed no detectable levels of ERRα following nuclear fraction pull down. These results indicate that in the tolerized macrophages, PGC-1α/ERRα interaction is impaired (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, since PGC-1α enhances the transcriptional activity of ERRα through their interaction, and ERRα transcription is regulated <italic>via</italic> an autoregulatory loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>], we examined the effect of tolerization on the transcription of <italic>PGC-1</italic>α<italic>, ERR</italic>α, and its target gene <italic>MPC1</italic>. Using RAW 264.7 cells infected with the wild type <italic>PA</italic> strain PA14 or isogenic Δ<italic>mvfR</italic> mutant, which does not produce 2-AA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] we observed lower RNA transcript levels of <italic>MPC1</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), <italic>ERR</italic>α (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>) and <italic>PGC-1</italic>α (4C) in PA14 compared to Δ<italic>mvfR</italic>. The addition of 2-AA to Δ<italic>mvfR</italic> decreased the levels of these gene transcripts to levels similar to the PA14 infection condition, supporting the role of 2-AA in effect. To test if the observed effects are due to MPC1-dependent reduction of mitochondrial ATP generation, we supplemented the macrophages with ATP. The findings indicate that the addition of ATP in PA14-infected cells elevated the transcript levels of <italic>ERR</italic>α, <italic>MPC1</italic>, and <italic>PGC-1</italic>α, reaching levels similar to those observed in Δ<italic>mvfR</italic> infected macrophages (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>, and 4C). These results indicate that reduced MPC1 function is due to 2-AA tolerization on the transcriptional activation of <italic>MPC1</italic> through the PGC-1α/ERRα axis.</p>

As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>, PA14 infected cells showed lower TNF-α transcript levels compared to the Δ<italic>mvfR</italic> infected cells. Supplementation of 2-AA to Δ<italic>mvfR</italic> infected cells led to a decrease in the TNF-α transcript levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). The addition of the MPC1 inhibitor, UK5099 in Δ<italic>mvfR</italic> infected cells counteracted the increase in TNF-α transcript levels observed in Δ<italic>mvfR</italic> infected cells in the absence of UK5099 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The <italic>PA</italic> signaling molecule 2-AA that is abundantly produced and secreted in human tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>] is the first QS molecule that epigenetically reprograms immune functions, promotes immune tolerance, and sustains <italic>PA’s</italic> presence in host tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. The present study provides insights into the mechanistic actions of 2-AA on cellular metabolism that contribute to host immune tolerance to <italic>PA</italic> persistence. We uncover that this signaling molecule causes distinct metabolic alterations in macrophages’ mitochondrial respiration and energy production promoted via the PGC-1α/ERRα axis and MPC1-dependent OXPHOS that links the TCA cycle to the production of ATP and energy homeostasis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Our results show that 2-AA tolerization decreases ATP the crucial energy metabolite and the histone acetylation metabolite acetyl-CoA and <italic>in vivo</italic>, implicating the importance of the key energy-producing mitochondrial process in immune tolerance. Although macrophages respond to the first exposure to 2-AA by enhancing ATP and acetyl-CoA production, long-term exposure to 2-AA leads to a tolerized state characterized by sustained reduced ATP and acetyl-CoA concentrations, a quiescent bioenergetic state with reduced mitochondrial pyruvate uptake and unresponsiveness to a 2<sup>nd</sup> exposure.</p>

<caption><title>Proposed mechanism by which 2-AA impairs bioenergetics through the inhibition of MPC1-mediated pyruvate transport into mitochondria and its impact on the PGC-1α/ERRα axis.</title>
<p>2-AA tolerized macrophages exhibit diminished pyruvate levels in mitochondria due to the decreased expression of <italic>MPC1</italic>, a consequence of the 2-AA impact on the interaction of ERRα with the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α for the effective transcription of ERRα since ERRα controls its own transcription and that of MPC1.

The reduction in mitochondrial pyruvate levels leads to decreased acetyl-CoA and ATP levels, which modulate HDAC1- and HAT-catalyzed remodeling of H3K18 acetylation. The diminished levels of this epigenetic mark have previously been associated with an increased intracellular presence of bacteria in macrophages, as demonstrated by our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>].

<p>Our results reveal that the decrease of ATP and acetyl-CoA in tolerized macrophages results from the 2-AA-mediated perturbation of the physical interaction between ERRα and PGC-1α. The PGC-1α/ERRα axis has not previously been implicated in tolerization but has been extensively studied in cancer, underscoring the novelty of our findings. Studies in cancer cells have shown that the physical interaction of human ERRα with PGC-1α strongly enhances the binding of ERRα to DNA to induce the activation of the targeted genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], including <italic>MPC1,</italic> responsible for the import of cytosolic pyruvate into mitochondria and PDH, that catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA in mitochondria. Inhibition of ERRα has also been shown in cancer cell metabolism studies to interfere with pyruvate entry in mitochondria by inhibiting the expression of MPC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>], and inhibition of ERRα led to decreased expression of PGC-1α-controlled expression of mitochondrial genes in mice brains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. Indeed, we find that the transcription of <italic>ERR</italic>α<italic>, PGC-1</italic>α, and <italic>MPC1</italic> genes and pyruvate uptake into mitochondria is reduced in tolerized macrophages. Given that pyruvate is a primary carbon source in the TCA cycle that fuels OXPHOS and the production of ATP into mitochondria, it explains the reduced ATP and acetyl-CoA levels observed in tolerized macrophages. Future studies will focus on unveiling the pathways by which macrophages respond to the bioenergetic changes identified and decipher their effect on the pyruvate cycle in host tolerance to infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>].</p>
<p>We show that the unprecedented action of a QS bacterial small signaling molecule on the interaction between ERRα and PGC-1α in the nucleus is hampered. Although it remains to be elucidated whether 2-AA interferes directly or indirectly with the PGC-1α/ERRα axis, our data bring up the possibility that the reduced production of acetyl-CoA may be responsible since cholesterol is a known coactivator/ligand of ERRα [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>], is generated from acetyl-CoA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. This possibility may also explain the reduced expression of <italic>ERR</italic>α and lower abundance since cholesterol is also required for its activation and autoregulation. However, it is also possible that 2-AA may antagonize the interaction between ERRα and PGC-1α by binding to ERRα. Small molecules as antagonists of ERRα have been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. The weaker binding of ERRα to the <italic>MPC1</italic> promoter site, and consequently reduced MPC1 expression, explains the reduced pyruvate presence in mitochondria and that of ATP and mitochondrial quiescence. These findings open avenues for exploring novel therapeutic strategies through the overexpression of ERRα to counteract the tolerization induced by 2-AA and enhance clearance of <italic>PA</italic> infection. Interestingly, ERRα overexpression on breast cancer metastases promotes an efficient antitumor immune response selectively in the bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>].</p>
<p>The observed cellular metabolic perturbances also align with our previous studies in skeletal muscle, which pointed to mitochondrial dysfunction triggered by 2-AA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Interestingly, the <italic>PA</italic> QS LasR-regulated homoserine lactone molecule, 3-oxo-C12-HSL, was reported to attenuate the expression of PGC-1α and decrease the mitochondrial respiratory capacity in lung epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Moreover, another <italic>PA</italic> QS molecule, PQS, also regulated by LasR, was recently shown to induce organelle stress, including mitochondria, by disrupting the mitochondrial membrane potential in human macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]. As opposed to 2-AA, which dampens the pro-inflammatory response, PQS increases proinflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>], consistent with the fact that PQS is an acute infection type molecule unrelated to chronic/persistent infections.</p>
<p>Previously, we reported that 2-AA tolerization induces histone deacetylation via HDAC1, reducing H3K18ac at the TNF-α promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. The findings with acetyl-CoA reduction, the primary substrate of histone acetylation, and the TNF-α transcription using UK5099 and ATP in 2-AA treated macrophages are in support of the bioenergetics disturbances observed in macrophages and their link to epigenetic modifications we have shown to be promoted by 2-AA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Macrophages exposed to 2-AA in the presence of exogenous ATP showed improved intracellular bacterial clearance and enhanced TNF-α levels, supporting the epigenetic interconnection of macrophages and cellular ATP responsiveness levels against infection. The exogenous addition of UK5099 that reverted the efficiency of the <italic>mvfR</italic> infected macrophages to clear the <italic>PA</italic> intracellular burden and the counteraction to the 2-AA effect by ATP addition that increases the clearance of <italic>PA</italic> intracellular burden support the importance of this energy-carrying molecule in <italic>PA</italic> persistence.</p>
<p>The results with the MPC1 inhibitor, UK5099, suggest that the availability of pyruvate could underlie the mechanism of 2-AA-regulated HDAC/HAT-dependent control of transcription of pro-inflammatory mediators and bacterial clearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. These results align with our previous findings, showing that establishing bacterial intracellular burden in macrophages is HDAC1 dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. It remains to be elucidated if HDAC/HAT-mediated histone modification directly regulates the expression of OXPHOS genes in 2-AA tolerized macrophages, as it was shown that histone deacetylation downregulates OXPHOS in persistent <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. Given the complexity of 2-AA-mediated long-term effects, future omics studies combined with immune profiling may aid in deciphering the possible network of co-factors across different subpopulations of immune cells and the immunometabolic reprogramming related to 2-AA.</p>
<p>We have shown that although 2-AA tolerization leads to a remarkable increase in the survival rate of infected mice, it permits an HDAC1-dependent sustained presence of <italic>PA</italic> in mice tissues and intracellularly in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Here, we use 2-AA-producing and isogenic non-producing <italic>PA</italic> strains to confirm the 2-AA-mediated decrease in the central metabolite acetyl-CoA and the energy-carrying molecule ATP during infection. These murine infection studies provide strong evidence of the 2-AA biological relevance in reducing these metabolites <italic>in vivo</italic>. Taking together our previous and current <italic>in vivo</italic> findings provide compelling evidence that the metabolic alterations identified favor <italic>PA</italic> persistence in infected tissues.</p>
<p>That 2-AA permits <italic>PA</italic> to persist in infected tissues despite rescuing the survival of infected mice underscores its difference from that of LPS tolerization, which results in bacterial clearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>] <italic>via</italic> the mechanism that relies on a set of different HDAC enzymes. LPS tolerization predominantly involves changes in H3K27 acetylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>], while 2-AA tolerization involves H3K18 modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. The 2-AA-mediated effects reported here are also distinct from the epigenetic-metabolic reprogramming mediated by LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>], which promotes endotoxin tolerance in immune cells by upregulating glycolysis and suppressing OXPHOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>]. Although 2-AA and LPS implicate different components and lead to different outcomes, both involve epigenetic mechanisms and immune memory.</p>
<p>Metabolic reprogramming upon infection may be pathogen-specific, with each pathogen impacting specific metabolic pathways that better fit its respective metabolic needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. This was shown for infections of various tissues with <italic>Chlamydia pneumonia</italic>, <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic>, <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, and <italic>Salmonella</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>] and, by our group, for <italic>PA</italic> infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. It would be interesting, however, to test whether 2-AA affects the killing efficacy of macrophages against other pathogens, as emerging evidence shows that synergistic or antagonistic interactions between clinically relevant microorganisms and host have important implications for polymicrobial infectious diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>].</p>
<p>While in this study, we focused on the role of ERRα mainly in pyruvate metabolism; future studies are needed to reveal other ERRα/PGC-1α axis-dependent metabolic and immune pathways are modulated by 2-AA. In this view, the cholesterol synthesis pathway that relies on acetyl-CoA precursor, as cholesterol is a known coactivator/ligand of ERRα [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>] and fatty acid catabolism, generating acetyl-CoA, and PGC-1α regulates fatty acid oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>].</p>
<p>This study unveils the unprecedented actions of a QS bacterial molecule in orchestrating cellular metabolic reprogramming in addition to the epigenetic reprogramming reported previously and has also been shown to promote a long-lasting presence of <italic>PA</italic> in the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. That 2-AA cross-tolerized macrophages to LPS corroborates our previous findings on the implication of epigenetic mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] rather than ligand-receptor mediated signaling-based mechanism and raises the possibility that this QS molecule may confer non-specific cross-protection. This is an aspect we plan to investigate in the future.</p>
<p>The reported immunometabolic reprogramming contributes to a better understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms, biomarkers, and functional significance that may be involved in immune tolerance to persistent infection, providing for designing and developing innovative therapeutics and interventions. These approaches can focus on promoting host resilience against bacterial burden and safeguarding patients from recalcitrant persistent infections.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study demonstrates that the Pseudomonas aeruginosa-derived quorum sensing signal, 2-aminoacetophenone, induces immune tolerization in macrophages by perturbing metabolism, particularly in the context of mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics. The authors present <bold>convincing</bold> evidence for 2-aminoacetophenone-mediated reduction of pyruvate transport into mitochondria, with downstream effects that result in reduced ATP production in tolerized macrophages. The work will be of interest to those studying host-pathogen interactions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study tries to connect energy metabolism with immune tolerance during bacterial infection. The mechanism details the role of pyruvate transporter expression via ERRalpha-PGC1 axis, resulting in pro-inflammatory TNF alpha signalling responsible for acquired infection tolerance.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, the study is an excellent addition to the role of energy metabolism during bacterial infection. The mechanism-based approach in dissecting the roles of metabolic coactivator, transcription factor, mitochondrial transporter and pro-inflammatory cytokine during acquired tolerance towards infections indicates a detailed and well-written study. The in vivo studies in mice nicely corroborate with the cell line-based data, indicating the requirement for further studies in human infections with another bacterial model system.</p>
<p>Weakness:</p>
<p>Revised version doesn't have much weakness as authors have performed some of the critical experiments to answer the concerns. Moreover, authors promted that a few concerns like public data sets, etc are out of scope of this work or they will perform such experiments in future.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Their findings elucidate the mechanisms underlying 2-AA-mediated reduction of pyruvate transport into mitochondria, which impairs the interaction between ERRα and PGC1α, consequently suppressing MPC1 expression and reducing ATP production in tolerized macrophages. While the data presented is intriguing and the paper is well-written, there are several points that warrant consideration. The authors should enhance the clarity, relevance, and impact of their study.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This paper presents a novel discovery regarding the mechanisms through which PA regulates the bioenergetics of tolerized macrophages.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The relevance of the in vivo model to support the conclusions is questionable. Further clarification is needed on this point.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. Our conclusion that 2-AA decreases bioenergetics while sustains bacterial burden is further supported by additional in vivo data we present now in Fig. S5. To strengthen the relevance of our in vivo data, we performed additional in vivo experiments. In this set of in vivo studies, mice received the first exposure to 2-AA by injecting 2-AA only and the 2nd exposure through infection with PA14 or ΔmvfR four days post-2-AA injection.  As shown in the supplementary Figure S5 the levels of ATP and acetyl-CoA in the spleen of infected animals and the enumeration of the bacterial counts were the similar between PA14 or ΔmvfR receiving the 1st 2-AA exposure and agree with the “one-shot infection” findings presented in Figure 5 with the PA14 or ΔmvfR+2-AA infected mice or those receiving 2-AA only. These results are consistent with our previous findings showing that 2-AA impedes the clearance of PA14 (Bandyopadhaya et al. 2012; Bandyopadhaya et al. 2016; Tzika et al. 2013) and provide compelling evidence that the metabolic alterations identified may favor PA persistence in infected tissues.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study tries to connect energy metabolism with immune tolerance during bacterial infection. The mechanism details the role of pyruvate transporter expression via ERRalpha-PGC1 axis, resulting in pro-inflammatory TNF alpha signalling responsible for acquired infection tolerance.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, the study is an excellent addition to the role of energy metabolism during bacterial infection. The mechanism-based approach in dissecting the roles of metabolic coactivator, transcription factor, mitochondrial transporter, and pro-inflammatory cytokine during acquired tolerance towards infections indicates a detailed and well-written study. The in vivo studies in mice nicely corroborate with the cell line-based data, indicating the requirement for further studies in human infections with another bacterial model system.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors have involved various mechanisms to justify their findings. However, they have missed out on certain aspects which connect the mechanism throughout the paper. For example, they measured ATP and acetyl COA production linked with bacterial re-exposures and added various targets like MCP1, EER alpha, PGC1 alpha, and TNF alpha. However, they skipped PGC1 alpha levels, ATP and acetyl COA in various parts of the paper. Including the details would make the work more comprehensive.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments and apologize for omitting the PGC-1α levels.  Per the reviewer’s suggestion, we have added the PGC-1α transcript levels (Figure 4C) in the section describing 2-AA-mediated dysregulation of the ERRα and MPC1 transcription (lines 243-252). Moreover, we have added Figure S5, which shows additional ATP and acetyl CoA levels in vivo. In our view, ATP and acetyl-CoA levels are shown in all appropriate settings, interrogating the bioenergetics, including in the presence of bacteria and in their absence, where only 2-AA is added. Please see Figures 1 and 5 and the newly added Figure S5.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The use of public data sets to support their claim on immune tolerance is missing. Including various data sets of similar studies will strengthen the findings independently.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Suppose we understand correctly the reviewer’s comment regarding public data sets on immune tolerance. In that case, we are referring to our data since there are no published data from other groups on 2-AA tolerization and because the outcome of the 2-AA effect on the bacterial burden differs from that of LPS. Therefore, this study did not consider comparing with published data from LPS.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Animal model: The authors appropriately initiated the study with an in vitro tolerization model involving 2-AA re-exposure, providing foundational insights for further investigation. However, the rationale for the one-shot injection in the in vivo model lacks clarity. To strengthen the relevance of the in vivo data, the authors should consider establishing a model involving bacterial re-exposure, such as a two-challenge paradigm with antibiotic treatment in between. This approach would allow for the examination of peritoneal macrophages harvested from mice, assessing ATP levels, acetyl CoA, TNF production, and bacterial counts. Such an approach would better align the in vivo findings with the in vitro experiments, confirming the role of tolerized macrophages in controlling PA infection in the presence of 2-AA.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment.  Indeed, we have performed a similar two-challenge paradigm study in which first exposure to 2-AA is achieved by injecting 2-AA, and 2nd exposure through infection with PA14 or ΔmvfR four days post -2-AA injection.  The results of Figure S5 can be directly compared with those in Fig 5 in vivo studies. As shown in supplementary Figure S5 the levels of ATP and acetyl-CoA in the spleen of infected animals and the enumeration of the bacterial counts agree with the “one-shot infection” presented in Fig 5 (PA14 or ΔmvfR+2-AA).  Figure S5 study although not included initially to simplify data presentation, it was performed in parallel with Fig 5 and thus they can be directly compared.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Exogenous ATP treatment: It is crucial to explore whether 2-AA re-exposure suppresses inflammasome activation and whether this suppression can be reversed by exogenous ATP treatment. Specifically, the authors should investigate whether NLRP3 inflammasome activation is inhibited in tolerized macrophages and whether such activation is necessary for host defense. Clarifying these points would provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying macrophage tolerization induced by 2-AA.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Excellent point. We agree, indeed, this is planned in the near future.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Figures 4C and D: The authors should exercise care in describing these figures. For instance, line 263 states that &quot;UK5099 had no effect on the PA14 burden in macrophages,&quot; which requires correction for accuracy.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize and rephrase this sentence and other sentences referring to Fig 4D and 4E in this section. Please see the highlighted sentences in the results section referring to Fig 4. For example, “The addition of the UK5099 inhibitor strongly enhanced the bacterial intracellular burden in ΔmvfR infected macrophages compared to the non-inhibited ΔmvfR infected cells, reaching a similar burden to those infected with PA14 (Fig. 4D)”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) ERRα expression: While the study intriguingly demonstrates a decrease in ERRα levels in tolerized macrophages following exposure to 2-AA, the discussion of this finding is lacking. It is worth exploring the possibility of increasing ERRα expression to counteract the tolerization induced by 2-AA and enhance clearance of PA infection. This avenue should be thoroughly discussed in the manuscript's Discussion section, offering insights into potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate the effects of 2-AA on macrophage function.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for this additional comment.  We have now included this point in the discussion section (lines 373-376).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Overall, the study is an excellent addition to the role of energy metabolism during bacterial infection. The mechanism-based approach in dissecting the roles of metabolic coactivator, transcription factor, mitochondrial transporter, and pro-inflammatory cytokine during acquired tolerance indicates a detailed and well-written study. However, connecting the mechanisms often was not reflected in some of the experiments, and answering a few concerns/suggestions will undoubtedly improve the study's readability, appeal, and overall impact on a broader audience.</p>
<p>(1) The authors should rephrase the title if possible. The title indicates 2AA as a bacterial quorum sensing signal; however, throughout the manuscript, there are no studies associated with actual quorum sensing in bacteria.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this comment. However, the title indicates 2-AA as a quorum sensing molecule because the synthesis of this signaling molecule is uniquely regulated by quorum sensing. Because of its importance in the virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and its regulation by quorum sensing, we feel that it is appropriate to refer to it as such.</p>

<p>(2) The authors generalised immunotolerance and memory of 2AA-exposed cells to broad-spectrum microbial exposure by just testing with LPS exposure. I would suggest they test at least 2 more heterologous microbial products known to illicit response and confirm their claim from Figure 1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. We intend not to generalize immunotolerance and memory of 2-AA exposed cells to broad-spectrum microbial exposure. Moreover, since the manuscript is not focused on comparing other bacterial molecules to 2-AA and multiple studies have focused on LPS tolerance, we tested LPS only in the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) LPS triggers ATP production through glycolysis in nitric oxide (NO) dependent mechanisms in various immune and non-immune cells. The authors should study the concentrations of NO, Glucose, and Pyruvate levels to clarify the mechanism of energy dynamics and the source of ATP and Acetyl CoA generated/scavenged during primary and secondary exposures to both 2AA and LPS.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that a cross-tolerization experiment using 2-AA and LPS would reveal interesting insights into immune response during PA infections.  However, this is out of the scope of this article. Please notice that the mechanism of 2-AA and LPS tolerization is mechanistically distinct, e.g. they rely on different HDAC enzymes, and LPS tolerization predominantly involves changes in H3K27 acetylation (Lauterbach et al. 2019). In contrast, 2-AA tolerization involves H3K18 modifications (Bandyopadhaya, Tsurumi, and Rahme 2017). For this reason, the complexity of such interactions would require a comprehensive set of experiments that are not part of the focus of this study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Immunogenic triggers often rapidly alter mitochondrial membrane potential, which alters oxygen consumption rates. However, the authors tend to generalize energy homeostasis and claim the deregulation of OXPHOS-inducing quiescent phenotype depending upon OCR measurements from Figure 1D. The authors must evaluate mitochondrial health and membrane potential during first and second exposure in a time-dependent manner to strengthen their theory of mitochondrial dysfunction. The authors should also check the phenomena in vivo (mice exposed to infection) if possible.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion. We now include electron microscopy images of mitochondria isolated from macrophages exposed to 2-AA. Results revealed that 2-AA alters mitochondrial morphology and cristae, supporting the mitochondrial dysfunctionality caused by 2-AA. These results are shown in Figure S4 and lines 185-188.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Since both MCP1 and MCP2 transporters are known to transport pyruvate to mitochondria, checking both MCP1 and 2 at transcript and protein levels in exposed cells will be essential. I suggest authors use MCP inhibitors or use RNA interference against MCPs to check the effect on tolerance of the cells exposed for a second time.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To our understanding, mitochondrial pyruvate carrier proteins, MPC1 and MPC2, form a hetero-oligomeric complex in the inner mitochondrial membrane to facilitate pyruvate import into mitochondria (McCommis and Finck 2015). We also used UK5099 an MPC carrier inhibitor for enumeration of bacterial load in macrophages in Figure 4 and observed a similar effect as 2-AA suggesting a similar mechanism of action.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The pyruvate levels of mitochondria in Figure 2A are shallow, and the authors claim statistical significance within a 1.5-fold change. The authors should cross-check the number of mitochondria they are isolating while estimating pyruvate from only mitochondrial fractions. Another point is, correlating mitochondrial pyruvate with the burst of ATP during first exposure in comparison to second exposure, one can argue that the number of mitochondria is variable between the exposures leading to a change in pyruvate amount (mitochondria number increases to compensate for the first exposure and decreases quickly to maintain homeostasis and remains quiescent during a second exposure due to activation of compensatory immune mechanism towards primary exposure). How do authors address the issue?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our electron microscopic studies indicate that although after 2-AA exposure, no reduction in mitochondrial numbers is observed in macrophages, alterations in mitochondrial morphology and cristae are observed. Please also see our answer to point # 4.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) The authors claim that ERR alpha regulates MCP1 transcription via activation of ERRalpha-PGC1 alpha axis and tolerization in cells to second exposure is due to impairment of the axis (Figure 3). PGC1 alpha is known to be induced during various metabolic, physiological, and immune-challenge-related stress in a tissue-dependent manner. In this context, one should expect changes in transcript and protein levels of PGC1 alpha. The authors must study PGC1 alpha levels with time-dependent exposures. LPS was shown to induce oscillations in PGC1 alpha levels in a tissue-specific manner. In experiments, authors should verify if such oscillations persist during time-dependent exposure, emphasising mitochondrial uncoupling that might get dampened during re-exposures to microbial challenges.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the suggestion. We have now included PGC-1α (Figure 4C) transcript levels, which show the same profile as the transcript levels of ERRα and MPC1. Please note that PGC-1α is only one of several ERRα co-activators; therefore, the amount of ERRα protein is the most relevant assessment regarding the activation of the MPC1 transcription.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) The authors claim that ERRalpha induces MCP1 through ChIP data in Figure 3. However, the physical verifications at mRNA levels and mutational/inhibitor-based experiments are missing. The authors should study the alterations of MCP1 mRNA in relation to exposures and inhibitors of ERRalpha and PGC1 alpha to strengthen their work.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an interesting approach; however, this experiment exceeds the scope of our manuscript. We will certainly consider this suggestion in our future experiments. Thank you.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) Publicly available data sets with LPS exposures should be analyzed for gene sets pertaining to mitochondrial OXPHOS, metabolism, immune response, etc. This will support the authors' work and provide a global overview of transcriptome associated with immune tolerance.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. For the reasons explained in #3 point and because the bacterial burden outcome of the 2-AA effect is different from that of LPS, comparison with LPS published data was not considered in this study.  We agree that in the future, a comprehensive comparison of whole genome transcriptome studies between LPS and 2-AA may reveal important insights that may also help better understand and potentially classify the immune tolerance triggered by 2-AA.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) In Figure 4, the authors study the role of MCP1 and associated pyruvate-dependent bacterial clearance during tolerization and associate them with a decrease in TNF alpha. I would suggest the addition of an ERR alpha inhibitor in these experiments. It is not clear as to why (mechanism) TNF alpha transcription was affected via pyruvate transport during bacterial exposure. I would suggest that the authors clarify the mechanism of TNF alpha activation/inactivation and its association with energy metabolism during acquired tolerance.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an excellent suggestion, given that a similar effect of ERRα on TNF-α was observed by other researchers (Chaltel-Lima et al. 2023).  Here, to clarify the mechanism of TNF alpha activation/inactivation and its association with energy metabolism, we elaborate on this aspect in the discussion section.</p>
<p>Lines 388-393. The text reads:</p>
<p>Previously, we reported that 2-AA tolerization induces histone deacetylation via HDAC1, reducing H3K18ac at the TNF-α promoter (Bandyopadhaya et al. 2016). The findings with acetyl-CoA reduction, the primary substrate of histone acetylation, and the TNF-α transcription  using UK5099 and ATP in 2-AA treated macrophages are in support of the bioenergetics disturbances observed in macrophages and their link to epigenetic modifications we have shown to be promoted by 2-AA (Bandyopadhaya et al. 2016)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) It is surprising that authors specifically target TNF alpha as a pro-inflammatory cytokine during tolerance. Various reports of cytokines and immune modulatory factors play a vital role in immune tolerance upon bacterial exposure. I would suggest authors perform cytokine profiling or check public data sets to specify their reason for choosing TNF alpha.</p>

<p>The choice of TNF-α is based on the results obtained in our previous study  (Bandyopadhaya et al. 2016).</p>
