<title>Abstract</title><p>Schlemm’s canal (SC) is central in intraocular pressure regulation but requires much characterization. It has distinct inner and outer walls, each composed of Schlemm’s canal endothelial cells (SECs) with different morphologies and functions. Recent transcriptomic studies of the anterior segment added important knowledge, but were limited in power by SEC numbers or did not focus on SC. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of SC biology, we performed bulk RNA sequencing on C57BL/6J SC, blood vessel, and lymphatic endothelial cells from limbal tissue (∼4500 SECs). We also analyzed mouse limbal tissues by single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (C57BL/6J and 129/Sj strains), successfully sequencing 903 individual SECs. Together, these datasets confirm that SC has molecular characteristics of both blood and lymphatic endothelia with a lymphatic phenotype predominating. SECs are enriched in pathways that regulate cell-cell junction formation pointing to the importance of junctions in determining SC fluid permeability. Importantly, and for the first time, our analyses characterize 3 molecular classes of SECs, molecularly distinguishing inner wall from outer wall SECs and discovering two inner wall cell states that likely result from local environmental differences. Further, and based on ligand and receptor expression patterns, we document key interactions between SECs and cells of the adjacent trabecular meshwork (TM) drainage tissue. Also, we present cell type expression for a collection of human glaucoma genes. These data provide a new molecular foundation that will enable the functional dissection of key homeostatic processes mediated by SECs as well as the development of new glaucoma therapeutics.</p>

<title>Significance statement</title>
<p>Schlemm’s canal is a critical ocular drainage structure that maintains intraocular pressure with important consequences for glaucoma. Despite this, Schlemm’s canal has been relatively understudied with the molecular process that mediate its function, maintain its health, or that are compromised in glaucoma needing much deeper characterization. This study is important as it provides the most comprehensive molecular characterization of Schlemm’s canal cells to date providing a wealth of molecular details. In addition to highlighting important biological pathways, this information will guide studies to develop new treatments against glaucoma.</p>

<title>Main text Introduction</title>
<p>Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness affecting 80 million people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor for glaucoma. Current glaucoma treatments reduce IOP using drugs and surgeries that decrease aqueous humor (AQH) formation or increase aqueous humor drainage (outflow) from the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Abnormally increased outflow resistance results in elevation of IOP and contributes to glaucoma. Schlemm’s canal (SC) and the trabecular meshwork (TM), key tissues of the conventional outflow pathway, are critical in regulating IOP and ocular fluid homeostasis. The flow resistance of the conventional outflow pathway is an important determinant of IOP. SC is an endothelial vessel circumscribing the eye within the iridocorneal angle at the limbus, where the iris and cornea meet. The canal has inner and outer walls composed of SECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). The inner wall (IW) of SC is the final barrier that AQH must cross before it passes into the lumen of SC, which is connected to venous circulation by vascular branches known as collector channels. The IW is specialized for its drainage functions with higher expression of lymphatic genes and differing cellular morphology compared to the outer wall (OW) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). The IW regulates aqueous humor drainage into the canal’s lumen. IW cells respond biomechanically to regulate IW fluid permeability and drainage. Specifically, they respond to changes in ocular pressure and shear stress, generated by AQH flow, forming specialized drainage structures called giant vacuoles as well as pores through which AQH passes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). However, much remains to be discovered about the mechanisms that determine outflow resistance and mediate outflow under both normal and pathological conditions.</p>
<p>Delineating the molecular control of outflow resistance and of inner wall fluid permeability is important for understanding IOP homeostasis and developing novel glaucoma treatments. A key site of resistance to outflow is located where SC and the adjacent juxtacanalicular meshwork (JCT) – a subpart of the TM – meet. The SC and TM are intimately linked at the cellular, biomechanical and functional levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>) . Both physical and molecular interactions between SC and TM cells participate in tissue formation, tissue maintenance and the regulation of resistance to outflow. The mechanisms by which the SC and TM coordinately regulate resistance to outflow and IOP are still being elucidated.</p>
<p>SC is a highly specialized vessel with its endothelial cells having properties of both blood vessels and lymphatic endothelial cells (BECs and LECs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). It develops by a process known as canalogenesis, which progresses through stages with features of angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, and lymphangiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Analyses of the genes linked to glaucoma most strongly identify lymphangiogenesis and endothelial processes, strongly implicating dysfunction of SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Despite this, SC is less studied than the TM and so we focus on SC in this study.</p>
<p>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is revealing the cellular heterogeneity and transcriptomic profiles of various ocular cell types, including the anterior segment from several species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). These important studies included SECs, but were underpowered and limited for SC due to the low representation of SECs in the studied tissues and the very small numbers of SECs successfully sequenced. To more deeply and rigorously characterize SECs, we here provide a multi-modal transcriptomic analysis. We present bulk sequencing data for SECs, LECs and BECs from the same tissue sample, providing averaged data on SEC gene expression at depth for ∼4500 SECs. We compare these bulk data to single cell (sc) and single nucleus (sn) RNA sequencing and then use the individual SEC transcriptome data to characterize SEC heterogeneity (across transcriptomes from 903 cells/nuclei from 2 strains of mice; C57BL/6J scRNA-seq 166, C57BL/6J snRNA-seq 375, 129/Sj scRNA-seq 362). Both the bulk and single cell resolution data confirm that SEC transcriptomes have similarities to BECs and LECs, but with an important bias towards lymphatic similarity. By sequencing a larger number of limbal SECs than previously reported, our study adds significant power and robustness, uncovering important new molecular characteristics of SECs. Building on the previous studies, it provides a more solid foundation to guide future work. Importantly, we identify unique gene expression features that distinguish inner and outer wall SECs, and we validate expression patterns using immunofluorescence (IF). Using pathway analysis and predicted ligand-receptor analysis, we provide critical new information about genes and pathways functioning in SC and about molecular interactions between SC and TM that are predicted to be central for tissue homeostasis, IOP control, and glaucoma. These unbiased methods greatly expand our molecular knowledge of SC.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Schlemm’s canal ECs are more similar to lymphatic than blood vessel ECs</title>
<p>To provide a more detailed understanding of the molecular nature of SECs, we compared the transcriptome of isolated limbal endothelial cells (SECs, BECs and LECs) obtained by bulk RNA sequencing. We developed a cell sorting method to isolate cells while preserving SECs. Limbal strips from Prox1-GFP mice were gently dissociated and dispersed cells were prelabeled with antibodies against LYVE1 and endomucin (EMCN). FACS was used to separate the dispersed cells into SECs (GFP+, EMCN+), LECs (GFP+, LYVE1+, EMCN-) and BECs (EMCN+ only). When we isolated mouse SECs with standard tissue dissociation procedures very few cells were obtained (&lt;&lt;100 from 10 eyes), whereas our optimized protocol allowed isolation of sufficient cells for meaningful studies (1500-1700 SECs, 200-300 LECs, and 2000-2500 BECs from 10 eyes) (Figure S1).</p>
<p>Pair-wise comparisons of the bulk RNA-seq data for each purified cell type demonstrate that the transcriptome of SECs displays more genes in common with LECs than BECs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). As LECs and SECs have the most similar transcriptomes, volcano plots of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between LECs and SECs showed fewer DEGs than for BECs versus SECs or for LECs versus BECs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). <italic>Npnt</italic> was highly expressed in SECs, but absent in LECs and BECs. As expected, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>) <italic>Prox1</italic> was the top DEG comparing SECs versus BECs and also LECs versus BECs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The dendrogram distances after hierarchical clustering and the signature gene heat maps of the bulk RNA sequencing data further demonstrate that the transcriptome of SECs is closer to that of LECs than BECs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>We next determined which canonical pathways were different between the cells based on their transcriptomes. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of SECs compared to BECs or LECs showed a common theme with extracellular matrix interactions (ECM glycoprotein, integrin cell surface interactions) being highly enriched in SECs compared to both other cell types (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). TGFβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>) cell signaling pathway was also enriched in SECs when compared to BECs but not LECs. Additionally, interleukin pathways were enriched in SECs compared to both BECs and LECs indicating their specific potential to interact with immune cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, Table 1, Table 2).</p>

<title>Cell types in mouse limbal tissue</title>
<p>Using scRNA-seq, we successfully sequenced 9272 single cells from dissected limbal tissue (enriched for drainage structures) of C57BL/6J mice (Figure S1). An unbiased low- resolution clustering of single cells projected onto a Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction (UMAP) space identified 9 major clusters representing various anterior segment cell types (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).

<title>SEC transcriptome is unique but closer to LEC than BEC</title>
<p>Using the strain C57BL/6J scRNA-seq data, the <italic>Egfl7</italic>-expressing ECs subclustered (unbiased methods) into three distinct sub-clusters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, D). Based on well characterized marker gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>) these sub-clusters were assigned as BEC (281 cells, high level of <italic>Flt1</italic> / <italic>VegfR1</italic>), LEC (22 cells, high level of <italic>Prox1</italic> and <italic>Lyve1</italic>) or SEC (166 cells expressing <italic>Prox1</italic> but not <italic>Lyve1</italic>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Among ECs, <italic>Npnt</italic> is uniquely expressed in SECs, <italic>Cdh5</italic> and <italic>Emcn</italic> are expressed at high levels in BECs, but only at mid and low levels in SECs and LECs, respectively. <italic>Flt4</italic> (<italic>VegfR3</italic>) is expressed at high levels in LECs, and at mid or low levels in SECs and BECs, respectively. <italic>Prox1</italic>, <italic>Ccl21a</italic>, and <italic>Fbln5</italic> are expressed in both LECs and SECs. <italic>Prox1</italic> and <italic>Ccl21a</italic> are expressed at higher levels in LECs but are not unique to either LECs or SECs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). A heatmap of the highly represented genes for each cell type indicates that the transcriptome of SECs more closely aligns with that of LECs than BECs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). The scRNA-seq data correlated well with the bulk sequencing data (Figure S3). When analyzing scRNA-seq data using Seurat, clusters are determined by calculating shared nearest neighbors followed by modularity optimization using a Louvian algorithm. To determine if the signature genes identified in these clusters identified by Seurat were robust and able to distinguish cell types in bulk RNA-seq samples, we used this signature gene list for unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the bulk RNA-seq data. This correctly identified the 3 cell types producing accurate SEC, BEC and LEC clusters. This demonstrates the robustness of the signature genes across independent samples using distinct statistical calculations (Figure S3).</p>

<title>RNAseq enables detection of OW and IW transcriptomes</title>
<p>Previous studies reported higher representation of ECs when using snRNA-seq compared to scRNA-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>) (and personal communication, Seth Blackshaw). Thus, we reasoned that snRNA-seq would capture more ECs and provide more power to discriminate SEC subtypes using unbiased methods. Using snRNA-seq, we analyzed 10,764 C57BL/6J nuclei (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) and captured 1287 EC nuclei (11.9% of total nuclei). This is a clear enrichment over scRNA-seq (EC 5.1% of cells).</p>

<p>The scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq datasets integrated well and agreed with each other in all assessed ways (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Although snRNA-seq captured fewer distinct genes (median gene count per cell = 759) than scRNA-seq (median gene count per cell = 2603), endothelial cells from the two datasets had a high degree of correlation of gene expression (Figure S3).</p>

<p>Unbiased clustering of this larger number of SEC transcriptomes separated SECs into two distinct sub-clusters (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C and D</xref>).

<title>Additional scRNA-seq transcriptomes allows detection of two distinct IW cell states</title>
<p>We reasoned that adding more transcriptomes with deeper coverage (transcripts from greater number of distinct genes detected) would enable better resolution of SEC subclasses. To examine more transcriptomes and with deeper coverage than snRNA-seq can achieve, and to validate our findings in a genetically divergent strain of mice, we performed scRNA-seq on limbal tissue from 129/Sj mice. We successfully sequenced 8812 limbal cells of 129/Sj mice (median gene count per cell = 1144). All major cell types were represented in the 129/Sj limbal data (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>) and it compared well to the C57BL/6J data. We integrated the <italic>Egfl7+ Cdh5+</italic> endothelial cells from 129/Sj and C57BL/6J datasets, a total of 1492 ECs (528 SECs) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). No statistically significant pathway differences were detected between the SECs of these strains, and a full analysis of the effects of strain background is beyond the scope of the current study (Table 3, shows a DEG list). Unbiased clustering of this integrated data detected three SEC states by further resolving the previously detected IW state into two subclasses that we call IW1 and IW2.

<p>SELP was detected in the outer wall of SC and some, but not all, BECs. This agrees with our transcriptomic data, where <italic>Selp</italic> was expressed in a significant subset of SECs by snRNA-seq, but minimally so in BECs. Whole mount staining of the anterior segment revealed SELP expression in OW SECs and ECs of CCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Taken together, the subgroup of SECs high in <italic>Selp</italic> expression must be OW SECs and CCs, while the subgroup of SECs with obvious <italic>Npnt</italic> expression are IW SECs.</p>
<p>Immunofluorescence detected ACKR1 in CCs and possibly very few OW cells (only where the CCs and OW meet, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). We denote these cells as CC cells in this paper. The exact starting location of CCs is hard to discern, as they blend into the OW, and there are very few of these <italic>Ackr1</italic>-expressing cells in the transcriptome data. The best ACKR1 antibody that we have tested is FAB6695 which has been used to detect ACKR1 in endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). However, it binds non-specifically to another protein(s) in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>).

Enrichment of the cell-cell junction, membrane raft, and endocytic vesicles cellular components in SECs highlights their importance for SEC maintenance and cellular functions. Molecular pathways enriched in SECs were actin binding, cell adhesion molecule binding, SH3 domain binding, protein tyrosine kinase binding. Enriched biological processes in SECs were actin filament organization and regulation of actin filament-based processes, small GTPase-mediated signaling, cell substrate adhesion, and regulation of vascular development (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>).</p>
<p>These data highlight diverse pathways through which SC is likely to regulate outflow and hence IOP.

<title>A multi-modal approach to understanding Schlemm’s canal</title>
<p>Single-cell resolution RNA-seq is revolutionizing molecular knowledge of cell types, cell states, and intercellular interactions in health and disease. Both scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq methods are greatly enabling. They overcome the previous necessity to purify individual cell types from complex tissues, and the associated technical issues with doing so. Importantly, they provide previously unavailable information about cell type and cell state heterogeneity. Nevertheless, tissue preparation methods still have to be optimized for specific tissues and cell types. Different preparation methods capture substantially distinct proportions of some cell types and/or different depths of transcriptomic data. Comprehensive analysis of desired cell types in a tissue may require the use of a combination of complementary, individually optimized preparation methods and sequencing approaches as presented here for SECs. We utilized bulk- RNA-seq of purified SECs from C57BL/6J mice as well as our current best optimized methods for scRNA-seq and snRNA-Seq to provide a robust analysis of the B6 limbus focusing on SEC transcriptomes. We successfully analyzed far greater numbers of SEC transcriptomes (541 total B6 transcriptomes, Table 4 summarizes all datasets) than previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>).</p>

<title>Deep transcriptome data and lymphatic biased identity of SECs</title>
<p>Despite their central role in assessing cellular heterogeneity, both snRNA-seq and scRNA-seq currently sample a much smaller proportion of the transcriptome than the averaged transcriptome provided by bulk-RNA-seq of a purified cell type. Our bulk-RNA-seq data (Table 6) provide the deepest analysis of the SEC transcriptome to date identifying &gt;9000 expressed genes (for 3 biological replicates representing approximately 1500 cells each) at FPKM &gt; 5. Comparing this bulk SEC data to bulk data we generated for LECs and BECs (from the same limbal tissue samples) we observe a lymphatic biased identity for SECs. This differs from the conclusion in a recent scRNA-seq study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), but is consistent with previous studies showing expression of lymphatic regulatory molecules including <italic>Prox1</italic> and <italic>Flt4</italic> in SECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>) and enrichment of lymphatic molecules in the IW of SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Adding to this, pseudo-bulk comparisons show that our scRNA-seq data agree well with our bulk data, again revealing the lymphatic biased expression pattern of SECs, and independently validating our conclusions based on bulk-seq. Our C57BL/6J scRNA-seq is of high quality with greater transcriptome representation (median ≈2600 genes per cell) than is often achieved in limbal cells. Our re-analysis of the scRNA-seq data in the conflicting publication indicated that that study was underpowered (for example capturing ∼5 LECs and ∼90 SECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>)) and upon integration and analysis their SECs co-clustered with ours (not shown, we did not include their cells in following studies as they differed from ours in being both from an albino strain and treated with Y27362, a ROCK inhibitor.

<title>snRNA-Seq allows identification of inner and outer wall SECs</title>
<p>snRNA-seq can have various advantages. It can allow the isolation of nuclei from frozen tissues. This theoretically helps to maintain transcriptomes as close to their natural state as possible and allows easy preservation of tissues for future analyses. Additionally, it can proportionally enrich for endothelial cells. For this reason, we used snRNA-seq in our studies.</p>
<p>ECs are very sensitive to preparation method and are routinely underrepresented using standard scRNA-seq methodologies, including in previous studies of the anterior segment and ocular drainage tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). On the other hand, snRNA-seq assays nuclear RNA, versus whole-cell RNA, and typically provides lower depth of transcriptome coverage than scRNA-seq. Our snRNA-seq data (strain C57BL/6J) agree well with our bulk and scRNA-seq transcriptome data and again supports the lymphatic biased expression pattern of SECs. Our snRNA-seq data integrated well with the scRNA-seq data and provided proportionally far more SECs (Results).</p>

<title>Enhanced identification of different SEC states using further scRNA-seq</title>
<p>In addition to sampling greater number of cells, deeper sampling of the transcriptome of each cell leads to more robust pathway analyses and improved resolution of heterogeneous cell states. Currently, popular data integration methods anchor datasets based on the genes that are sampled. This means that extending data by adding more cells with low sampling is not as informative as adding more cells with more deeply sampled transcriptomes (adding data with lower sampling may even be detrimental, with the balance between the added statistical power of increasing cell number and depth of transcriptome sampling being important). Despite the general value of snRNA-seq, it generally achieves lower depth of transcriptome coverage, with greater technical variation in sampling of specific genes. This means that snRNA-seq data generally provide lower power for pathway enrichment analyses than scRNA-seq (as is true in our data).</p>
<p>Thus, to both provide further scRNA-seq data to enhance the resolution of SEC subtypes and to allow a cross-strain comparison, we next sequenced limbal tissue from strain 129/Sj mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). We obtained high quality data with standard coverage (362 SECs and median 1144 genes per cell, Table 4). The strain 129/Sj and B6 data integrate well and allowed stratification of SECs into 3 different states, including 2 IW states, for the first time. We named these classes OW, IW1, and IW2 based on marker studies and IF (see below). We refer to these SEC classes as states rather than subtypes because, despite their unbiased statistical separation, they have remarkably similar transcriptomes with no or very few detected pathway differences (at the currently achieved depth of sampling). Their transcriptomes may differ more due to the effects of local environmental differences (including exposure to different AQH flow parameters) than differing developmental trajectories. With greater sampling and deeper transcriptomic depth, it is likely that additional SEC cell states/types will be identified. Pathway enrichment analysis identified a few significantly different pathways between IW and OW cells. IW1 cells are enriched for the calcium-dependent protein binding and cell adhesion molecule binding pathways which makes intuitive sense, since SC contains many vesicles, suggesting that membrane fusion events must be important for normal function, likely in pore formation within drainage structures known as giant vacuoles. Membrane fusion in other cell types is regulated by calcium binding to various proteins including calmodulin (<italic>Calm1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). Inner wall cells have a discontinuous basement membrane and effective cell adhesion is necessary as the pressure gradient pushes them away from their basement membrane. Additionally, various cell adhesion molecule and related signaling can impact the stability of cell junctions, again with the possibility of modulating resistance to AQH drainage through the IW (Kizhatil et al., 2023 Biorxiv).</p>

In fact, <italic>Npn</italic>t is most highly expressed in IW1 cells, and its transcript was detected in 89% of IW1 versus 26% of IW2 and 32% of OW cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>, Table 5). <italic>Ccl21a</italic> was also recently reported in SECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). We extend this by showing that the <italic>Ccl21a</italic> gene is robustly expressed in IW2 cells but is typically expressed at low levels in IW1 and OW cells. Its transcript was detected in 45% of IW2 cells, 33% of IW1 and 21% of OW cells. Thus, high <italic>Npnt</italic> or high <italic>Ccl21a</italic> expression are key markers for these SEC classes (NPNT for IW1 and CCL21A for IW2). In agreement with our previous study demonstrating polarization of SC with a bias for robust expression of lymphatic molecules in the IW versus the OW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). IW cells have higher expression of key lymphatic genes including <italic>Flt4</italic>, <italic>Prox1</italic> and <italic>Ccl21a</italic>. Assessing various marker genes by IF confirmed the identification of these OW and IW cell states. Additionally, an analysis of SECs in publicly available dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), showed a similar distribution of <italic>Npnt, Ccl21a,</italic> and <italic>Selp</italic> expression in SECs (Figure S5) which further bolsters our findings.</p>

<title>Potential regulators of AQH flow and immune cell transit expressed by IW SECs</title>
<p>In addition to validating the identification of OW and IW transcriptomes, our IF analyses further strengthened the biological separation of IW1 and IW2 SECs. IF revealed a bias for IW1 cells (marked by robust NPNT) to be located more anteriorly in SC than IW2 cells (marked by robust CCL21A). IW2 cells have a bias to be localized more posteriorly in SC. In mice, the anterior portion of the SC IW is likely to experience higher transmural AQH flow rates based on the more open, anterior angle tissue anatomy, while the posterior portion of the IW is likely to experience lower flow rates. The posterior portion of SC has a differing local environmental context compared to the anterior portion being more closely opposed to: 1) the iris/uvea, 2) the more robust posterior trabecular meshwork and 3) the ciliary muscle and ciliary body. Together, this suggests that <italic>Npnt</italic> may respond to (and/or be a marker of) either local AQH flow rates, to local transport of ligands in AQH that are carried by flow, or to other local environmental differences. Since it is an extracellular matrix molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>), NPNT may even directly modulate the local regulation of flow. Further studies are needed to assess these possibilities and are already underway. Interestingly, the IW2 marker CCL21A is a potent chemoattractant ligand. It engages the CCR7 receptor on lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells (APCs). <italic>Ccl21a</italic> is prominently expressed in lymphatics and lymph nodes and directs the migration of immune cells into lymphoid tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>) Low fluid flow environments create a gradient of CCL21A that then directs cellular homing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). We speculate that CCL21A may have similar functions in SC, which in addition to draining aqueous humor is intimately associated with immune cells, some of which transit the IW when exiting the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). SC is likely important in the transit of immune- tolerizing cells that are exposed to antigens in the anterior chamber, exit the eye and then travel to the spleen to establish a form of immune tolerance to the antigen captured in the eye, a process known as anterior chamber associated immune deviation (ACAID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>).</p>

<title>Macrophages, pericytes and collector channels</title>
<p>We previously reported a chaperoning role for macrophages in SC development, while adult SC is intimately associated with macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). It seems likely that macrophages associated with SC and/or present in the TM will have important roles in determining AQH outflow/IOP in health and disease. Our scRNA-seq data did not have adequate power for pathway analysis of macrophages, but further studies are underway. Our scRNA-seq also identified pericytes. IF demonstrated that <italic>Desmin</italic>-expressing pericytes are present along the CCs. The physical association of pericytes with CCs suggests an important role in regulating outflow resistance at a site immediately distal to SC, but further experiments are needed to test this.</p>

<title>Pathways in SECS</title>
<p>Gene ontology (GO) analysis of our scRNA-seq identified molecular pathways and hub genes that can be used to test hypotheses regarding SC function in regulating IOP. We identified genes involved in a variety of biological processes that are enriched in SECs. These processes include actin filament organization, cell substrate adhesion, regulation of vascular development, and tissue migration. Importantly, cell-cell junction pathway genes were enriched in SECs, including <italic>Tjp1</italic>, <italic>Tjp2</italic> and <italic>Ctnnb1</italic>. These genes have important roles in the formation and regulation of tight junction proteins in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). Integrin genes involved in regulating collagen-containing extracellular matrix such as <italic>Itga6</italic>, <italic>Itga9</italic>, and <italic>Itgb4</italic>, fibulin genes with roles in maintaining the integrity of basement membrane such as <italic>Fbln2</italic> and <italic>Fbln5</italic>, and nephronectin (<italic>Npnt</italic>) an ECM molecule that regulates cell-cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>) are all expressed in SECs. Our GO analysis indicates enrichment of ‘membrane raft’ pathway genes in SECs including <italic>Fyn</italic>, <italic>Lyn</italic>, and <italic>Crk</italic> kinases in SECs. Recently we demonstrated a role for FYN, a Src family kinase in regulating AQH outflow and IOP (Kizhatil et al., 2023 Biorxiv). FYN is activated by IOP elevation and phosphorylates VECAD at specific tyrosine residues, thereby increasing the permeability of SEC cell junctions. Functionally analyzing hub genes identified in our pathway analyses is likely to improve our understanding of additional mechanisms that are active within SECs. Enhancing knowledge of pathway details in SECs, our bulk data provide much greater depth of transcript sampling and is valuable for extending the number of identified pathway members beyond the scRNA-seq data.</p>
<p>To provide important information on predicted ligand receptor signaling between the TM and SC, we used NicheNet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>) to identify matching ligand receptor pairs present on SECs and TM cells. A list of key ligand receptor pairs is presented in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>. Supporting this approach and consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>), this analysis shows that <italic>Angpt1</italic> is produced by TM cells while its receptor TEK is highly expressed in SECs. Disturbances in this pathway are known to result in IOP elevation and developmental glaucoma while GWAS implicates it in POAG. Since IOP elevation is a key risk factor for glaucoma, we also provide a summary of the key cell types in which key genes implicated in IOP elevation and glaucoma though GWAS are expressed.</p>
<p>In summary, our study provides a deep characterization of SECs including the identification of 3 distinct cell states of great value to understanding both SC biology and IOP elevation in glaucoma. Although we focus on SC here, a wealth of data is provided for other anterior segment cell types that will be the focus of future studies.</p>

<p>The anterior segment of the eye including the limbus was dissected from each of ten 3-month- old Prox1-GFP mice to make 1 biological replicate of each cell type. The iris, cornea, and ciliary body were gently and carefully removed using forceps to prevent damage to the delicate aqueous humor drainage structures. A strip of limbal tissue 1-2 mm wide consisting of the aqueous humor outflow tissues SC and TM, limbal blood vessels, and lymphatics was dissected from each anterior segment. Limbal strips were dissected in ice-cold PBS. Strips from 20 eyes were pooled and dissociated paying strict attention to osmolarity (290-300 mOSm) and mechanical force, using 1mg/ml Collagenase Type 4 (Worthington Biochemical Cat. no. LS004188) to preserve membrane proteins for the staining cell surface marker for flow cytometry. Single-cell suspension was stained with Lyve1 conjugated to eFluor 660 (ALY7 eBioscience Cat. no. 14-0443-82), Endomucin conjugated to phycoerythrin (eBio V.7.C7 Cat. no.14-5851-82), and propidium iodide to mark dead cells. Forward and side scatter gates were first used to eliminate events with low scatter which include derbies, cell fragments and pyknotic cells. Then propidium iodide positive dead cells were gated out.

<title>Analysis of sequencing data</title>
<p>Bulk RNA sequencing: Raw reads were aligned to mm10 reference genome by STAR and summarized to gene counts. After transcripts Per Kilobase Million (TPM) normalization, principal components analysis (PCA) was applied to assess technical replication and remove outlier samples. DESeq2 models were fitted to identify genes differentially expressed between blood vessel endothelial, SC endothelial, and lymphatic endothelial cells, where a threshold of log (fold change) &gt; 2 and FDR &lt; 0.05 was used to identify a total of 3,063 variable genes between three pair-wise comparisons. TPM of differentially expressed genes were shown as a heatmap between samples. The resulting log (fold change) values for each gene were plotted against those obtained from single-cell sequencing data described below.</p>
<p>Single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing: Raw reads were mapped to the mm10 reference genome by 10x Genomics Cell Ranger pipeline. Seurat v3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>) was used to conduct all single cell and single nucleus sequencing analyses. Briefly, the dataset was filtered to contain cells with at least 200 expressed genes and genes with expression in more than three cells. Cells were also filtered for mitochondrial gene expression (&lt;20% for single-cell and &lt;5% for single-nucleus, mitochondrial genes are rarely represented in snRNA-seq). The dataset was log-normalized and scaled. Unsupervised clustering was performed using a resolution parameter of 0.1, followed by manual annotation of Seurat clusters. Sub-clustering of individual clusters was also performed in an unsupervised manner with a resolution parameter of 0.5. Biological incompatibility based on gene expression was used to identify doublets. The two C57BL/6J single cell datasets were merged after QC. They were technical replicates, experimentally processed at the same time, and so batch effects resulting from sample preparation, sequencing technology, etc. do not apply. The merged C57BL/6J single cell dataset was integrated with the C57BL/6J single nucleus dataset post-QC, because of expected batch-effects between datasets arising from differences in sample preparation, sequencing technology, and alignment of reads (inclusion of intronic reads in snRNA-seq). Similarly, the merged C57BL/6J single cell dataset was integrated with the 129/Sj single cell dataset post-QC. Briefly, samples were log-normalized followed by the selection of highly variable genes and a reduction of dimensions using canonical correlation analysis. The unsupervised clustering with a resolution parameter of 0.1 for both single cell and single nucleus sequencing data was represented on a common UMAP space, and cluster identity was assigned based on the expression of various known genes. Marker genes were identified using Wilcoxon test implemented in Seurat using default parameters. Data can be visualized in the Broad Institute’s Single Cell Portal with accession numbers SCP2293 (cell) and SCP2317 (nucleus).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Balasubramanian et al. characterized the cell types comprising mouse Schlemm's canal (SC) using bulk and single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). The results identify expression patterns the delineate the SC inner and outer wall cells and two inner wall 'states'. Further analysis demonstrates expression patterns of glaucoma associated genes and receptor ligand pairs between SEC's and neighboring trabecular meshwork.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>While mouse SC has been profiled in previous scRNA-seq studies (van Zyl et al 2020, Thomson et al 2021), these data provide higher resolution of SC cell types, particularly endothelial cell (SEC) populations. SC is an important regulator of anterior chamber outflow and has important consequences for glaucoma.</p>
<p>Comments on the latest version:</p>
<p>The authors have addressed my primary concerns with the first version of the manuscript. This study represents a valuable resource in the molecular characterization of mouse Schlemm's canal cell types.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This revised article has characterized the mouse Schlemm's canal expression profile using a comprehensive approach based on sorted SEC, LEC, and BEC total RNA-Seq, scRNA-Seq, and snRNA-Seq to enrich the selection of SECs. The revised study has successfully profiled genome-wide gene expression using sorted SECs, demonstrating that SECs have a closer similarity to LECs than BECs. The combined scRNA- and snRNA-Seq data with deep coverage of gene expression led to the successful identification of many novel biomarkers for inner wall SECs, outer wall SECs, collector channel ECs, and pericytes. In addition, the study also identified two novel states of inner wall SECs separated by new markers. The study provides significant novel information about the biology and expression profile of SECs in the inner and outer walls. It is of great significance to have this novel, convincing, and comprehensive study led by leading researchers published in this journal. The revision has improved the clarity and significance of the study with more details.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a comprehensive study using various data to support the expression characterization of mouse SECs. First, the study profiled genome-wide expression using sorted SECs, LECs, and BECs from the same tissue/organ to identify the similarities and differences among the three types of cells. Second, snRNA-Seq was applied to enrich the number of SECs from mouse ocular tissues significantly. Increased sampling of SECs and other cells led to more comprehensive coverage and characterization of cells, including pericytes. Third, the combined scRNA- and snRNA-Seq data analyses increase the power to further characterize the subtle differences within SECs, leading to identifying the expression markers of Inner and Outer wall SECs, collector channel ECs, and distal region cells. Fourth, the identified unique markers were validated for RNA and protein expression in mouse ocular tissues. Fifth, the study explored how the IOP- and glaucoma-associated genes are expressed in the ScRNA- and snRNA-Seq data, providing potential connections of these GWAS genes with IOP and glaucoma. Sixth, the initial pathway and network analyses generated exciting hypotheses that could be tested in other independent studies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors have addressed most of the previous comments by adding more details about the protocol and additional discussions. Several comments requiring additional experimental data have been addressed as future directions, such as protein validation, RNA expression validation in human samples, and GWAS-identified IOP genes.</p>
<p>Comments on the latest version:</p>
<p>The authors have addressed previous comments responsively. The authors have suggested several experiments to be completed in the future since these could be time-consuming with human samples. The revised article is with better clarity and clearer significance. No additional comments.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>

<p>Balasubramanian et al. characterized the cell types comprising mouse Schlemm's canal (SC) using bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). The results identify expression patterns that delineate the SC inner and outer wall cells and two inner wall 'states'. Further analysis demonstrates expression patterns of glaucoma-associated genes and receptor-ligand pairs between SEC's and neighboring trabecular meshwork.</p>

<p>While mouse SC has been profiled in previous scRNA-seq studies (van Zyl et al 2020, Thomson et al 2021), these data provide higher resolution of SC cell types, particularly endothelial cell (SEC) populations. SC is an important regulator of anterior chamber outflow and has important consequences for glaucoma.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewers for their thorough reading of our manuscript and their insightful comments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Since SC has previously been characterized in mouse, human, and other species by scRNA-seq in other studies, this study would benefit from more direct comparisons to published datasets. For example, Table 4 could be expanded to list the SC cell numbers profiled in each study. Expression patterns highlighted in this study could be independently verified by plotting in publicly available mouse SC datasets. Further, a comparison to human expression patterns would assess whether type-specific expression patterns are conserved. Alternatively, an integrated analysis could be performed. Indeed, the authors mention that an integrated analysis was attempted but the data is not shown. It is unclear if this was because of a lack of agreement between datasets or other reasons.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Table 4 now includes an expanded list of SC cell numbers in each study. We profiled the expression of Npnt, Selp, and Ccl21a in the Thomson et al., 2021 dataset and have included the concurring results in Figure S5. We were unable to do a similar profile using the Van Zyl., 2020 dataset due to small SC numbers. As previously mentioned, differences such as read depth, strain of animals used (including pigmented vs albino), method of cell isolation (including drug exposure), and number of cells profiled raise a significant impediment to integration with previously published datasets. A comparison to human atlas is a focus of future work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Figure 1 presents bulk RNA seq results comparing SEC, BEC, and LEC expression patterns. These populations were isolated using cell surface markers and enrichment by FACS. Since each EC population is derived from the same sample, the accuracy of this data hinges on the purity of enrichment. However, a reference is not given for this method and it is not clear how purity was validated. The authors later note that marker Emcn, which was used to identify BECs, is also expressed in SECs and LECs at lower levels. It should be demonstrated that these populations are clearly separated by flow cytometry.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added the following clarifying text to the methods section: Forward and side scatter gates were first used to eliminate events with low scatter which include debris, cell fragments and pyknotic cells. Then propidium iodide positive dead cells were gated out. Further gating on the viable cells was applied such that distinct population of cells were isolated a) SECs: GFP+Lvye1-, b) LECs: GFP+ Lyve1+, c) GFP- BECs: Endomucin+.</p>
<p>We show here a representative of the flow sort showing the clear distinction in SEC and LEC cell isolation.</p>
<fig id="sa3fig1">

<p>We obtained two distinct populations; 1. SEC cells (GPF+LYVE1--blue) 2. LEC (GPF+LYVE1+- red). Note eFluor 660 emission was collected using the Alexa647 (A647) setting of the flow cytometer. Additionally, SEC marker expression from bulk RNA-seq aligns with signature gene expression from SECs in single cell RNA-seq (Figure S3).</p>

<p>(3) Bulk RNA-seq analysis infers similarity from the number of DEGs between samples, however, this is not a robust indicator. A correlation analysis should be run to verify conclusions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have provided a heatmap with hierarchical clustering based on Euclidean distance of the EC subtypes (Figure 1B) analyzed by bulk RNA seq in addition to number of DE genes between subtypes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Figures 2-4 present three different datasets targeting the same tissue: 1) C57bl/6j scRNA-seq, 2) C57bl/6j snRNA-seq, 3) 129/sj scRNA-seq. Integrated analysis comparing datasets #1 to #2 and #3 is also presented. Integration methods are not described beyond 'normalization for cell numbers'. It is unclear if additional alignment methods were used. Integration across each of these datasets needs careful consideration, especially since different filtering methods were used (e.g. &lt;20% mito in scRNA-seq and &lt;5% in snRNA-seq). Improper integration could affect the ability to cluster or exaggerate differences between cell/types and states. It would be useful to demonstrate the contribution of different samples and datasets to each cell type/state to verify that these are not driven by batch effects, mouse strain, or collection platform.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that integration should be performed with careful consideration to confounding factors. We demonstrate the contribution of different samples and datasets to show how our datasets integrated well (we had added panels to Figure 3C and 4C) and that cell types/states contribution was uniformly distributed across methods (C57BL/6J single cell and single nuc) and backgrounds (C57BL/6J and 129/Sj) were not a result of integration.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) IW1 and IW2 are not well separated, and it is unclear if these represent truly different cell states. Figure 5b shows the staining of CCL21A and describes expression in the 'posterior portion' but in the image there are no DAPI+ nuclei in the anterior portion, suggesting the sampling in this section is different from Figure 5a. This would be improved by co-staining NPNT and CCL21A to demonstrate specificity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Since both our antibodies are derived from the same species (goat), a co-labeling wasn’t possible. To be prudent, we used adjacent sections, flat-mounts, and RNAscope and provided further evidence of the anterior/posterior “bias” in supplemental figures.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The substructures observed within clusters in sc/snRNA-seq data suggest that overall profiling may still not be comprehensive. This should be noted in the discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree and have added this note in the discussion: “With greater sampling and deeper transcriptomic depth, it is likely that additional SEC cell states/types will be identified.”</p>

<p>This article has characterized the mouse Schlemm's canal expression profile using a comprehensive approach based on sorted SEC, LEC, and BEC total RNA-Seq, scRNA-Seq, and snRNA-Seq to enrich the selection of SECs. The study has successfully profiled genome-wide gene expression using sorted SECs, demonstrating that SECs have a closer similarity to LECs than BECs.

In addition, the study also identified two novel states of inner wall SECs separated by new markers. The study provides significant novel information about the biology and expression profile of SECs in the inner and outer walls. It is of great significance to have this novel, convincing, and comprehensive study led by leading researchers published in this journal.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for their comments on the strengths of this study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A few minor weaknesses have been noted. First, since snRNA-Seq and scRNA-Seq generated different coverage of expressed genes in the cells, how did the combined analyses balance the un-equal sequencing coverage and missing data points in the snRNA-Seq data? Second, the RNA/protein validation of selected SEC molecular markers was done using mouse anterior segment tissues. It would be more helpful to examine whether these molecular markers for SECs could work well in human SECs. Third, the effort to characterize the GWAS-identified IOP- and glaucoma-associated genes is exciting but with limited new information. Additional work could be performed to prioritize these genes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Integration of sc-Seq and sn-Seq data: We have addressed a similar integration question from reviewer 1 and have now included a plot showing the distribution of cells upon integration. Integration methods are not perfect and generally result in some loss of data especially when datasets of un-equal sequencing coverage are integrated. However, we did not observe any obvious differences between the original (un-integrated) and integrated datasets. We also noted that cell types/states contribution was similarly distributed across methods (C57BL/6J single cell and single nuc) and backgrounds (C57BL/6J and 129/Sj) and clustering were not a result of batch-effects.</p>
<p>We agree about the human relevance of SEC markers, and this will be a focus of future work.</p>
<p>Another focus of our future work is to understand how GWAS identified IOP and glaucoma genes change in disease states.</p>

<p>(1) The study has validated RNA/protein expression of the selected biomarkers for IW/OW SECs in mouse eyes. It would be more helpful to confirm that these newly identified molecular biomarkers for SECs could apply to human eyes. This could be examined through available human scRNA-/snRNA-Seq data or targeted RNA and protein staining experiments. The additional validation in human SECs would make the current discovery more convincing.</p>

<p>We agree with the importance of validation in human samples, and is the scope of future work.</p>

<p>(2) The combination of scRNA-Seq and snRNA-Seq from three batches of experiments increased the statistical power to identify subtypes of SECs. It would be helpful to include more details on how the qc, missing data, and normalization across different batches were dealt with.</p>

<p>We have incorporated more details in the methods section of the paper.</p>

<p>(3) The authors explored the underlying molecular connection between the newly identified IOP/glaucoma-associated genes using the newly generated SEC-targeted scRNA/snRNA-Seq data. Many of these associated genes were present in the same SEC cells. It would be interesting to see how many of these genes' expression levels are correlated with each other via a network. These potential correlation networks across SECs could lead to identifying novel upstream regulators or network hubs, which could target many IOP-associated genes for future studies.</p>

<p>We agree with the importance of a correlation network analysis, but this is a focus of future work, especially in normal and disease states.</p>
