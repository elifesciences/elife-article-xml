<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Bacterial exonuclease III (ExoIII), widely acknowledged for specifically targeting double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), has been documented as a DNA repair-associated nuclease with apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP)-endonuclease and 3′→5′ exonuclease activities. Due to these enzymatic properties, ExoIII has been broadly applied in molecular biosensors. Here, we demonstrate that ExoIII (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>) possesses highly active enzymatic activities on ssDNA. By using a range of ssDNA fluorescence-quenching reporters and fluorophore-labeled probes coupled with mass spectrometry analysis, we found ExoIII cleaved the ssDNA at 5′-bond of phosphodiester from 3′ to 5′ end by both exonuclease and endonuclease activities. Additional point mutation analysis identified the critical residues for the ssDNase action of ExoIII and suggested the activity shared the same active center with the dsDNA-targeted activities of ExoIII. Notably, ExoIII could also digest the dsDNA structures containing 3′-end ssDNA. Considering most ExoIII-assisted molecular biosensors require the involvement of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) or nucleic acid aptamer containing ssDNA, the activity will lead to low efficiency or false positive outcome. Our study revealed the multi-enzymatic activity and the underlying molecular mechanism of ExoIII on ssDNA, illuminating novel insights for understanding its biological roles in DNA repair and the rational design of ExoIII-ssDNA involved diagnostics.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Endogenous and exogenous stresses frequently result in DNA damage. Base damage is one of the most common DNA lesions caused by alkylation, oxidation, deamination, and depurination/depyrimidination <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Such structural changes in double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) immediately recruit a range of downstream enzymes to the lesion locus for repair, a process known as base excision repair (BER) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Exonuclease III (ExoIII) has been widely recognized as one of the most critical players in BER <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Based on the enzymatic activities involved, BER has been conceptually divided into the following five steps <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>: 1) glycosylase excision on the damaged base forming the apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site; 2) AP endonuclease (ExoIII) incision on the phosphodiester backbone to create and extend a ssDNA gap; 3) 5′-deoxyribose phosphate (dRp) removal; 4) polymerase-directed gap filling; 5) ligase-aided nick sealing. During the BER process, ExoIII performs the dual roles of AP endonuclease and exonuclease in <italic>E. coli</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Once the damaged bases are removed by glycosylases leaving an AP site, ExoIII first acts as an endonuclease to hydrolyze the phosphodiester bond at the 5′-end of the AP site, then as an exonuclease to degrade the downstream single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) of the duplex region from 3′ to 5′ end. These two ExoIII-dominated enzymatic activities create a proper length of ssDNA gap on dsDNA, which is required for polymerase binding at the locus to re-synthesize nucleotides <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Structural analysis revealed that the α<sub>M</sub> helix of ExoIII stabilized the substrate by stretching into the major groove of dsDNA in the catalytic process <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Interestingly, different from the typical multifunctional enzymes, i.e., DNA polymerase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, with separate active sites, the multiple activities of ExoIII on dsDNA lie in the same active site <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>During the 1960s-1990s, Kornberg’s laboratory demonstrated that ExoIII specifically recognizes dsDNA but is inactive to ssDNA based on an ssDNA oligo of five consecutive Ts (5′ pTpTpTpTpT 3′) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, and other researchers showed ExoIII had limited enzymatic activity on dsDNA containing 3′-protruding ssDNA (≥ 4 nt) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Hence, ExoIII was previously proposed to produce ssDNA from dsDNA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Combined with novel materials, chemicals,, or mechanical platforms, ExoIII has been widely employed in detecting nucleic acids, metals, toxins, and other types of small molecules <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Based on the specific enzymatic activities of ExoIII on dsDNA in detections, the ExoIII-assisted biosensors can be divided into two categories: AP-endonuclease and exonuclease-based methods. As a promising replacement of PCR technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, TwistAmp® Liquid exo kit (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.twistdx.co.uk/product/twistamp-liquid-exo/">https://www.twistdx.co.uk/product/twistamp-liquid-exo/</ext-link>) represents one of the most successful AP-endonuclease-based nucleic acid detection, which combines recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> and ExoIII. In the application of the commercial kit, a 46∼52 nt ssDNA probe is required to base-pair with the target sequence and the probe should also contain an AP site (usually simulated by a tetrahydrofuran [THF] residue) labeled with a fluorophore and a quencher, respectively, at or near the 5′- and 3′- end of AP. Once the ssDNA probe binds to the complementary sequence with the aid of recombinase and forms a dsDNA region containing an AP, ExoIII recognizes and cleaves the AP site, which separates the fluorophore and quencher, leading to a fluorescence release. In the exonuclease-based methods, ssDNA or nucleic acid aptamer contained ssDNA is often configured to form dsDNA substrate for the exonuclease activity of ExoIII <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. However, the digesting of ExoIII on ssDNA probe has been inadvertently observed in three ExoIII-developed detection methods <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> and a biochemical study <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. As the studies displayed limitaitons in proving the ssDNase activity of ExoIII: a) no additional procedure safeguards the ssDNA substrate from forming secondary structure containing dsDNA duplex in or between ssDNA, which can easily happen, and b) only stays on the phenomenon without further in-depth characterization and mechanism exploring, ExoIII has therefore still been publicly described (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/">https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/</ext-link> exonuclease-III), studied <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, and commercialized as a dsDNA-specific enzyme that is inactive or has limited activity on ssDNA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.thermofisher.cn/order/catalog/product/EN0191">https://www.thermofisher.cn/order/catalog/product/EN0191</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://international.neb.com/products/m0206-exonuclease-iii-e-coli#Product%20Information">https://international.neb.com/products/m0206-exonuclease-iii-e-coli#Product%20Information</ext-link>) for over a half century. The definition of the enzymatic activity of ExoIII on ssDNA remains ambiguous.</p>
<p>To address this long-standing controversy, we used several sensitive fluorescence-quenching (FQ) ssDNA reporters to detect the enzymatic activity of ExoIII on ssDNA. FQ is distance-dependent, where increasing the distance between the fluorophore and the quencher increases the fluorescence intensity. As a sensitive and visible physical phenomenon, it has been transformed into one of the most influential techniques for monitoring dynamic alterations of macromolecule conformation in complex interactions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. The DNA or RNA constructed FQ reporter has been successfully employed in CRISPR-based diagnostics <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> as an efficient sensor of collateral trans-cleavage activity of Cas12a on ssDNA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> and Cas13a on RNA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Once the nuclease cuts the ssDNA or RNA connector and disconnects the fluorophore and quencher, fluorescence will be significantly released as a positive readout for the detection. Combining with mass spectrometry and structure analysis, our finding demonstrated the ssDNase activity of ExoIII and its potential biological role of in DNA repair. Furthermore, it also alerted a risk of false positive or low efficiency within the widely adopted ExoIII-ssDNA combined diagnostic approach.</p>

<title>ExoIII rapidly cleaved the ssDNA FQ reporters</title>
<p>As a ultrasensitive biosensor of the ssDNase activity, the ssDNA FQ (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>) (5 nt) of CRISPR-based detection systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> were utilized for assaying the ssDNase activity of ExoIII and its digesting rate. To examine if the substrates form the dsDNA region internally or between ssDNA strands, the dsDNA-specific nuclease T7 exo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> was used as the negative control, while LbCas12a<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> was designated as the positive control. Once the ssDNA FQ reporter is cleaved by nuclease, fluorescent signal will be released. In contrast to T7 exo and LbCas12a, ExoIII (5 U/µl) triggered a substantial fluorescent signal promptly upon adding to FQ reporter (5 µM) (a total of 50 pmol), and most of the ssDNA substrate (over 90%) was cleaved in the first minute (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>), which suggested that the commercial ExoIII (5 U/µl) degraded over 2.7×10<sup>13</sup> (45 pmol) phosphodiester bonds per minute in the reaction, significantly faster than 0.7 pmol phosphodiester bonds per minute of LbCas12a and that of other nucleases (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>). Strikingly, we found even at room tempreture (22°C) the fluorescence release initiated immediately when 0.5 µl ExoIII was mixed with FQ reporter (5 µM) under LED blue light <bold>(Supplementary video S1)</bold>. In summary, T7 exo showed no significance with D-T7 exo; APE1 exhibited a significantly detectable fluorescence signal compared to its deactivated counterpart (D-APE1), albeit much weaker than that of ExoIII and LbCas12a (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>Given that ExoIII has long been recognized as a dsDNA-specific nuclease, we initially speculated that the ssDNA activity on FQ reporters might be ascribed to its cleavage at the 5′ or 3′ end phosphodiester bonds of ssDNA reporter rather than the tipycal phosphodiester bonds within ssDNA. To narrow down the possibility, we firstly removed the 5′ end phosphodiester by designing the FQ reporter with FAM labeled at its 5′ first thymine (T<sub>1</sub>) base instead of the 5′ end phosphate (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></bold>). Logically, the 5′ FAM T<sub>1</sub>-labeled reporter should not produce fluorescence if ExoIII cuts at the 5′ end phosphodiester bond. But fluorescence monitoring assays showed that ExoIII (5 U/µl) digested over 90% of 5′ FAM T<sub>1</sub>-labeled FQ reporter (5 µM) in the first minute (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref></bold>), indicating a speed of 2.7×10<sup>13</sup> (45 pmol) phosphodiester bonds per minute (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref></bold>); APE1 and LbCas12a also exhibited a stronger fluorescence intensity compared to their deactivated counterparts (D-APE1 and D-LbCas12a) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref></bold>). Treated with ExoIII, fluorescence of the FQ reporter was generated rapidly even before incubating at 37°C <bold>(Supplementary video S2)</bold>. The evidence implied that ExoIII cleaved the FQ reporter not at 5′ end phosphodiesters.</p>
<p>Subsequently, we removed the 3′ end phosphodiesters by labeling the BHQ1 at the reporter’s 3′ end thymine (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref></bold>). The fluorescence monitoring assay showed that the ExoIII-treated FQ reporter (5 µM) released a significant fluorescence signal compared to other nucleases. Slower than the previous two FQ reproters, it cleaved over 90% of the base-labeled FQ reporter in 10 min (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref></bold>), demonstrating that the commercial ExoIII (5 U/µl) digested about 2.7×10<sup>12</sup> (4.5 pmol) phosphodiester bonds or nucleotides of ssDNA in the FQ reporter (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref></bold>). Compared with the massive fluorescence induced by ExoIII, the modifications on thymine may impede the binding and cleaving of LbCas12a-crRNA complex on the ssDNA substrate, leading to less fluorescence generated (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref></bold>). Combining all the results of three types of FQ reporters, we demonstrated ExoIII might harbor a powerful ssDNase activity.</p>

<title>Reaction conditions for the ssDNase activity of ExoIII</title>
<p>To explore if this enzymatic action of ExoIII requires Mg<sup>2+</sup>, we added EDTA to the enzymatic reaction. The endpoint fluorescence intensity of the FQ reporter showed that the addition of EDTA completely inhibited the generation of fluorescence compared with the reaction without EDTA (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>).

These EDTA-added experiments demonstrated that Mg<sup>2+</sup> was required for the ssDNase activity of ExoIII. Subsequently, we added different concentrations of ExoIII (0, 0.025, 0.125, 0.250, 0.500, and 1.250 µM) to the ssDNA probe (0.5 µM).

<p>Furthermore, to investigate the degradation degree of ssDNA caused by ExoIII in the detection kits, we tested a 5′ FAM-labeled ssDNA probe in these detection reactions.

<p>The different degrees of degradation between these two kinds of commercial kits might be caused by different amounts of T4 gp32 added, as T4 gp32 is a ssD-NA-binding protein protecting the ssDNA from nuclease degradation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>.

With the weakened ssDNase activity demonstrated in our study, K121A can replace the wild type to be applied in the AP-endonuclease-based commercial kits with minimized effects of ssDNase activity. By comparing the digested products generated by S217A, R216A, K176A, R170A, Q112A, and wild type, we found that R170A produced a larger fragment than other mutants and wild type (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref></bold>). It suggested that mutation of R170A affected the efficiency of ExoIII digestion on ssDNA. Based on the conservation indicator of all residues of ExoIII illustrated (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://consurfdb.tau.ac.il/index.php">https://consurfdb.tau.ac.il/index.php</ext-link>), these identified residues (W212, F213, D214, N153, Y109, K121, D151 and R170) were highly conserved among 300 homolog proteins (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6G</xref></bold>).

To investigate if the mutation of R170A also affects the AP-endonuclease and exonuclease activities of ExoIII on dsDNA, we designed specific dsDNA substrates for the two types of activities. On the AP-endonuclease substrate, the mutation of R170 took a much longer time (10 min) to digest compared to the wild type (1 min) <bold>(Supplementary Figure S3A and S3B)</bold>, suggesting the mutation seriously impaired the efficiency of AP-endonuclease activity.

On the exonuclease substrate, the mutant of R170A produced a much larger product than the wild type <bold>(Supplementary Figure S3D and S3E)</bold>. It might be because R170A retained the intact exonuclease activity on dsDNA but not on ssDNA, leading to a larger ssDNA intermediate compared to the wild type. The exonuclease activities of ExoIII on dsDNA and ssDNA involved in the digestion are described in <bold>Supplementary Figure S3F</bold>. Altogether, we deemed that R170 in the α<sub>M</sub> helix structure may help recognize or stabilize the AP site on dsDNA or ssDNA substrate for further docking into the active site, and the mutation of R170 affects the AP-endonuclease and ssDNase activities of ExoIII but still retains its dsDNA exonuclease activity.</p>

<title>The proposed enzymatic action model of ExoIII on ssDNA</title>
<p>Since the ssDNase activity probably shares the same active center with its dsDNA-targeted activity, an appropriate ssDNA substrate for ExoIII should possess a ‘V’-shaped micro-structure, similar to the ssDNA conformation in the B-formed dsDNA (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref></bold>). According to the ExoIII-ssDNA structure and the previously reported functions of the key residues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, four primary functional units for enzymatic actions of ExoIII are defined: capturing unit (R170, at 3′ side of the cleavage site and three nucleotides away from it), phosphate-stabilizing unit (Y109, K121, and N153, at 5′ side of cleavage site and three nucleotides away from it), sugar ring-stacking unit (W212, F213, and D214) and phosphodiester-cleaving unit (D151), all of which also represent four sequential steps in the digestion process (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref></bold>). Unit 1(R170), located at the surface of ExoIII and functioning at the 3′ side of the cleavage site, is most likely the first contact with the substrate, the involvement of which naturally drives the endonuclease action on ssDNA. In the endonuclease model, interactions of unit 1 and unit 2 with ssDNA substrates can help convert the ∼6 nucleotides at 3′ end of ssDNA to form a ‘V’ shape intermediate, suitable for the following actions of unit 3 and unit 4. Certain ssDNA substrates, such as the consecutive identical bases (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), might have difficulty in converting to the necessary conformation, resulting in the inhibition on digestion of ExoIII; Meanwhile, the substrates with “V” conformation internally possibly attract units 2 and 3 of ExoIII binding to the site and triggering the endonucleolytic digestion, which explains the products of endonuclease activity in the mass spectrometry analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). In the exonuclease model, some types of ssDNA (possibly short ssDNA or others with suitable micro-structure) might directly enter the active center without contacting unit 1 and sequentially processed by units 2, 3, and 4 (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref></bold>).</p>

In the model of endonuclease, Unit 1(R170) located at the surface of ExoIII is most likely the first contact with the substrate, and binding at the 3′ side of the cleavage site naturally drives the endonucleolytic cleavage on ssDNA.

The short ssDNA (∼3 nt) or others with suitable microstructure would directly enters into the active center and be processed by units 2, 3, and 4 into mononucleotides (exonuclease activity). Most ssDNA substrates might be digested by both endonuclease and exonuclease activity of ExoIII.</p></caption>

<p>Conbining with the structure analysis and the digestion results of <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, we proposed the enzymatic actions of ExoIII digestion on ssDNA: the ssDNA substrate tends to be captured by the outer-layered unit 1, then stabilized by the inter-layered units 2 and 3, finally cleaved by unit 4 of ExoIII, producing short fragments of ssDNA (endonuclease activity). The short ssDNA (∼3 nt) or others with suitable micro-structure might directly enter into the active center and be processed by unit 2, unit 3, and unit 4 into nucleotides (exonuclease activity) (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref></bold>). The model reflects a distributive catalyzation of ExoIII on ssDNA. In summary, ssDNA substrate is likely to undergo fragmentation by the endonuclease activity of ExoIII, and the resulting small fragments is subsequently digested by the exonuclease activity of ExoIII into mononucleatides.Without the base-pairing of complementary strands, the conformation of ssDNA is easily affected by ion concentration, interacted protein, temperature, and other factors in the solution. All these elements together forge the specific catalytic pattern of ExoIII on ssDNA.</p>

<title>ExoIII digested the dsDNA structures containing 3′ end ssDNA</title>
<p>To explore the biological significance of the ssDNase activity of ExoIII, we examined several dsDNA substrates containing ssDNA (dsDNA with 3′ ssDNA flap, dsDNA with 3′ protruding ssDNA tail, bubble and fork-shaped dsDNA) that might occur in the biological process.

<p>We next tested its ability to cleave the dsDNA substrates with a protruding ssDNA (≥ 4 nt) at the 3′ end, previously reported as resistant to ExoIII digestion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Our results on the dsDNA with a 10-base protruding structure indicated that ExoIII could rapidly digest the dsDNA with a 3′ end 10-base ssDNA tail <bold>(Supplementary Figure S4A and S4B)</bold>. But for the dsDNA with 4-base protruding ssDNA at the 3′ end, the digestion occurred at 10 min, suggesting the efficiency of digestion significantly decreased to about one-tenth of the 10-base protruding structure <bold>(Supplementary Figure S4C and S4D)</bold>. Different from the previous study <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, our results demonstrated that ExoIII could catalyze dsDNA structure with 3′ end protruding bases (≥ 4 nt). Furthermore, we found when the 3′ end 4-base protruding ssDNA was replaced with four adenylates, the dsDNA showed no digestion over 10 min <bold>(Supplementary Figure S4E and S4F)</bold>, suggesting the 3′ A<sub>4</sub>-protruding ssDNA was resistant to the ssDNase activity of ExoIII and protected the dsDNA duplex from ExoIII digestion. Therefore, dsDNA with 3′ A<sub>4</sub>-protruding ssDNA can be used for related enzymatic research of ExoIII or as the aptamer of biosensors, as the previous typical substrate may not protect itself from being cleaved by the ssDNase activity and the following exonuclease of ExoIII. Based on the structural analysis that indicated the α<sub>M</sub> helix was exactly 4∼5 nt apart from the AP site (located in the active center) <bold>(Supplementary Figure S4G and S4H)</bold>, we speculated that the lower efficiency of digestion on the 4-base protruding dsDNA might be because the topology of dsDNA-ssDNA junction site was not well recognized by α<sub>M</sub> helix, which was unfavourable for the ssDNA further docking into the active center.</p>
<p>The fork structure was slightly digested by ExoIII in the first minute and completely degraded over 10 min <bold>(Supplementary Figure S5A)</bold>. To test if the ssDNA binding protein affects the digestion of ExoIII, the fork structure was incubated with T4 gp32 for 10 min before adding ExoIII. The result indicated that 1 μl T4 gp32 (10 mg/mL) protected over 40% of the substrate from digestion, significantly higher than 0.2 μl (∼10%) <bold>(Supplementary Figure S5A)</bold>. This protection effect suggested that ExoIII started the digestion of the structure from the 3′ end ssDNA, and the binding of T4 gp32 to the 3′ end ssDNA prevented the dsDNA from being digested <bold>(Supplementary Figure S5B)</bold>. The analysis on gray intensity showed ExoIII was able to digest the fork dsDNA structure and the single binding protein delayed the process by binding to the ssDNA part <bold>(Supplementary Figure S5C and S5D)</bold>. The bubble structure showed no apparent digestion over time <bold>(Supplementary Figure S5E and 5F)</bold>. Collectively, these results indicated ExoIII may function in more types of dsDNA stuctures with 3′ ssDNA in DNA-repair ormetabolism processes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Defining the ssDNase activity of ExoIII is crucial for understanding its biological roles and guiding the current diagnostic applications. In this study, we adopted the sensitive ssDNase indicator FQ reporters, a range of short ssDNA substrates (∼20 nt), and mass spectrometry analysis for prudent confirmation and systematic characterization of the ssDNase activity of ExoIII. Our results uncovered that ExoIII possessed highly efficient 3′→5′ exonuclease and endonuclease activities on ssDNA, with the cleavage site at the 5′ side bond of the phosphodiester. As the discovery may remold the roles of ExoIII in its industrialized application and biological understanding in the DNA repair process, we assessed its effects by testing the popular commercialized kits containing ExoIII and investigated its possible biological functions through the dsDNA structures containing ssDNA that might occur <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our results showed that ExoIII digested ssDNA probes or primer in the isothermal amplification kit and dsDNA structures containing 3′-end ssDNA. To minimize the effects of ExoIII′ ssDNase activity, we advise: a) adding more single-strand DNA binding protein T4 gp32 protects the primer or ssDNA probe from degradation of ExoIII in the isothermal amplification kits; b) adding four or more consecutive adenylates at the 3′-end of the dsDNA structure or ssDNA helps inhibit the degradation of ExoIII; c) with limited ssDNase activity, K121A and R170A mutants can replace the wild type and be applied in the AP-endonuclease and exnuclease based diagnostics, respectively; d) raise the reaction temperature to ≥ 42℃, as the ssDNase activity of ExoIII was found highly suppressed in the temperature range. Considering the ssDNase activity of ExoIII shares a same active center with its dsDNA-targeted activity, it seems challenging to separately examine its biological roles <italic>in vivo</italic> by point mutation. But digesting the dsDNA with 3′ flap ssDNA or 3′ protruding ssDNA tail <italic>in vitro</italic> indicated the ssDNase activity of ExoIII may confer it a 3′ flap-cleaving ability, suggesting it might be competent to deal with more types of DNA lesions. And during which, the ssD-NA-binding proteins may paly a regulatary role in ExoIII-related ssDNA degradation <italic>in vivo</italic>. As a multi-functional nuclease, the enzymatic activities of ExoIII identified so far is summarized in <bold>Supplementary Table S3</bold>.</p>
<p>The endonuclease activity of ExoIII on ssDNA was confirmed for the first time by mass spectrometry analysis on Probe 1 and Probe 2. It might explain the digested products of ExoIII and LbCas12a only accounted for 50%∼80% of their deactivated counterparts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3G</xref>, and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3K</xref>). The lost 20∼50% fluorescence is possibly caused by ExoIII or LbCas12a cleaving the substrates and forming products with different lengths, which traveled in the gel at different speeds, finally leading to being dispersed or invisible under UV light. Combining these results with the analysis of the constructed crystal structure of ExoIII-ssDNA, we proposed a theoretical model for understanding the underlying mechanism of endonuclease and exonuclease actions of ExoIII on ssDNA. Steven A. Benner and his coworkers observed that ExoIII could bypass two consecutive nucleotides with phosphorothioate modification and continued deleting the ssDNA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, which might be well-explained by endonuclease activity in the model. In addition, its human homolog APE1 has been reported to have a strong binding affinity to the G-rich oligo (5′-AGGGCGGTGTGGGAAGAGGGAAGAGGGGGAGG-3′, a 32-nt sequence of the oncogene KRAS promoter) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Thus, ExoIII also possibly bound to the G-rich region of Probe 2 and activated its endonuclease activity, producing more middle fragments than the other two ssDNA probes, as indicated in mass spectrometry analysis.</p>
<p>Another interesting finding is that the consecutive identical bases of ssDNA stalled the digestion of ExoIII. In the early 1960s, the inactivity of ExoIII on ssDNA was coined by Kornberg’s laboratory based on an ssDNA oligo of five consecutive Ts (5′ pTpTpTpTpT 3′) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> (which might not be sufficiently prudent to conclude that ExoIII is inactive on all ssDNA). In 2007, Steven A. Benner and his coworkers pointed out for the first time that ExoIII could degrade ssDNA by incubating with two long ssDNA oligos (51 nt) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. An approximate 43-mer band occurred as the superior product when the concentration of ExoIII decreased, but the reason remains unclear. Here, based on our conclusion, the 43-mer intermediate exactly corresponds to the product generated when ExoIII stalled its digestion ahead of the consecutive GGG (Position 40-42) of the ssDNA substrate in 3′→5′ direction (5′-GCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGACGAGCGTACTTTAGTGA<bold>GGG</bold>TTAATT CGC-3′). In addition, adding 10 T bases to an ssDNA at the 3′ end has been indicated to suppress ExoIII digestion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>; a <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> homolog of ExoIII, CCR4 (an ssDNA exonuclease), has also been reported to have a slower degradation on the substrate with 3′ end five consecutive As and was unable to cleave when the ssDNA contained ten consecutive As within <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Based on our proposed model, the sequence feature of consecutive identical bases in ssDNA may create an unfavorable local microstructure that can impede ExoIII digestion.</p>
<p>Our work uncovers the long-underestimated ssDNase activity of ExoIII, dissects the underlying enzymatic behaviors of ExoIII on ssDNA and advances the mechanism understanding of its biological roles in DNA repair. Future investigations might be conducted: 1) crystal structure of the ExoIII-ssDNA complex (endonuclease and exonuclease model); 2) potential biological roles of the ssDNase activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. A better understanding on the underlying enzymatic actions of this multifunctional enzyme will facilitate efficient and reliable applications of ExoIII-based nucleic acid diagnostics.</p>

<p>After 5 μM fluorophore-labeled ssDNA oligo was incubated with 5 U/μl ExoIII at 37°C for 0.5 h, the enzymatic reaction was stopped by heating at 95°C for 5min. The reaction product was then analyzed by mass spectrometry. The reaction containing only ssDNA oligo or ExoIII was prepared as the control. Before incubation at 37°C, the ssDNA oligos were pre-incubated at 95°C for 5 min and cooled down in the ice. Hippo Biotechnology Co., Ltd. performed the mass spectrometry (Thermo LTQ-XL, Massachusetts, USA) analysis on the samples (Huzhou, Zhejiang, China). The detection range of molecular weight in mass spectrometry is 500∼20000 Da. Electron Spray Ionization (ESI) was used to ionize the molecules.</p>

<title>Molecular docking</title>
<p>Molecular docking of ExoIII (PDB code: 1AKO) and ssDNA (NDB ID: 1S40) was performed in a webserver (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wenmr.science.uu.nl/haddock2.4/">https://wenmr.science.uu.nl/haddock2.4/</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Before the docking, we performed structure alignment or superimposing on ExoIII and APE1-dsDNA (PDB ID: 1DE8 and NDB ID: 5WN5) complex through TM-align (Version 20190822) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zhanggroup.org/TM-align/">https://zhanggroup.org/TM-align/</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. We extracted the structure of the ExoIII-ssDNA complex by PyMOL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> <bold>(Supplementary Figure S6)</bold>. Residues of ExoIII located within 5 Å of the ssDNA and the last four nucleotides at the 3′ end of the ssDNA were selected to input in the HADDOCK website for molecular docking. Docking parameters were set by default. The output structure of ExoIII-ssDNA with the highest score was visualized by PyMOL for further analysis.</p>

<title>Evaluation of the ExoIII′ ssDNase activity in the commercial diagnostic kits</title>
<p>To examine the effects of ExoIII′ ssDNase activity on the commercial isothermal amplification detection kit containing ExoIII, we tested four kits including RPA (recombinase polymerase amplification) with ExoIII (TwistAmp® exo) or without ExoIII (TwistAmp® Basic) (Abbott, Illinois, US), MIRA (Multienzyme Isothermal Rapid Amplification) with (Fluorescence type) or without ExoIII (Basic type) (Amplification Future company, Weifang, Shandong Province, China) by FQ reporter and 5′-FAM-labeled ssDNA probe. All the reagents were added to the lyophilized powder following the usage instructions. Then 5 μl ssDNA FQ reporter or probe (10 μM) was added to the reaction mix. The tubes containing the reaction mixture were incubated in Mx3500P (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) at 37°C for 30 min to monitor the fluorescence generated. The endpoint fluorescence was visualized under an LED blue light transilluminator (THBC-470) (TUOHE ELECTROMECHANICAL TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD, Shanghai, China).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors show compelling data indicating that ExoIII has significant ssDNA nuclease activity that is posited to interfere with biosensor assays. This does not come as a surprise as other published works have indeed shown the same, but in this work, the authors provide a deeper analysis of this underestimated activity.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors used a variety of assays to examine the ssDNA nuclease activity of ExoIII and its origin. Fluorescence-based assays and native gel electrophoresis, combined with MS analysis clearly indicate that both commercial and laboratory purified ExoIII contain ssDNA nuclease activity. Mutational analysis identifies the residues responsible for this activity. Of note is the observation in this submitted work that the sites of ssDNA and dsDNA exonuclease activity overlap, suggesting that it may be difficult to identify mutations that affect one activity but not the other. In this regard, it is of interest the observation by the authors that the ssDNA nuclease activity depends on the sequence composition of the ssDNA, and this may be used as a strategy to suppress this activity when necessary. For example, the authors point out that a 3′ A4-protruding ssDNA could be employed in ExoIII-based assays due to its resistance to digestion. However, this remains an interesting suggestion that the authors do not test, but that would have strengthened their conclusion.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors provide a wealth of experimental data showing that E. coli ExoIII has ssDNA nuclease activities, both exo- and endo-, however this work falls short in showing that indeed this activity practically interferes with ExoIII-driven biosensor assays, as suggested by the authors. Furthermore, it is not clear what new information is gained compared to the one already gathered in previously published works (e.g. references 20 and 21). Also, the authors show that ssDNA nuclease activity has sequence dependence, but in the context of the observation that this activity is driven by the same site as dsDNA Exo, how does this differ from similar sequence effects observed for the dsDNA Exo? (e.g. see Linxweiler, W. and Horz, W. (1982). Nucl. Acids Res. 10, 4845-4859).</p>
<p>Because of the claim that the underestimated ssDNA nuclease activity can interfere with commercially available assays, it would have been appropriate to test this. The authors only show that ssDNA activity can be identified in commercial ExoIII-based kits, but they do not assess how this affects the efficiency of a full reaction of the kit. This could have been achieved by exploiting the observed ssDNA sequence dependence of the nuclease activity. In this regard, the work cited in Ref. 20 showed that indeed ExoIII has ssDNA nuclease activity at concentrations as low as 50-fold less than what test in this work. Ref 20 also tested the effect of the ssDNA nuclease activity in Targeted Recycle Assays, rather than just testing for its presence in a kit.</p>
<p>Because of the implication that the presence of ssDNA exonuclease activity may have in reactions that are supposed to only use ExoIII dsDNA exonuclease, it is surprising that in this submitted work no direct comparison of these two activities is done. Please provide an experimental determination of how different the specific activities for ssDNA and dsDNA are.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper describes some experiments addressing 3' exonuclease and 3' trimming activity of bacterial exonuclease III. The quantitative activity is in fact very low, despite claims to the contrary. The work is of low interest with regard to biology, but possibly of use for methods development. Thus the paper seems better suited to a methods forum.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Technical approaches.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The purity of the recombinant proteins is critical, but no information on that is provided. The minimum would be silver-stained SDS-PAGE gels, with some samples overloaded in order to detect contaminants.</p>
<p>Lines 74-76: What is the evidence that BER in E. coli generates multinucleotide repair patches in vivo? In principle, there is no need for the nick to be widened to a gap, as DNA Pol I acts efficiently from a nick. And what would control the extent of the 3' excision?</p>
<p>Figure 1: The substrates all report only the first phosphodiester cleavage near the 3' end, which is quite a limitation. Do the reported values reflect only the single phosphodiester cleavage? Including the several other nucleotides likely inflates that activity value. And how much is a unit of activity in terms of actual protein concentration? Without that, it's hard to compare the observed activities to the many published studies. As best I know, Exo III was already known to remove a single-nucleotide 3'-overhang, albeit more slowly than the digestion of a duplex, but not zero! We need to be able to calculate an actual specific activity: pmol/min per µg of protein.</p>
<p>Figures 2 &amp; 3: These address the possible issue of 1-nt excision noted above. However, the question of efficiency is still not addressed in the absence of a more quantitative approach, not just &quot;units&quot; from the supplier's label. Moreover, it is quite common that commercial enzyme preparations contain a lot of inactive material.</p>
<p>Figure 4D: This gets to the quantitative point. In this panel, we see that around 0.5 pmol/min of product is produced by 0.025 µmol = 25,000 pmol of the enzyme. That is certainly not very efficient, compared to the digestion of dsDNA or cleavage of an abasic site. It's hard to see that as significant.</p>
<p>Line 459 and elsewhere: as noted above, the activity is not &quot;highly efficient&quot;. I would say that it is not efficient at all.</p>

<p>Overall:</p>
<p>ExoIII has been described and commercialized as a dsDNA-specific nuclease. Several lines of evidence, albeit incomplete, have indicated this may not be entirely true. Therefore, Wang et al comprehensively characterize the endonuclease and exonuclease enzymatic activities of ExoIII on ssDNA. A strength of the manuscript is the testing of popular kits that utilize ExoIII and coming up with and testing practical solutions (e.g. the addition of SSB proteins ExoIII variants such as K121A and varied assay conditions).</p>
<p>Comments:</p>
<p>(1) The footprint of ExoIII on DNA is expected to be quite a bit larger than 5-nt, see structure in manuscript reference #5. Therefore, the substrate design in Figure 1A seems inappropriate for studying the enzymatic activity and it seems likely that ExoIII would be interacting with the FAM and/or BHQ1 ends as well as the DNA. Could this cause quenching? Would this represent real ssDNA activity? Is this figure/data necessary for the manuscript?</p>
<p>(2) Based on the descriptions in the text, it seems there is activity with some of the other nucleases in 1C, 1F, and 1I other than ExoIII and Cas12a. Can this be plotted on a scale that allows the reader to see them relative to one other?</p>
<p>(3) The sequence alignment in Figure 2N and the corresponding text indicates a region of ExoIII lacking in APE1 that may be responsible for their differences in substrate specificity in regards to ssDNA. Does the mutational analysis support this hypothesis?</p>
