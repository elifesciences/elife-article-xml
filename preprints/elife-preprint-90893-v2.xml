<title>Abstract</title><p>Neurogenesis occurs in the adult brain in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, an area that contains neurons which are vulnerable to insults and injury, such as severe seizures. Previous studies showed that increasing adult neurogenesis reduced neuronal damage after these seizures. Because the damage typically is followed by chronic life-long seizures (epilepsy), we asked if increasing adult neurogenesis would prevent epilepsy. Adult neurogenesis was selectively increased by deleting the pro-apoptotic gene <italic>Bax</italic> from Nestin-expressing progenitors. Tamoxifen was administered at 6 weeks of age to conditionally delete <italic>Bax</italic> in Nestin-CreER<sup>T2</sup><italic>Bax</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice. Six weeks after tamoxifen administration, severe seizures (status epilepticus; SE) were induced by injection of the convulsant pilocarpine. After mice developed epilepsy, seizure frequency was quantified for 3 weeks. Mice with increased adult neurogenesis exhibited fewer chronic seizures. Postictal depression was reduced also. These results were primarily in female mice, possibly because they were the more affected by <italic>Bax</italic> deletion than males, consistent with sex differences in <italic>Bax</italic>. The female mice with enhanced adult neurogenesis also showed less neuronal loss of hilar mossy cells and hilar somatostatin-expressing neurons than wild type females or males, which is notable because these two hilar cell types are implicated in epileptogenesis. The results suggest that selective <italic>Bax</italic> deletion to increase adult neurogenesis can reduce experimental epilepsy, and the effect shows a striking sex difference. The results are surprising in light of past studies showing that suppressing adult-born neurons can also reduce chronic seizures.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It has been shown that neurogenesis occurs in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) during adult life of mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c128">Taupin 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Gage et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Altman 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Kempermann 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Kazanis 2013</xref>). It is important to note that this idea was challenged recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Paredes et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">Sorrells et al. 2018</xref>) but afterwards more studies provided support for the original idea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Boldrini et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Kempermann et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c127">Tartt et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Moreno-Jimenez et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">Tobin et al. 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>In the DG, adult-born neurons are born in the subgranular zone (SGZ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Altman and Das 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Kaplan and Hinds 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Altman 2011</xref>). Upon maturation, newborn neurons migrate to the granule cell layer (GCL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Cameron et al. 1993</xref>), develop almost exclusively into GCs, and integrate into the DG circuitry like other GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Ramirez-Amaya et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Kempermann et al. 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Prior studies suggest that the immature adult-born GCs can inhibit the other GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Ash et al. 2023</xref>) especially when they are up to 6 weeks-old (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Drew et al. 2016</xref>). By inhibition of the GC population, young adult-born GCs could support DG functions that require GCs to restrict action potential (AP) discharge, such as pattern separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Sahay et al. 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Sahay et al. 2011b</xref>). Indeed suppressing adult neurogenesis in mice appears to weaken pattern separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Clelland et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Nakashiba et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Niibori et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">Tronel et al. 2012</xref>) and increasing adult neurogenesis improves it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Sahay et al. 2011a</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, inhibition of the GC population by young adult-born GCs could limit excessive excitation from glutamatergic input and protect the cells in the DG hilus and hippocampus that are vulnerable to excitotoxicity. Thus, strong excitation of GCs can cause excitotoxicity of hilar neurons, area CA1 pyramidal cells, and area CA3 pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Scharfman and Schwartzkroin 1990b</xref>; a; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Sloviter 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Scharfman 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Sloviter et al. 2003</xref>). Indeed, increasing adult-born neurons protects hilar neurons, and CA3 from neuronal loss 3 days after severe seizures are induced by the convulsant pilocarpine(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Jain et al. 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>The seizures induced by kainic acid or pilocarpine are severe, continuous, and last several hours, a condition called <italic>status epilepticus</italic> (SE). The neuronal injury in hippocampus after SE has been suggested to be important because it is typically followed by chronic seizures (epilepsy) in rodents and humans, and has been suggested to cause the epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Falconer et al. 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Sloviter 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Cavalheiro et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Herman 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Mathern et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Dudek and Staley 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Dingledine et al. 2014</xref>). Chronic seizures involve the temporal lobe, so the type of epilepsy is called temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). In the current study we asked if increasing adult neurogenesis can protect from chronic seizures in an animal model of TLE. We used a very common method to induce a TLE-like syndrome, which involves injection of the muscarinic cholinergic agonist pilocarpine at a dose that elicits SE. Several weeks later, spontaneous intermittent seizures begin and continue for the lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Scorza et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Botterill et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Levesque et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c132">Whitebirch et al. 2022</xref>). Seizure frequency, duration, and severity were measured by continuous video-EEG with 4 electrodes to monitor the hippocampus and cortex bilaterally.</p>
<p>It is known that SE increases adult neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Parent and Kron 2012</xref>). SE triggers a proliferation of progenitors in the week after SE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Parent et al. 1997</xref>). Although many GCs that are born in the days after SE die in subsequent weeks by apoptosis, some survive. Young neurons that arise after SE and migrate into the GCL may suppress seizures by supporting inhibition of GCs because adult-born GCs in the normal brain inhibit GCs when they are young (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Drew et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Ash et al. 2023</xref>). In addition, after SE, the newborn GCs in the GCL can exhibit low excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Jakubs et al. 2006</xref>). However, some neurons born after SE mismigrate to ectopic locations such as the hilus (hilar ectopic GCs), where they can contribute to recurrent excitatory circuits that promote seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Scharfman et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Parent and Lowenstein 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Scharfman 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Scharfman and Hen 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Parent and Murphy 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Scharfman and McCloskey 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c134">Zhan et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Myers et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Cho et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Althaus et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c135">Zhou et al. 2019</xref>). Since the hilar ectopic GCs are potential contributors to epileptogenesis, we also studied whether enhancing adult neurogenesis would alter the number of hilar ectopic GCs.</p>
<p>Mossy cells are a major subset of glutamatergic hilar neurons which are vulnerable to excitotoxicity after SE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Scharfman 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Sloviter et al. 2003</xref>). During SE, mossy cells may contribute to the activity that ultimately leads to widespread neuronal loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Botterill et al., 2019</xref>). However, surviving mossy cells can be beneficial after SE because they inhibit spontaneous chronic seizures in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Bui et al. 2018</xref>). Another large subset of vulnerable hilar neurons co-express GABA and somatostatin (SOM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">Sloviter 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">de Lanerolle et al. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Freund et al. 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">Sun et al. 2007</xref>) and correspond to so-called HIPP cells (neurons with <bold><italic><underline>hi</underline></italic></bold>lar cell bodies and axons that project to the terminal zone of the <bold><italic><underline>p</underline></italic></bold>erforant <bold><italic><underline>p</underline></italic></bold>ath; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Han et al. 1993</xref>)). HIPP cells are important because they normally inhibit GCs and have the potential to prevent seizures. Therefore, we studied mossy cells and SOM cells in the current study.</p>
<p>The results showed that increasing adult neurogenesis protects mossy cells and hilar SOM cells and reduces chronic seizures. Remarkably, the preservation of hilar mossy cells and SOM cells, and the reduction in chronic seizures, was found in females only. The sex difference may have been due to a greater ability to increase adult neurogenesis in females than males, consistent with sex differences in <italic>Bax</italic>- and caspase-dependent cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Forger et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Siegel and McCullough 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The results are surprising because prior studies that suppressed neurogenesis reduces chronic seizures. Therefore, taken together with the results presented here, both increasing and suppressing adult-born neurons appear to reduce chronic seizures. How could this be? Past studies suggested that suppressing adult-born neurons led to a reduction in chronic seizures because there were fewer hilar ectopic granule cells. In the current study, increasing adult-born neurons may have reduced chronic seizures for another reason.Regardless, the present data suggest a novel and surprising series of findings which, taken together with past studies, suggest that adult-neurogenesis can be targeted in multiple ways to reduce chronic seizures in epilepsy.</p>

<p>The first experiment addressed the effect of increasing adult neurogenesis on pilocarpine-induced SE in Nestin-CreER<sup>T2</sup><italic>Bax<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (called “Cre+”, below). To produce Nestin-CreER<sup>T2</sup><italic>Bax<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice, hemizygous Nestin-CreER<sup>T2</sup> mice were bred with homozygous <italic>Bax<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice. Littermates of Cre+ mice that lacked Cre (called “Cre-”, below) were also treated with tamoxifen and were controls.</p>
<p><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A1</xref> shows the experimental timeline. Tamoxifen was injected s.c. once per day for 5 days to delete <italic>Bax</italic> from Nestin-expressing progenitors. After 6 weeks, a time sufficient for a substantial increase in adult-born neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Drew et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Jain et al., 2019</xref>), pilocarpine was injected s.c. to induce SE.</p>

<label>B.</label><title>Effects of increasing adult neurogenesis on SE</title>
<p>The latency to the first seizure after pilocarpine injection was measured for all mice (with and without EEG electrodes; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>) or just those that had EEG electrodes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). When mice with and without electrodes were pooled, the latency to the onset of first seizure was similar in both genotypes (Cre-: 47.2 ± 4.8 min, n=27; Cre+: 45.3 ± 3.9 min, n=28; Student’s t-test, t(53)=0.3, p=0.761; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D1</xref>).</p>
<p>The total number of seizures was quantified until 2 hr after pilocarpine injection because at that time diazepam was administered to decrease the severity SE. The total number of seizures were similar in both genotypes (Cre-: 3.0 ± 0.2 seizures; Cre+: 2.8 ± 0.1 seizures; Student’s t-test, t(54)=0.9, p=0.377; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D2</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, when sexes were separated, Cre+ females had a shorter latency to the first seizure than all other groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D3</xref>). Thus, a two-way ANOVA with genotype (Cre- and Cre+) and sex (female and male) as main factors showed a main effect of sex (F(1,51)=4.31; p=0.043) with Cre+ females exhibiting a shorter latency compared to Cre+ males (Cre+ females, 34.3 ± 3.4 min, n=15; Cre+ males, 57.9 ± 5.6 min, n=13; Bonferroni’s test, p=0.026) but not other groups (Cre- female, 46.7 ± 9.3 min, n=12; Cre- males, 47.4 ± 4.4 min, n=15; Bonferroni’s tests, all p &gt; 0.344; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D3</xref>). There was no effect of genotype (F(1,49)=0.75; p=0.305) or sex (F(1,49)=0.62; p=0.436) on the total number of seizures by two-way ANOVA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D4</xref>).</p>
<p>When adult neurogenesis was suppressed by thymidine kinase activation in GFAP-expressing progenitors, the severity of the first seizure was worse, meaning it was often convulsive rather than non-convulsive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Iyengar et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore we examined the severity of the first seizure. These analyses were conducted only with mice implanted with electrodes because only with the EEG can one determine if a seizure is non-convulsive. A non-convulsive seizure was defined as an EEG seizure without movement. When sexes were pooled, the proportion of mice with a non-convulsive first seizure was not different (Cre-: 18.2%, 2/11 mice; Cre+: 28.6%, 4/14 mice Chi-square test, p&gt;0.999; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E1</xref>). However, when sexes were separated, the first seizure was non-convulsive in 60% of Cre+ females (3/5 mice) whereas only 25% of Cre- females had a first seizure that was nonconvulsive (1/4 mice), 14% of Cre- males (1/7 mice), and 11% of Cre+ males (1/9 mice; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E3</xref>). Although the percentages suggest differences, i.e., Cre+ females were protected from an initial severe seizure, the differences were not significantly different (Fisher’s exact test, p=0.166; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E3</xref>).</p>
<p>The duration of SE was shorter in Cre+ mice compared to Cre- mice (Cre-: 280.5 ± 14.6 min, n=11; Cre+: 211.4 ± 17.2 min, n=14; Student’s t-test, t(23)=0.30, p=0.007; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E2</xref>). When sexes were separated, effects of genotype were modest. A two-way ANOVA showed that the duration of SE was significantly affected by genotype (F(1,21)=6.7; p=0.017) but not sex (F(1,21)=5.04; p=0.487). Cre+ males showed a trend for a shorter SE duration compared to Cre- males (Cre- males: 280.1 ± 22.8 min, n=7; Cre+ males: 199.1 ± 24.1 min, n=9; Bonferroni’s test, p=0.078; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E4</xref>). Cre+ females had a mean SE duration that was shorter than Cre- females, but it was not a significant difference (Cre- females: 281.0 ± 11.8 min, n=4; Cre+ females: 233.4 ± 20.5 min, n=5; Bonferroni’s test, p=0.485; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E4</xref>). More females would have been useful, but the incidence of SE in females was only 42.8% if they were implanted with EEG electrodes (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 – Supplemental figure 2</xref>). In contrast, the incidence of SE in the unimplanted females was 100%, a significant difference by Fisher’s exact test (p &lt; 0.001; <xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1-Supplemental figure 2</xref>). In males the incidence of SE was also significantly different in implanted and unimplanted mice (implanted males, 70.4%; unimplanted males, 100%; Fisher’s exact test, p=0.016, <xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1-Supplemental figure 2</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2a3">
<label>D.</label><title>Power</title>
<p>We also investigated power during SE (<xref rid="fig1s3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1-Supplemental figure 3</xref>). The baseline was measured, and then power was assessed for 5 hrs, at which time SE had ended. Power was assessed in 20 min consecutive bins. Females were used in this analysis (Cre- and Cre+). Two-way RMANOVA with genotype and time as main factors showed no effect of genotype for any frequency range: delta (1-4 Hz, F(1,7)=1.61; p=0.245); theta (4-8 Hz, F(1,7)=1.75; p=0.227); beta (8-30 Hz, F(1,7)=1.65; p=0.240); low gamma (80 Hz, F(1,7)=0.29; p=0.174); high gamma (80-100 Hz, F(1,7)=0.17; p=0.689). There was a significant effect of time for all bands (delta, p=0.003; theta, p=0.002, beta, low gamma and high gamma, &lt;0.001), which is consistent with the declining power in SE with time.</p>
<p>In summary, Cre+ mice did not show extensive differences in SE except for SE duration, which was shorter.</p>

<p>Data were then segregated based on sex and a two-way ANOVA was conducted with genotype and sex as main factors. There was a main effect of genotype (F(1,32)=4.26; p=0.047) and sex (F(1,32)=12.46; p=0.001) on the total number of chronic seizures and a significant interaction between sex and genotype (F(1,32)=8.54; p=0.006). Bonferroni’s post-hoc tests showed that Cre+ females had ∼half the chronic seizures of Cre- females (Cre- female: 44.6 ± 10.2 seizures, n=7; Cre+ female: 22.6 ± 2.0 seizures, n=9; p=0.004; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). However, Cre+ males and Cre- males had a similar number of chronic seizures (Cre- male: 16.1 ± 1.6 seizures, n=12; Cre+ male: 19.9 ± 2.7 seizures, n=8; p&gt;0.999; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C2</xref>).</p>
<p>Results for seizure frequency were similar to results comparing total numbers of seizures. There ws a main effect of genotype (F(1,32) 4.18; p=0.049) and sex (F(1, 32)=11.96; p=0.002) on chronic seizure frequency, and a significant interaction between sex and genotype (F(1,32)=8.29; p=0.007). Cre+ female mice had approximately half the seizures per day as Cre- females (Bonferroni’s test, Cre- female: 2.1 ± 0.5 seizures/day; Cre+ female: 1.1 ± 0.1 seizures/day; p=0.004; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D2</xref>).</p>

<label>B.</label><title>Additional analyses</title>
<p>While reviewing the data for each mouse plotted in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C2</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D2</xref>, one point appeared spurious in the Cre- females, potentially influencing the comparison. The seizures in this mouse were more than 2x the standard deviation of the mean. Although not an outlier using the ROUT method (see Methods), we were curious if removing the data of this mouse would lead to a difference in the statistical results. There was still a main effect of sex (F(1,31)=16.04; p=0.0004) with a significant interaction between sex and genotype (F(1,31)=9.20; p=0.005) and Cre+ females had significantly fewer seizures than Cre- female mice (p=0.020; <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2-Supplemental figure 1A1</xref>). Tests for seizure frequency led to the same conclusions (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2-Supplemental figure 1A2</xref>). These data suggest that spurious data point was not the reason for the results.</p>
<p>All mice were included in the analyses above, both those implanted and unimplanted during SE. Mice which were unimplanted prior to SE were implanted at approximately 2-3 weeks after pilocarpine to study chronic seizures. Because implantation affected the incidence of SE (discussed above), we asked if chronic seizures were different in implanted and unimplanted mice. The total number of chronic seizures (F(1,17)=1.33, p=0.265) and seizure frequency (F(1,17)=1.27, p=0.276) were similar, suggesting that implantation did not influence chronic seizures (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2-Supplemental figure 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>There were no significant differences in mortality associated with SE or chronic seizures. For quantification, we examined mortality during SE and the subsequent 3 days, 3 days until the end of the 3 week-long EEG recording period, or both (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2-Supplemental figure 2A</xref>). Graphs of mouse numbers (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2-Supplemental figure 2B</xref>) or percentages of mice (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2-Supplemental figure 2C</xref>) were similar: groups (Cre- females, Cre+ females, Cre- males, Cre+ males) were not significantly different (Chi-Sq. test, p&gt;0.999).</p>

<sec id="s2b3">
<label>C.</label><title>Mean duration of individual chronic seizures</title>
<p>To evaluate the duration of individual seizures at the time mice were epileptic, two measurements were made. First, durations of each seizure of a given mouse were averaged, and then the averages for Cre- mice were compared to the averages for Cre+ mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E1</xref>). There was no difference in the genotypes (Cre-: 46.8 ± 2.9 sec, n=17; Cre+: 43.4 ± 2.5 sec, n=16; Student’s t-test, t(31)=0.89, p=0.379; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E1</xref>).</p>
<p>When separated by sex, a two-way ANOVA showed that female seizure durations were shorter than males (F(1,29)=12.42; p=0.001). However, this was a sex difference, not an effect of genotype (F(1,29)=0.033; p=0.856; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E2</xref>), with Cre- female seizure duration shorter than Cre- male seizure duration (Bonferroni post-hoc test, p=0.015), and the same for Cre+ females compared to Cre+ males (Bonferroni post-hoc test, p=0.037; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E2</xref>). One reason for the sex difference could be related to the greater incidence of postictal depression in females (see below), because that suggests spreading depolarizations truncated the seizures in females but not males.</p>
<p>The second method to compare seizure durations compared the duration of every seizure of every Cre- and Cre+ mouse. In the previous comparison (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E1</xref>), every mouse was a data point, whereas here every seizure was a data point (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F1</xref>). The data were similar between genotypes (Cre-: 41.9 ± 0.9 sec; Cre+: 36.8 ± 0.7 sec; Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, <italic>U</italic> statistic, 18873, p=0.079; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F1</xref>). When sexes were separated, a Kruskal-Wallis test was significant (Kruskal-Wallis statistic, 69.30, p&lt;0.001). Post-hoc tests showed that Cre+ females had longer seizure durations than Cre- females (Cre- female: 33.2 ± 0.7 sec; Cre+ female: 39.3 ± 0.6 sec, p&lt;0.001; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F2</xref>). Cre+ females may have had longer seizures because they were protected from spreading depolarizations that truncated seizures in Cre- females. Seizure durations were not significantly different in males (Cre- male: 51.4 ± 1.7 sec; Cre+ male: 44.0 ± 1.3 sec, p=0.298; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F2</xref>).</p>

<label>D.</label><title>Postictal depression</title>
<p>Postictal depression is a debilitating condition in humans where individuals suffer fatigue, confusion and cognitive impairment after a seizure. In the EEG, it is exhibited by a decrease in the EEG amplitude immediately after a seizure ends relative to baseline. In recent years the advent of DC amplifiers made it possible to show that postictal depression is often associated with spreading depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c121">Ssentongo et al. 2017</xref>), a large depolarization shift that is accompanied by depolarization block. As action potentials are blocked there are large decreases in input resistance leading to cessation of synaptic responses. As ion pumps are activated to restore equilibrium, there is recovery and the EEG returns to normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Somjen 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Hartings et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Herreras and Makarova 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Lu and Scharfman 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>We found that males had little evidence of postictal depression but it was common in females (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), a sex difference that is consistent with greater spreading depolarization in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Eikermann-Haerter et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Bolay et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Kudo et al. 2023</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A1</xref>, a male showed a robust spontaneous seizure (selected from the 3 week-long recording period when mice are epileptic). However, the end of the seizure did not exhibit a decrease in the amplitude of the EEG relative to baseline. The EEG before and immediately after the seizure is expanded in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A2</xref> to show the EEG amplitude is similar. In contrast, the seizure from the female in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B1-2</xref> shows a large reduction in the EEG immediately after the seizure. For quantification, the mean peak-to-trough amplitude of the EEG 25-30 sec before the seizure was compared to the mean amplitude for the EEG during the maximal depression of the EEG after the seizure. If the depression was more than half, the animal was said to have had postictal depression.</p>

<p>The number of days with seizures were similar between genotypes (Cre-: 8.6 ± 0.6 days, n=18; Cre+: 8.4 ± 0.6 days, n=17; Student’s t-test, t(33)=0.23, p=0.822; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B1</xref>). The number of consecutive days without seizures, called the seizure-free interval, was also similar between genotypes (Cre-: 6.4 ± 0.4 days, n=19; Cre+: 7.7 ± 0.6 days, n=17; Student’s t-test, t(34)=1.65, p=0.107; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B2</xref>). When data were segregated based on sex, a two-way ANOVA showed no effect of genotype (F(1,32)=1.18, p=0.286) or sex on the number of days with seizures (F(1,32)=0.86, p=0.361; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B3</xref>).

<p>Clustering is commonly manifested by consecutive days with frequent seizures. Clusters of seizures can have a substantial impact on the quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Haut 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Jafarpour et al. 2019</xref>) so they are important.

Therefore, we defined clusters as &gt;1 consecutive day with ≥ 3 seizures/day (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). The duration of clusters were similar between genotypes (Cre-: 3.8 ± 0.7 days, n=19; Cre+: 3.0 ± 0.3 days, n=18; Mann-Whitney’s <italic>U</italic> test, <italic>U</italic> statistic 159, p=0.723; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>1). Next, we calculated the number of days between clusters, which we call the intercluster interval. Genotypes were similar (Cre-: 7.2 ± 0.8 days, n=13; Cre+: 9.2 ± 0.8 days, n=9; Student’s t-test, t(20)=1.70, p=0.104; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D2</xref>).</p>
<p>Two-way ANOVA was then performed on the sex-separated data. For cluster duration, there was no effect of genotype (F(1,33)=3.36, p=0.076) but there was a main effect of sex (F(1,33)=7.66, p=0.009) and a significant interaction of genotype and sex (F(1,33)=.66, p=0.009). Cre+ females had fewer days with ≥3 seizures than Cre- females (Cre- females: 6.3 ± 1.4 days; Cre+ females: 3.0 ± 0.4 days; Bonferroni’s test, p=0.009; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D3</xref>). These data suggest Cre+ females were protected from the peak of a cluster, when seizures increase above 3/day.</p>
<p>There was no effect of genotype (F(1,17)=2.72, p=0.117) or sex (F(1,17)=2.72, p=0.117) on the intercluster interval (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D4</xref>). However, this result may have underestimated effects because Cre+ females often had such a long interval that it was not captured in the 3 week-long recording period. That led to fewer Cre+ females that were included in the measurement of intercluster interval. In 5 out of 9 (i.e., 55%) Cre+ females, there was only one cluster in 3 weeks, so intercluster interval was too long to capture. Of those mice where intercluster interval could be measured, Cre- females had an interval of 5.7 ± 1.0 days (n=7) and Cre+ females had a 9.0 ± 1.1 day interval (n=4). That difference was not significant.</p>
<p>In summary, Cre+ females had fewer seizures, fewer days with ≥3 seizures, reduced postictal depression, and appeared to have a long period between clusters of seizures.</p>

<p>A two-way ANOVA with sex and genotype as factors showed a significant effect of genotype (F(1,9)=60.78, p&lt;0.001) but not sex (F(1,9)=1.20, p=0.301; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Post-hoc comparisons showed that Cre+ females had more DCX than Cre- females (p=0.001) and the same was true for males (p=0.003). Cre+ males had more DCX than Cre- females (p&lt;0.001), and Cre+ females had more DCX than Cre- males (p=0.006). Cre- females and males were not different (p=0.774). The results are consistent with studies using the same methods which showed that Cre+ males have more DCX compared to Cre- males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Jain et al., 2019</xref>). Together the data suggest that Cre+ mice had more young adult-born neurons than Cre- mice immediately before SE.</p>

<label>B.</label><title>After epileptogenesis</title>
<p>We also quantified DCX at the time when epilepsy had developed, after the 3 week-long EEG recording (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Representative examples of DCX expression in the GCL/SGZ are presented in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref> shows the area fraction of DCX in the GCL/SGZ was significantly greater in Cre+ mice than Cre- mice (Cre-: 3.1 ± 0.4%, n=20; Cre+: 4.2 ± 0.3%, n=17; Student’s t-test, t(35)=2.13, p=0.041; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D1</xref>). Therefore, Cre+ mice had increased DCX in the GCL/SGZ after chronic seizures had developed.</p>
<p>To investigate a sex difference, a two-way ANOVA was conducted with genotype and sex as main factors. There was a significant effect of genotype (F(1,33)=12.62, p=0.001) and sex (F(1,33)=11.68, p=0.002), with Cre+ females having more DCX than Cre- females (Cre- female: 1.8 ± 0.3, n=7; Cre+ female: 3.8 ± 0.4, n=9; Bonferroni’s test, p=0.001; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). In contrast, DCX levels were similar between Cre+ and Cre- male mice (p=0.498, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). Therefore, elevated DCX occurred after chronic seizures had developed in Cre+ mice but the effect was limited to females. Because Cre+ epileptic females had increased immature neurons relative to Cre- females at the time of SE, and prior studies show that Cre+ females had less neuronal damage after SE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Jain et al. 2019</xref>), female Cre+ mice might have had reduced chronic seizures because of high numbers of immature neurons. However, the data do not prove a causal role.</p>
<p>It is notable that the Cre+ male mice did not show increased numbers of immature neurons at the time of chronic seizurers but Cre+ females did. It is possible that there was a “ceiling” effect in DCX expression that would explain why male Cre+ mice did not have a significant increase in immature neurons relative to male Cre- mice.</p>

<p>Based on the literature showing that reducing hilar ectopic GCs decreases chronic seizures after pilocarpine-induced SE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Cho et al., 2015</xref>), we hypothesized that female Cre+ mice would have fewer hilar ectopic GCs than female Cre- mice.

<p>In past studies, hilar ectopic GCs have been suggested to promote seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Scharfman et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Jung et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Cho et al. 2015</xref>). Therefore, we asked if the numbers of hilar ectopic GCs correlated with the numbers of chronic seizures. When Cre- and Cre+ mice were compared (both sexes pooled), there was a correlation with numbers of chronic seizures (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D1</xref>) but it suggested that more hilar ectopic GCs improved rather than worsened seizures. However, the correlation was only in Cre- mice, and when sexes were separated there was no correlation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D3</xref>).</p>
<p>When seizure-free interval was examined with sexes pooled, there was a correlation for Cre+ mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D2</xref>) but not Cre- mice. Strangely, the correlations of Cre+ mice with seizure-free interval (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D2</xref>, D4) suggest ectopic GCs shorten the seizure-free interval and therefore worsen epilepsy, opposite of the correlative data for numbers of chronic seizures. In light of these inconsistent results it seems that hilar ectopic granule cells had no consistent effect on chronic seizures.</p>

<label>V.</label><title>Increased neurogenesis preserves mossy cells and hilar SOM interneurons but has little effect on parvalbumin interneurons</title>
<p>It has been suggested that epileptogenesis after a brain insult like SE is due to the hippocampal damage caused by the insult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Cavalheiro et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Herman 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Mathern et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Dudek and Staley 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Dingledine et al. 2014</xref>). Therefore, one of the reasons why increasing adult neurogenesis reduced chronic seizures could be that it reduced neuronal damage after SE. Indeed, that has been shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Jain et al., 2019</xref>). Here we examined the loss of vulnerable hilar mossy cells and SOM cells because they have been suggested to be critical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">Sloviter 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Cavazos and Sutula 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Cavazos et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Henshall and Meldrum 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Huusko et al. 2015</xref>).

<p>The results showed that Cre+ mice had more GluR2/3-expressing hilar cells than Cre- mice (Cre-: 10.0 ± 1.8 cells, n=10; Cre+: 17.0 ± 2.0 cells, n=13; Student’s t-test, t(21)=2.46, p=0.022; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A1-3</xref>). We confirmed that the GluR2/3+ hilar cells were not double-labeled with Prox1, suggesting they corresponded to mossy cells, not hilar ectopic GCs (Supplementary Fig. 8A). To investigate sex differences, a two-way ANOVA was conducted with genotype and sex as main factors. There was a significant effect of genotype (F(1,18)=4.95, p=0.039) with Cre+ females having more GluR2/3 cells than Cre- females (Cre- female: 8.0 ± 2.0 cells, n=6; Cre+ female: 19.1 ± 2.7 cells, n=8; Bonferroni’s test, p=0.011; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A4</xref>). GluR2/3-ir hilar cells were similar in males (Cre- male: 13.0 ± 3.0 cells, n=4; Cre+ male: 13.6 ± 2.5 cells, n=5; Bonferroni’s test, p=0.915; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A4</xref>). These results in dorsal DG also were obtained in ventral DG (Supplementary Fig. 8B-C). The data suggest that having more GluR2/3-ir mossy cells could be a mechanism that allowed Cre+ females to have reduced chronic seizures compared to Cre- females. Equal numbers of GluR2/3 mossy cells in Cre+ and Cre- males could relate to their lack of protection against chronic seizures. Next, we measured SOM hilar cells in pooled data (females and males together).</p>
<p>These results were analogous to the data for GluR2/3, showing that Cre+ mice had more hilar SOM cells than Cre- mice (Cre-: 2.1 ± 0.5 cells, n=9; Cre+: 4.6 ± 0.6 cells, n=11; Student’s t-test, t(18)=2.95, p=0.008; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B1-3</xref>). When sexes were separated, a two-way ANOVA showed a significant effect of genotype (F(1,16)=5.14, p=0.038) and no effect of sex (F(1,18)=0.94, p=0.346). However, Cre+ females had more SOM cells than Cre- females (Cre- female: 2.2 ± 0.6 cells, n=6; Cre+ female: 5.1 ± 0.6 cells, n=8; Bonferroni’s test, p=0.019; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B4</xref>), although only in dorsal DG (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B4</xref>) not ventral DG (Supplementary Fig. 8C). Numbers of SOM cells were similar in males (Cre- male: 2.2 ± 0.7 cells, n=3; Cre+ male: 3.3 ± 1.8 cells, n=3; Bonferroni’s test, p=0.897; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B4</xref>) in both dorsal and ventral DG (Supplementary Fig. 8B-C). Therefore, the ability to preserve more mossy cells and SOM hilar cells in Cre+ females could be a mechanism by which Cre+ females were protected from chronic seizures.</p>
<p>Parvalbumin-ir cells were not significantly different between genotypes (Student’s test, t(19)=1.76, p=0.095; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C1-3</xref>). A two-way ANOVA showed no effect of genotype (F(1,17)=3.10, p=0.096) or sex (F(1,17)=0.26, p=0.616) on the numbers of parvalbumin cells. The results were the same in dorsal and ventral DG (Supplementary Fig. 8B-C). These data are consistent with the idea that loss of parvalbumin-expressing cells has not been considered to play a substantial in epileptogenesis in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">Sloviter 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">1994</xref>). However, it should be noted that subsequent research has shown that the topic is complicated because parvalbumin expression may decline even if the cells do not die (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Andre et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">Sun et al. 2007</xref>) and data vary depending on the animal model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c131">van Vliet et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Huusko et al. 2015</xref>).</p>

<p>To quantify Fluorojade-C, ROIs were drawn digitally around the pyramidal cell layers (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>, there was less Fluorojade-C staining in Cre+ female mice relative to Cre- female mice in both CA1 and the subiculum. The area of the ROI that showed Fluorojade C-positive cells was calculated as area fraction and expressed as % in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>. For females, a two-way ANOVA with genotype and subfield as factors showed a significant effect of genotype (F(1,14)=11.21, p=0.005) with a smaller area fraction in Cre+ mice than Cre- mice for subiculum (p=0.045) and but not CA1 (p=0.095; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D1</xref>).

Thus, Cre+ female mice were protected from hilar, CA3, and CA1 damage at 3 days and were protected from subicular damage at 10 days after SE.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study showed that conditional deletion of <italic>Bax</italic> from Nestin-expressing progenitors increased young adult-born neurons in the DG when studied 6 weeks after deletion and using DCX as a marker of immature neurons. In a different set of mice, pilocarpine was used to induce epileptogenesis. The chronic seizures, measured 4-7 weeks after pilocarpine, were reduced in frequency by about 50% in females. Therefore, increasing young adult-born neurons before the epileptogenic insult can protect against epilepsy. However, we do not know if the protective effect was due to the greater number of new neurons before SE or other effects. Past data would suggest that increased numbers of newborn neurons before SE leads to a reduced SE duration and less neuronal damage in the days after SE. That would be likely to lessen the epilepsy after SE. However, there may have been additional effects of larger numbers of newborn neurons prior to SE.</p>
<p>Increasing young adult-born neurons has been shown to protect the hippocampus from SE-induced neuronal loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Jain et al., 2019</xref>) which is a major contributor to epileptogenesis. Therefore, by protecting against SE-induced neuronal loss the young adult-born neurons could have reduced the severity of epilepsy. Indeed, we showed that the Cre+ female mice that had reduced chronic seizures had preservation of hilar mossy cells and SOM cells, two populations that are lost in SE-induced epilepsy and considered to contribute to epileptogenesis.</p>
<p>There were major surprises in the current study. First, the results are unexpected because suppressing adult-born neurons was shown to reduce chronic seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Cho et al., 2015</xref>). Here, increasing adult-born neurons did not have the opposite effect. It was also unanticipated that only females with <italic>Bax</italic> deletion showed a significant increase in young adult-born neurons and a significant reduction in chronic seizures. The larger effect of increasing adult neurogenesis in female mice may be attributable to sex differences in Bax (discussed below). The other remarkable finding relates to hilar ectopic GCs. These GCs have been suggested to promote epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Scharfman 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Jung et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Scharfman et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Parent and Murphy 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Hester and Danzer 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Cho et al. 2015</xref>), but hilar ectopic GCs increased in females with reduced seizures. The association of more hilar ectopic GCs with fewer chronic seizures was unexpected.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Effects of <italic>Bax</italic> deletion on SE</title>
<p>In past studies, suppressing adult neurogenesis made kainic acid-induced SE worse, and pilocarpine-induced SE was also worse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Iyengar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Jain et al., 2019</xref>). In the present study, SE was affected also. The duration of SE was reduced in Cre+ mice. In the Cre+ females, the first seizure after pilocarpine injection was often less severe, and power showed a tendency to be reduced during SE. Therefore, SE might have been less severe in the Cre+ females, and this could have contributed to reduced neuronal loss and chronic seizures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b">
<title>Chronic seizures</title>
<p>It is remarkable that increasing adult neurogenesis for 6 weeks was sufficient to reduce seizures long-term. It is consistent with the idea that normally the young adult-born neurons inhibit other GCs, which supports the DG gate function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Hsu 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Drew et al. 2016</xref>). This gate has been suggested to be an inhibitory barrier to entry of seizures from cortex into hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Coulter and Carlson 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Hsu 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Krook-Magnuson et al. 2015</xref>).That entry is deleterious because seizures that pass from entorhinal cortex to the GCs and then CA3 are likely to continue to CA1 and back to cortex, causing reverberatory (long-lasting, severe) seizures. The reason for the relatively ease of reverberation once past the DG gate is that the synapses between GCs and CA3, CA1 and cortex are excitatory. The GCs have especially powerful excitatory synapses on CA3 pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Henze et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Scharfman and MacLusky 2014</xref>), although these are normally mitigated by GABAergic circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Acsady et al. 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>These data are consistent with the demonstration that adult-born neurons protect against other pathological conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Choi et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Choi and Tanzi 2019</xref>). However, it is important to note that all effects are unlikely to be mediated only by the DG. The olfactory bulb and other areas also have adult-born neurons and they could contribute to epilepsy, especially those epilepsy syndromes with mechanisms that are extrahippocampal.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3c">
<title>Clusters of seizures</title>
<p>There were fewer days with &gt; 3 seizures in Cre+ female mice which is another way that Cre+ females were protected from chronic seizures. These findings are valuable because clusters in humans have a significantly negative impact on health and quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Haut 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Jafarpour et al. 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>The results may have underestimated the effects on clusters because we did not measure the interval between clusters in many Cre+ female mice. The reason is that the interval between clusters increased in some mice so they only had one cluster in 3 weeks. Thus intercluster interval appeared to lengthen in Cre+ females but animals with only one cluster had to be excluded. In the end, the results were not statistically significant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3d">
<title>Sex differences</title>
<p>Females showed more of an effect of conditional <italic>Bax</italic> deletion than males. Insight into this sex difference came when the same assessments were made before SE Before SE, there was no sex difference. Cre+ females had more adult-born neurons than Cre- females and Cre+ males had more than Cre- males. In addition, the levels of DCX were similar in Cre+ females and Cre+ males.</p>
<p>However, after epilepsy developed, there was a sex difference. Cre- females had less DCX than Cre- males. One explanation is that cell birth during epileptogenesis was greater in males because it is in developing hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">Sisk et al. 2016</xref>) and SE has been suggested to rekindle developmental programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Ben-Ari and Holmes 2006</xref>). Another possibility is males had less programmed cell death during epileptogenesis. Indeed during development, females have more apoptotic profiles than males and the sex difference was blocked by <italic>Bax</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Forger et al. 2004</xref>). A final possibililty is that cell death during epileptogenesis is <italic>Bax</italic>-dependent in females but <italic>Bax</italic>-independent in males. Support for this idea comes from studies of ischic cell death, which is caspase-dependent cell death in females but not males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Siegel and McCullough 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3e">
<title>Hilar ectopic GCs</title>
<p>In the normal brain, adult-born neurons in the DG are thought to arise mainly from the SGZ and migrate to the GCL(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Kempermann 2012</xref>). After SE, there is a surge in proliferation in the SGZ and neurons either migrate correctly to the GCL or aberrantly in the hilus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Parent et al. 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>These hilar ectopic GCs are thought to contribute to seizure generation in the epileptic brain because they are innervated by residual CA3 neurons, and project to GCs, making a major contribution to mossy fiber innervation of GCs in the inner molecular layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Scharfman et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Kron et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Pierce et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Scharfman and Pierce 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Althaus et al. 2016</xref>). When epileptiform activity occurs in CA3 in slices of epileptic rats, CA3 evokes discharges in hilar ectopic GCs that in turn excite GCs in the GCL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Scharfman et al. 2000</xref>). Consistent with the idea that hilar ectopic GCs promote seizures, the numbers of hilar ectopic GCs are correlated with chronic seizure frequency in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">McCloskey et al. 2006</xref>) and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Hester and Danzer 2013</xref>). Furthermore, suppressing hilar ectopic GC formation reduces chronic seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Jung et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Cho et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Hosford et al. 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Notably, this is the first study to our knowledge showing that increased hilar ectopic GCs were found in mice that had reduced seizures. One potential explanation is that SE-induced hippocampal damage was reduced in Cre+ females with high numbers of hilar ectopic GCs. Therefore, the circuitry of the DG would be very different compared to past studies of hilar ectopic GCs where neuronal loss was severe (Supplementary Fig. 7). The presence of mossy cells is one way the circuitry would be different. MCs normally support the young adult-born GCs that migrate to the GCL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Piatti and Schinder 2018</xref>). Mossy cells provide an important activator of newborn GCs when they are young (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Chancey et al. 2014</xref>). Mossy cells also innervate hilar ectopic GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Pierce et al. 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Another possibility is that there was protection against chronic seizures in female Cre+ mice by increasing adult-born neurons <italic>in the GCL</italic>. The reason to suggest this possibility is that prior studies showed that young adult-born neurons in the GCL primarily inhibit GCs in the normal brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Drew et al. 2016</xref>) and are relatively quiescent in the epileptic brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Jakubs et al. 2006</xref>) .</p>

<sec id="s3f">
<title>Additional considerations</title>
<p>Diazepam was administered earlier in females during SE than males, and this could have influenced the results. However, the timing of SE was not significantly different in females than males (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Methods – Supplemental figure 1</xref>). Also, diazepam was admimistered the same way in all Cre+ and Cre- females similarly but only the Cre+ females were protected.</p>
<p>This study is limited by the possibilities of type II statistical errors in those instances where we divided groups by genotype and sex, leading to comparisons of 3-5 mice/group. Another potential caveat is that female mice were selected regardless of the stage of the estrous cycle.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In the past, suppressing adult neurogenesis before SE was followed by fewer hilar ectopic GCs and reduced chronic seizures. Here, we show that the opposite - enhancing adult neurogenesis before SE and increased hilar ectopic GCs - do not necessarily reduce seizures. We suggest instead that protection of the hilar neurons from SE-induced excitotoxicity was critical to reducing seizures. The reason for the suggestion is that the survival of hilar neurons would lead to persistence of the normal inhibitory functions of hilar neurons, protecting against seizures. However, this is only a suggestion at the present time because we do not have data to prove it. Additionally, because protection was in females, sex differences are likely to have played an important role. Regardless, the results show that enhancing neurogenesis of young adult-born neurons in Nestin-Cre+ mice had a striking effect in the pilocarpine model, reducing chronic seizures in female mice.</p>

<label>II.</label><title>Increasing adult neurogenesis</title>
<p>To enhance neurogenesis, a method was used that depends on deletion of <italic>Bax</italic>, the major regulator of programmed cell death in adult-born neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">Sun et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Sahay et al. 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ikrar et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Adlaf et al. 2017</xref>). Enhancement of neurogenesis was induced by conditional deletion of <italic>Bax</italic> from Nestin-expressing progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Sahay et al. 2011a</xref>). These mice were created by crossing mice that have <italic>loxP</italic> sites flanking the pro-apoptotic gene <italic>Bax</italic> (<italic>Bax<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>) with a Nestin-CreER<sup>T2</sup> mouse line in which tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase (CreER<sup>T2</sup>) is expressed under the control of the rat Nestin promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Sahay et al. 2011a</xref>). It was shown that after tamoxifen injection in adult mice there is an increase in dentate gyrus neurogenesis based on studies of bromo-deoxyuridine, Ki67, and doublecortin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Sahay et al. 2011a</xref>). The Nestin-CreER<sup>T2</sup><italic>Bax<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mouse line was kindly provided by Drs. Amar Sahay and Rene Hen and used and described previously by our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bermudez-Hernandez et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Jain et al. 2019</xref>). Although Nestin-Cre-ER<sup>T2</sup> mouse lines have been criticized because they can have leaky expression, the mouse line used in the present study did not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">Sun et al. 2014</xref>), which we confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Jain et al. 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Starting at 6 weeks of age, mice were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) with tamoxifen (dose 100 mg/kg, 1/day for 5 days; Cat# T5648, Sigma-Aldrich). Tamoxifen was administered from a stock solution (20 mg/ml in corn oil, containing 10% absolute alcohol; Cat# C8267, Sigma-Aldrich). Tamoxifen is light-sensitive so it was stored at 4°C in an aluminum foil-wrapped container for the duration of treatment (5 days).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5c">
<label>III.</label><title>Pilocarpine-induced SE</title>
<p>Six weeks after the last dose of tamoxifen injection, mice were injected with pilocarpine to induce SE. Methods were similar to those used previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Jain et al. 2019</xref>). On the day of pilocarpine injection, there were 2 initial injections of pre-treatments and then one injection of pilocarpine. The first injection of pre-treatments was a solution of ethosuximide (150 mg/kg of 84 mg/ml in phosphate buffered saline, s.c.; Cat# E;7138, Sigma-Aldrich). Ethosuximide was used because the background strain, C57BL6/J, is susceptible to respiratory arrest during a severe seizure and ethosuximide decreases the susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Iyengar et al. 2015</xref>). The second injection of pre-treatments was a solution of scopolamine methyl nitrate (1 mg/kg of 0.2 mg/ml in sterile 0.9% sodium chloride solution, s.c.; Cat# 2250, Sigma-Aldrich) and terbutaline hemisulfate (1 mg/kg of 0.2 mg/ml in sterile 0.9% sodium chloride solution, s.c.; Cat# T2528, Sigma-Aldrich). Scopolamine is a muscarinic cholinergic antagonist and when injected as methyl nitrate it does not cross the blood brain barrier. Therefore, scopolamine decreased peripheral cholinergic side effects of pilocarpine without interfering with central actions of pilocarpine. Terbutaline was used to keep airways patent during severe seizures, minimizing mortality. Ethosuximide had to be administered separately because it precipitates when mixed with scopolamine and terbutaline.</p>
<p>Thirty min after the pre-treatments, pilocarpine hydrochloride was injected (260-280 mg/kg of 50 mg/ml in sterile 0.9% sodium chloride solution, s.c.; Cat# P6503; Sigma-Aldrich). Different doses were used because different batches of pilocarpine had different ability to elicit SE.</p>
<p>The severity of SE was decreased by administering the benzodiazepine diazepam (10 mg/kg of 5 mg/ml stock solution, s.c.; NDC# 0409-3213-12, Hospira, Inc.) 2 hr after pilocarpine injection. In females, diazepam was injected earlier, 40 minutes after the onset of first seizure, because in the first group of females in which diazepam was injected 2 hr after pilocarpine, there was severe brain damage. While sedated with diazepam, animals were injected with warm (31°C) lactated Ringer’s solution (s.c.; NDC# 07-893-1389, Aspen Veterinary Resources). At the end of the day, mice were injected with ethosuximide using the same dose as before pilocarpine. For the next 3 days, chow was provided that was moistened with water. The cage was placed on a heating blanket to maintain cage temperature at 31°C.</p>

Prior to surgery, the analgesic Buprenex (Buprenorphine hydrochloride; NDC# 1296-0757-5; Reckitt Benckheiser) was diluted in sterile saline (0.9% sodium chloride solution) to yield a 0.03 mg/ml stock solution and 0.2 mg/kg was injected s.c.

<label>B.</label><title>Implantation of EEG electrodes</title>
<p>Before electrode implantation, hair over the skull was shaved and then the scalp was cleaned with 70% ethanol. A midline incision was made to expose the skull with a sterile scalpel. To implant subdural screw electrodes (0.10” stainless steel screws, Cat# 8209, Pinnacle Technology), 6 holes were drilled over the exposed skull. The coordinates were: right occipital cortex (anterior-posterior or AP −3.5 mm from Bregma, medio-lateral or ML, 2.0 mm from the midline); left frontal cortex (Lt FC, AP −0.5 mm; ML −1.5 mm); left hippocampus (AP −2.5 mm; ML −2.0 mm) and right hippocampus (AP −2.5 mm; ML 2.0 mm). An additional screw was placed over the right olfactory bulb as ground (AP 2.3 mm; ML 1.8 mm) and another screw over the cerebellum at the midline as reference (relative to Lambda: AP −1.5 mm; ML −0.5 mm). Here, “ground” refers to the earth ground and “reference” refers to the reference for all 4 screw electrode recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Moyer et al. 2017</xref>). An 8-pin connector (Cat# ED85100-ND, Digi-Key Corporation) was placed over the skull and secured with dental cement (Cat# 51459, Dental Cement Kit; Stoelting Co.).</p>
<p>After surgery, mice were injected with 50 ml/kg warm (31°C) lactated Ringer’s solution (s.c.; NDC# 09355000476, Aspen Veterinary Resources). Mice were housed a clean cage on a heating blanket for 24 hr. Moistened food pellets were placed at the base of the cage to encourage food intake. Afterwards mice were housed individually because group housing leads to disturbance of the implant by other mice in the cage.</p>

<label>A.</label><title>Video-EEG recording</title>
<p>Mice were allowed 3 weeks to recover from surgery. During this time, mice were housed in the room where video-EEG equipment are placed so that mice could acclimate to the recording environment. To record video-EEG, the pin connector on the head of the mouse was attached to a preamplifier (Cat# 8406, Pinnacle Technology) which was attached to a commutator (Cat# 8408, Mouse Swivel/Commutator, 4-channel, Pinnacle Technology) to allow freedom of movement. Signals were acquired at a 500 Hz sampling rate, and band-pass filtered at 1-100 Hz using Sirenia Acquisition software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pinnaclet.com">https://www.pinnaclet.com</ext-link>, RRID:SCR_016183). Video was captured with a high-intensity infrared LED camera (Cat# PE-605EH, Pecham) and was synchronized to the EEG record.</p>
<p>To monitor pilocarpine-induced SE, video-EEG was recorded for hour before ad 24 hr after pilocarpine injection. Approximately 5-6 weeks after pilocarpine-induced SE, video-EEG was recorded to measure spontaneous recurrent seizures. Video-EEG was recorded continuously for 3 weeks.</p>

<sec id="s5e2">
<label>B.</label><title>Video-EEG analysis</title>
<p>EEG was analyzed offline with Sirenia Seizure Pro, V2.0.7 (Pinnacle Technology, RRID:SCR_016184). A seizure was defined as a period of rhythmic (&gt;3 Hz) deflections that were &gt;2x the standard deviation of baseline mean and lasted at least 10 sec (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Jain et al. 2019</xref>). Seizures were rated as convulsive if an electrographic seizure was accompanied by a behavioral convulsion (observed by video playback), defined as stages 3-5 using the Racine scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Racine 1972</xref>) where stage 3 is unilateral forelimb clonus, stage 4 is bilateral forelimb clonus with rearing, and stage 5 is bilateral forelimb clonus followed by rearing and falling. A seizure was defined as non-convulsive when there was electrographic evidence of a seizure but there were no stage 3-5 behavior.</p>
<p>SE was defined as continuous seizures for &gt;5 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Chen and Wasterlain 2006</xref>) and EEG amplitude in all 4 channels &gt;3x the baseline mean. For mice without EEG, SE was defined by stage 3-5 seizures that did not stop with a resumption of normal behavior. Often stage 3-5 seizures heralded the onset of SE and then occurred intermittently for hours. In between convulsive behavior mice had twitching of their body, typically in a prone position.</p>
<p>SE duration was defined in light of the fact that the EEG did not return to normal after the initial period of intense activity. Instead, intermittent spiking occurred for at least 24 hrs, as we previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Jain et al. 2019</xref>) and has been described by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Mazzuferi et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Bumanglag and Sloviter 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">Smith et al. 2018</xref>). We therefore chose a definition that captured the initial, intense activity. We defined the end of this time as the point when the amplitude of the EEG deflections were reduced to 50% or less of the peak deflections during the initial hour of SE. Specifically, we selected the time after the onset of SE when the EEG amplitude in at least 3 channels had dropped to approximately 2 times the amplitude of the EEG during the first hour of SE, and remained depressed for at least 10 min (Fig S2 in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Jain et al. 2019</xref>). Thus, the duration of SE was defined as the time between the onset and this definition of the “end” of SE.</p>
<p>To access the severity of chronic seizures, frequency and duration of seizures were measured during the 3 weeks of EEG recording. Inter-cluster interval was defined as the maximum number of days between two clusters.</p>

<p>Mice were perfused after video-EEG recording. To perfuse, mice were deeply anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation followed by urethane (250 mg/kg of 250 mg/ml in 0.9% sodium chloride, intraperitoneal, i.p.; Cat#U2500; Sigma-Aldrich). After loss of a reflex to a tail pinch, and loss of a righting reflex, consistent with deep anesthesia, the heart cavity was opened, and a 25-gauge needle inserted into the heart, followed by perfusion with 10 ml saline (0.9% sodium chloride in double-distilled water (ddH<sub>2</sub>O) using a peristaltic pump (Minipuls 1; Gilson) followed by 30 ml of cold (4°C) 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Cat# 19210, Electron Microscopy Sciences) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB; pH 7.4). The brains were removed immediately, hemisected, and post-fixed for at least 24 hr in 4% PFA at 4°C. After post-fixation, one hemisphere was cut in the coronal plane and the other in the horizontal plane (50 μm-thick sections) using a vibratome (Cat# TPI-3000, Vibratome Co.). Sections were collected sequentially to select sections that were from similar septotemporal levels. For dorsal hippocampus, coronal sections were selected every 300 μm starting at the first section where the DG blades are fully formed (between AP −1.94 and −2.06 mm). Horizontal sections were chosen every 300 μm starting from the temporal pole at the place where the GCL is clearly defined (between DV 0.84 and 1.08 mm). This scheme is diagrammed and described in more detail in prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Moretto et al. 2017</xref>).</p>

<p>Doublecortin (DCX), a microtubule-associated protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Gleeson et al. 1999</xref>), was used to identify immature adult-born neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Brown et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Couillard-Despres et al. 2005</xref>), and was stained after antigen retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Botterill et al. 2015</xref>). First, free floating sections were washed in 0.1 M Tris buffer (TB, 3 × 5 min). Sections were then incubated in sodium citrate (Cat# S4641, Sigma-Aldrich) buffer (2.94 mg/ml in ddH<sub>2</sub>O, pH 6.0 adjusted with HCl) in a preheated water bath at 85°C for 30 min. Sections were washed with 0.1 M TB (3 × 5 min), blocked in 5% goat serum (Cat# S-1000, RRID:AB_2336615, Vector Laboratories) in 0.1 M TB with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Cat# X-100, Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 1 hr. Next, sections were incubated overnight with primary antibody (1:1000 diluted in blocking serum, monoclonal anti-rabbit DCX; Cat#4604S, Cell Signaling Technology) on a shaker (Model# BDRAA115S, Stovall Life Science Inc.) at room temperature.</p>
<p>On the next day, sections were washed in 0.1 M TB (3 × 5 min), treated with 2.5% hydrogen peroxide (Cat# 216763, Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min to block endogenous peroxide, and washed with 0.1 M TB (3 × 5 min). Next, sections were incubated in secondary antibody (biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG, 1:500, Vector Laboratories) for 1 hr in 0.1 M TB, followed by washes with 0.1 M TB (3 × 5 min). Sections were then incubated in avidin-biotin complex (1:500 in 0.1 M Tris buffer; Cat# PK-6100, Vector) for 2 hr, washed in 0.1 M TB (1 × 5 min) and then in 0.175 M sodium acetate (14.36 mg/ml in ddH<sub>2</sub>O, pH 6.8, adjusted with glacial acetic acid, 2 × 5 min; Cat# S8750, Sigma-Aldrich). Sections were reacted in 0.5 mg/ml 3, 3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB; Cat# D5905, Sigma-Aldrich) with 40 µg/ml ammonium chloride (Cat# A4514, Sigma-Aldrich), 3 µg/ml glucose oxidase (Cat# G2133, Sigma-Aldrich), 2 mg/ml (D+)-glucose (Cat# G5767, Sigma-Aldrich) and 25 mg/ml ammonium nickel sulfate (Cat# A1827, Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.175 M sodium acetate. Sections were washed in 0.175 M sodium acetate (2 × 5 min) and 0.1 M TB (5 min), mounted on gelatin-coated slides (1% bovine gelatin; Cat# G9391, Sigma-Aldrich), and dried overnight at room temperature.</p>
<p>On the next day, sections were dehydrated with increasing concentrations of ethanol, cleared in Xylene (Cat# 534-56, Sigma-Aldrich), and coverslipped with Permount (Cat# 17986-01, Electron Microscopy Sciences). Sections were viewed with a brightfield microscope (Model BX51; Olympus of America) and images were captured with a digital camera (Model Infinity3-6URC, Teledyne Lumenera).</p>

<label>2)</label><title>DCX Analysis</title>
<p>DCX was quantified by first defining a region of interest (ROI) that included the adult-born cells and the majority of their DCX-labeled dendrites: the SGZ, GCL, and inner molecular layer. The SGZ was defined as a region that extended from the GCL into the hilus for a width of 100 µm because this region included the vast majority of the DCX immunoreactivity. The inner molecular layer was defined as the 100 μm immediately above the GCL. Next, a threshold was selected where DCX-immunoreactive (ir) cells were above, but the background was below threshold, as described in more detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Jain et al. 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>This measurement is referred to as area fraction in the Results and expressed as a percent. For a given animal, the area fraction was determined for 3 coronal sections in the dorsal hippocampus between AP −1.94 to −2.06 mm and 3-4 horizontal sections in the ventral hippocampus between DV 0.84 to 1.08 mm, with sections spaced 300 μm apart. These area fractions were averaged so that a mean area fraction was defined for each animal. For these and other analyses described below, the investigator was blinded.</p>

To stain for Prox1, free-floating sections were washed in 0.1 M TB pH 7.4, 3×5 min). Sections were then incubated in 0.1 M TB with 0.25%Triton X-100 for 30 min followed by a 10 min-long wash in 0.1 M TB with 0.1%Triton X-100 (referred to as Tris A). Next, sections were treated with 1% hydrogen peroxide in Tris A for 5 min followed by a 5 min-long wash in Tris A. Sections were blocked in 10% normal horse serum (Cat# S-2000, RRID:AB_2336617, Vector) in Tris A for 1 hr followed by a 10 min-long wash in Tris A and then 0.1 M TB with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.005% bovine serum albumin (referred to as Tris B).

<label>2)</label><title>Prox1 Analysis</title>
<p>Prox1 was quantified in the hilus, defined based on zone 4 of Amaral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Amaral 1978</xref>). The definition of Amaral was modified to exclude 20 μm below the GCL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c133">Winawer et al. 2007</xref>). The GCL boundary was defined as the location where GCs stopped being contiguous. Practically that meant there was no GC with more than a cell body width of cell-free space around it. A cell body width was 10 μm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Claiborne et al. 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Amaral et al. 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>CA3c was included in the ROI but hilar Prox1 cells have not been detected in the CA3c layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Scharfman et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c133">Winawer et al. 2007</xref>). However, there are rare GCs in CA3 according to one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c126">Szabadics et al. 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In ImageJ, a ROI was traced in the image taken at 20x magnification and then a threshold was selected where Prox1-immunoreactivity was above the background threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Jain et al. 2019</xref>). Then Prox1 cells were counted using the Analyzed particle plugin where a particle with an area ≥ 10 μm<sup>2</sup> was counted. The following criteria were used to define a hilar Prox1-ir cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bermudez-Hernandez et al. 2017</xref>): (1) the hilar cell had sufficient Prox1-ir to reach a threshold equal to the average level of Prox1-ir of GCs in the adjacent GC layer, (2) All hilar Prox-ir cells were complete, i.e., not cut at the edge of the ROI. When hilar Prox1-ir cells were in clusters, although not many (typically 2–3 per 50 μm section), cells were counted manually. For each animal 3 coronal sections in the dorsal hippocampus and 3-4 horizontal sections in the ventral hippocampus, with sections spaced 300 μm apart were chosen.</p>

<p>Free floating sections were washed (3×5 min) in 0.1 M TB followed by a 10-min long wash in Tris A and another 10 min-long wash in Tris B. Sections were incubated in blocking solution (5% normal goat serum or donkey serum in Tris B) for 1 hr at room temperature. Next, primary antibodies for anti-rabbit GluR2/3, anti-goat Prox1, anti-rabbit SOM and anti-mouse parvalbumin (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) were diluted in blocking solution and sections were incubated for 48 hr at 4°C. For SOM labelling, antigen retrieval was used.

<p>Fluorojade-C (FJ) is a fluorescent dye that is the “gold standard” to stain degenerating neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Schmued and Hopkins 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Schmued et al. 2005</xref>). First, sections were mounted on gelatin-coated slides (1% porcine gelatin in ddH2O; Cat# G1890, Sigma-Aldrich) and dried on a hot plate at 50–55°C for 1 hr. Then slides were placed in a staining rack and immersed in a 100% ethanol solution for 5 min, then in 70% ethanol for 2 min, followed by a 1 min wash in ddH2O.</p>
<p>Slides were then incubated in 0.06% potassium permanganate (Cat# P-279, Fisher Scientific) solution for 10 min on a shaker (described above) with gentle agitation, followed by washes in ddH2O (2 × 1 min). Slides were then incubated for 20 min in a 0.0002% solution of FJ in ddH2O with 0.1% acetic acid in the dark. The stock solution of FJ was 0.01% in ddH2O and was stored at 4°C for up to 3 months. To prepare a working solution, 6 ml of stock solution was added to 294 mL of 0.1% acetic acid (Cat# UN2789, Fisher Scientific) in ddH2O and used within 10 min of preparation. Slides were subsequently protected from direct light. They were washed in ddH2O (3 × 1 min) and dried overnight at room temperature. On the next day, slides were cleared in Xylene (2 × 3 min) and coverslipped with DPX mounting medium (Cat# 44581, Sigma-Aldrich). Sections were photographed with an epifluorescence microscope (Model BX51; Olympus of America) and images were captured with a digital camera (Model Infinity3-6URC, Teledyne Lumenera).</p>

<label>2)</label><title>Procedures for analysis</title>
<p>We measured the FJ in the cell layers of CA1 and CA3. Manual counting of FJ-positive (FJ+) cells was not possible in these cell layers because there could be so many FJ+ cells that were overlapping. Instead, FJ staining in cell layers was quantified by first outlining the cell layer as a ROI at 10× magnification in ImageJ as before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Jain et al. 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>To outline the CA1 cell layer, the border with CA2 was defined as the point where the cell layer changed width, a sudden change that could be appreciated by the background in FJ-stained sections and confirmed by cresyl violet-stained sections. The border of CA1 and the subiculum was defined as the location where the normally compact CA1 cell layer suddenly dispersed. To outline CA3, the border with CA2 and CA3 was defined by the point where stratum lucidum of CA3 terminated. This location was distinct in its background in FJ-stained sections. The border of CA3 and the hilus was defined according to zone 4 of Amaral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Amaral 1978</xref>). This location was also possible to detect in FJ-stained sections because the background in the hilus was relatively dark compared to area CA3.</p>
<p>After defining ROIs, a threshold fluorescence level was selected so that all cells that had very bright immunofluorescence were above threshold but other cells that were similar in fluorescence to background staining were not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Iyengar et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Jain et al. 2019</xref>). ImageJ was then used to calculate the area within the ROI and this measurement is referred to as area fraction in the Results and expressed as a percent. For a given animal, the area fraction was determined for three coronal sections in the dorsal hippocampus between AP −1.94 and −2.06 mm and 3–4 horizontal sections in the ventral hippocampus between DV 0.84 and 1.08 mm, with sections spaced 300 μm apart. These area fractions were averaged so that a mean area fraction was defined for each animal.</p>

<label>VI.</label><title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism Software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism/">https://www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism/</ext-link>, RRID: SCR_002798). Statistical significance was set at p &lt; 0.05. Robust regression and Outlier removal (ROUT) method was used to remove outliers with ROUT coefficient Q set at 1%. Parametric tests were used when data fit a normal distribution, determined by the D’Agostino and Pearson or Shapiro-Wilk’s normality tests, and there was homoscedasticity of variance (confirmed by a F-test). A Student’s unpaired two-tailed t-test was used to assess differences between two groups. A Welch’s test was used instead of a Student’s t-test when there was heteroscedasity of variance. One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), two-way ANOVA, and three-way ANOVA were performed when there were multiple groups and were followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison post-hoc test (Bonferroni’s test). The main factors for two-way ANOVA were genotype and sex; region was added as another factor for three-way ANOVA. Interaction between factors is reported in the Results if it was significant. A Fisher’s exact test was used for comparing proportions of binary data (yes/no). Pearson’s Correlation was used to assess the association between 2 variables.</p>
<p>For data that did not follow a normal distribution, typically some data had a 0 value. In these cases, non-parametric tests were selected. The Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test was used to compare two groups, and a Kruskal-Wallis test followed by post-hoc Dunn’s test was used for multiple groups comparison.</p>

GluR2/3. A two-way ANOVA showed no effect of dorsal or ventral location (F(1,13)=3.38; p=0.089) or genotype (F(1,13)=1.158; p=0.302).</p><p>2. SOM. A two-way ANOVA showed no effect of dorsal or ventral location (F(1,10)=0.172; p=0.687) or genotype (F(1,10)=0.014; p=0.908).</p><p>3. Parvalbumin. A two-way ANOVA showed no effect of dorsal or ventral location (F(1,13)=0.358; p=0.560) or genotype (F(1,13)=1.068 p=0.320).</p><p><bold>C.</bold> A comparison of ventral measurements for both Cre- and Cre+ female and male mice.</p><p>1. There were significantly more GluR2/3+ hilar cells in Cre+ female mice compared to Cre- female mice, like the dorsal hippocampus (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Thus, GluR2/3+ hilar cells were spared in Cre+ females in dorsal and ventral hippocampus. A two-way ANOVA showed o effect of sex (F(1,18)=0.744; p=0.400) or genotype F(1,18)=0.386; p=0.542) but there was a significant interaction F(1,18)=5.433; p=0.0316, and post-hoc tests showed that Cre+ females had significantly more GluR2/3+ cells than Cre- females (p=0.045).</p><p>2. There were no significant differences among groups for SOM+ cells. Thus, there was an effect in dorsal (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>) but not ventral hippocampus. Thus, SOM cells were spared in Cre+ females dorsally but not ventrally. A two-way ANOVA showed no effect of sex (F(1,17)=0.718; p=0.408) or genotype F (1, 17)=0.769; P=0.393).</p><p>3. There were no significant differences in numbers of parvalbumin+ cells, like dorsal hippocampus (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Thus, parvalbumin cells were similar regardless of genotype in dorsal and ventral hippocampus. A two-way ANOVA showed no significant effect of sex (F(1,16)=0.401; p=0.536) or genotype (F(1,16)=0.221; p=0.645).</p></caption>

<caption><title>The latency to SE, interval between SE and diazepam administration, and interval between pilocarpine and diazepam injections were not significantly different in experimental groups.</title><p><bold>A.</bold> A timeline of experimental procedures is shown for the day of pilocarpine-induced SE. Pilocarpine was injected and the first seizure stage 3 or greater was noted. The onset of SE was noted also. For females, diazepam (DZP) was injected 45 min after the first seizure (Sz). Males were administered DZP 2 hrs after pilocarpine (Pilo). The reason for the difference is that it made the latencies to SE, interval between SE and DZP injection, and interval between pilocarpine and DZP injections similar.</p><p><bold>B.</bold> The mean ± SEM is shown for the time from pilocarpine to SE, SE to DZP injection, and pilocarpine to DZP injection. There were no sex differences: a two-way ANOVA with sex and type of measurement as main factors showed no effect of sex (F(1,45)=0004, p=0.949). However, there were differences between the types of measurements (F(2,45)=11.89, p&lt;0.0001).</p><p><bold>C.</bold> When Cre+ and Cre- females were compared, there was no effect of genotype (F(1,33)=2.33, p=0.136) but there was a significant effect of the type of measurement (F(2,33)=7.66, p=0.002).</p></caption>

<p>In this manuscript, Jain and colleagues explore whether increasing adult-born neurons is protective against status epilepticus and the development of spontaneous recurrent seizures (chronic epilepsy) in a mouse pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy. This is an <bold>important</bold> work that provides <bold>solid</bold> data, contradicting previous studies on suppressing chronic seizures by reduction in adult-born neurons.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>As adult-born granule neurons have been shown to play diverse roles, both positive and negative, to modulate hippocampal circuitry and function in epilepsy, understanding the mechanisms by which altered neurogenesis contribute to seizures is important for future therapeutic strategies. The work by Jain et al., demonstrates that increasing adult-born neurons (not increasing adult neurogenesis because BrdU birthdating was not performed in this study) before status epilepticus (SE) leads to a suppression in chronic seizures in the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy. This work is potentially interesting because previous studies showed suppressing adult-born neurons led to reduced chronic seizures.</p>
<p>To increase adult-born neurons, the authors conditionally delete the pro-apoptotic gene Bax using a tamoxifen inducible Nestin-CreERT2 which has been previously published to increase proliferation and survival of adult-born neurons by Sahay et al. (although this was not shown in this study). After 6 weeks of tamoxifen injection, the authors subject male and female mice to pilocarpine induced SE. In the first study, at 2 hours after pilocarpine, the authors examine latency to the first seizure, severity and total number of acute seizures, and power during SE. In the second study in a separate group of mice, the authors examine chronic seizure number and frequency, seizure duration, postictal depression, and seizure distribution/cluster seizures for 3 weeks after pilocarpine. Overall, the study concludes that increasing adult-born neurons in the normal adult brain can reduce epilepsy in females specifically.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The study is sex matched and reveals differences in response to increasing adult-born neurons in chronic seizures between male and females.</p>
<p>(2) The EEG recording parameters are stringent, and analysis of chronic seizures is comprehensive. In two separate experiments, the electrodes were implanted to record EEG from cortex as well as hippocampus. The recording is done for 10 hours post pilocarpine to analyze acute seizures, and for 3 weeks continuous video EEG recording was done to analyze chronic seizures.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Increased DCX alone (without birthdating with BrdU) could indicate increased survival of adult-born neurons, not proliferation or birth of newborn neurons per se. While prior work has demonstrated that tamoxifen injection in adult mice showed an increase in dentate gyrus neurogenesis based on studies of BrdU, Ki67, and DCX (Sahay et al., 2011), the dynamics of adult-born neurons (proliferation, differentiation, and/or survival) could be different in epileptic (pilocarpine-treated) animals. Other stages, e.g., proliferation of neural precursors or maturation of adult-born dentate granule cells, was not examined. Analysis of additional stages of adult neurogenesis may reveal additional cellular understanding and add impact of the work on the field.</p>

<p>As adult-born granule neurons have been shown to play diverse roles, both positive and negative, to modulate hippocampal circuitry and function in epilepsy, understanding the mechanisms by which altered neurogenesis contributes to seizures is important for future therapeutic strategies. The work by Jain et al. demonstrates that increasing adult neurogenesis before status epilepticus (SE) leads to a suppression of chronic seizures in the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy. This work is potentially interesting because previous studies showed suppressing neurogenesis led to reduced chronic seizures.</p>
<p>To increase neurogenesis, the authors conditionally delete the pro-apoptotic gene Bax using a tamoxifen-inducible Nestin-CreERT2 which has been previously published to increase proliferation and survival of adult-born neurons by Sahay et al. After 6 weeks of tamoxifen injection, the authors subjected male and female mice to pilocarpine-induced SE. In the first study, at 2 hours after pilocarpine, the authors examine latency to the first seizure, severity and total number of acute seizures, and power during SE. In the second study in a separate group of mice, at 3 weeks after pilocarpine, the authors examine chronic seizure number and frequency, seizure duration, postictal depression, and seizure distribution/cluster seizures. Overall, the study concludes that increasing adult neurogenesis in the normal adult brain can reduce epilepsy in females specifically. However, important BrdU birthdating experiments in both male and female mice need to be included to support the conclusions made by the authors. Furthermore, speculative mechanisms lacking direct evidence reduce enthusiasm for the findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There are two suggestions. First, BrdU birthdating of newborn neurons is important to add to the paper so that there is support for the conclusions. Second, speculative text reduced enthusiasm. In response, we clarified the conclusions. We do not think that the clarified conclusions require BrdU birthdating (discussed further below). We also removed two schematics (and associated text) that we think the reviewer was referring to when speculation was mentioned.</p>
<p>We also want to point out something minor -that the times of injections listed above are not correct.</p>
<p>a. Seizures were not measured 2 hrs after pilocarpine; that is when the anticonvulsant diazepam was administered to males.</p>
<p>b. Seizures were not measured 3 weeks after pilocarpine; the duration of recording was 3 weeks.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) BrdU birthdating is required for conclusions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We think that the Reviewer was suggesting birthdating because we were not clear about our conclusions, and we apologize for the confusion. The Reviewer stated that we concluded: “conditionally deleting Bax in Nestin-Cre+ cells leads to increased neurogenesis and hilar ectopic granule cells, thereby reducing chronic seizures.”  (Note this is a quote from the review).</p>
<p>However, we did not intend to conclude that. We intended to conclude that conditionally deleting Bax in Nestin-Cre+ mice reduced chronic seizures in the mouse model of epilepsy that we used. Also, that conclusion only pertained to females. Please note we did not conclude that hilar ectopic granule cells led to reduced seizures. We also concluded that Bax deletion increased neurogenesis in female mice. We have revised the text to make the conclusions clear.</p>
<p>Abstract, starting on line 67:</p>
<p>The results suggest that selective Bax deletion to increase adult neurogenesis can reduce experimental epilepsy, and the effect shows a striking sex difference.</p>
<p>Results, starting on line 448:</p>
<p>Because Cre+ epileptic females had increased numbers of immature neurons relative to Cre- females at the time of SE, and prior studies show that Cre+ females had less neuronal damage after SE (Jain et al., 2019), female Cre+ mice might have had reduced chronic seizures because of high numbers of immature neurons. However, the data do not prove a causal role.</p>
<p>Starting on line 477:</p>
<p>...we hypothesized that female Cre+ mice would have fewer hilar ectopic GCs than female Cre- mice. However, that female Cre+ mice did not have fewer hilar ectopic GCs.</p>
<p>Discussion, starting on line 563:</p>
<p>The chronic seizures, measured 4-7 weeks after pilocarpine, were reduced in frequency by about 50% in females. Therefore, increasing young adult-born neurons before the epileptogenic insult can protect against epilepsy. However, we do not know if the protective effect was due to the greater number of new neurons before SE or other effects. Past data would suggest that increased numbers of newborn neurons before SE leads to a reduced SE duration and less neuronal damage in the days after SE. That would be likely to lessen the epilepsy after SE. However, there may have been additional effects of larger numbers of newborn neurons prior to SE.</p>
<p>Conclusions, starting on line 745:</p>
<p>In the past, suppressing adult neurogenesis before SE was followed by fewer hilar ectopic GCs and reduced chronic seizures. Here, we show that the opposite - enhancing adult neurogenesis before SE and increased hilar ectopic GCs - do not necessarily reduce seizures. We suggest instead that protection of the hilar neurons from SE-induced excitotoxicity was critical to reducing seizures. The reason for the suggestion is that the survival of hilar neurons would lead to persistence of the normal inhibitory functions of hilar neurons, protecting against seizures. However, this is only a suggestion at the present time because we do not have data to prove it. Additionally, because protection was in females, sex differences are likely to have played an important role. Regardless, the results show that enhancing neurogenesis of young adult-born neurons in Nestin-Cre+ mice had a striking effect in the pilocarpine model, reducing chronic seizures in female mice.</p>
<p>The Reviewer is correct that it would be interesting to know when the increase in adult neurogenesis occurred that was critical to the effect. For example, was it the initial increase following Bax deletion but before pilocarpine-induced SE, or the increase in neurogenesis following SE, or increased adult neurogenesis in the chronic stage of epilepsy. It also might be that related aspects of neurogenesis played a role such as the degree that maturation was normal in adult-born neurons. We have not pursued the experiments to identify these aspects of neurogenesis because of how much work it would entail. Also, approaches to conclude cause-effect relationships are going to be difficult.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Speculation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We removed the text and supplemental figures with schematics that we think were the overly speculative parts of the paper the Reviewer mentioned.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The study is sex-matched and reveals differences in response to increasing adult neurogenesis in chronic seizures between males and females.</p>
<p>(2) The EEG recording parameters are stringent, and the analysis of chronic seizures is comprehensive. In two separate experiments, the electrodes were implanted to record EEG from the cortex as well as the hippocampus. The recording was done for 10 hours post pilocarpine to analyze acute seizures, and for 3 weeks continuous video EEG recording was done to analyze chronic seizures.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Cells generated during acute seizures have different properties to cells generated in chronic seizures. In this study, the authors employ two bouts of neurogenesis stimuli (Bax deletion dependent and SE dependent), with two phases of epilepsy (acute and chronic). There are multiple confounding variables to effectively conclude that conditionally deleting Bax in Nestin-Cre+ cells leads to increased neurogenesis and hilar ectopic granule cells, thereby reducing chronic seizures.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned above, with a clarification of our conclusions we think we have addressed the concern. We believe that we conditionally deleted Bax in Nestin-expressing cells. We believe we found that female mice had reduced loss of hilar mossy cells and somatostatin-expressing neurons after SE, and fewer chronic seizures after SE. While it makes sense that increased neurogenesis caused the reduced seizures, we acknowledge it was not proved.</p>
<p>We do not make conclusions about the role of hilar ectopic granule cells. However, we note that they appear to have been similar in number across groups, which suggests they played no role in the results. This is very surprising and therefore adds novelty.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Related to this is the degree of neurogenesis between Cre+ and Cre- mice and the nature of the sex differences. It is crucial to know the rate/fold change of increased neurogenesis before pilocarpine treatment and whether it is different between male and female mice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that if sex differences in adult neurogenesis could be shown by a sex difference in rate, fold change, maturation, and other characteristics.  However, sex differences can also be shown by a change in doublecortin (DCX), which is what we did. We respectfully submit that we do not see an exhaustive study is critical.</p>
<p>As a result, we have clarified DCX was studied either before SE or in the period of chronic seizures:</p>
<p>Results, starting on line 406:</p>
<p>III. Before and after epileptogenesis, Cre+ female mice exhibited more immature neurons than Cre- female mice but that was not true for male mice.</p>
<p>Starting on line 446:</p>
<p>Therefore, elevated DCX occurred after chronic seizures had developed in Cre+ mice but the effect was limited to females.</p>
<p>Discussion, starting on line 592:</p>
<p>This study showed that conditional deletion of Bax from Nestin-expressing progenitors increased young adult-born neurons in the DG when studied 6 weeks after deletion and using DCX as a marker of immature neurons.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors observe more hilar Prox1 cells in Cre+ mice compared to Cre- mice. The authors should confirm the source of the hilar Prox1+ cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an excellent question but it is unclear that it is critical to the seizures since both sexes showed more hilar Prox1 cells in Cre+ mice but only the females had fewer seizures than Cre- mice. This is the additional text to describe the results (starting on Line 493):</p>
<p>In past studies, hilar ectopic GCs have been suggested to promote seizures (Scharfman et al., 2000; Jung et al., 2006; Cho et al., 2015). Therefore, we asked if the numbers of hilar ectopic GCs correlated with the numbers of chronic seizures. When Cre- and Cre+ mice were compared (both sexes pooled), there was a correlation with numbers of chronic seizures (Fig. 6D1) but it suggested that more hilar ectopic GCs improved rather than worsened seizures. However, the correlation was only in Cre- mice, and when sexes were separated there was no correlation (Fig. 6D3).</p>
<p>When seizure-free interval was examined with sexes pooled, there was a correlation for Cre+ mice (Fig. 6D2) but not Cre- mice. Strangely, the correlations of Cre+ mice with seizure-free interval (Fig. 6D2, D4) suggest ectopic GCs shorten the seizure-free interval and therefore worsen epilepsy, opposite of the correlative data for numbers of chronic seizures. In light of these inconsistent results it seems that hilar ectopic granule cells had no consistent effect on chronic seizures.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The biggest weakness is the lack of mechanism. The authors postulate a hypothetical mechanism to reconcile how increasing and decreasing adult-born neurons in GCL and hilus and loss of hilar mossy and SOM cells would lead to opposite effects - more or fewer seizures. The authors suggest the reason could be due to rewiring or no rewiring of hilar ectopic GCs, respectively, but do not provide clear-cut evidence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As we mention above, we removed the supplemental figures with schematics because they probably were what seemed overly speculative.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that mechanism is not proven by our study. However, we would like to mention that in our view, showing preservation of hilar mossy cells and SOM cells, but not PV cells, does add mechanistic data to the paper. We understand more experiments are necessary.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Jain et al explore whether increasing adult neurogenesis is protective against status epilepticus (SE) and the development of spontaneous recurrent seizures (chronic epilepsy) in a mouse pilocarpine model of TLE. The authors increase adult neurogenesis via conditional deletion of Bax, a pro-apoptotic gene, in Nestin-CreERT2Baxfl/fl mice. Cre- littermates are used as controls for comparisons. In addition to characterizing seizure phenotypes, the authors also compare the abundance of hilar ectopic granule cells, mossy cells, hilar SOM interneurons, and the degree of neuronal damage between mice with increased neurogenesis (Cre+) vs Cre- controls. The authors find less severe SE and a reduction in chronic seizures in female mice with pre-insult increased adult-born neurons. Immunolabeling experiments show these females also have preservation of hilar mossy cells and somatostatin interneurons, suggesting the pre-insult increase in adult neurogenesis is protective.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The finding that female mice with increased neurogenesis at the time of pilocarpine exposure have fewer seizures despite having increased hilar ectopic granule cells is very interesting.</p>
<p>(2) The work builds nicely on the group's prior studies.</p>
<p>(3) Apparent sex differences are a potentially important finding.</p>
<p>(4) The immunohistochemistry data are compelling.</p>
<p>(5) Good controls for EEG electrode implantation effects.</p>
<p>(6) Nice analysis of most of the SE EEG data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) In addition to the Cre- littermate controls, a no Tamoxifen treatment group is necessary to control for both insertional effects and leaky expression of the Nestin-CreERT2 transgene.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>About “leaky” expression, we have not found expression to be leaky. We checked by injecting a Cre-dependent virus so that mCherry would be expressed in those cells that had Cre.  The results were published as Supplemental Figure 9 in Jain et al. (2019).</p>
<p>In the revised manuscript we also mention a study that examined three Nestin-CreERT2 mouse lines (Sun et al., 2014). One of the mouse lines was ours. The leaky expression was not in the mouse line we use. We have added these points to the revised manuscript:</p>
<p>Methods, section II starting on line 791:</p>
<p>Although Nestin-Cre-ERT2 mouse lines have been criticized because  they can have leaky expression, the mouse line used in the present study did not (Sun et al., 2014), which we confirmed (Jain et al., 2019).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors suggest sex differences; however, experimental procedures differed between male and female mice (as the authors note). Female mice received diazepam 40 minutes after the first pilocarpine-induced seizure onset, whereas male mice did not receive diazepam until 2 hours post-onset. The former would likely lessen the effects of SE on the female mice. Therefore, sex differences cannot be accurately assessed by comparing these two groups, and instead, should be compared between mice with matching diazepam time courses.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that a shorter delay between pilocarpine and diazepam would be likely to lead to less damage. However, the latency from pilocarpine to SE varied, making the time from the onset of SE to diazepam variable. Most of the variability was in females. By timing the diazepam injection differently in males and females, we could make the time from the onset of SE to diazepam similar between females and males. We had added a supplemental figure to show that our approach led to no significant differences between females and males in the latency to SE, time between SE and diazepam injection, and time between pilocarpine and diazepam injection. We also show that Cre+ females and Cre- females were not different in these times, so it could not be related to the neuroprotection of Cre+ females.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Additionally, the authors state that female mice that received diazepam 2 hours post-onset had severe brain damage. This is concerning as it would suggest that SE is more severe in the female than in the male mice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We regret that our language was misleading. We intended to say females had more morbidity and mortality than males (lack of appetite and grooming, death in the days after SE) when we gave DZP 2 hrs after Pilo. We actually don’t know why because there were no differences in severity of SE. We think the females had worse outcome when they had a short latency to SE.  These females had a longer period of SE before DZP than males, probably leading to worse outcome. To correct this we gave DZP to females sooner. Then morbidity and mortality was improved in females.</p>
<p>Interestingly, after we did this we saw females did not always have a short latency to SE. We maintained the same regimen however, to be consistent. As the new supplemental figure (above) shows, there were significant sex differences in the latency to SE, time between SE and DZP, and time between pilocarpine and DZP.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Some sample sizes are low, particularly when sex and genotypes are split (n=3-5), which could cause a type II statistical error.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree and have noted this limitation in the Discussion:</p>
<p>Additional considerations, starting on line 739:</p>
<p>This study is limited by the possibilities of type II statistical errors in those instances where we divided groups by genotype and sex, leading to comparisons of 3-5 mice/group.</p>

<p>(4) Several figures show a datapoint in the sex and genotype-separated graphs that is missing from the corresponding male and female pooled graphs (Figs. 2C, 2D, 4B).</p>

<p>We are very grateful to the Reviewer for pointing out the errors. They are corrected.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) In Suppl Figs. 1B &amp; 1C, subsections 1c and 2c, the EEG trace recording is described as the end of SE; however, SE appears to still be ongoing in these traces in the form of periodic discharges in the EEG.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The Reviewer is correct.  It is a misconception that SE actually ends completely. The most intense seizure activity may, but what remains is abnormal activity that can last for days. Other investigators observe the same and have suggested that it argues against the concept of a silent period between SE and chronic epilepsy. We had discussed this in our prior papers and had referenced how we define SE.  In the revised manuscript we add the information to the Methods section instead of referencing a prior study:</p>
<p>Methods, starting on line 899:</p>
<p>SE duration was defined in light of the fact that the EEG did not return to normal after the initial period of intense activity. Instead, intermittent spiking occurred for at least 24 hrs, as we previously described (Jain et al., 2019) and has been described by others (Mazzuferi et al., 2012; Bumanglag and Sloviter, 2018; Smith et al., 2018). We therefore chose a definition that captured the initial, intense activity. We defined the end of this time as the point when the amplitude of the EEG deflections were reduced to 50% or less of the peak deflections during the initial hour of SE. Specifically, we selected the time after the onset of SE when the EEG amplitude in at least 3 channels had dropped to approximately 2 times the amplitude of the EEG during the first hour of SE, and remained depressed for at least 10 min (Fig. S2 in (Jain et al., 2019). Thus, the duration of SE was defined as the time between the onset and this definition of the &quot;end&quot; of SE.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) In Results section II.D and associated Fig.3, what the authors refer to as &quot;postictal EEG depression&quot; is more appropriately termed &quot;postictal EEG suppression&quot;. Also, postictal EEG suppression has established criteria to define it that should be used.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We find suppression is typical in studies of ECT or humans (Esmaeili et al., 2023; Gascoigne et al., 2023; Hahn et al., 2023; Kavakbasi et al., 2023; Langroudi et al., 2023; Karl et al., 2024; Vilan et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2024) and animal research uses the term postictal depression(Kanner et al., 2010; Krishnan and Bazhenov, 2011; Riljak et al., 2012; Singh et al., 2012; Carballosa-Gonzalez et al., 2013; Kommajosyula et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2018; Uva and de Curtis, 2020; Medvedeva et al., 2023). Therefore we think depression is a more suitable term.</p>

<p>We thank the Reviewer for the intriguing possibility. We now mention it in the manuscript:</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The main claim of the study is that increasing adult neurogenesis decreases chronic seizures. However, to quantify adult-born neurons, DCX immunoreactivity is used as the sole metric to determine neurogenesis. This is insufficient as changes in DCX-expressing cells could also be an indicator of altered maturation, survival, and/or migration, not proliferation per se. To claim that increasing adult neurogenesis is associated with a reduction of chronic seizures, the authors should perform a pulse/chase (birth dating) experiment with BrdU and co-labeling with DCX.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We think that increased DCX does reflect increased adult neurogenesis. However, we agree that one does not know if it was due to increased proliferation, survival, etc. We also note that this mouse line has been studied thoroughly to show there was increased neurogenesis with BrdU, Ki67 and DCX. We mention that paper in the revised text:</p>
<p>Methods, starting on line 786:</p>
<p>It was shown that after tamoxifen injection in adult mice there is an increase in dentate gyrus neurogenesis based on studies of bromo-deoxyuridine, Ki67, and doublecortin (Sahay et al., 2011).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) As mentioned above, analysis of DCX staining alone months after TAM injections is limited. Instead, the cells could be labelled by BrdU prior to TAM injection, following which quantification of BrdU+/Prox1+ cells at 6 weeks post TAM injection should be performed in Cre+ and Cre- mice (males and females) to yield the rate of neurogenesis increase.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully disagree that birthdating cells is critical. Using DCX staining just before SE, we know the size of the population of cells that are immature at the time of SE. This is what we think is most important because these immature neurons are those that appear to affect SE, as we have already shown.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) To confirm the source of the hilar Prox1+ cells, a dual BrdU/EdU labeling approach would be beneficial. BrdU injection could be given before TAM injection and EdU injection before pilocarpine to label different cohorts of neural stem cells. Co-staining with Prox1 at different time points will help in identifying the origin of hilar ectopic cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful for the ideas of the Reviewer. We hesitate to do these experiments now because it seems like a new study to find out where hilar granule cells come from.</p>
