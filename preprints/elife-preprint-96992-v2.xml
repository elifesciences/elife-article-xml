<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Mutational activation of <italic>KRAS</italic> occurs commonly in lung carcinogenesis and, with the recent FDA approval of covalent inhibitors of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> such as sotorasib or adagrasib, KRAS oncoproteins are important pharmacological targets in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, not all KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-driven NSCLCs respond to these inhibitors, and the emergence of drug resistance in those patients that do respond can be rapid and pleiotropic. Hence, based on a backbone of covalent inhibition of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>, efforts are underway to develop effective combination therapies. Here we report that inhibition of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> signaling increases autophagy in KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> expressing lung cancer cells. Moreover, the combination of DCC-3116, a selective ULK1/2 inhibitor, plus sotorasib displays cooperative/synergistic suppression of human KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-driven lung cancer cell proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic> and superior tumor control <italic>in vivo</italic>. Additionally, in genetically engineered mouse models of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-driven NSCLC, inhibition of either KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> or ULK1/2 decreases tumor burden and increases mouse survival. Consequently, these data suggest that ULK1/2-mediated autophagy is a pharmacologically actionable cytoprotective stress response to inhibition of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> in lung cancer.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is responsible for ∼50,000 deaths/year in the USA. Amongst the most common genetic drivers of LUAD are mutations in <italic>KRAS</italic> that encode KRAS-4A and -4B oncoproteins among which the substitution of cysteine for glycine at codon 12 (KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>) is the most common mutation and is associated with exposure to tobacco smoke<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. For many years, RAS (H-, K- or N) oncoproteins were considered undruggable until the seminal work of Ostrem et al. that demonstrated the feasibility of developing covalent inhibitors of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> that bind into the Switch II pocket of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-GDP and derivatize the reactive thiol of cysteine 12 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We and others have previously reported that inhibition of RAS&gt;RAF&gt;MEK&gt;ERK signaling in melanoma or pancreatic cancer cells elicits increased autophagy, an intracellular macromolecule and organelle recycling mechanism, through the LKB1&gt;AMPK&gt;ULK1 signaling axis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Liver kinase B1 (LKB1) activates AMP kinases in response to cellular nutrient changes to maintain homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. However, induction of autophagy has also been reported in response to MEK inhibition in models of KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>-driven lung cancer with loss of LKB1 expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, suggesting that LKB1 is dispensable for increases in autophagy in lung cancer. LKB1 silencing is frequently observed in patients with KRAS-driven lung cancer, and such patients exhibit decreased overall survival and are more refractory to current therapeutic treatments than in LKB1 proficient KRAS-driven lung cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. With the advent of FDA-approved covalent KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibitors, it is imperative to investigate if autophagy occurs following inhibition of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> signaling, especially since MEK inhibitors offer little clinical benefit accompanied by toxicity to lung cancer patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. This prompted us to explore if treatment with sotorasib leads to an increase in autophagy in KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> mutant lung cancer cells with and without the expression of LKB1.</p>
<p>At present, the only FDA-approved therapeutics that inhibit autophagy are the 4-amino-quinolone lysosomal inhibitors chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Originally approved for treating malaria, HCQ acts by inhibiting Toll-like receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. It was also reported that HCQ inhibits acidification of the lysosome, thereby inhibiting auto-lysosome activity, although the precise mechanism of this remains obscure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Clinically, high concentrations of HCQ are required to achieve modest inhibition of autophagy in patients, suggesting that the inhibitory potency of these compounds may limit clinical responses. Indeed, co-targeting lysosomal function in combination with RAS-driven signaling has recently been tested in RAS-driven cancers in several clinical trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04214418, NCT04132505, NCT04386057, NCT04145297). However, there is a lack of clinical investigation on targeting autophagy with selective autophagy inhibitors in patients.</p>
<p>Autophagy is a complex intracellular recycling process important for maintaining cellular homeostasis under stressed conditions. The genetics and biochemistry of autophagy, first revealed in yeast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, indicate numerous points of regulation of which the initiation and formation of the autophagosome, as well as the fusion of the autophagosome to the lysosome are of key importance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> ULK1/2 are protein serine/threonine kinases that form a complex with FIP200, ATG13 and ATG101, which integrates upstream signals from mTORC1 and AMPK energy-sensing pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Upon activation, ULK1/2 phosphorylate a number of substrates including ATG13 (at serine 318, pS318) to initiate the formation of autophagosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. There remains interest in the development of selective inhibitors of autophagy for use in a number of disease indications. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> DCC-3116 is one such “switch-control” ULK1/2 inhibitor, which is currently in Phase 1/2 clinical trials either as a monotherapy or in combination with inhibitors of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>, MEK1/2 or EGFR (NCT04892017 &amp; NCT05957367).</p>
<p>Here, we test the anti-tumor effects of DCC-3116 against preclinical models of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-driven lung cancer either alone or in combination with sotorasib. We observed that cultured KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-driven lung cancer cells increase autophagy in response to inhibition of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>&gt;RAF&gt;MEK&gt;ERK signaling. In addition, combined inhibition of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> plus ULK1/2 leads to decreased cell proliferation and tumor growth. Moreover, using GEM models of ether KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>/TP53<sup>R172H</sup>- or KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>/LKB1<sup>Null</sup>-driven lung cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, we demonstrate that LKB1 is dispensable for increases in autophagy following KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibition. Furthermore, LKB1 silencing diminishes the sensitivity of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>/LKB1<sup>Null</sup>-driven lung cancer perhaps through the emergence of mixed adenosquamous cell carcinomas and mucinous adenocarcinomas. Adenosquamous carcinomas are observed in up to 4% of lung cancers and the emergence of these tumors is observed as a resistance mechanism to current therapeutics in lung cancer patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Patients with ASC tend to exhibit substantially decreased overall survival compared to patients with adenocarcinomas or squamous carcinomas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. These data suggest that KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> mutant lung tumors with adenosquamous pathology may not respond to KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> or ULK inhibition. Clinical acquired resistance to sotorasib and adagrasib is emerging in KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> mutant lung cancer patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Here, we demonstrate that KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>/LKB1<sup>Null</sup>-driven lung cancer cells that acquire resistance to sotorasib increase expression of RAS&gt;RAF&gt;MEK&gt;ERK signaling, and no longer increase autophagy after sotorasib treatment. These cells do induce autophagy after MEK1/2 inhibition and decrease cellular proliferation and viability after treatment with trametinib, suggesting that sotorasib-resistant cells are still vulnerable to downstream KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> signaling inhibition.</p>

<title>Human KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-driven lung cancer cells are sensitive to co-inhibition of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> and ULK1/2</title>
<p>To determine if direct inhibition of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> in lung cancer cells influences autophagy, human KRAS<sup>G12X</sup>-driven lung cancer cell lines were engineered to express a chimeric fluorescent <underline>a</underline>utophagy reporter (FAR) comprised of mCherry fused to EGFP fused to LC3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. LC3 targets the chimeric FAR to the autophagosome where the pH sensitive EGFP moiety is quenched in the acidic environment of the autolysosome (pH&lt;5). Hence, an increase in the ratio of mCherry:EGFP fluorescence is indicative of increased autophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. All KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-driven lung cancer cells displayed dose-dependent increases in autophagy following sotorasib treatment as indicated by an increase in the mCherry:EGFP ratio detected in live cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1A-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figs. S1A-D</xref>). Since sotorasib is reported to bind to &gt;300 proteins, we ruled out non-specific effects of sotorasib on autophagy, by treating a KRAS<sup>G12V</sup>-driven NSCLC cell line (COR-L23) with sotorasib, which failed to show any change in mCherry:EGFP fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1E</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Moreover, as predicted by previous experiments, all KRAS<sup>G12X</sup>-driven NSCLC cell lines displayed a dose-dependent increase in autophagy following treatment with trametinib, a MEK1/2 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figs. S1F-J</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Next, we tested the effects of DCC-3116 on autophagy in KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-driven NSCLC cell lines. As anticipated, DCC-3116 inhibited both basal and sotorasib-induced autophagy in all KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-driven cell lines as assessed using the FAR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1A-C</xref>). In addition, DCC-3116 treatment, either alone or in combination with sotorasib, led to decreased pS318-ATG13, one of ULK1’s immediate downstream substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figs. S2A-C</xref>). To test if DCC-3116 might show additive or synergistic anti-proliferative effects when combined with sotorasib, human KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-driven NSCLC cells were treated with varying concentrations of both drugs for 72 hours with cell proliferation assessed using a cell viability assay. Interestingly, we observed synergistic anti-proliferative effects of DCC-3116 plus sotorasib in NCI-H2122 and Calu-1 cell lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1G-H</xref>), but not in NCI-H358 cells, which are noted to be exquisitely sensitive to single agent sotorasib (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>). Using the Incucyte platform, we measured cell proliferation over time and noted that the combination of sotorasib plus DCC-3116 was superior to either single agent in NCI-H2122 and Calu-1 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1D-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figs.

<p>We next proceeded to test the anti-tumor effects of DCC-3116, either alone or in combination with sostorasib, against xenografted tumors derived from injection of NCI-H2122, Calu-1 or NCI-H358 cells into immunocompromised mice. Here, we observed clear cooperation of sotorasib plus DCC-3116 in tumors derived from NCI-H2122 and Calu-1 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1J-K</xref>) but not from NCI-H358 cells, which are noted for their sensitivity to low-concentrations of sotorasib (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1L</xref>). To confirm the inhibitory activity of sotorasib in the cell lines used, cell extracts of control vs. sotorasib treated NSCLC cells were immunoblotted for phospho-ERK1/2. As expected, pERK1/2 was decreased in all cell lines following 2 hours of sotorasib treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2G-I</xref>). In addition, we detected by immunoblotting the expected electrophoretic mobility shift of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>, which is indicative of covalent binding of sotorasib (561 daltons) to cysteine 12 of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figs.

<title>Genetic inhibition of ULK1 decreases autophagy and cooperates with sotorasib to reduce cell viability</title>
<p>As an alternate way to assess the role of ULK1/2 in sotorasib-induced autophagy, we conditionally expressed a kinase-inactive, dominant negative form of ULK1 (ULK1<sup>K46N</sup>) under the control of a tetracycline transactivator (Tet<sup>ON</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Doxycycline treatment of NCI-H2122/Tet<sup>ON</sup>::ULK1<sup>K46N</sup> cells led to a substantial increase in total ULK1 expression within 8 hours, which could be inferred to also be phosphorylated at known sites (pS555 and pS747) of regulatory phosphorylation of ULK1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2A-B</xref>). As anticipated, expression of ULK1<sup>K46N</sup> led to decreased phosphorylation of pS318-ATG13 in a manner comparable to treatment with DCC-3116 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). In addition, expression of ULK1<sup>K46N</sup> led to a decrease in both basal and sotorasib-induced autophagy as assessed using the FAR. Finally, expression of ULK1<sup>K46N</sup> displayed synergistic anti-proliferative effects in NCI-H2122 cells when combined with sotorasib for 48 hours, suggesting that both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of ULK1 signaling had similar effects on NCI-H2122 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>).</p>

<title>Either LKB1 silencing or expression of dominant-negative TP53<sup>R172H</sup> cooperates with KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-in GEM models of lung cancer</title>
<p>To complement the use of cultured human lung cancer cells, and to further test how additional genetic alterations influence KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-driven lung tumor progression and treatment response, we generated genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-driven lung cancer. To that end, we crossed <italic>Kras<sup>LSL-G12C/+</sup></italic> (K)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> mice to either: 1. <italic>Stk11<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> <sup>37</sup>mice to generate KL mice or; 2. <italic>Trp53<sup>wm-R172H</sup></italic> to generate KP mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Intranasal administration of an adenovirus encoding CRE recombinase under the control of a CMV promoter (Ad-CMV-CRE) to KL mice initiates expression of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> plus silencing of LKB1 in alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells. Similar treatment of KP mice initiates expression of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> plus dominant-negative TP53<sup>R172H</sup> in AT2 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3A</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). At euthanasia, 14 weeks post-initiation (p.i.), compared to <italic>Kras<sup>LSL-G12C/+</sup></italic> (K) mice, KL and KP mice displayed both accelerated lung cancer formation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>) and increased tumor burden (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Histopathological analysis of H&amp;E stained sections of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> only-driven lung tumors, also at 14 weeks p.i., indicated that they comprised mainly of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) and low-grade small lung adenocarcinomas. KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>/LKB1<sup>Null</sup>-driven lung tumors comprised AHH, adenocarcinomas, adenosquamous carcinomas (ASC) and mucinous adenocarcinomas. Finally, KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>/TP53<sup>R172H</sup>-driven lung tumors consisted of AAH and a mix of low- and higher-grade lung adenocarcinomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3B</xref>). Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor sections indicated that phospho-ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) was detected in KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-driven lung tumors regardless of cooperating alterations in LKB1 or TP53 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). However, the intensity of pERK1/2 staining across all three GEM models, and even between lesions in the same lung lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3C</xref>) displayed substantial variability. Moreover, phospho-AKT1-3 (a surrogate for activation of PI3’-kinase signaling) was low across all KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-driven lung tumors, albeit that some individual cells in tumors had readily detected pAKT1-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3D</xref>). Similar analysis confirmed the absence of LKB1 in KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>/LKB1<sup>Null</sup>-driven lung tumors, but its presence in KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> only and KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>/TP53<sup>R172H</sup>-driven lung tumors. Similarly, KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>/TP53<sup>R172H</sup>-driven lung tumors displayed elevated expression of TP53 that was not observed in KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> only or in KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>/LKB1<sup>Null</sup>-driven lung tumors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Previously published data demonstrated that KRAS-driven lung cancer cells occasionally suppress expression of NK2 homeobox 2 (NKX2.1), a master-regulatory transcription factor required for normal lung development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. In addition, KRAS-driven but NKX2.1 deficient lung tumors display a mucinous adenocarcinoma pathology and other transcriptional features of a pulmonary-to-gastric lineage switch <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Although mucinous adenocarcinomas were detected in lung sections from KL mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>), these KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>/LKB1<sup>Null</sup> tumor cells retained expression of NKX2.1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3E</xref>), and some cells also expressed the gastrointestinal transcription factor HNF4<italic>α</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3E</xref>). Finally, we assessed expression of the AT2 specific pro-surfactant protein C (SPC), a surfactant important for the function of normal lung<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, and noted its uniform expression in KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> only driven lung tumors, but more variable expression in KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>/LKB1<sup>Null</sup>- and KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>/TP53<sup>R172H</sup>-driven lung tumors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p>

<p>To test if combined inhibition of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> plus ULK1/2 would inhibit growth of established KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>/LKB1<sup>Null</sup> lung tumors, tumor-bearing KL mice at 10 weeks p.i. were administered sotorasib or DCC-3116 either alone or in combination for 8 weeks or until the mice met pre-determined euthanasia endpoints (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Compared to vehicle, all three treatments significantly increased the survival of tumor-bearing KL mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). Although there was a trend towards improved survival of KL mice treated with the combination of sotorasib plus DCC-3116, these differences were not statistically significant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). We also utilized micro-computed tomography (microCT) to monitor the response of tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> that were large enough to be detected throughout drug treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4A</xref>). As expected, lung tumors in vehicle treated mice rapidly increased in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4A</xref>). The growth of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>/LKB1<sup>Null</sup> tumors in mice treated with sotorasib, DCC-3116 or the combination was delayed compared to those in vehicle treated mice, but tumors ultimately progressed on treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4</xref>). However, some lung tumors in mice treated with the sotorasib plus DCC-3116 drug combination did not appear to change their size over the course of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4A</xref>). Throughout the course of treatment, we observed substantial (≤20%) weight loss in four out of five sotorasib only treated mice and one combination treated mouse that reached our euthanasia criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4B</xref>). Following euthanasia, we performed immunohistochemical analysis on lung sections from control vs drug treated mice. In KL mice treated with sotorasib, either alone or in combination with DCC-3116, we noted a predominance of ASC and mucinous adenocarcinomas at the expense of AAH and adenocarcinoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4C</xref>). These results suggest that KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>/LKB1<sup>Null</sup>-driven ASC or mucinous adenocarcinomas may be less sensitive to sotorasib treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figs. S4A,C</xref>). Intriguingly, single-agent DCC-3116 treatment also slowed the growth of established tumors compared to vehicle treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4A</xref>), but this did not inhibit the growth of AAH or adenocarcinomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4C</xref>). Immunohistochemistry revealed the expected decrease in pERK1/2 and pAKT1-3 staining in tumors treated with sotorasib, either alone or in combination with DCC-3116, compared to mice treated with vehicle or single-agent DCC-3116 alone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4G-I</xref>). NKX2.1 expression was detected in all lung tumors regardless of the treatment group (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). Finally, many mice, regardless of the treatment type, developed lung tumors with the aforementioned mucinous adenocarcinoma phenotype, expressing HNF4<italic>α</italic>and stained postitive for various mucins (Alcian-Blue/PAS-positive) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>).</p>
<p>To further compare and contrast the effects of sotorasib and DCC-3116, either alone or in combination in GEM models of lung cancer and because of noted correlations between loss of LKB1 and insensitivity of cancers to various types of therapy, we employed our <italic>KP</italic> mouse model. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>/TP53<sup>R172H</sup>- driven lung tumorigenesis was initiated in adult <italic>KP</italic> mice and at 10 weeks p.i. tumor bearing mice were treated with: 1. Vehicle control; 2. Sotorasib; 3. DCC-3116 or; 4. Combination of sotorasib plus DCC-3116 for 4 weeks (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>) at which time mice were euthanized for analysis as described above. Interestingly, compared to control, there was a significant reduction in lung tumor burden in response to all three treatments (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). In addition, in all sotorasib treated mice, either alone or in combination with DCC-3116, regression of pre-existing lung tumors was detected by microCT scanning (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Fig. S5</xref>). In mice treated with single agent DCC-3116, although an overall reduction in tumor burden was observed, some tumors detectable by microCT scanning continued to increase in size throughout treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Fig. S5</xref>). Moreover, in this experiment, we noted no weight loss in mice in any of the three treatment groups (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Immunohistochemical analysis of lung sections from mice again revealed decreased pERK1/2 in mice treated with sotorasib either alone or in combination with DCC-3116, although pERK1/2 was detected in some areas of the lung (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5D-E</xref>). Vehicle treated KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>/TP53<sup>R172H</sup>-driven lung tumors had detectable pAKT, which was decreased by all three treatments (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5D</xref>, F).

<title>KL lung-cancer-derived cells that acquire resistance to sotorasib increase RAS and pERK1/2 expression and do not increase autophagy after sotorasib treatment</title>
<p>To complement our <italic>in vivo</italic> work with GEM models and to better understand how acquired sotorasib resistance influences autophagy and treatment sensitivity, we generated KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>/LKB1<sup>Null</sup>-lung cancer-derived cell lines from suitably manipulated, drug naive KL mice. As expected, parental KL70 cells are sensitive to the anti-proliferative effects of both sotorasib and the MEK1/2 inhibitor, trametinib (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6A-D</xref>). In addition, pERK1/2 also is inhibited by both sotorasib and trametinib (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Next, we generated a sotorasib-resistant (SR) KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>/LKB1<sup>Null</sup>-driven lung cancer cell line by culturing parental KL70 cells over 12 weeks in gradually increasing concentrations of sotorasib until a resistant population emerged (KL70<sup>SR</sup> cells). KL70<sup>SR</sup> cells were entirely resistant to the anti-proliferative effects of sotorasib but remained sensitive to trametinib (Fig. D). Consistent with this, the level of pERK1/2 was sotorasib resistant but trametinib sensitive (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Indeed, KL70<sup>SR</sup> cells had a higher baseline level of both RAS and pERK1/2 expression compared to parental KL70 cells, which might explain their more rapid baseline proliferation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>).</p>

<p>We next tested differences in baseline and drug-induced autophagy in KL70 and KL70<sup>SR</sup> cells using the fluorescent autophagy reporter. As expected based on analysis of human KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-driven lung cancer cells, KL70 cells increased autophagy in response to either sotorasib or trametinib treatment, a further demonstration that LKB1 is not required for increased autophagy in response to inhibition of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>&gt;RAF&gt;MEK&gt;ERK inhibition (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). KL70<sup>SR</sup> cells treated with sotorasib displayed little induction of autophagy (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). However, trametinib elicited a robust induction of autophagy in KL70<sup>SR</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>), further suggesting that changes in autophagy levels are correlated to pERK1/2 levels in the cell. Because sotorasib did not induce autophagy in the KL70<sup>SR</sup> cells, it was not clear if the addition of an autophagy inhibitor would decrease cell viability in the sotorasib-resistant cells. Cell viability was measured after 72 hours of drug treatment in the KL70 and KL70<sup>SR</sup> cell lines (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> F-I). The combination of sotorasib and DCC-3116 did not lead to decreases in cell viability in the KL70<sup>SR</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> H). We next tested if there were any synergist decreases in cell viability with the combination of trametinib and DCC-3116 because there was a robust increase in autophagy levels with trametinib treatment in the KL70<sup>SR</sup> cells. KL70<sup>SR</sup> cells are exquisitely sensitive to trametinib at very low concentrations and therefor little synergy was observed with the tested concentrations (Fig. I).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Cancer cells exhibit increased autophagy in response to a variety of cellular stresses including nutrient deprivation or the application of pathway-targeted therapy, thereby allowing cancer cells to recycle a wide variety of macromolecules and organelles to promote cell viability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> Moreover, GEM models of lung or pancreatic cancer indicate that cancer cells employ autophagy - both cancer cell autonomous and from the mouse as a whole - at a several stages of cancer progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Recently, we and others have demonstrated that many RAS-driven cancer cells display increased autophagy in response to blockade of RAS&gt;RAF&gt;MEK&gt;ERK signaling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Moreover, in our work, combined inhibition of MEK1/2 (with trametinib) plus inhibition of lysosome function (with CQ or HCQ) displayed synergistic anti-proliferative activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, superior tumor control (compared to the single agents or standard of care) in <underline>c</underline>ell line- or <underline>p</underline>atient-<underline>d</underline>erived <underline>x</underline>enografts (CDX or PDX) models of pancreatic cancer and, in one patient with advanced pancreatic cancer, there was evidence of anti-tumor activity of the combination of trametinib plus hydroxychloroquine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. These data (and others) have led to a number of clinical trials, some of which are ongoing (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04214418, NCT04132505, NCT04386057, NCT04145297). Here we expand these observations using preclinical models of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-driven lung cancer. The management of this disease has been transformed by FDA approval of adagrasib and sotorasib, covalent inhibitors of the KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> oncoprotein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. However, as is generally true for single-agent pathway-targeted cancer therapy, the emergence of drug resistant disease can be rapid and pleiotropic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Our data suggest that combined inhibition of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> plus autophagy may have superior activity against KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-driven lung cancer. These data are in accord with a recent study in which HCQ-mediated inhibition of lysosome function sensitized a KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>/LKB1<sup>Null</sup>-driven GEM model of lung cancer to MEK1/2 inhibition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. An interesting aspect of these results is the apparent dispensability of LKB1 for the induction of autophagy in response to inhibition of KRAS signaling. Our work and that of others had concluded that LKB1 was important for trametinib-induced autophagy in pancreatic cancer cells, but this new data argues that LKB1 is not an obligate requirement for autophagy induction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Co-alterations in KRAS plus LKB1 are frequent in lung cancer and patients with these alterations are reported to display resistance to current therapeutic options such as chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. In addition, and perhaps surprisingly, we noted that DCC-3116 had substantial single-agent activity against KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-driven lung cancers in GEM models. Importantly, previous studies have demonstrated that combined inhibition of MEK1/2 plus autophagy does not lead to synergistic or cooperative decreases in cell proliferation or tumor growth in a GEM model of KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>/TP53<sup>Null</sup>-driven lung cancer in which LKB1 expression is retained<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Here, we show that combined inhibition of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> plus ULK1/2 in Calu-1 cells (KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>/LKB1<sup>WT</sup>/TP53<sup>null</sup>) decreased cell proliferation and tumor growth and that this combination was more effective than either single agent. Our findings demonstrate that inhibition of both KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> plus ULK1/2 kinases is synergistic in KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> mutant lung cancer cells with wild-type LKB1 expression but loss of TP53 expression. The difference between these findings could be due to the difference in KRAS missense mutation driving lung tumorigenesis or differences between inhibiting autophagy with a 4-aminoquiniolone such hydroxychloroquine and DCC-3116 mediated inhibition of ULK1/2. Indeed, since HCQ inhibits lysosome function, it might inhibit cellular recycling of substrates acquired by micropinocytosis, whereas ULK1/2 inhibition should be specific for autophagic recycling of intracellular substrates. Hence, this work supports the hypothesis that patients with KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-driven lung cancers may benefit from treatment with the combination of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> plus ULK1/2 inhibitors. To that end, there is an ongoing clinical trial enrolling patients with KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-driven cancers to test the combination of sotorasib plus DCC-3116 (NCT04892017).</p>
<p>Autophagy is reported to promote lung tumor progression by supporting tumor energy production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Others have demonstrated that silencing of Autophagy-Related 7 (ATG7) expression, a protein essential for autophagy, in KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>/LKB1<sup>null</sup> driven tumors at the time of tumor initiation substantially diminishes lung tumor burden<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Our study suggests that pharmacological inhibition of ULK1/2 kinase activity starting at tumor initiation also significantly reduces growth of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>/LKB1<sup>null</sup> lung tumors. Together, these data suggest that both ATG7 and ULK1/2 kinases are necessary for KRAS-driven lung tumorigenesis even when LKB1 expression is silenced. Intriguingly, treatment of mice bearing established KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-driven lung tumors with single agent DCC-3116 decreased tumor burden, further demonstrating that ULK-mediated autophagy may be important for maintenance of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-driven lung tumors. Although we and others have demonstrated that autophagy inhibition as a monotherapy modestly reduces tumor burden in some preclinical models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, this has not been recapitulated in human cell line-derived models or in clinical trials with HCQ. This could be attributed to the relatively low potency of autophagy inhibition with HCQ, the low mutational burden of tumors arising in GEM models compared to human cancers or the use of non-specific autophagy inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Indeed, we did observe that DCC-3116 treatment modestly inhibited the growth of one human KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> mutant lung cancer cell line, NCI-H358, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, suggesting that ULK1/2 inhibition as a monotherapy may indeed have significant single agent activity in certain settings.</p>
<p>In addition to assessment of preclinical therapeutic responses in GEM models, this study also addressed the histopathology of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-driven lung tumors, either in combination with LKB1 silencing or expression of dominant-negative TP53<sup>R172H</sup>, in GEM models. In both the KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>/LKB1<sup>Null</sup> and KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>/TP53<sup>R172H</sup> GEM models of lung tumorigenesis, we noted the outgrowth of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) and adenocarcinomas as was reported for KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>-driven lung tumors some years ago. Interestingly, KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>/LKB1<sup>Null</sup>-driven lung tumors also displayed mixed adenosquamous carcinomas (ASC) and mucinous adenocarcinomas that were not observed in the KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>/TP53<sup>R172H</sup>-driven model. Analysis of the mucinous adenocarcinomas indicated that some tumor cells expressed the gastric lineage marker HNF4<italic>α</italic>, an observation originally reported in KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>/NKX2.1<sup>Null</sup>-driven lung tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. In this (and related) GEM model(s), silencing of NKX2.1, a master transcriptional regulator of both lung and thyroid development, promoted the transition of lung tumor cells to a mucinous gastric cell phenotype through the action of HNF4<italic>α</italic> in partnership with the FOXA1/2 transcription factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Interestingly, HNF4<italic>α</italic> expressing KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>/LKB1<sup>Null</sup>-driven lung tumor cells retained expression of NKX2.1 suggesting that NKX2.1 silencing is not required for the emergence of mucinous adenocarcinomas when LKB1 expression is silenced. Whether this reflects the ability of LKB1 signaling to: 1. Regulate cancer metabolism through effects on triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) or altered lactate production and secretion; 2. Regulate transcription effects on histone acetylation via elevated CRTC2-CREB signaling downstream of the salt-inducible kinases (SIKs) or effects on HDAC1/3 or some other signaling circuit remains to be determined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Finally, in both GEM models of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-driven lung tumorigenesis, we observed inhibition of both AAH and adenocarcinoma with either single agent treatment or the combination of sotorasib plus DCC-3116. By contrast, in the GEM model of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>/LKB1<sup>Null</sup>-driven lung tumorigenesis, we noted an enrichment of the mixed adenosquamous and mucinous carcinomas after cessation of therapy. This suggests that this histopathological class of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>/LKB1<sup>Null</sup>-driven lung tumors may be relatively resistant to agents such as sotorasib that covalently inhibit the inactive, GDP-bound state of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>. This could reflect: 1. Differences in expression of RGS GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) that promote GTP hydrolysis by KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>; A cell state transition that is less dependent on the KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> oncoprotein as has been described for resistance of EGFR-driven lung cancers to pathway-targeted inhibition of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity or; 3. Elevated expression of downstream factors such as c-MYC that we have recently shown can confer resistance to the combination of trametinib plus HCQ in models of KRAS-driven pancreatic cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In closing, our data support the testing of ULK1/2 inhibitors in patients with KRAS-driven lung cancer, either as single agents or in combination with direct inhibitors of KRAS oncoproteins, or of KRAS-regulated signaling pathways downstream of KRAS such as the RAF&gt;MEK&gt;ERK MAP kinase pathway. It will be interesting to interrogate specimens from patients on such trials prior to and after the likely eventual emergence of drug resistance to determine the extent to which potential resistance mechanisms glimpsed in preclinical models are observed in clinical trials. Such observations may pave the way for more efficacious regimens of therapy that maximize the depth and durability of desirable anti-tumor effects while minimizing toxicity.</p>

All human lung cancer cell lines were obtained from the ATCC and cultured in RPMI (Roswell Park Memorial Institute) 1640 (Gibco 11875-093) supplemented with 10%(v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco 10438-026) and 1% penicillin plus streptomycin (P/S) (Gibco 15140-122). Mouse tumor-derived cell lines were derived as previously described (PMID:19282848). Briefly, lungs from tumor-bearing mice were homogenized in a solution of digestive enzymes and plated in dishes. Cells were harshly split to allow for the outgrowth of tumor cells. The specific genetic abnormalities in each cell line were confirmed by analysis of genomic DNA or by immunoblotting.

Flow cytometry (Beckman Coulter CytoFLEX) was performed to assess mCherry and EGFP intensity and quantify the mCherry:EGFP ratio normalized to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control. Cells engineered to express the FAR are analyzed by flow cytometry in which we defined autophagy status by gating viable (based Sytox Blue staining), DMSO-treated control cells into three bins based on the ratio of EGFP:mCherry fluorescence. We gate all live cells into the 33% highest EGFP-positive cells (autophagy low) and the 33% highest mCherry-positive cells (autophagy high), and therefore, the proportion in the middle is also approximately 33% and considered the medium autophagy status. Again, these gates are based entirely on the DMSO-treated control cells, and all other treatments within the experiment are compared to settings on these gates. For statistical analysis, an ordinary one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test were performed.</p>

<p>This is a mechanistic study showing the effect of combining inhibition of autophagy (through ULK1/2) and KRAS (using sotorasib) on KRAS mutant NSCLC making the study <bold>valuable</bold> to cancer biologists and more broadly in a clinical setting. The evidence generated by GEM mouse models and cell lines is <bold>solid</bold> but could be further strengthened by increasing the mouse cohort size. This study holds translational relevance beyond NSCLC to other indications that carry KRAS mutations.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Ghazi et reported that inhibition of KRASG12C signaling increases autophagy in KRASG12C expressing lung cancer cells. Moreover, the combination of DCC 3116, a selective ULK1/2 inhibitor, plus sotorasib displays cooperative/synergistic suppression of human KRASG12C driven lung cancer cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Additionally, in genetically engineered mouse models of KRASG12C driven NSCLC, inhibition of either KRASG12C or ULK1/2 decreases tumor burden and increases mouse survival. Additionally, this study found that LKB1 deficiency diminishes the sensitivity of KRASG12C/LKB1Null-driven lung cancer to the combination treatment, perhaps through the emergence of mixed adeno/squamous cell carcinomas and mucinous adenocarcinomas.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Both human cancer cells and mouse models were employed in this study to illustrate that inhibiting ULK1/2 could enhance the responsiveness of KRASG12C lung cancer to sotorasib. This research holds translational importance.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The revised manuscript has addressed most of my previous concerns. However, I still have one issue: the sample size (n) for the GEMM study in Figures 4E and 4F is too small, despite the authors' explanation. The data do not support the conclusion due to the lack of significant difference in tumor burden. Additionally, the significance labels in Figure 4E are not clearly explained.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Given that KRAS inhibition approaches are a relatively new innovation and that resistance is now being observed to such therapies in patients with NSCLC, investigation of combination therapies is valuable. The manuscript furthers our understanding of combination therapy for KRAS mutant non-small cell lung cancer by providing evidence that combined inhibition of ULK1/2 (and therefore autophagy) and KRAS can inhibit KRAS-mutant lung cancer growth. The manuscript will be of interest to the lung cancer community but also to researchers in other cancer types where KRAS inhibition is relevant.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript combines cell line, cell line-derived xenograft, and genetically-engineered mouse model data to provide solid evidence for the proposed combination therapy.  The manuscript is well written, and experiments are broadly well performed and presented.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank Reviewer #1 (R1) for the generally favorable review of our manuscript, and also for the more detailed critique that identifies potential weaknesses in the research, which we address on a point-by-point basis below.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>With 3-4 mice per group in many experiments, experimental power is a concern and some comparisons (e.g. mono vs combination therapy) seem to be underpowered to detect a difference. Both male and female mice are used in experiments which may increase variability.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank R1 for pointing out concerns regarding statistical power in our various mouse models of NSCLC experiments, and agree that more mice per group would certainly increase statistical power.  However, there are certain logistical considerations that impact the generation of cohorts of experimental <italic>KrasLSL-G12C</italic> mice.  Because mice homozygous for the <italic>KrasLSL-G12C</italic> allele display embryonic lethality, we are required to generate experimental mice by crossing heterozygous male and female <italic>KrasLSL-G12C</italic> mice.  Although 66% of the progeny of such crosses are predicted to be <italic>KrasLSL-G12C/+</italic>, experience tells us that we only obtain ~40-50% heterozygous <italic>KrasLSL-G12C/+</italic> mice with litter sizes around 6-8 mice from such crosses.  Therefore, there are usually only about 4 heterozygous <italic>KrasLSL-G12C</italic> mice per litter, which presents a substantial challenge in generating larger cohorts of age-matched mice suitable for experiments, especially under conditions where we wish to euthanize mice at multiple time points for analysis.  For the GEM model experiments, Figure 3B is the only experiment that has n=3.  All other experiments contain 4-6 mice per experimental condition.  We rationalized using both male and female mice because both human males and females have high lung cancer rates.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Additional validation of certain data is necessary.</p>
<p>(1) mCherry-EGFP-LC3 reporter was used to assess autophagy flux in Figure 1A. Please explain how autophagy status (high, medium, and low) was defined. It's also suggested to show WB of LC3 processing in different treatments as in Figure 1A at 48 hours.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and agree that a more thorough description of how autophagy status is assessed using the Fluorescent Autophagy Reporter (FAR) would benefit the readers of our manuscript.  Cells engineered to express the FAR are analyzed by flow cytometry in which we defined autophagy status by gating viable (based Sytox Blue staining), DMSO-treated control cells into three bins based on the ratio of EGFP:mCherry fluorescence.  We gate all live cells into the 33% highest EGFP-positive cells (autophagy low) and the 33% highest mCherry-positive cells (autophagy high), and therefore, the proportion in the middle is also approximately 33% and considered the medium autophagy status.  Again, these gates are based entirely on the DMSO-treated control cells, and all other treatments within the experiment are compared to settings on these gates.  In response to a specific manipulation (sotorasib, trametinib, DCC-3116 etc) we assess how the specific treatment changes the percentages of cells in each of the pre-specified gates to assess increased autophagy (decreased EGFP:mCherry ratio) or decreased autophagy (increased increased EGFP:mCherry ratio).</p>
<p>Although LC3 processing and/or the expression of p62SQSTM1 are used by others as markers of autophagy, there is much debate in the literature as to how reliable immunoblotting analysis of LC3 processing or p62SQSTM1 expression are as measures of autophagy.  Certainly, in our hands, we find that the Fluorescent Autophagy Reporter is a much more sensitive measure of changes in autophagy in various different cancer cell lines as we have described in previous papers (Kinsey et al., PMID: 30833748, Truong et al., PMID: 32933997 and Silvis &amp; Silva et al., PMID: 36719686).  Furthermore, in the omnibus publication that describes techniques for measuring autophagy (Klionsky et al., PMID: 33634751) the use of the FAR (or similarly configured reporters) is regarded as the gold standard for measuring autophagy status in cells.  We have amended the Materials &amp; Methods section of our manuscript to better describe the use of the FAR in measuring autophagy.</p>

<p>(2) For Figures 1J, K, and L, please provide immunohistochemistry (IHC) images demonstrating RAS downstream signaling blockade by sotorasib and autophagy blockade by DCC 3116 in tumors.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the comment and have probed the tumors from the xenograft experiments in Figures 1J, K, and L for pERK1/2 and p62SQSTM1 to determine the biochemical activity of sotorasib or DCC-3116, respectively and have provided representative images below. We observed the expected decrease in pERK and p62 signal after sotorasib treatment in all three xenografted cell lines. We did observe the expected accumulation of p62 in the DCC-3116 treated tumors from the NCI-H2122 and NCI-H358 cell lines. There appears to be no difference between the vehicle and DCC-3116 treated tumors in the NCI-H358 cell line-derived tumors as detected by IHC.</p>

<p>(3) Given that both DCC 3116 and ULK1K46N exhibit the ability to inhibit autophagy and synergize with sotorasib in inhibiting cell proliferation, in addition to demonstrating decreased levels of pATG13 via ELISA assay, please include Western blot analyses of LC3 or p62 to confirm the blockade of autophagy by DCC 3116 and ULK1K46N in Figure 1 &amp; Figure 2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's comment and have performed an immunoblot analysis of cells treated with DCC-3116 or expressing ULK1K46N and probed for p62SQSTM1 and LC3 expression.  We did observe the expected accumulation of p62 SQSTM1 in NCI-H2122 (ULK1K46N) cells treated with 1ug/ml doxycycline to induce expression of ULK1K46N compared to DMSO treatment.  Additionally, we treated the human cell lines from Figure 1 with sotorasib and/or DCC-3116 and tested for p62SQSTM1 expression after 48 hours of treatment. In the human cell lines NCI-H2122 and NCI-H358, there was a decrease in the p62 signal with increasing doses of sotorasib, as expected. There was no detectable change in p62 levels in the Calu-1 cells by immunoblot. For LC3-I/LC3-II, there was only one detectable band in the NCI-H2122 cells, which makes it difficult to interpret the results and further emphasizes why we use the fluorescent autophagy reporter which is more sensitive than immunoblotting. There is no detectable change in LC3-I/LC3-II in the Calu-1 cells treated with increasing doses of sotorasib, but the expected decrease in LC3-I is observed with sotorasib treatment in the NCI-H358 cells.</p>

<p>(5) Please provide the sample size (n) for each treatment group in the survival study (Figure 4E). It appears that all mice were sacrificed for tumor burden analysis in Figure 4F. However, there doesn't seem to be a significant difference among the treatment groups in Figure 4F, which contrasts with the survival analysis in Figure 4E. It is suggested to increase the sample size in each treatment group to reduce variation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have updated Figure 4E to indicate sample size for each treatment group and thank the reviewer for this suggestion.  Any mice that remained on study through the entire 8-week treatment regimen were sacrificed after the last day of treatment (Day 56).  Figure 4F indicates analysis of total tumor burden in all mice that remained on treatment for the full 8 weeks and mice that reached euthanasia criteria before the end of the 8-week treatment.  Therefore, it is important to note that the mice in Figure 4F were not all euthanized on the same day.  There is no statistically significant difference between the 3 treatment groups (sotorasib, DCC-3116, combination).  This may be due to a lower sample size as well as ending the treatment at 8 weeks as opposed to continuing the treatment for a longer period of time.  Although we agree that increasing the sample size would benefit the study, due to how long the GEMM model experiments take (12-16 weeks of breeding, 6 weeks for the mice to reach adulthood, 10 weeks of tumor formation post-initiation, 8 weeks of treatment= ~40 weeks) we would respectfully submit that the analysis of additional mice is outside the scope of the current revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(6) In KP mice (Figure 5), it seems that a single treatment alone is sufficient to inhibit established KP lung tumor growth. Combination treatment does not further enhance anti-tumor efficacy. Therefore, this result doesn't support the conclusion generated from human cancer cell lines. Please discuss.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this observation.  Indeed, KP lung tumors were sensitive to single agent DCC-3116 treatment, which is reflected in the tumor burden analysis.  This was somewhat surprising to us as we have not previously detected much anti-tumor activity using 4-amino-quinoloines (chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine) or other autophagy inhibitors.  It should be noted however that the KRASG12C/TP53R175H NSCLC model has a very low tumor burden overall (~4% in vehicle-treated mice).  Additionally, our microCT imager cannot detect AAH and small tumors at the settings/resolution used.  Therefore, we were limited in our ability to detect small tumors or hyperplasia by microCT imaging.  Although there was a decrease in overall tumor burden with single agent DCC-3116 treatment, we could not demonstrate using microCT imaging that KRASG12C/TP53R175H lung tumors were actually regressing with single agent DCC-3116 treatment.  The larger tumors that were detected appeared to show a cytostatic effect (i.e. no or slow growth) with DCC-3116 monotherapy.  This may reflect our inability to detect regression of AAH or small tumors with the microCT.  In all human cell lines tested, the only cell line that responded to single agent DCC-3116 treatment was NCI-H358 cells, which do have a complete heterozygous loss of the <italic>TRP53</italic> gene and lack TP53 protein.  However, other cells that also have a loss of expression of TP53 expression (Calu-1) are insensitive to single-agent DCC-3116 treatment. Due to the low mutational burden of the KP mouse model compared to human NSCLC cell lines driven by mutationally-activated KRASG12C and the loss of TP53 function, it is difficult to directly compare GEM models to the human cell line models.  Most of the human cell lines have alterations in other genes that are not altered in the KP mouse model which could affect the sensitivity of treatment.</p>

<p>(3) The manuscript figures would be improved by the use of a colourblind-friendly palette.</p>

<p>We have previously published multiple manuscripts using this color scheme for the fluorescent autophagy reporter experiments and chose to use red and green as the reporter uses EGFP and mCherry.  We wanted to keep this color scheme consistent across our publications and would prefer not to change the colors.  However, we agree with the reviewer that the data should be accessible to all people and, therefore, have updated these graphs to include slashes over the red color to ease in telling the differences between the red and green colors.
