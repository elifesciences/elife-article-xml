<title>Abstract</title><p>The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes, malate dehydrogenase (MDH1) and citrate synthase (CIT1), form a multienzyme complex called ‘metabolon’ that channels intermediate, oxaloacetate, between the reaction centers of the enzymes. Since the MDH1-CIT1 metabolon enhances the pathway reactions in vitro, it is postulated to regulate the TCA cycle flux through dynamic assembly in response to cellular metabolic demands. Here, we demonstrated that yeast mitochondrial MDH1 and CIT1 dissociated when aerobic respiration was suppressed by the Crabtree effect and associated when the pathway flux was enhanced by acetate. Pharmacological TCA cycle inhibitions dissociated the complex, while electron transport chain inhibition enhanced the interaction. The multienzyme complex assembly was related to the mitochondrial matrix acidification and oxidation, as well as cellular levels of malate, fumarate, and citrate. These factors significantly affected the MDH1-CIT1 complex affinity in vitro. Especially the buffer pH significantly changed the MDH1-CIT1 affinity within the pH range between 6.0 and 7.0, which is observed in the mitochondrial matrix under physiological conditions. These results show a dynamic association and dissociation of a metabolon in the mitochondria and its relationship with pathway flux, supporting the metabolon’s role in metabolic regulation. Multiple factors, including pH and metabolite availabilities, possibly regulate MDH1-CIT1 interaction.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Enzymes catalyzing sequential reactions can interact to form a multienzyme complex, often called a ‘metabolon,’ which channels the metabolic intermediate within the complex. Metabolite channeling can mediate pathway reactions by concentrating the reaction intermediates near the enzyme active site and sequestering them from competing reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Obata, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Spivey and Ovádi, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Wheeldon et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, dynamic multienzyme complexes are believed to quickly regulate cellular metabolic flux by changing their degree of association and dissociation without involving time-consuming and resource-demanding protein synthesis, degradation, and modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Halper and Srere, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Morgunov and Srere, 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Obata, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Omini et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Srere, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Sumegi et al., 1993</xref>). However, limited experimental evidence shows metabolon dynamics and the mechanisms regulating its association.</p>
<p>The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle multienzyme complex composed of malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and citrate synthase (CS) is conserved in all organisms analyzed so far, including animals, bacteria, yeast, and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Meyer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Morgunov and Srere, 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Robinson et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). MDH and CS catalyze the key steps in respiratory metabolism as their reactions comprise the carbon entry steps from the glycolytic processes as malate and acetyl-CoA, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Sweetlove et al., 2010</xref>). MDH-CS complex is considered a dynamic protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bulutoglu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Omini et al., 2021</xref>) that protects the channeled intermediate, oxaloacetate, from degradation and competing pathways in the bulk phase of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bulutoglu et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, MDH-CS complex formation and oxaloacetate channeling are considered essential for the forward TCA cycle flux to occur since MDH forward reaction to synthesize oxaloacetate is thermodynamically unfavorable in physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fukuda et al., 2008</xref>). These findings suggest that dynamic association and dissociation of the MDH-CS multienzyme complex plays a role in the flux regulation of the TCA cycle and associated metabolic pathways. To address this hypothesis, this study focuses on demonstrating the in vivo dynamics of the MDH-CS complex in relation to respiratory fluxes, a crucial aspect of achieving metabolic regulation. Another key requirement, metabolic impacts of the metabolon, will be addressed in a separate study.</p>
<p>This study utilized the yeast mitochondrial MDH (MDH1)-CS (CIT1) multienzyme complex as the model. Budding yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, dramatically rearranges its central carbon metabolism in response to changes in nutrient availability and stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Causton et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rep et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Rolland et al., 2002</xref>). Remarkably, yeast respiratory metabolism, involving aerobic respiration and fermentation, is highly adaptable to substrate availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pfeiffer and Morley, 2014</xref>). When oxygen and non-fermentable respiratory substrates, such as acetate, are abundant, aerobic respiration is upregulated, with increased carbon flux through the TCA cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gerstmeir et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). In the presence of fermentable sugars, such as glucose and fructose, the fermentation pathway is upregulated, and aerobic respiration is repressed, even when oxygen is available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, aerobic respiration and fermentation cooperate in the presence of a poorly fermentable carbon source like raffinose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Guaragnella et al., 2013</xref>). Application of fermentable substrates to respiring yeast cells induces a substantial shift from aerobic respiration to fermentation, known as the ‘Crabtree effect,’ involving a massive transcriptional rearrangement of enzyme genes related to aerobic respiration and fermentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gancedo, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Ronne, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Thierie and Penninckx, 2010</xref>). This inducible metabolic shift in yeast makes it an ideal model to investigate the dynamic relationship between the MDH1-CIT1 multienzyme complex and the TCA cycle flux. Understanding the mechanisms of the Crabtree effect is crucial for metabolic engineering applications to enhance the supply of TCA cycle intermediates for desired product synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Yin et al., 2015</xref>) and for gaining insights into metabolic regulation in other eukaryotic systems, including cancer cells, which exhibit metabolic shifts similar to the Crabtree effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Diaz-Ruiz et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Various allosteric regulators and environmental factors, including pH and redox state, affect MDH and CS enzyme activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Beeckmans, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Williamson and Cooper, 1980</xref>). These factors alter protein conformations, influencing the MDH-CS complex affinities. Previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that NAD<sup>+</sup>, malate, succinate, acetyl-CoA, α-ketoglutarate, and acidic pH enhance the MDH-CS interaction, while NADH, citrate, and basic pH weaken it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Omini et al., 2024</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Tompa et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Wu and Minteer, 2015</xref>). These allosteric regulators promote the MDH-CS interaction when the TCA cycle substrates are abundant and products are limited, indicating the role of the MDH-CS multienzyme complex in the TCA cycle feedback regulation. The electron transport chain activity affects the mitochondrial matrix pH, redox state, and ATP content and is closely related to cellular respiratory flux distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Santo-Domingo and Demaurex, 2012</xref>)). Therefore, the MDH-CS multienzyme complex may associate and dissociate according to the microenvironment in the mitochondrial matrix, such as metabolite concentrations, pH, redox state, and energy levels.</p>
<p>In this study, we adopted a nanoBIT protein-protein interaction assay system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dixon et al., 2016</xref>) to monitor real-time MDH1-CIT1 multienzyme complex interaction in living yeast cells under the presence of various carbon sources and respiratory inhibitors. The results showed the relationship between respiratory flux and the dynamic MDH1-CIT1 complex assembly. The fluorescent biosensors showed crosstalk between the cellular respiratory status, MDH1-CIT1 interaction, and the microenvironments of the mitochondrial matrix. These results indicate the functional dynamics of the MDH-CS multienzyme complex in relation to the metabolic flux of the TCA cycle and adjacent pathways.</p>

<title>MDH1-CIT1 interaction was detected exclusively in respiratory conditions</title>
<p>We employed a nanoBIT split-luciferase system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dixon et al., 2016</xref>) for semi-quantitative relative detection of the MDH1-CIT1 multienzyme complex association in living yeast cells. The codon-optimized sequences of nano-BIT subunits were integrated into the direct downstream of MDH1 and CIT1 exon in the yeast genome by gene homologous recombination to fuse the nanoBIT subunits to the native enzymes. The nanoBIT subunits reconstruct nanoLUC holoenzyme to exert luciferase signals when MDH1 and CIT1 are in proximity. The affinity between the nanoBIT subunits is very low and does not stabilize the interactions of the tagged proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dixon et al., 2016</xref>). The integration of nanoBIT subunits showed no significant effect on the cellular growth rate or cellular MDH and CS enzyme activities (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – figure supplement 1</xref>). Although the MDH1-CIT1 reporter line did not show detectable luciferase signal when it was grown in a fermentation condition (glucose-containing SD media; SD-Gluc), it showed substantial luciferase signal in mixed-respiration (raffinose-containing SD media; SD-Raff) and respiration (acetate-containing SD-media; SD-Acet) conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). These results indicate that MDH1 and CIT1 interact under respiratory conditions. The MDH1-CIT1 interaction can be related to the oxidative respiration and the TCA cycle activity since oxygen consumption was detected only in SD-Raff and SD-Acet media but not in the SD-Gluc medium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Klein et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Polakis and Bartley, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rep et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Rolland et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Strittmatter, 1957</xref>). However, MDH1 and CIT1 expression was downregulated in SD-Gluc growing cells near the detection limit (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), making it difficult to conclude if the undetectable MDH1-CIT1 interaction was due to complex dissociation or low protein levels.</p>

<title>Crabtree induction reduced the MDH1-CIT1 interaction</title>
<p>To test the relationship between the respiratory activity and the MDH1-CIT1 complex association when MDH1 and CIT1 enzymes are abundant in the cell, we monitored the time course of the MDH1-CIT1 interaction after a rapid shift from aerobic to anaerobic respiration by the Crabtree effect. The Crabtree effect was induced by applying 2% glucose to the SD-Raff-grown MDH1-CIT1 nanoBIT reporter line (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The luciferase signals only slightly changed for 30 min upon glucose application, followed by a steep decline. In contrast, the control cells retained the initial signal level for 100 min (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Other Crabtree inducers, such as fructose and sucrose, also reduced the MDH1-CIT1 interaction, while the addition of non-fermentable sugars, including galactose, caused no significant change in MDH1-CIT1 interaction (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – figure supplement 2A-D</xref>). The signal decline following glucose application was partially reversed by co-application with a fermentation inhibitor, 100 mM phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">van Urk et al., 1989</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Phosphate co-application slowed the decrease of luciferase signal compared to the glucose-applied cells, and the signal was not statistically significantly lower than the control until 80 min after application. The oxygen consumption rate significantly decreased when glucose was added to SD-Raff-grown cells but was slightly recovered by co-application of glucose with phosphate (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – figure supplement 2E</xref>). These results indicate that the respiratory suppression by the Crabtree effect is related to MDH1-CIT1 complex disruption.</p>

<p>MDH1 protein level monitored with the yeast strain expressing MDH1 fused with full-length nanoLUC luciferase showed a 20% decline within 100 min upon glucose addition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Western blotting also showed slight decrease in the MDH1 and CIT1 levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). The time course of the MDH1-CIT1 nanoBIT signal was inconsistent with that of MDH1-nanoLUC, and the 20% decline in protein content cannot fully explain the decrease of MDH1-CIT1 signal by over 50% within 100 min after glucose addition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>&amp;<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Therefore, the decline in the MDH1-CIT1 nanoBIT signal reflects the MDH1-CIT1 complex dissociation co-occurring with the Crabtree effect, even though we cannot exclude a partial effect of protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Litsios et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Oxidative respiration significantly influences the microenvironments in the mitochondrial matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Beeckmans, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Williamson and Cooper, 1980</xref>). To assess if the MDH1-CIT1 interaction decline is related to the changes in the microenvironments of the mitochondrial matrix by the Crabtree effect, we monitored the mitochondrial matrix pH, ATP concentration, and redox state by expressing fluorescent biomarkers, pHluorin, mito-GoAteam2, and mito-roGFP1, respectively, in the mitochondrial matrix of the MDH1-CIT1 reporter line (<xref rid="fig2s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – figure supplement 3A-D</xref>). Mitochondrial matrix pH in the SD-Raff-grown cells was 7.2 and temporally declined to 6.8 in the first 25 min of glucose application. The control cell matrix pH gradually decreased to 6.2 and stayed lower than in glucose-applied cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). The alterations of the MDH1-CIT1 interaction and mitochondrial matrix parameters in the control condition are not due to carbon starvation since 2% raffinose application had no significant effect (<xref rid="fig2s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – figure supplement 3E</xref>). The redox state stayed around -288.0 mV in both the control and glucose cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). The ATP level slightly increased during the experimental period of 100 min in both the control and glucose cells, with slightly but significantly lower levels in the glucose than control cells from 55 min to 100 min (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Thus, mitochondrial matrix pH and ATP levels were maintained after glucose was applied to cells, while they decreased and increased in the control cells during the experimental period.</p>
<p>Our previous in vitro study showed that metabolite abundance influences MDH-CS complex interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Omini et al., 2021</xref>). To assess the possible roles of metabolite accumulation in controlling MDH1-CIT1 complex interaction, we determined the cellular levels of 38 metabolites (Data S1) by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). We focus here on the intermediates of the TCA cycle and related pathways (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). At 80 min following 2% glucose application to SD-Raff-grown cells, malate, citrate, fumarate, and glutamate levels reduced while α-ketoglutarate content increased significantly compared to the control cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Thus, the glucose-induced shift from aerobic respiration to fermentation altered the intracellular metabolite profile in SD-Raff-grown cells.</p>

<title>MDH1-CIT1 complex interacts in relation to the TCA cycle activity</title>
<p>We further assessed the relationship between the MDH1-CIT1 complex association and TCA cycle flux. Acetate supplies acetyl-CoA to the TCA cycle and enhances the TCA cycle flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cavero et al., 2003</xref>). The application of 1% sodium acetate gradually increased the MDH1-CIT1 interaction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) with an immediate decline in mitochondria pH to 6.1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). The mitochondrial matrix redox state and the ATP level were maintained during the experimental period while they gradually increased in the control cells, resulting in the significantly lower mitochondrial matrix redox state and ATP level in the acetate-treated cells in the latter half of the experimental period (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>&amp;<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). On the other hand, TCA cycle inhibition by 5 mM sodium arsenite, which impedes α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lee et al., 2011</xref>), led to an absolute decline in MDH1-CIT1 interaction within 10 min (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Mitochondrial matrix pH went slightly lower than the control cells after 40 min of arsenite application (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Arsenite treatment showed minor effects on the redox state and ATP level in the mitochondrial matrix (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>&amp;<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">H</xref>). Aminooxyacetate is an aminotransferase inhibitor and reduces TCA cycle flux by blocking the malate-aspartate NADH shuttle, which intersects with the cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Borst, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Eto et al., 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Molinié et al., 2022</xref>). The MDH1-CIT1 interaction gradually reduced following 0.5 mM aminooxyacetate application (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>). The matrix redox state was more reducing after 10 min of application (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>). Aminooxyacetate did not affect the mitochondrial matrix pH and ATP level (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>&amp;<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">L</xref>).

<p>Mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) activity is directly related to the mitochondrial microenvironments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Selivanov et al., 2008</xref>). To further assess the effects of mitochondrial matrix microenvironments on MDH1-CIT1 complex interaction, we treated SD-Raff-grown cells with ETC inhibitors. Inhibition of ETC complex II, III, IV, and V with 20 mM malonate, 10 µM antimycin, 0.5 mM cyanide, and 1 mM oligomycin, respectively, significantly reduced oxygen consumption of SD-Raff-grown cells (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 1</xref>), showing their effects on respiration. MDH1-CIT1 interaction was enhanced by ETC inhibitors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, E, I</xref>), whereas the complex V (ATP synthase) inhibitor exerted no effect on MDH1-CIT1 interaction and mitochondrial matrix microenvironment in this experimental condition (<xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 2A-D</xref>). Complex II inhibition slightly and temporally enhanced the MDH1-CIT1 interaction, although the increase was not statistically significant compared to the control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Complex II inhibition showed minor effects on the mitochondrial microenvironments too (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B-D</xref>).

Mitochondrial matrix microenvironments were also affected in the first 20 min of Complex IV inhibition. The matrix pH and the ATP level were temporally decreased and exhibited inverse relationships with the MDH1-CIT1 interaction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>&amp;<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">H</xref>). The mitochondrial matrix was slightly more oxidized during the initial 15 min of treatment, although the redox state was not significantly different from the control cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we report the relationships between metabolic flux changes and mitochondrial MDH1-CIT1 multienzyme complex interaction in living yeast cells. MDH1-CIT1 multienzyme complex dynamically associated and dissociated in response to respiratory status. This study is the first in vivo evidence in any organism showing the dynamic association and dissociation of the TCA cycle metabolon in real time. The MDH-CS metabolon, specifically, is considered essential for the forward TCA cycle flux due to its ability to overcome the unfavorable thermodynamics of MDH reaction under physiological oxaloacetate concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Beeckmans and Kanarek, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Huang et al., 2018</xref>). The results of this study demonstrate that the MDH1-CIT1 multienzyme complex associates when the TCA cycle is active and dissociates when it is suppressed, supporting its hypothesized functions in metabolic regulation to enhance pathway flux by substrate channeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Noor et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>The MDH1-CIT1 complex dissociated under conditions suppressing the TCA cycle flux. TCA cycle inhibition by arsenite and aminooxyacetate induced strong dissociation of the MDH1-CIT1 complex (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>&amp;<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">I</xref>). In a physiological condition, the MDH1-CIT1 complex dissociated when Crabtree-inducing fermentable sugars were supplied to the media (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, and S2). The Crabtree effect redistributes respiratory flux to stimulate fermentation and repress aerobic respiratory pathways, including the TCA cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gancedo, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Ronne, 1995</xref>). The metabolic shift by the Crabtree effect is a concerted action of multiple mechanisms, such as the suppression of enzyme gene expressions and the inhibition of mitochondrial transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ahmadzadeh et al., 1996</xref>). Interestingly, glucose-induced rapid repression of mitochondrial respiration occurs at a rate that is too great to be explained only by the inhibition of enzyme synthesis, and additional forms of regulation are anticipated to be involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ahmadzadeh et al., 1996</xref>). Our results suggest that the dissociation of the TCA cycle metabolon can be an additional mechanism to downregulate the respiratory flux swiftly during the Crabtree effect.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the MDH1-CIT1 complex interaction was enhanced under conditions that promote TCA cycle flux. An increase in TCA cycle flux by the addition of acetate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Orlandi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Vilela-Moura et al., 2011</xref>) enhanced the MDH1-CIT1 complex interaction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), suggesting the role of the MDH-CS metabolon in facilitating forward TCA cycle flux. However, ETC inhibition also enhanced MDH1-CIT1 interaction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, E</xref>, and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">I</xref>) despite their inhibitory effects on oxidative respiration (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 - figure supplement 1</xref>) and the TCA cycle flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Epstein et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Grassian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Heinz et al., 2022</xref>). It should be noted that the enhanced MDH1-CIT1 interaction was temporal (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, E</xref>, and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">I</xref>). It may not be directly related to the changes in respiratory metabolism as the inhibition of O<sub>2</sub> consumption by ETC inhibitors was less significant than those by Crabtree induction (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 - figure supplement 1</xref>). The enhanced MDH1-CIT1 interaction is rather related to the temporal changes in mitochondrial microenvironments discussed below.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the treatments used to alter the TCA cycle flux in this study also induce flux alterations through metabolic pathways connected to the TCA cycle. In particular, acetate and aminooxyacetate treatments affect malate-aspartate shuttle activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cavero et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Eto et al., 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Liu and Butow, 2006</xref>), which competes for oxaloacetate with MDH and CS reactions. Since the protection of channeled intermediates from competing reactions is one of the postulated functions of metabolon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Morgunov and Srere, 1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Obata, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Spivey and Merz, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Welch, 1978</xref>), the relationship between malate-aspartate shuttle flux and MDH1-CIT1 interaction can provide significant insight into the metabolic function of MDH1-CIT1 metabolon. However, specific investigations are required to address this question since the TCA cycle and malate-aspartate shuttle function cooperatively, and their fluxes are tightly linked in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Liao and Butow, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Nielsen et al., 2011</xref>). Other metabolic pathways can also be affected by treatments, and their effects on MDH-CS interactions cannot be ruled out.</p>
<p>We also investigated the molecular mechanisms regulating the MDH1-CIT1 complex dynamics. We previously reported that protein conformation changes induced by the solution pH and allosteric regulators affect porcine MDH-CS complex interaction in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Omini et al., 2021</xref>). The recombinant yeast MDH1 and CIT1 showed similar responses to the porcine enzymes; MDH1-CIT1 affinity was higher in low pH and in the presence of upstream TCA cycle intermediates (malate and fumarate) but disrupted in the presence of reaction product (citrate; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). These factors can affect the TCA cycle metabolon formation in vivo.</p>
<p>In this study, we observed enhanced MDH1-CIT1 interaction under conditions lowering mitochondrial matrix pH in vivo. The mitochondrial matrix pH decreased after adding acetate, corresponding to the enhanced MDH1-CIT1 interaction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 A, B</xref>). The time courses of the temporal increase in MDH1-CIT1 interaction and pH decrease were inversely related following the complex III and IV inhibitions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, B, E, F</xref>). The decrease in the pH from 7.5 to 6.0 ranges is remarkable since the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of MDH1-CIT1 association decreases in an order of magnitude within this pH range (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The mitochondrial matrix acidification under respiratory conditions likely favors the MDH1-CIT1 interaction. On the other hand, the mitochondria matrix pH was maintained around 7.2 in the presence of glucose (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), which likely weakens the MDH1-CIT1 complex interaction. These results indicate that mitochondrial matrix pH, which is related to the proton transport activity by ETC, can stabilize or destabilize the MDH1-CIT1 complex to play a role in regulating the MDH1-CIT1 interaction in response to the respiratory activity.</p>
<p>The pH and MDH1-CIT1 interaction changes did not coincide following the Crabtree induction and acetate supplementation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs 2</xref>&amp;<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). TCA cycle inhibitions reduced the MDH1-CIT1 interaction without significantly affecting the mitochondrial matrix pH (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E, F, I, J</xref>). These results indicate that mitochondrial matrix pH is not always the primary regulator of MDH1-CIT1 interaction, which directly induces association and dissociation, but rather a factor maintaining the MDH1-CIT1 interaction state. Mitochondrial matrix oxidation can also influence the MDH1-CIT1 interaction state since it was related to the increase in MDH1-CIT1 interaction upon ETC inhibition (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G, K</xref>), while matrix reduction was related to the decrease in MDH1-CIT1 interaction upon aminooxyacetate-induced TCA cycle inhibition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>).</p>
<p>The TCA cycle intermediates and cofactors can also regulate the MDH1-CIT1 interaction, considering their effects on the interaction in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Omini et al., 2021</xref>). The yeast enzymes showed responses to malate, α-ketoglutarate, succinate, and citrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Omini et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Tompa et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Wu et al., 2015</xref>) similar to the enzymes of other organisms, while fumarate is newly identified as an effector of the MDH-CS interaction. Especially fumarate, malate, and citrate showed significant influence on the yeast enzymes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Cellular concentrations of these effector metabolites significantly altered under the conditions tested in this study (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3M</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4M</xref>). Increased and decreased levels of malate and citrate, respectively, following complex IV and complex III inhibition (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4M</xref>), likely enhance the MDH1-CIT1 interaction since citrate disrupts and malate enhances the interaction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Omini et al., 2021</xref>)). These results indicate the involvement of metabolite effectors, such as malate and citrate, in the MDH1-CIT1 interaction regulation. However, their precise effects must be evaluated by site-specific and time-dependent quantification of metabolite levels in the mitochondrial matrix.</p>
<p>This study demonstrates that the TCA cycle MDH1-CIT1 multienzyme complex dynamically interacts depending on the respiratory status of the cell. Cues of cellular respiratory state may be transmitted to the multienzyme complex, at least in part, by protons (pH), reducing equivalents (redox state), and metabolite levels (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Since non of these factors always corresponded to the MDH1-CIT1 interaction, multiple factors most probably cooperatively regulate the multienzyme complex formation. Although we focused on allosteric regulators in this study, further factors are potentially involved in the MDH1-CIT1 complex regulation. For example, 44 and 33 post-translational modifications have been identified in CIT1 and MDH1, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bhagwat et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Henriksen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Holt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lanz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Reinders et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Swaney et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Weinert et al., 2013</xref>), some of which likely affect the MDH1-CIT1 complex affinity. Various scaffolding molecules, such as long noncoding RNAs, lipid layers, and scaffolding proteins, have been shown to stabilize the multienzyme complexes in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Zhu et al., 2022</xref>). Future studies should investigate the effects of these factors to understand the regulatory mechanisms for MDH1-CIT1 interaction.</p>

<caption><title>Relationship between the respiratory metabolism and the MDH1-CIT1 metabolon association.</title>
<p>In conditions with low respiratory flux, the MDH1-CIT1 multienzyme complex dissociates, and the TCA cycle flux reduces. Reduced ETC flux results in higher mitochondrial matrix pH, which reduces MDH1-CIT1 affinity. When the respiratory flux and the TCA cycle flux are high, MDH1-CIT1 metabolon associates and likely channels the intermediate oxaloacetate (OXA). High ETC flux lowers mitochondrial matrix pH and enhances the MDH1-CIT1 interaction. The TCA cycle intermediates affect MDH1-CIT1 metabolon formation; fumarate and malate enhance (red arrows with dotted lines), and citrate inhibits (blue arrows with dotted lines) the interaction. The arrow thickness represents the metabolic fluxes.</p></caption>

<p>Changes in environmental conditions and nutrient availability occur swiftly, and a corresponding change in metabolic flux must occur at a similar rate for the successful adaptation of living cells. Dynamic metabolons can be a system to regulate and fine-tune metabolic network flux quickly, allowing cells to maintain metabolic homeostasis in rapidly fluctuating environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Obata, 2019</xref>). Considering the thermodynamic favourability of forward MDH reaction and substrate channeling in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bulutoglu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fukuda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Sweetlove et al., 2010</xref>), the MDH1-CIT1 complex formation likely enhances the forward TCA cycle flux in the conditions demanding oxidative respiration to achieve robust fine-tuning of the TCA cycle flux. Further direct evidence showing the effects of metabolon formation on the metabolic pathway flux in living cells is necessary to understand the functions of metabolons in metabolic network regulation. Elucidating the regulatory system of the TCA cycle metabolon can lead to a novel strategy to manipulate the TCA cycle flux in metabolic engineering to achieve efficient industrial production of various molecules requiring TCA cycle intermediates as substrates or to control the Warburg effect to suppress cancer cells.</p>

<title>Generation of the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> reporter strains with tagged MDH1 and CIT1</title>
<p>The nanoBiT split nanoLUC luciferase complementation system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dixon et al., 2016</xref>) was adopted to monitor MDH1-CIT1 interaction in yeast cells. The yeast lines expressing MDH1 and CIT1 proteins fused with the small (SmBiT) and large (LgBiT) nanoBiT subunits, respectively, were generated by inserting the yeast codon-optimized tag-coding sequences into the BY4741 genome following the scarless C-terminal tagging procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Landgraf et al., 2016</xref>). The full-length nanoLUC, LgBiT, and SmBiT coding sequences were integrated to direct downstream of the Mdh1 (chrIV:3300230) and Cit1 (chrX:303993) genes on the BY4741 genome for C-terminal fusion. The LgBiT and SmBiT sequences include flexible linkers (ACKIPNDLKQKVMNH; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hu et al., 2002</xref>)) with HA and cMyc epitope sequences, respectively, for immunological detections. Details of the vector construction procedure, primers, and vectors are described in the Supplementary Method.</p>
<p>Briefly, we generated the plasmids with integration cassettes composed of the linker, 5’ half of tag-coding sequence, URA3 selection marker, and 3’ half of tag-coding sequence in this order using the Golden Braid technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Sarrion-Perdigones et al., 2013</xref>). The halves of the tag-coding sequences have an overlapping sequence. The integration cassettes were amplified by PCR using the primers with around 40 bases 5’ extension with sequences homologous to the franking region of the tag insertion sites. BY4741 cells were transformed with the purified PCR products to insert the cassettes into the target sites directly downstream of the Mdh1 and Cit1 genes by homologous recombination due to the 5’ extension of the primers. The transformants were selected on uracil-deficient plates. To pop-out the URA3 marker and reconstruct nanoLUC and nanoBIT subunits, the transformants were cultured overnight in uracil-containing YPD media. The URA3 gene was excluded from the genome by recombination based on the overlapping sequences in the cassette. The cell suspension was spread on SD plates containing 1 mg ml<sup>-1</sup> 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) to select the cell lines without the URA3 gene. SmBiT was initially fused with the Mdh1 gene, and the resulting strain was further transformed to fuse LgBiT with Cit1 (MDH1/CIT1-BiT strain). Another strain expressing MDH1 fused with full-length nanoLUC luciferase was also generated following the same procedure to monitor MDH1 protein levels (MDH1-nLUC strain).</p>

<title>Measurement of redox state, pH, and ATP level in the mitochondrial matrix</title>
<p>Cells expressing pHluorin, mito-roGFP1, and mito-GoAteam2 were grown to OD<sub>600</sub>=0.50 in their respective selection media. Cells were prepared for fluorescence measurement according to the method described by Morgan <italic>et al</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Morgan et al., 2011</xref>).

The ratio of pHluorin emission at 510 nm upon excitation at 390 and 470 nm (R390/470) was plotted against buffer pH to obtain a calibration curve.</p>
<p>The mitochondrial matrix redox state was measured using mito-roGFP1 expressing strain. The ratio of emission intensity at 510 nm from excitation at 365 nm and 470 nm (R470/365) was measured. Mito-roGFP1 in situ calibration was performed following the method described by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Vevea et al., 2013b</xref>).

<p>This study reports a dynamic association/dissociation between malate dehydrogenase (MDH1) and citrate synthase (CIT1) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under different metabolic conditions that control TCA pathway flux rate. The research question is timely, the use of the NanoBiT split-luciferase system to monitor protein-protein interactions is innovative, and the significance of the findings is <bold>valuable</bold>. However, the strength of evidence needed to support the conclusions was found to be <bold>incomplete</bold> based on a lack of critical control and mechanistic experiments.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study by the Obata group characterizes the dynamics of the canonical malate dehydrogenase-citrate synthase metabolon in yeast.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study is well-written and appears to give clear demonstrations of this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Studies of the dynamics of metabolon formation are rare; if the authors can address the concern detailed below, then they have provided such for one of the canonical metabolons in nature.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There is a fundamental issue with the study, which is that the authors do not provide enough support or information concerning the split luciferase system that they use. Is the binding reversible or not? How the data is interpreted is massively influenced by this fact. What are the pros and cons of this method in comparison to, for example, FLIM-FRET? The authors state that the method is semi-quantitative - can they document this? All of the conclusions are based on the quality of this method. I know that it has been used by others, but at least some preliminary documentation to address these questions is required.</p>

<p>This study explores the dynamic association between malate dehydrogenase (MDH1) and citrate synthase (CIT1) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with the aim of linking this interaction to respiratory metabolism. Utilizing a NanoBiT split-luciferase system, the authors monitor protein-protein interactions in vivo under various metabolic conditions.</p>
<p>Major Concerns:</p>
<p>(1) NanoBiT Signal May Reflect Protein Abundance Rather Than Interaction Strength</p>
<p>In Figure 1C, the authors report increased MDH1-CIT1 interaction under respiratory (acetate) conditions and decreased interaction during fermentation (glucose), as indicated by NanoBiT luminescence. However, this signal appears to correlate strongly with the expression levels of MDH1 and CIT1, raising the possibility that the observed luminescence reflects protein abundance rather than specific interaction dynamics. To resolve this, NanoBiT signals should be normalized to the expression levels of both proteins to distinguish between abundance-driven and interaction-driven changes.</p>
<p>(2) Lack of Causal Evidence</p>
<p>The study presents a series of metabolic perturbation experiments (e.g., arsenite, AOA, antimycin A, malonate) and correlates changes in metabolite levels with NanoBiT signals. However, these data are correlative and do not establish a functional role for the MDH1-CIT1 interaction in metabolic regulation. To demonstrate causality, the authors should implement approaches to specifically disrupt the MDH1-CIT1 interaction. One strategy could involve using a 15-residue peptide (Pept1) derived from the Pro354-Pro366 region of CIT1, previously shown to mediate the interaction, or introducing the cit1Δ3 (Arg362Glu) mutation, which perturbs binding. Metabolic flux analysis using ^13C-labeled glucose and mitochondrial respiration assays (e.g., Seahorse) could then assess functional consequences.</p>
<p>(3) Absence of Protein Expression Controls Under Perturbation Conditions</p>
<p>In experiments involving acetate, arsenite, AOA, antimycin A, and malonate, the authors infer changes in MDH1-CIT1 association based solely on NanoBiT signals. However, no accompanying data are provided on MDH1 and CIT1 protein levels under these conditions. This omission weakens the conclusions, as altered expression rather than interaction strength could underlie the observed luminescence changes. Immunoblotting or quantitative proteomics should be used to confirm constant protein expression across conditions.</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>Although the central question is compelling and the use of NanoBiT in live cells is a strength, the manuscript requires additional experimental rigor. Specifically, normalization of interaction signals, introduction of causative perturbations, and validation of protein expression are essential to substantiate the study's claims.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Metabolons are multisubunit complexes that promote the physical association of sequential enzymes within a metabolic pathway. Such complexes are proposed to increase metabolic flux and efficiency by channeling reaction intermediates between enzymes. The TCA cycle enzymes malate dehydrogenase (MDH1) and citrate synthase (CIT1) have been linked to metabolon formation, yet the conditions under which these enzymes interact, and whether such interactions are dynamic in response to metabolic cues, remain unclear, particularly in the native cellular context. This study uses a nanoBIT protein-protein interaction assay to map the dynamic behavior of the MDH1-CIT1 interaction in response to multiple metabolic stimuli and challenges in yeast. Beyond mapping these interactions in real time, the authors also performed GC-MS metabolomics to map whole-cell metabolite alterations across experimental conditions. Finally, the authors use microscale thermophoresis to determine components that alter the MDH1-CIT1 interaction in vitro. Collectively, the authors synthesize their collected data into a model in which the MDH1-CIT1 metabolon dissociates in conditions of low respiratory flux, and is stimulated during conditions of high respiratory flux. While their data largely support these models, some key exceptions are found that suggest this model is likely oversimplified and will require further work to understand the complexities associated with MDH1-CIT1 interaction dynamics. Nonetheless, the authors put forth an interesting and timely toolkit to begin to understand the interaction kinetics and dynamics of key metabolic enzymes that should serve as a platform to begin disentangling these important yet understudied aspects of metabolic regulation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The authors address an important question: how do metabolon-associated protein-protein interactions change across altered metabolic conditions?</p>
<p>(2) The development and validation of the MDH1-CIT1 nanoBIT assay provides an important tool to allow the quantification of this protein-protein interaction in vivo. Importantly, the authors demonstrate that the assay allows kinetic and real time assessment of these protein interactions, which reveal interesting and dynamic behavior across conditions.</p>
<p>(3) The use of classic biochemical techniques to confirm that pH and various metabolites can alter the MDH1-CIT1 interaction in vitro is rigorous and supports the model put forth by the authors.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Some of the data collected seem to be merely reported rather than synthesized and interpreted for the reader. This is particularly true for data that seem to reflect more complex trends, such as the GC-MS experiments that map metabolites across multiple experiments, or treatments that show somewhat counterintuitive results, such as the antimycin A treatment, which promotes rather than disrupts the MDH1-CIT1 interaction.</p>
<p>(2) Some of the assertions put forth in the manuscript are not substantiated by the data presented, and the authors are at times overly reliant on previous findings from the literature to support their claims. This is particularly notable for claims about &quot;TCA cycle flux&quot;; the authors do not perform flux analysis anywhere in their study and should be cautious when insinuating correlations between their observations and &quot;flux&quot;.</p>
<p>(3) The manuscript presentation could be improved. For figures, at times, the axes do not have intuitive labels (example, Figure 1A), data points and details about the number of samples analyzed are missing (bar graphs and box plots), and molecular weight markers are not reported on western blots. The authors refer to the figures out of order in the text, which makes the manuscript challenging to navigate as a reader.</p>
