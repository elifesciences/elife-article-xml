<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Copy number variants (CNVs)—gains and losses of genomic sequences—are an important source of genetic variation underlying rapid adaptation and genome evolution. However, despite their central role in evolution little is known about the factors that contribute to the structure, size, formation rate, and fitness effects of adaptive CNVs. Local genomic sequences are likely to be an important determinant of these properties. Whereas it is known that point mutation rates vary with genomic location and local DNA sequence features, the role of genome architecture in the formation, selection, and the resulting evolutionary dynamics of CNVs is poorly understood. Previously, we have found that the <italic>GAP1</italic> gene in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> undergoes frequent and repeated amplification and selection under long-term experimental evolution in glutamine-limiting conditions. The <italic>GAP1</italic> gene has a unique genomic architecture consisting of two flanking long terminal repeats (LTRs) and a proximate origin of DNA replication (autonomously replicating sequence, ARS), which are likely to promote rapid <italic>GAP1</italic> CNV formation. To test the role of these genomic elements on CNV-mediated adaptive evolution, we performed experimental evolution in glutamine-limited chemostats using engineered strains lacking either the adjacent LTRs, ARS, or all elements. Using a CNV reporter system and neural network simulation-based inference (nnSBI) we quantified the formation rate and fitness effect of CNVs for each strain. We find that although <italic>GAP1</italic> CNVs repeatedly form and sweep to high frequency in strains with modified genome architecture, removal of local DNA elements significantly impacts the rate and fitness effect of CNVs and the rate of adaptation. We performed genome sequence analysis to define the molecular mechanisms of CNV formation for 177 CNV lineages. We find that across all four strain backgrounds, between 26% and 80% of all <italic>GAP1</italic> CNVs are mediated by Origin Dependent Inverted Repeat Amplification (ODIRA) which results from template switching between the leading and lagging strand during DNA synthesis. In the absence of the local ARS, a distal ARS can mediate CNV formation via ODIRA. In the absence of local LTRs, homologous recombination mechanisms still mediate gene amplification following <italic>de novo</italic> insertion of retrotransposon elements at the locus. Our study demonstrates the remarkable plasticity of the genome and reveals that template switching during DNA replication is a frequent source of adaptive CNVs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Defining the genetic basis and evolutionary dynamics of adaptation is a central goal in evolutionary biology. Mutations underlying adaptation or biological innovation can depend on multiple factors including genetic backgrounds, phenotypic states, and genome architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Blount et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">2012</xref>). One important class of mutation mediating adaptive evolution are copy number variants (CNVs) which comprise duplications or deletions of genomic sequences that range in size from gene fragments to whole chromosomes. Quantifying the rates at which CNVs occur, the factors that influence their formation, and the fitness and functional effects of CNVs is essential for understanding their role in evolutionary processes.</p>
<p>CNVs play roles in rapid adaptation in multiple contexts and are an initiating event in biological innovation. For example, in laboratory evolution experiments a spontaneous tandem duplication captured a promoter for expression of a citrate transporter and resulted in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells, typically unable to use citrate, to start metabolizing citrate as a carbon source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Blount et al., 2012</xref>). CNVs can be beneficial in cancer cells, promote tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Ben-David &amp; Amon, 2020</xref>), enhance cancer cell adaptability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Rutledge et al., 2016</xref>), and accelerate resistance to anti-cancer therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Lukow et al., 2021</xref>). Over longer time scales, CNVs serve as substrate from which new genes evolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Ohno, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Taylor &amp; Raes, 2004</xref>) as duplicated genes redundant in function can accumulate mutations and evolve to acquire new functions. For example, the globin gene family in mammals arose from rounds of gene duplication and subsequent diversification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Storz, 2016</xref>). CNVs also contribute to macro-evolutionary processes and thereby contribute to species differences, such as between humans and chimpanzees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Cheng et al., 2005</xref>) and reproductive isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Zuellig &amp; Sweigart, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Mutations, including CNVs, occur in part because of errors made during DNA replication or DNA repair. Two general processes underlie CNV formation: (1) DNA recombination-based mechanisms and (2) DNA replication-based mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Brewer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Harel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Hastings, Lupski, et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Malhotra &amp; Sebat, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Pös et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">F. Zhang, Gu, et al., 2009</xref>). Recombination-mediated mechanisms of CNV formation include non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) and nonhomologous end joining. NAHR occurs via recombination between homologous sequences that are not allelic. As such, NAHR occurs more frequently with repetitive sequences due to improper alignment of DNA segments and can occur either between (interchromosomal) or within (intrachromosomal) a chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Harel et al., 2015</xref>). One prevalent class of repetitive sequence are retrotransposons and both full length and partial sequences, such as long terminal repeats (LTR), are substrates for homologous recombination generating gene amplifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Avecilla et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Dunham et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Gresham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lauer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Spealman et al., 2022</xref>). DNA replication-based mechanisms include fork stalling template switching (FoSTes) and microhomology mediated break-induced repair (MMBIR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Carvalho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Gu et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Hastings, Ira, et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Lee et al., 2007</xref>). During FoSTes and MMBIR, the DNA replication fork stalls due to a single strand nick and a replication error occurs in which the lagging strand switches to an incorrect template strand mediated by microhomology. Reinitiation of DNA synthesis at the incorrect site can form CNVs. A particular type of DNA replication-based error is Origin-Dependent Inverted Repeat Amplification (ODIRA), in which short inverted repeats near an origin of DNA replication enable template switching of the leading strand to the lagging strand. Subsequent replication generates an intermediate DNA molecule that can recombine into the original genome to form a triplication with an inverted middle copy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Brewer et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Martin et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>In microbes, CNVs can mediate rapid adaptation to selective conditions imposed through nutrient limitation in a chemostat. Selected CNVs often include genes encoding nutrient transporters that facilitate import of the limiting nutrient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Dunham et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Gresham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Hong &amp; Gresham, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Horiuchi et al., 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Payen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Sonti &amp; Roth, 1989</xref>), likely as a result of improved nutrient transport capacity due to increased protein production. Previous studies have found amplification of the general amino acid permease gene, <italic>GAP1,</italic> when <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> populations are continuously cultured in glutamine-limited chemostats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Gresham et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lauer et al., 2018</xref>). Amplification of <italic>GAP1</italic> confers increased fitness in the selective environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Avecilla et al., 2023</xref>). Sequence characterization of these CNVs revealed that a diversity of <italic>de novo</italic> CNV alleles are generated and selected including tandem duplications, complex large CNVs, aneuploidies, and translocations. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying this diversity.</p>
<p>Local genome sequence elements are likely to be an important determinant of CNV formation rates and mechanisms. Genomic context can influence multiple properties including mutation rate, epigenetic regulation, chromatin state, transcription levels, DNA replication, and recombination rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Arndt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Chuang &amp; Li, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Lang &amp; Murray, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Lercher &amp; Hurst, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Matassi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Nishant et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Wolfe et al., 1989</xref>). Prior work has shown that CNVs occur more frequently in repetitive regions in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Harel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Pentao et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Stankiewicz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Turner et al., 2008</xref>). However, little is known about the role of local genomic architecture and organization on CNV formation rates, the types of CNVs that are generated, their associated fitness effects, and ultimately the paths taken during adaptive evolution.</p>
<p>Here, we aimed to investigate the effect of local genome architecture elements on <italic>de novo GAP1</italic> CNV formation and selection dynamics during adaptive evolution of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. We hypothesized that sequence elements proximate to <italic>GAP1</italic> potentiate CNV formation. The <italic>GAP1</italic> locus, which is located on the short arm of chromosome XI, consists of two flanking Ty1 long terminal repeats (LTRs) that share 82% sequence identity and an origin of DNA replication or autonomously replicating sequence (ARS) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Both LTRs and ARS may facilitate <italic>GAP1</italic> CNV formation due to their proximity. First, the flanking LTRs can undergo inter-chromatid NAHR to form tandem duplications of <italic>GAP1</italic> on a linear chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lauer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Spealman et al., 2022</xref>). Second, intra-chromatid NAHR between the flanking LTRs can form an extrachromosomal circle containing <italic>GAP1</italic> and an ARS able to self-propagate and integrate into the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Gresham et al., 2010</xref>). Finally, <italic>GAP1</italic> triplications can form through ODIRA using short inverted repeats and the proximate ARS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Brewer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lauer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Martin et al., 2024</xref>). These elements are thought to facilitate a high rate of <italic>GAP1</italic> amplification, estimated to be on the order of 10<sup>-4</sup> per haploid genome per generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Avecilla et al., 2022</xref>). To test our hypothesis we used a CNV reporter, wherein a constitutively expressed fluorescent GFP gene is inserted adjacent to <italic>GAP1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lauer et al., 2018</xref>). We engineered strains that lacked either the ARS (ARSΔ), both flanking LTRs (LTRΔ), or all three elements (ALLΔ) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We performed experimental evolution using wildtype (WT) and genomic architecture mutant populations in glutamine-limited chemostats for 137 generations and quantified <italic>GAP1</italic> CNVs using flow cytometry (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Surprisingly, we find that the proximate DNA elements are not required for <italic>GAP1</italic> CNV formation as <italic>GAP1</italic> CNVs were identified in all evolving populations. We used neural network simulation-based inference (nnSBI) to infer the CNV formation rate and selection coefficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Avecilla et al., 2022</xref>). We find that although genomic architecture mutants have significantly reduced CNV formation rates relative to WT and significantly lower selection coefficients, <italic>GAP1</italic> CNVs repeatedly form and sweep to high frequency in all strains with modified genomes. We performed genome sequence analysis to define the molecular mechanisms of CNV formation for 177 CNV lineages and found that 26-80% of <italic>GAP1</italic> CNVs are mediated by ODIRA across all four background strains. In the absence of the local ARS, a distal ARS facilitates CNV formation through ODIRA. We also find that homologous recombination mechanisms still mediate gene amplification in the absence of LTRs in part initiated by <italic>de novo</italic> insertion of retrotransposon elements at the locus. Our study reveals the remarkable plasticity of the genome and that template switching of the leading and lagging strands during DNA replication is a common source of adaptive CNVs even in the absence of local DNA sequences.</p>

<p>Accurate estimation of CNV allele frequencies remains challenging using molecular methods such as DNA sequencing and qPCR. To address this challenge we previously developed a CNV reporter comprising a constitutively expressed fluorescent gene inserted upstream of <italic>GAP1</italic> and observed recurrent amplification and selection of <italic>GAP1</italic> in glutamine-limiting chemostats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lauer et al., 2018</xref>). Subsequently, we showed that a high rate of <italic>GAP1</italic> CNV formation and strong fitness effects explain the highly reproducible evolutionary dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Avecilla et al., 2022</xref>). Noncoding sequence elements proximate to <italic>GAP1</italic>, including flanking LTRs in tandem orientation and an ARS, contribute to <italic>GAP1</italic> CNV formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Gresham et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lauer et al., 2018</xref>). Many studies have shown that repetitive sequence regions and origins of replications are hotspots of CNVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Arlt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cardoso et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Di Rienzi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Gresham et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lauer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Martin et al., 2024</xref>; H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that the local genomic architecture of <italic>GAP1</italic> facilitates its high rate of CNV formation.</p>
<p>To test the role of proximate genomic features we engineered strains in which each element is deleted and thus differ from the wildtype strain (WT) containing a <italic>GAP1</italic> CNV reporter by a single modification. Specifically, we constructed ARSΔ, a strain lacking the single ARS, LTRΔ, a strain lacking the flanking LTRs, and ALLΔ, a strain lacking all three elements (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). All strains contain the CNV reporter at the identical location as the WT strain. We confirmed scarless deletions of genetic elements using Sanger and whole-genome sequencing.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Local genomic architecture contributes to <italic>GAP1</italic> CNV evolutionary dynamics</title>
<p>We founded independent populations with each of the three engineered strains lacking proximate genomic features and a WT strain. We studied <italic>GAP1</italic> CNV dynamics in populations maintained in glutamine-limited chemostats over 137 generations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). For each of the four strains, we propagated 5-8 clonal replicate populations, each originating from the same inoculum (founder population) derived from a single colony. Approximately every 10 generations, we measured GFP fluorescence of sampled populations using a flow cytometer and quantified the proportion of cells containing <italic>GAP1</italic> CNVs (Methods). We observed similar CNV dynamics across independent populations within each strain (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B</xref>). Therefore, we summarized CNV dynamics for each strain using the median proportion of the population with a <italic>GAP1</italic> CNV (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). In every strain, <italic>GAP1</italic> CNVs are generated and selected resulting in qualitatively similar dynamics in WT and mutant strains.</p>

<title>Deletion of the ARS, but not the flanking LTRs alters CNV dynamics</title>
<p>We quantified three phases of CNV dynamics: 1) time to CNV appearance, defined by the inflection point before the rise in CNV proportion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>); 2) selection of CNV, corresponding to the increase in proportion of CNVs per generation during the initial expansion of CNVs (i.e., slope) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>); and 3) equilibrium phase, corresponding to the inflection point before the plateau (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). The time to CNV appearance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) and the CNV selection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) does not differ between WT and LTRΔ populations (pairwise Wilcoxon test, adjusted p = 1, pairwise t-test adjusted p = 1, respectively). In the WT and LTRΔ populations, <italic>GAP1</italic> CNVs appear at generation 50 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) and increase in proportion at similar rates, ∼15% per generation in WT and ∼18% per generation in LTRΔ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). The two strains both reach their equilibrium phase at the same time, around generation 75 (pairwise t-test, adjusted p =1) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). The absence of a significant difference in CNV dynamics between the two strains suggests that the LTRs are not a major determinant of <italic>GAP1</italic> CNV evolutionary dynamics.</p>
<p>By contrast, in ARSΔ and ALLΔ populations, we observe a delay in the time to CNV appearance. In both of these strains, CNVs are first detected at generations 65-80, whereas in WT and LTRΔ populations CNVs are first detected at generation 50 (ARSΔ vs. LTRΔ, wilcoxon pairwise test, adjusted p = 0.0059, ALLΔ vs. LTRΔ, Wilcoxon pairwise test, adjusted, p = 0.0124) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, the local ARS contributes to the initial <italic>GAP1</italic> CNV dynamics. Similarly, CNV selection is significantly different between the LTRΔ (18%) and ALLΔ (13%) (pairwise t-test, adjusted p-value = 0.0026) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Finally, we also observe a significant delay (ANOVA, p = 0.00833) in the generation at which the CNV proportion reaches equilibrium in ARSΔ (∼generation 112) compared to WT (pairwise t-test, adjusted p = 0.05) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). These observations suggest that absence of the ARS in the ARSΔ and ALLΔ strains delays the appearance of <italic>GAP1</italic> CNVs compared with the presence of the ARS in WT or LTRΔ strains.</p>

<title><italic>GAP1</italic> amplifications can occur without CNV reporter amplification</title>
<p>In both WT and LTRΔ populations we observed that <italic>GAP1</italic> CNV abundance stabilized around 75% during the equilibrium phase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) across each of the twelve independent populations (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary S3B</xref>). Flow cytometry analysis showed that each experiment begins a population of cells with only one-copy of GFP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Over generations, distinct populations appear with higher GFP fluorescence (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Previously, GFP fluorescence has been shown to scale with <italic>GAP1</italic> copy number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lauer et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, the four distinct subpopulations observed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) likely represent cells harboring 1, 2, 3, and 4-copies of <italic>GAP1,</italic> respectively. This corroborates previous experimental evolution results in which <italic>de novo GAP1</italic> CNVs are quickly formed and selected for and over selection higher copy outcompete lower copy subpopulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lauer et al., 2018</xref>). The raw flow cytometry plots (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>) and population GFP histograms (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>) also revealed a persistent single-copy GFP subpopulation throughout the timecourse (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A, bottom subpopulation in each panel</xref>). These data could be explained by two possible scenarios: 1) the existence of a non-<italic>GAP1</italic> CNV subpopulation comprising beneficial variation at other loci with fitness effects equivalent to <italic>GAP1</italic> CNVs; or 2) lineages with <italic>GAP1</italic> CNVs without co-amplification of the CNV reporter. To resolve these two possibilities, we sequenced clones from the single-copy GFP subpopulation across of the five WT populations from different chemostats (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) and identified the presence of <italic>GAP1</italic> amplifications without co-amplification of the CNV reporter in four out of five WT populations (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). We found eleven distinct <italic>GAP1</italic> CNVs that lacked amplification of the reporter gene (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>) indicating at least eleven independent CNV events occurred, either in the founder population or shortly after chemostat inoculation. By contrast, in one of the five populations, population 3, all clones from the single-copy GFP subpopulation contained one copy of GFP and one copy of <italic>GAP1</italic> (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), suggesting these clones have a beneficial mutation elsewhere in the genome that allows their stable coexistence with the <italic>GAP1</italic> CNV subpopulation. The <italic>GAP1</italic> CNVs without GFP amplification were either pre-existing at the time of the inoculation or occurred shortly after inoculation. We suspect that they likely occurred after inoculation but early in the evolution, for three reasons: 1) the similar ∼75% plateau is observed in the dynamics in all independent WT and LTRΔ populations, 2) at least eleven independent CNVs of this type were detected (<italic>GAP1</italic> amplification without co-amplification of the GFP), and 3) there are no common CNVs detected across chemostats. Our findings show that <italic>GAP1</italic> amplification without coamplification of the CNV reporter can occur and beneficial variation other than <italic>GAP1</italic> CNVs underlie adaptation to glutamine-limitation.</p>

<title>Incorporating unreported early-occurring CNVs in an evolutionary model</title>
<p>To quantify the evolutionary parameters underlying empirically measured CNV dynamics (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) we built a mathematical evolutionary model, which describes the experiment in a simplified manner. Because measuring CNV rates and selection coefficients is difficult and laborious to perform in the lab, we use neural network simulation-based inference (nnSBI) to estimate these parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Avecilla et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Cranmer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Gonçalves et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, we use the model to predict hypothetical outcomes of additional experiments without requiring additional experimentation. We have previously used nnSBI to infer <italic>GAP1</italic> CNV formation rates and selection coefficients in glutamine-limited selection and experimentally validated these inferences using barcode tracking and pairwise competition assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Avecilla et al., 2022</xref>). Previously, our evolutionary model assumed the <italic>GAP1</italic> CNV reporter allowed us to detect all <italic>GAP1</italic> CNVs. However, our new flow cytometry and sequencing results indicate the existence of a small subpopulation of unreported <italic>GAP1</italic> CNVs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B, C- cells</xref>) present either at the beginning or early in the experiments. Therefore, we expanded the evolutionary model to include φ, the proportion of cells with <italic>GAP1</italic> CNVs without co-amplification of the reporter, at the commencement of the experiment (i.e., generation 0). The remaining model parameters are δ<sub><italic>C</italic></sub>, the rate at which <italic>GAP1</italic> duplications form; δ<italic><sub>B</sub></italic>, the rate other beneficial mutations occur; <italic>s<sub>C</sub></italic>, the selection coefficient of <italic>GAP1</italic> CNVs; and <italic>s<sub>B</sub></italic>, the fitness effect of other beneficial mutations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). We find that this expanded evolutionary model can accurately describe the observed dynamics (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>), which are clearly affected by the value of φ. When the total CNV proportion is very different from the reported proportion, e.g., when φ≫δ<italic><sub>C</sub></italic> &gt; δ<italic><sub>B</sub></italic>, a reduced CNV formation rate results in a greater discrepancy between reported and total CNV proportions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>

<title>Decreased CNV formation rates in modified genomes suggests adjacent genomic elements contribute to <italic>GAP1</italic> CNV formation</title>
<p>We used nnSBI to infer CNV formation rates and selection coefficients from the evolutionary dynamics observed in glutamine-limited chemostats (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Previously, nnSBI estimations have been experimentally validated demonstrating its accuracy and reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Avecilla et al., 2022</xref>). First, we trained a neural density estimator using evolutionary simulations (Methods). This neural density estimator then allows us to infer posterior distributions and estimate the model parameters (i.e. the <italic>GAP1</italic> CNV formation rate, δ<italic><sub>C</sub></italic>; the <italic>GAP1</italic> CNV selection coefficient, <italic>s<sub>C</sub></italic>) from a single population CNV dynamics. We also inferred a collective posterior distribution from a set of replicate populations of the same strain. This collective posterior distribution consolidates estimations of the formation rate and selection coefficient from multiple replicate populations of one strain into one single estimate per strain in order to compare between the four strains, rather than between all 27 populations. We evaluated the confidence of our inference approach on synthetic simulations by computing its coverage, i.e., the probability that the true parameter falls within the 95% highest density interval (HDI) of the posterior distribution, a measure of certainty in an estimate similar to confidence intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Kruschke, 2021</xref>)(<xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). We find that the posterior distributions are narrow as the 95% HDI are less than an order of magnitude for both <italic>s<sub>C</sub></italic> and δ<italic><sub>C</sub></italic>. Thus, we did not apply post-training adjustments to the neural density estimator, such as calibration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Cook et al., 2006</xref>) or ensembles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Caspi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Hermans et al., 2022</xref>) when estimating δ<italic><sub>C</sub></italic> and <italic>s<sub>C</sub></italic> from experimental <italic>GAP1</italic> CNV dynamics.</p>
<p>We find that the individual maximum <italic>a posteriori</italic> (MAP) estimates vary across strains and replicates (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). Overall, the CNV selection coefficient, <italic>s<sub>C</sub></italic>, ranges from 0.1 to 0.22 (with one exception of 0.3), whereas the CNV formation rate, δ<italic><sub>C</sub></italic>, ranges from 10<sup>−6</sup> to 10<sup>−4</sup> (with one exception of 10<sup>−3</sup> and two of 10<sup>−7</sup>); and the proportion of early-occurring <italic>GAP1</italic> CNVs without amplification of the reporter (φ) ranges from 10<sup>−6</sup> to 10<sup>−2</sup> (with two exceptions of 10<sup>−8</sup>). We found that MAP estimates of replicate populations of the same strain cluster together, with some outliers (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). We performed posterior predictive checks, drawing parameter values from the posterior distributions and simulating the CNV dynamics (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>), which agree with the observed data (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). For each strain, we use all individual posterior distributions to infer the collective posterior distribution, which is a posterior distribution conditioned on all observations, <italic>P</italic>(θ|<italic>X</italic><sub>1</sub>, …, <italic>X</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub>) (Methods). The collective posterior allows us to estimate whether there is a difference in CNV formation rate and fitness effect across the four strains.</p>
<p>Collective posterior HDIs are very narrow (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), and samples are highly correlated, as expected for joint estimation of selection coefficients and beneficial mutation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gitschlag et al., 2023</xref>). The collective MAP estimates of the CNV selection coefficient are similar for the WT and LTRΔ (0.182). For ARSΔ and ALLΔ, the selection coefficient is estimated to be lower, with values of 0.146 and 0.126, respectively. However, all four selection coefficients are still large, consistent with these populations containing <italic>GAP1</italic> CNVs that are highly beneficial under glutamine-limitation. The collective MAP estimate for the CNV formation rate in WT is 4. 5⋅10<sup>−5</sup>. By contrast, the CNV formation rate is markedly lower in all mutant strains ranging from 1⋅10<sup>−5</sup> for LTRΔ and ALLΔ to 2. 4⋅10<sup>−6</sup> in ARSΔ. These results support our hypothesis that proximate sequence features facilitate <italic>GAP1</italic> CNV formation.</p>

</fig>
<p>The collective MAP predictions reproduce the experimental observations. Other than the very final time point for the WT population, all collective MAP predictions lay within the interquartile ranges (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). The observed <italic>GAP1</italic> CNV proportion stabilizes at different levels in the different experiments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). This can be explained by pre-existing or early-occurring unreported CNVs with proportions estimated to be between φ=4⋅10<sup>−6</sup> to 1. 6⋅10<sup>−4</sup> by the collective MAPs (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). Indeed, our model predicts that the total (reported and unreported) final CNV proportion is nearly one in all cases (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>).</p>
<p>We sought to understand the consequences of differences in CNV formation rate and CNV fitness effects between the four strains on evolutionary dynamics. We used a modified version of the evolutionary model with the estimated parameters to simulate an evolutionary competition between WT and the three architecture mutant strains over 116 generations, a point at which CNVs have reached high proportions in the experiment. To “win” these competitions, the competitor strains need to adapt to glutamine-limitation by producing CNVs. The results of the simulated competitions predict that the WT outcompetes the other strains in all cases as its predicted final proportion almost always exceeds its initial proportion of 0.5 (<xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 11</xref> and supplementary information). The average predicted proportion of WT cells when competing with LTRΔ is 0.717. By contrast, ARSΔ and ALLΔ are predicted to be almost eliminated by generation 116, as the average predicted WT proportion is 0.998 and 0.999, respectively. These simulated competitions further suggest that the ARS is a more important contributor to adaptive evolution mediated by <italic>GAP1</italic> CNVs.</p>
<p>Next, we estimated <italic>de novo</italic> CNV diversity in each strain. Previous work showed a diversity of CNV alleles formed under glutamine-limited selection including tandem duplications, segmental amplification, translocations, and whole chromosome amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lauer et al., 2018</xref>), and that lineage richness decreases rapidly over the course of evolution due in part to competition and clonal interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lauer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Levy et al., 2015</xref>; Nguyen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Ba et al., 2019</xref>). Our model does not include competition, clonal interference, or recurrent CNV formation. Therefore, diversity calculations are likely overestimations. Nonetheless, a comparison of diversity between strains is informative of whether proximate genome elements affect CNV allele diversity. Therefore, for each strain, we used its collective MAP to simulate a posterior prediction for the genotype frequencies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), which we then used to predict the posterior Shannon diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Jost, 2006</xref>). In all populations, we predict the set of CNV alleles to be highly diverse: the final predicted Shannon diversity ranges from 1. 6⋅10<sup>4</sup> in ARSΔ to 3. 2⋅10<sup>5</sup> in WT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Our model predicts that the diversity increases rapidly during the selection phase and stabilizes in the equilibrium phase. This is because CNV alleles that form towards the end of the experiment would have a low frequency with a minor effect on diversity. We observe the greatest diversity in WT populations with lower diversity in the three genomic architecture mutants. Moreover, diversity saturates faster in WT populations. This suggests that the WT strain is able to form more unique CNVs allele types earlier compared to the other three strains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Shannon diversity is lower in LTRΔ and further lower in ALLΔ and ARSΔ (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>) reflecting the rank order of CNV formation rates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>

<title>Inference of CNV mechanisms in genome architecture mutants</title>
<p>Contrary to our expectations, removal of proximate genomic elements from the <italic>GAP1</italic> locus does not inhibit the formation of <italic>GAP1</italic> CNVs. We sought to determine the molecular basis by which <italic>GAP1</italic> CNVs form in the absence of these local elements. Therefore, we isolated 177 <italic>GAP1</italic> CNV-containing clones across each population containing the four different strains at generations 79 and 125 and performed Illumina whole-genome sequencing. Using a combination of read depth, split read, and discordant read analysis, we defined the extent of the amplified region, the precise CNV breakpoints, and <italic>GAP1</italic> copy number. On the basis of these features, we inferred the CNV-forming mechanisms for each <italic>GAP1</italic> CNV (Methods). Among the 177 analyzed <italic>GAP1</italic> CNVs, we observed tandem amplifications, tandem triplications with an inverted middle copy, intra- and inter-chromosomal translocations, aneuploidy, and complex CNVs. <italic>GAP1</italic> copy numbers range from two to six in any given clone. Each of the four strains is able to produce a diversity of CNV alleles ranging from small (tens of kilobases) to large (∼hundreds of kilobases) segmental amplifications (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). We quantified the CNV length per strain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>) and found no significant interaction between CNV length and generation from which the clone was isolated (ANOVA, p=0.33) and therefore considered all 177 clones in subsequent comparisons (<xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 12</xref>). We found no significant effect of the inferred <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>C</italic></sub> (ANOVA, p= 0.673) or δ<italic><sub>C</sub></italic> (ANOVA, p= 0.277) on CNV length. We defined six major CNV-forming mechanisms across the four strains: ODIRA, LTR NAHR, NAHR, transposon-mediated, complex CNVs, and whole chromosome duplication (aneuploidy) and assigned each CNV allele to one mechanism using diagnostic features of each CNV (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-D</xref> and Methods).</p>

In the clone example, the short inverted repeat pairs are CAAT, ATTG (ChrXI:508938, ChrXI: 508986) in <italic>CAF4</italic> and TAAAA, AAAAT (ChrXI:582561, ChrXI582610) in <italic>AIM29</italic>. The contig sequence at the breakpoint (rectangle) is aligned to the reference within the <italic>CAF4</italic> coding sequence fragment. The 5’ and 3’ ends of the contig are labeled and a dashed line indicates contiguity (no gaps). The contig spans the <italic>CAF4</italic> breakpoint junction and contains a <italic>de novo</italic> inversion, i.e.) two fragments of the <italic>CAF4</italic> gene are in opposite orientations with the mediating short inverted repeats shown in blue and underlined. The contig was generated using CVish (Methods) and supported by split reads at the breakpoint junction (not shown).. The contig containing a <italic>de novo</italic> inversion across the <italic>AIM29</italic> breakpoint is not shown.

In the example clone, we detect a hybrid sequence between the two homologous sequences in <italic>BET3</italic> (ChrXI) and <italic>SPT4</italic> (ChrVI). Because these two sequences are on different chromosomes we infer that an interchromosomal translocation occurred. The other breakpoint is unresolved. A read depth plot supports the amplified segment containing the <italic>GAP1</italic> gene.

In the ALLΔ strains which have the flanking LTRs deleted, we find novel LTR retrotransposon insertions near previously deleted LTR sites. The newly deposited LTR sequence (<italic>downstream of GAP1</italic>) recombines with another LTR sequence (<italic>upstream of GAP1</italic>), either pre-existing or introduced by a second <italic>de novo</italic> retrotransposition, to form a resulting CNV (focal amplification or segmental amplification).

<title>ODIRA is a predominant mechanism of CNV formation</title>
<p>We inferred <italic>GAP1</italic> CNVs formed through ODIRA in all four genotypes at high frequencies: 22 out of 37 WT clones (59%), 42 out of 52 LTRΔ clones (81%), 11 out of 42 ARSΔ clones (26%), and 12 out of 46 ALLΔ clones (26%). Considering the set of all CNVs in all strains, ODIRA is the most common CNV mechanism comprising almost half of all CNVs (87/177, 49%). The second most common mechanism occurs about half as often—NAHR between flanking LTRs (38/177, 21%), which generates tandem amplifications. In the WT background, ODIRA (22/37) and NAHR between LTRs (11/37) account for 89% of <italic>GAP1</italic> CNVs.</p>
<p>In LTRΔ populations, <italic>GAP1</italic> CNVs form via ODIRA, chromosome missegregation, and NAHR using other sites. As expected, in LTRΔ clones we did not detect NAHR between LTRs in 52 clones and no focal amplifications were detected (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). In LTR<bold>Δ</bold> populations CNVs are formed predominantly by ODIRA (42/52, 81%) (<xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 3</xref>), a significant increase relative to WT clones (chi-sq, p = 0.02469) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). By contrast, aneuploidy (5/52), complex CNV (3/52), and NAHR (2/52) account for less than 10% of <italic>GAP1</italic> CNVs in LTR<bold>Δ</bold>. Consequently, we observe an increase in average <italic>GAP1</italic> CNV length in LTR<bold>Δ</bold> relative to WT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>) as there is an increased prevalence of segmental amplifications and aneuploidy (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, aneuploidy was observed infrequently. Whole amplification of chromosome XI was detected in six out of 177 clones (3.4%) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>) and detected in only two strains: WT and LTRΔ (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). We also detected supernumerary chromosomes in five out of 177 clones (2.8%), which formed through both NAHR and ODIRA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>).</p>

<title>ODIRA generates CNVs using distal ARS</title>
<p>Whereas removal of proximate LTRs prevents the formation of small tandem duplication CNVs through LTR NAHR, removal of the local ARS does not prevent the formation of <italic>GAP1</italic> CNVs through ODIRA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). In the absence of the proximate ARS, distal ones are used to form ODIRA as all amplified regions of ODIRA clones contain a distal ARS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>), with one exception (Methods, <xref rid="figs13" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 13</xref>). We observe a significant increase of LTR NAHR in the ARSΔ clones (27/52, 52%) relative to WT clones (11/37, 39%) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>, chi-sq, p = 0.03083). In ARSΔ clones, we find two CNV length groups (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>) that correspond with two different CNV mechanisms (<xref rid="figs14" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 14</xref>). All smaller CNVs (6-8kb) (<xref rid="figs14" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 14</xref>) correspond with a mechanism of NAHR between LTRs flanking the <italic>GAP1</italic> gene (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>, <italic>ARSΔ,</italic> bottom left green points<italic>)</italic>. Larger CNVs (8kb-200kb) (<xref rid="figs14" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 14</xref>) correspond with other mechanisms that tend to produce larger CNVs, including ODIRA and NAHR between one local and one distal LTR element (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>).</p>
<p>Surprisingly, we found CNVs with breakpoints consistent with ODIRA that contained only 2 copies of the amplified region, whereas ODIRA typically generates a triplication. In the absence of additional data, we cannot rule out inaccuracy in our read-depth estimates of copy numbers for these clones (ie. they have 3 copies). An alternate explanation is a secondary rearrangement of an original inverted triplication resulting in a duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Brewer et al., 2024</xref>); however, we did not detect evidence for secondary rearrangements in the sequencing data. A third alternate explanation is that a duplication was formed by hairpin capped double-strand break repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Narayanan et al., 2006</xref>). Notably, we found 3 additional ODIRA clones that end in native telomeres, each of which had amplified 3 copies. In these clones the other breakpoint contains the centromere, indicating the entire right arm of chromosome XI was amplified 3 times via ODIRA, each generating supernumerary chromosomes. Thus,ODIRA can result in amplifications of large genomics regions from segmental amplifications to supernumerary chromosomes.</p>

<title>Novel retrotransposition events potentiate <italic>GAP1</italic> CNVs</title>
<p>CNVs in the ALLΔ clones form by two major mechanisms: 1) ODIRA using distal ARS sites to form large amplifications and 2) LTR NAHR following novel Ty LTR retrotransposon insertions to form focal amplifications (transposon-mediated, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). These two classes are evident in the broad CNV lengths detected (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). ALLΔ clones tend to have more larger amplifications formed by ODIRA than ODIRA-generated amplifications in WT and LTRΔ (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>) because they encompass distal ARS and inverted repeats (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). Surprisingly, we detected novel LTR retrotransposon events that generated new LTRs that subsequently formed <italic>GAP1</italic> CNVs through NAHR with a pre-existing LTR in the genome or an LTR from a second novel retrotransposition (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). This explains the small focal amplifications detected in ALLΔ clones that are in some cases smaller than that of WT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Regions upstream of tRNA genes are known to be hotspots for Ty retrotransposons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Ji et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Mularoni et al., 2012</xref>). We find the novel retrotransposons insert near one or both of the previously deleted LTR sites (Supplementary File 1), which flank <italic>GAP1</italic> and are downstream of tRNA genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We only detected novel retrotranspositions in ALLΔ populations. In total we detected 15 unique Ty retrotransposon insertion sites of which eight were upstream of the deleted LTR, YKRCδ11, and four were downstream of deleted LTR, YKRCδ12 (Supplementary File 1). The remaining two insertions were distal to the <italic>GAP1</italic> gene: one on the short arm and the second on the long arm of chromosome XI. Every novel insertion was upstream of an tRNA gene, consistent with the biased preference of Ty LTR insertions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Ji et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Mularoni et al., 2012</xref>). Recombination between a new and preexisting LTR produces large amplifications whereas recombination between two newly inserted Ty1 flanking the <italic>GAP1</italic> gene forms focal amplifications of the <italic>GAP1</italic> gene (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we sought to understand the molecular basis of repeated <italic>de novo</italic> amplifications and selection of the general amino acid permease gene, <italic>GAP1</italic>, in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> evolving under glutamine-limited selection. We hypothesized that a high formation rate of <italic>GAP1</italic> CNVs is due to the unique genomic architecture at the locus, which comprises two flanking long terminal repeats and a DNA replication origin. We used genetic engineering, experimental evolution, and neural network simulation-based inference to quantify <italic>de novo</italic> CNV dynamics and estimate the CNV formation rate and selection coefficient in engineered mutants lacking the proximate genome elements. We find that removal of these elements has a significant impact on <italic>de novo</italic> CNV dynamics, CNV formation rate, and selection coefficients. However, CNVs are formed and selected in the absence of these elements highlighting the plasticity of the genome and diversity of mechanisms that generate CNVs during adaptive evolution.</p>
<p>Despite their proximity to <italic>GAP1</italic> and previous studies demonstrating the prevalence of NAHR between repetitive sequences forming CNVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Dunham et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Gresham et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Todd et al., 2019</xref>; H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), we found that flanking LTRs are not an essential driver of CNV formation. The <italic>de novo</italic> CNV dynamics of WT and LTRΔ populations are similar and we find that although the CNV formation rate is reduced, the effect is small. By contrast, a significantly decreased CNV formation rate and delayed CNV appearance time was observed in the absence of the ARS in ARSΔ and ALLΔ populations, which suggests that the local ARS is an important determinant of <italic>GAP1</italic> CNV-mediated adaptive dynamics. Furthermore, the significant delay in the time at which the CNV frequency reaches equilibrium in the ARSΔ compared to WT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>) can be explained by both the estimated lower CNV formation rate and lower selection coefficient (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). ODIRA was identified as the predominant CNV mechanism in sequence-characterized clones revealing that DNA replication errors, specifically template switching of the leading and lagging strands, are a common source of CNV formation during adaptive evolution.</p>
<p>Using nnSBI we inferred lower rates of CNV formation in all strains with modified genomes that may be informative of the rate at which specific mechanisms occur. The lower CNV formation rate in the LTRΔ strain could be a closer approximation of ODIRA formation rates at this locus as ODIRA CNVs are the predominant CNV mechanism in the LTRΔ strain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Furthermore, the low formation rates in the LTRΔ relative to WT might suggest that the presence of the flanking long terminal repeats may increase the rate of ODIRA formation through an otherwise unknown combinatorial effect of DNA replication across these flanking LTRs and template switching at the <italic>GAP1</italic> locus. ARSΔ has the lowest CNV formation rate and it could be an approximation of the rates of NAHR between flanking LTRs and ODIRA at distal origins. We find that the ALLΔ has a higher CNV formation rate than the ARSΔ. One explanation for this is that the deletion of the flanking LTRs in ALLΔ gives opportunity for novel transposon insertions and subsequent CNV formation through LTR NAHR. Indeed, we find an enrichment of novel transposon-insertions in the ALLΔ (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>) and subsequent CNV formation through recombination of the Ty1-associated repeats (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H, ALLΔ</xref>). The sequential events of transposon insertion followed by LTR NAHR must occur at a high rate to explain the increased CNV rate in ALLΔ relative to ARSΔ. While remarkable, increased transposon activity is associated with nutrient stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Curcio &amp; Garfinkel, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Lesage &amp; Todeschini, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Todeschini et al., 2005</xref>) and therefore this is a plausible explanation for the CNV rate estimated in ALLΔ. Additionally, ARSΔ clones rely more on LTR NAHR to form CNVs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). The prevalence of ODIRA in ARSΔ and ALLΔ are similar. LTR NAHR usually occurs after double strand breaks at the long terminal repeats to give rise to CNVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Argueso et al., 2008</xref>). Because we use haploid cells, such double strand break and homology-mediated repair would have to occur during S-phase after DNA replication with a sister chromatid repair template to form tandem duplications. Therefore the dependency on LTR NAHR to form CNVs and the spatial (breaks at LTR sequences) and temporal (S-phase) constraints could explain the lower formation rate in ARSΔ.</p>
<p>The genomic elements have clear effects on the evolutionary dynamics using simulated competitive fitness experiments. The similar selection coefficients in WT and LTRΔ suggest that CNV clones formed in these background strains are similar. Indeed, the predominant CNV mechanism in both is ODIRA followed by LTR NAHR (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Whereas LTR NAHR is abolished in the LTRΔ, it seems that CNVs formed by ODIRA allow adaptation to glutamine-limitation similar to WT. The lower selection coefficients in ARSΔ and ALLΔ suggest that <italic>GAP1</italic> CNVs formed in these strains have some cost. In a competition, they would get outcompeted by CNV alleles in the WT and LTRΔ background (<xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 11</xref>). Additionally, the local ARS, ARS1116, is a major origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">McGuffee et al., 2013</xref>) and ODIRA CNVs found around this origin corroborate its activity. The simulated competitions (<xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 11</xref>) further suggest that the ARS is a more important contributor to adaptive evolution mediated by <italic>GAP1</italic> CNVs.</p>
<p>The prevalence of ODIRA generated CNVs is a consequence of multiple DNA replication origins and pervasive inverted repeat sequences throughout the chromosome (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). In particular, breakpoint analysis of LTRΔ CNV clones show that ODIRA produces a continuum of CNV sizes along the short arm of chromosome XI. Downstream breakpoints of ODIRA-generated CNVs range from nearby the <italic>GAP1</italic> gene <italic>(∼</italic>3 kilobases<italic>)</italic> to the right telomere of chromosome XI (153 kilobases) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). The <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome contains a high frequency of inverted repeats ranging from 3bp to 14bp throughout the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Martin et al., 2024</xref>), but longer repeats are more likely to be used in ODIRA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Martin et al., 2024</xref>). The ubiquity of inverted repeats is in stark contrast to the relative paucity of LTR sequences, which are dispersed throughout the genome. Thus, ODIRA supplies a diverse and high number of gene amplifications for selection to act on, setting the stage for genome evolution and adaptation. It appears that complex CNVs may include secondary rearrangements after an initial ODIRA event as most complex CNVs in this study include signatures of ODIRA events (<xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Further work needs to be done to resolve the CNV structure.</p>
<p>Consistent with previous reports of increased Ty insertions in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> under stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Morillon et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">2002</xref>), we observed novel retrotransposon insertions in populations evolved in glutamine-limited chemostats. Transposon insertions can be harmful and lead to loss-of-function mutations but are also a means of generating beneficial alleles including CNVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Blanc &amp; Adams, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Dunham et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Gresham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Wilke &amp; Adams, 1992</xref>). We only detected novel Ty insertions in the ALLΔ strain. This is likely because regions upstream of tRNA genes are predisposed to transposition. Our detection of novel retrotransposon insertions is consistent with a previous experimental evolution study that suggested that Ty insertions were rare under constant nitrogen-limitation and substantially more common under fluctuating nitrogen limitation, in which cells experience total nitrogen starvation periodically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Hays et al., 2023</xref>). In that study, 898 novel Ty insertions were found across 345 clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Hays et al., 2023</xref>) corresponding to an average of 2.6 insertions per genome This high insertion frequency is consistent with detecting novel insertions on either side of the <italic>GAP1</italic> gene that subsequently mediate a focal amplification via LTR NAHR. Importantly, the role of Ty differs in the two studies, as in our case beneficial CNV formed after novel retrotransposition through recombination of newly introduced repeat sequences, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Hays et al. (2023)</xref> found Ty-associated null alleles that are beneficial in nitrogen-limited conditions. Together, these results reveal the different means by which retrotransposition can facilitate adaptive evolution..</p>
<p>Aneuploidy was not a major source of adaptation in our experiments as it was infrequently detected (n = 6/177). This contrasts with studies suggesting aneuploidy is a rapid and transient route to adaptation over short evolutionary time scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Chen, Bradford, et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Chen, Rubinstein, et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Pavelka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Selmecki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Selmecki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Yona et al., 2012</xref>). However, aneuploidy incurs a fitness cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Robinson et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Tsai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Yang et al., 2021</xref>) and therefore can be outcompeted by slow-forming but less costly beneficial mutations in large populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Kohanovski et al., 2024</xref>). Our observed higher frequencies of focal and segmental amplifications may be because they are less costly than whole-chromosome amplifications.</p>
<p>A variety of DNA replication errors generate CNVs. Replication slippage at palindromic DNA and DNA repeats can cause fork stalling and downstream CNV formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">F. Zhang, Khajavi, et al., 2009</xref>). DNA repeats can form secondary structures like R loops, cruciforms, non-B DNA structures, and hairpins which stimulate CNV formation (Gu et al., 2008). Untimely replication, faulty fork progression, S-phase checkpoint dysfunction, defective nucleosome assembly, and DNA repeat sites including LTRs are sources of replication-associated genome instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aguilera &amp; García-Muse, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Additional processes may also play a role. The <italic>GAP1</italic> gene is highly transcribed under glutamine-limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Airoldi et al., 2016</xref>) and transcription-replication collisions may fuel ODIRA CNV formation at this locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Lauer &amp; Gresham, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Wilson et al., 2015</xref>). CNV formation can also be stimulated by transcription-associated replication stress and histone acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Hull et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Salim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Whale et al., 2022</xref>) and replication fork stalling at tRNA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Osmundson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Yeung &amp; Smith, 2020</xref>). Testing the role of transcription in promoting the formation of adaptive CNVs warrants further investigation.</p>
<p>Recent work has proposed that ODIRA CNVs are a major mechanism of CNVs in human genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Brewer et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Martin et al., 2024</xref>). Studies of human and yeast genomes have typically considered homologous recombination as the predominant mechanism of CNV formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Lupski &amp; Stankiewicz, 2005</xref>). CNV hotspots identified in the human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Chance et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Lupski, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Lupski &amp; Stankiewicz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Pentao et al., 1992</xref>) and yeast genomes are indeed mediated by NAHR of long repeat sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Green et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Gresham et al., 2010</xref>). However, a focus on recombination-based mechanisms as a means of generating copy number variation may be the result of ascertainment bias or the comparative ease of studying the effect of long repeat sequences over short palindromic ones. Our study demonstrates that experimental evolution in yeast is a useful approach to elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which DNA replication errors generate CNVs.</p>

It consists of, in the following order, an <italic>ACT1</italic> promoter, mCitrine (GFP) coding sequence, <italic>ADH1</italic> terminator, and kanamycin cassette under control of a <italic>TEF</italic> promoter and terminator. To construct each deletion strain, we performed two rounds of transformations both using PCR amplified donor templates designed for homology-directed repair. The first transformation used a repair template containing a nourseothricin resistance cassette to replace the pre-existing kanamycin resistance cassette and <italic>GAP1</italic> gene. The repair template was designed to also delete the elements of interest (ie. ARS, both flanking LTRs, or both LTRs and ARS). The second transformation replaced the nourseothricin cassette with a kanamycin resistance cassette and <italic>GAP1</italic> gene thus yielding a genomic architecture Δ strain that is kanamycin(+) and nourseothricin(-). We confirmed scarless deletions with sanger sequencing and whole-genome-sequencing. Final identifiers are DGY1657 for the WT strain, DGY2076 for the LTRΔ strain, DGY2150 for the ARSΔ strain, and DGY2071 for the ALLΔ strain.</p>
<p>The zero-, one-, and two-copy GFP controls, DGY1, DGY500, and DGY1315, respectively, are described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lauer et al. 2018</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Spealman et al. 2023</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lauer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Spealman et al., 2023</xref>).

<title>Long-Term Experimental Evolution</title>
<p>We performed experimental evolution of 30 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> populations in miniature chemostats (ministats) for ∼137 generations under nitrogen limitation with 400μM glutamine as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lauer et al. (2018)</xref>. Of the 30 populations, there were three controls: one control population with no fluorescent reporter (DGY1), one with one GFP fluorescent reporter (DGY500), one with two GFP fluorescent reporters (DGY1315). The remaining 27 populations have the <italic>GAP1</italic> CNV GFP reporter. Of these, five populations are WT (DGY1657), seven are LTRΔ (DGY2076), seven are ARSΔ (DGY2150), and eight are ALLΔ (DGY2071). We inoculated each ministat containing 20ml of glutamine-limited media with 0.5 ml culture from its corresponding genotype founder population. The founder population was founded by a single colony grown overnight in glutamine-limited media at 30°C. Replicate populations of the same strain were inoculated from the same founder population derived from a single colony. Strains were randomized among the 30-plex ministat setup to account for the possibility of systematic position effects. After inoculation, populations were incubated in a growth chamber at 30°C for 24 hours with the media inflow pump off. After 24 hours, the populations had reached early stationary phase and we turned on the media inflow pump and waited 4 hours for the populations to reach steady-state equilibrium, at which the population size was ∼10<sup>8</sup> cells. This was generation zero. Ministats were incubated in a growth chamber at 30°C with a dilution rate of 0.12 culture volumes/hr. Since the ministats had a 20ml culture volume, the population doubling time was 5.8 hours. Approximately every 10 generations, we froze 2-ml samples of each population in 15% glycerol stored at −80°C. Approximately every 30 generations, we pelleted cells from 1-ml samples of each population and froze them at −80°C for genomic DNA extraction.</p>

<sec id="s4c">
<title>Flow Cytometry analysis to study <italic>GAP1</italic> CNV dynamics</title>
<p>To track <italic>GAP1</italic> CNV dynamics, we sampled 1-ml from each population approximately every 10 generations. We sonicated cell populations for 1 minute to remove any cell clumping and immediately analyzed samples on the Cytek Aurora flow cytometer. We sampled 100,000 cells per population and recorded forward scatter, side scatter, and GFP fluorescent signals for every cell. We performed hierarchical gating to define cells, single cells, unstained (zero-copy-GFP control) cells, cells with one copy of GFP (<italic>GAP1</italic>), and two or more copies of GFP (<italic>GAP1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Spealman et al., 2023</xref>). First we gated for cells (filtered out any debris, bacteria) by graphing forward scatter area (FSC-A) against side scatter area (SSC-A). Second, we gated for single cells by graphing forward scatter area against forward scatter height and drawing along the resulting diagonal. Finally, we drew non-overlapping gates to define three subpopulations: zero copy, one copy, and two or more copies of GFP by graphing B2 channel area (B2-A), which detects GFP (excitation = 516 <bold>λ</bold>, emission = 529 <bold>λ</bold>), against forward scatter area (FSC-A). We note that the one copy and two copy events overlap some, which is a limitation in this experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Spealman et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>We found that two architecture mutants, DGY2150 and DGY2071, had strain-specific GFP fluorescence even though they only harbored one copy of GFP. DGY2150 and DGY2071 had slightly higher fluorescence than the one copy GFP control strain, DGY500, but less than that of the two copy GFP control strain, DGY1315. The third architecture mutant, DGY2076, had the same GFP fluorescence as the one-copy GFP control strain (DGY500). We ruled out that they were spontaneous diploids by looking at forward scatter signals. The forward scatter signal was not different from that of the one copy control (a haploid) and was not as high as a diploid. Therefore due to strain-specific fluorescence, we decided to perform strain-based gating, ie. one set of gates for the WT strain, a second set of gates for the LTRΔ strain, and so on. Since the controls are also a strain of their own, they were not used to set universal gates for one-copy or two-copy. Thus, for each strain, we chose the basis of our one-copy gate as the timepoint per strain in aggregate with the lowest median cell-sized normalized fluorescence. The two-or-more-copy (CNV) gate was drawn directly above and non-overlapping with the one-copy gate.</p>

<sec id="s4d">
<title>Quantification of dynamics</title>
<p>To obtain the proportion of CNVs for each population at each timepoint, we applied gates that correspond to zero-,one-, and two-or-more copy subpopulations. Using such proportion per population per timepoint, we summarize population CNV dynamics as follows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lauer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Spealman et al., 2023</xref>). We calculate the generation of CNV appearance for each of the evolved populations. We defined CNV appearance as the generation where the proportion of CNV-containing cells first surpasses a threshold of 10% for three consecutive generations. Next, modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Lang et al. (2011)</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Lang et al., 2011</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lauer et al. (2018)</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lauer et al., 2018</xref>), we calculate the percent increase in CNVs per generation for each evolved population. We compute the natural log of the proportion of the population with CNVs divided by the proportion of the population without CNVs for each timepoint. These proportions were obtained previously by gating. We plot these values across time and perform linear regression during the initial increase of CNVs. The slope of the linear regression is the percent increase in CNVs per generation. Finally, we calculate the time to CNV equilibrium, as defined by the generation at which a linear regression results in a slope &lt; 0.005 after the selection phase.</p>

<title>Evolutionary model</title>
<p>We developed a Wright-Fisher model that describes the evolutionary dynamics, similar to our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Avecilla et al., 2022</xref>). In that study we have shown that a Wright-Fisher model is suitable for describing evolutionary dynamics in a chemostat. Wright Fisher is a discrete-time evolutionary model with a constant population size and non-overlapping generations. Every generation has three stages: selection, in which the proportion of genotypes with beneficial alleles increases; mutation, in which genotypes can gain a single beneficial mutation or CNV; and drift, in which the population of the next generation is generated by sampling from a multinomial distribution. Our model follows the change in proportion of four genotypes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>): <italic>A</italic>, the ancestor genotype; <italic>B</italic>, a cell with a non-CNV beneficial mutation; <italic>C</italic><sup>+</sup>, a genotype with two copies of <italic>GAP1</italic> and two copies of the CNV reporter; and <italic>C</italic><sup>−</sup> a genotype with two copies of <italic>GAP1</italic> but only a single copy of the CNV reporter. CNV and non-CNV alleles are formed at a rate of δ<italic><sub>C</sub></italic> and δ<italic><sub>B</sub></italic> and have a selection coefficient of <italic>s<sub>C</sub></italic> and <italic>s<sub>B</sub></italic>, respectively. The proportion of genotype <italic>i</italic> is <italic>X<sub>i</sub></italic>. Unlike <italic>X<sub>B</sub></italic> and <italic>X<sub>C</sub></italic><sup>+</sup>, which may increase due to both mutation and selection, we assume that <italic>C</italic><sup>−</sup> is not generated after generation 0 (as experimental results suggest that the reporter is working properly). Hence, the proportion of the <italic>C</italic><sup>−</sup> genotype only increases idue to selection, with <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>C</italic></sub> as its selection coefficient. We assume <italic>C</italic><sup>−</sup> has an initial proportion φ. Model equations and further details are in the supplementary information.</p>

<p>We applied NPE, implemented in the Python package <italic>sbi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Tejero-Cantero et al., 2020</xref>), using a masked autoregressive flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Papamakarios et al., 2018</xref>) as the neural density estimator: an artificial neural network that “learns” an amortized posterior of model parameters from a set of synthetic simulations. Posterior amortization allows us to infer the posterior distribution P(θ|Χ) for a new observation Χ without the need to re-run the entire inference pipeline, i.e., generating new simulations and re-training the network (as is the case in sampling-based methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo or MCMC).</p>
<p>We generated 100,000 synthetic observations simulated from our evolutionary model using parameters drawn from the prior distribution (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The neural density estimator was trained using early stopping with a convergence threshold of 100 epochs without decreases in minimal validation loss (the default in <italic>sbi</italic> is 20). Using 100 epochs as a threshold resulted in improved predictions. We validated that this improvement in prediction accuracy is not a result of over-fitting (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>).</p>
<p>We validated the trained neural density estimator by measuring the coverage property: the probability that parameters fall within the inferred posterior marginal 95% HDI. Then, we used the distribution of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="589936v2_inline1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>) and posterior predictive checks (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>) as quantitative and qualitative measures of prediction accuracy, respectively.</p>

<title>Collective posterior distribution</title>
<p>NPE estimates a single posterior distribution per observation, i.e., <italic>P</italic>(θ|<italic>X</italic>). Given <italic>n</italic> observations <italic>X</italic><sub>1</sub>, …<italic>X</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> generated from the same model distribution <italic>P</italic>(θ)<italic>P</italic>(<italic>X</italic>|θ), where each observation is a time-series of GAP1 CNV proportion, NPE infers <italic>n</italic> individual posterior distributions, each conditioned on a single observation, <italic>P</italic>(θ|<italic>X</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>). We infer the <italic>collective posterior distribution</italic> based on <italic>n</italic> individual posteriors, that is, a posterior distribution conditioned on all observations,
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="589936v2_eqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
This can be computed using the individual posteriors <italic>P</italic>(θ|<italic>X</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) and the prior <italic>P</italic>(θ) (see supplementary information for derivation).</p>
<p>However, as <italic>P</italic>(θ|<italic>X</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) could be infinitesimally small, a single observation could potentially reject a parameter value that is likely according to other observations. We want the collective posterior to be robust to such non-representative observations. Therefore, we define <italic>P</italic><sub>ɛ</sub>(θ|<italic>X</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) = <italic>max</italic>(ɛ, <italic>P</italic>(θ|<italic>X</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>)) and use this quantity instead of <italic>P</italic>(θ|<italic>X</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) in <xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">eq. 1</xref>. For a correct choice of ɛ, the collective posterior mode should reflect a value with high posterior density for multiple observations, rather than a value that no individual posterior completely rejects. We set ɛ = <italic>e</italic><sup>−150</sup> based on a visual grid-search. To find the normalizing factor (denominator in <xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">eq. 1</xref>), the integral is approximated by a dense Riemann sum (300 points). Maximizing the distribution, i.e., finding the collective MAP, is implemented using <italic>scipy</italic>’s <italic>minimize</italic> method with the Nelder-Mead algorithm.</p>

<title>Whole genome sequencing of isolated clones</title>
<p>Clones were isolated from archived populations and verified to harbor a <italic>GAP1</italic> CNV by measuring GFP fluorescence signal consistent with two or more copies. Populations of each strain from generation 79 were streaked out from the −80°C archive on YPD and incubated at 30°C for 2 days. Plates containing single colonies were viewed under a blue light to view GFP fluorescent colonies by eye. Relative to the fluorescence of the 2 copy control strain, we picked single colonies that fluoresced as bright or brighter, reasoning that these colonies would likely contain <italic>GAP1 CNVs</italic>. Single colonies were used to inoculate cultures in glutamine-limited media and incubated at 30°C for 18 hours.

<sec id="s4g4">
<title>Definitions of Inferred CNV mechanisms</title>
<p>We used the following liberal classifications for each CNV category. We called a clone ODIRA if we found inverted sequences in at least one breakpoint (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). We define LTR NAHR as having both breakpoints at LTR sites (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), evidence of recombination between the homologous LTR sequences. This mechanism typically forms tandem amplifications. In some cases, we find the hybrid sequence between two LTRs, but this is hard to recover in short-read-sequencing. We define NAHR as having breakpoints at homologous sequences, with at least one breakpoint not at an LTR sequence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). We define transposon-mediated as a clone having a breakpoint at a novel LTR retrotransposon site and the other breakpoint at a different LTR site (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Such characteristics support that the newly deposited LTR sequence recombined with another LTR sequence (either pre-existing or introduced by a second <italic>de novo</italic> retrotransposition) to form CNVs. Rarely, we are able to recover the hybrid sequence between LTR sequences even with high sequencing coverage 80-100X). We define complex CNV as having more than two breakpoints on chromosome XI and a read depth profile that suggests more than one amplification event occurred (i.e. multi-step profile). For the complex CNV clones, we were not able to resolve the CNV mechanisms due to the limitations of short-read sequencing, though most have at least one ODIRA breakpoint.</p>

<p>Estimated copy number of the <italic>GAP1</italic> gene and inserted GFP gene of sequenced clones from five 1-copy-GFP minor subpopulations of the WT genome architecture strain. Copy number estimation is defined as the read depth of the target gene relative to the average read depth of the chromosome XI. Populations 1, 2, 4, 5 contain clones harboring GAP1 <italic>CNVs</italic> but only 1 copy of GFP. Clones from population 3 and 5 harbor 1 copy each of <italic>GAP1</italic> and GFP suggesting these lineages have beneficial mutations elsewhere in the genome, allowing coexistence with the <italic>GAP1</italic> CNV major subpopulation.

<caption><title>Estimation of network confidence.</title>
<p>The coverage, defining the probability that the true parameter falls within the 95% highest density interval (HDI) of the posterior distribution, for 829 synthetic simulations in which the final reported <italic>GAP1</italic> CNV proportion is at least 0.3. 95% HDI was calculated for each simulation using 200 posterior samples.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The work by Chuong et al. provides important new insights into the contribution of different molecular mechanisms in the dynamics of CNV formation. It will be of interest to anyone curious about genome architecture and evolution from yeast biologists to cancer researchers studying genome rearrangements.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Their results are especially striking in that the &quot;simplest&quot; mechanism of GAP1 amplification (non-allelic homologous recombination between the flanking Ty-LTR elements) is not the most common route taken by the cells, emphasizing the importance of experimentally testing what might seem on the surface to be obvious outcome. One of the important developments of their work is the use of their neural network simulation-based inference (nnSBI) model to derive rates of amplicon formation and their fitness effects.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The nnSBI model that derives rates of amplicon formation and fitness is still opaque to this reviewer. All of the other criticisms made in the first review have been clarified/corrected in this much-improved version of the manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study examines how local DNA features around the amino acid permease gene GAP1 influence adaptation to glutamine limited conditions through changes in GAP1 Copy Number Variation (CNV). The study is well motivated by the observation of numerous CNVs documented in many organisms, but difficulty in distinguishing the mechanisms by which they are formed, and whether or how local genomic elements influence their formation. The main finding is convincing and is that a nearby Autonomous Replicating Sequence (ARS) influences the formation of GAP1 CNVs and this is consistent with a predominate mechanism of Origin Dependent Inverted Repeat Amplification (ODIRA). These results along with finding and characterizing other mechanisms of GAP1 CNV formation will be of general interest to those studying CNVs in natural systems, experimental evolution and in tumor evolution. While the results are limited to a single CNV of interest (GAP1), the carefully controlled experimental design and quantification of CNV formation will provide a useful guide to studying other CNVs and CNVs in other organisms.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study was designed to examine the effects of two flanking genomic features next to GAP1 on CNV formation and adaptation during experimental evolution. This was accomplished by removing two Long Terminal Repeats (LTRs), removing a downstream ARS, and removing both LTRs and the ARS. Although there was some heterogeneity among replicates, later shown to include the size and breakpoints of the CNV and the presence of an unmarked CNV, both marker assisted tracking of CNV formation and modeling of CNV rate and fitness effects showed that deletion of the ARS caused a clear difference compared to the control and the LTR deletion.</p>
<p>The consequence of deletion of local features (LTR and ARS) was quantified by genome sequencing of adaptive clones to identify the CNV size, copy number and infer the mechanism of CNV formation. This greatly added value to the study as it showed that i) ODIRA was the most common mechanism but ODIRA is enhanced by a local ARS, ii) non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) is also used but depends on LTRs, and iii) de novo insertion of transposable elements mediate NAHR in strains with both ARS and LTR deletions. Together, these results show how local features influence the mechanism of CNV formation, but also how alternative mechanism can substitute when primary ones are unavailable.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The CNV mutation rate and effect on fitness are hard to disentangle. The frequency of the amplified GFP provides information about mutation rate differences as well as fitness differences. The data and analysis show that each evolved population has multiple GAP1 CNV lineages within it, with some being unmarked by GFP. Thus, estimates of CNV fitness are more of a composite view of all CNV amplifications increasing in frequency during adaptation. Another unknown but potential complication is whether the local (ARS, LTR) deletions influence GAP1 expression and thus the fitness gain of GAP1 CNVs. The neural network simulation based inference does a good job at estimating both mutation rates and fitness effects, while also accounting for unmarked CNVs. However, the model does not account for population heterogeneity of CNVs and their fitness effects. Despite these limitations of distinguishing mutation rate and fitness differences, the authors' conclusions are well supported in that the LTR and ARS deletions have a clear impact on the CNV mediated evolutionary outcome and the mechanism of CNV formation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Various 'simple' models are used to mechanistically explain the formation of genomic rearrangements, often based on local sequence elements. Here the authors show these models to be lacking for the well characterised GAP1 locus as, although predicted events are observed at reasonable frequency, mutating relevant local sequence elements has surprisingly little impact on the emergence of GAP1 CNV. Rather, a similar set of mechanisms occur (at in some cases somewhat lower frequency) using different genomic elements, the outcome being that that CNV frequency is largely independent of local genomic elements, although this does of course strongly influence the actual structure of the CNVs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a very thorough study of a very complex system.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are limitations as previous reviews have noted, but these are well justified in the revised text and rebuttal</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews</bold>:</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The work by Chuong et al. provides important new insights into the contribution of different molecular mechanisms in the dynamics of CNV formation. It will be of interest to anyone curious about genome architecture and evolution from yeast biologists to cancer researchers studying genome rearrangements.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for recognizing the broad significance of our study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Their results are especially striking in that the &quot;simplest&quot; mechanism of GAP1 amplification-non-allelic homologous recombination between the flanking Ty-LTR elements is not the most common route taken by the cells, emphasizing the importance of experimentally testing what might seem on the surface to be obvious answers. One of the important developments of their work is the use of their neural network simulation-based inference (nnSBI) model to derive rates of amplicon formation and their fitness effects.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with this assessment as the results of our study challenge our intuition that the simplest path to structural variation is the most likely and reveals the great diversity in mechanisms that can lead to large scale changes in the genome.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript reads as though two different people wrote two different sections of the manuscript - an experimental evolutionist and a computational scientist. If the goal is to reach both groups of readers, there needs to be more explanation of both types of work. I found the computational sections to be particularly dense but even the experimental sections need clearer explanations and more specific examples of the rearrangements found. I will point out these areas in the detailed remarks to the authors. While I have no reason to question their conclusions, I couldn't independently verify the results that ODIRA was the majority mechanism since the sequence of amplified clones was not made available during the review. I've encouraged the authors to include specific, detailed sequence information for both ODIRA events as well as the specific clones where GAP1 was amplified but the flanking gene GFP was not.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have revised the manuscript to expand explanations of both the experimental and computational aspects of our study and to provide additional information for the reader. In doing so, we have edited the text to improve readability. We have made all raw data publicly available through the NCBI short read archive (SRA) and are hosting all sequence data for easy visualization in JBrowse using a public server.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study examines how local DNA features around the amino acid permease gene GAP1 influence adaptation to glutamine-limited conditions through changes in GAP1 Copy Number Variation (CNV). The study is well motivated by the observation of numerous CNVs documented in many organisms, but difficulty in distinguishing the mechanisms by which they are formed, and whether or how local genomic elements influence their formation. The main finding is convincing and is that a nearby Autonomous Replicating Sequence (ARS) influences the formation of GAP1 CNVs and this is consistent with a predominate mechanism of Origin Dependent Inverted Repeat Amplification (ODIRA). These results along with finding and characterizing other mechanisms of GAP1 CNV formation will be of general interest to those studying CNVs in natural systems, experimental evolution, and in tumor evolution. While the results are limited to a single CNV of interest (GAP1), the carefully controlled experimental design and quantification of CNV formation will provide a useful guide to studying other CNVs and CNVs in other organisms.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this positive assessment of our study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study was designed to examine the effects of two flanking genomic features next to GAP1 on CNV formation and adaptation during experimental evolution. This was accomplished by removing two Long Terminal Repeats (LTRs), removing a downstream ARS, and removing both LTRs and the ARS. Although there was some heterogeneity among replicates, later shown to include the size and breakpoints of the CNV and the presence of an unmarked CNV, both marker-assisted tracking of CNV formation and modeling of CNV rate and fitness effects showed that deletion of the ARS caused a clear difference compared to the control and the LTR deletion.</p>
<p>The consequence of deletion of local features (LTR and ARS) was quantified by genome sequencing of adaptive clones to identify the CNV size, copy number and infer the mechanism of CNV formation. This greatly added value to the study as it showed that i) ODIRA was the most common mechanism but ODIRA is enhanced by a local ARS, ii) non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) is also used but depends on LTRs, and iii) de novo insertion of transposable elements mediate NAHR in strains with both ARS and LTR deletions. Together, these results show how local features influence the mechanism of CNV formation, but also how alternative mechanisms can substitute when primary ones are unavailable.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with this assessment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The CNV mutation rate and its effect on fitness are hard to disentangle. The frequency of the amplified GFP provides information about mutation rate differences as well as fitness differences. The data and analysis show that each evolved population has multiple GAP1 CNV lineages within it, with some being unmarked by GFP. Thus, estimates of CNV fitness are more of a composite view of all CNV amplifications increasing in frequency during adaptation. Another unknown but potential complication is whether the local (ARS, LTR) deletions influence GAP1 expression and thus the fitness gain of GAP1 CNVs. The neural network simulation-based inference does a good job at estimating both mutation rates and fitness effects, while also accounting for unmarked CNVs. However, the model does not account for the population heterogeneity of CNVs and their fitness effects. Despite these limitations of distinguishing mutation rate and fitness differences, the authors' conclusions are well supported in that the LTR and ARS deletions have a clear impact on the CNV-mediated evolutionary outcome and the mechanism of CNV formation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While it is true that the inferred mutation rate and fitness effect are negatively correlated, as in other studies (Gitschlag et al., 2023; Caspi et al., 2023; Avecilla et al., 2022), our modeling approach does generate an estimate of each parameter that is best explained by the data. By reporting the confidence intervals (i.e. the 95% HDI) we define the set of parameter values that are consistent with the data. It is true that our model doesn't explicitly account for population heterogeneity; rather, following Hegreness et al. (2006), we employ a single effective fitness effect and mutation rate for all GAP1 CNVs. It is interesting to consider whether the ARS and LTR affect <italic>GAP1</italic> expression; however, we have no evidence that this is the case.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors represent an elegant and detailed investigation into the role of cis-elements, and therefore the underlying mechanisms, in gene dosage increase. Their most significant finding is that in their system copy number increase frequently occurs by what they call replication errors that result from the origin of replication firing.</p>
<p>The authors somewhat quantitatively determine the effect of the presence of a proximal origin of replication or LTR on the different CNV scenarios.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) A clever and elegant experimental design.</p>
<p>(2) A quantitative determination of the effect of a proximal origin of replication or LTR on the different CNV scenarios. Measuring directly the contribution of two competing elements.</p>
<p>(3) ODIRA can occur by firing of a distal ARS element.</p>
<p>(4) Re-insertion of Ty elements is interesting.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that these are interesting and novel findings from our study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Overall, the research does not considerably advance the current knowledge. The research does not investigate what the maximum distance between ARS for ODIRA is to occur. This is an important point since ODIRA was previously described. A considerable contribution to the field would be to understand under what conditions ODIRA wins NAHR.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that these are important questions and they are ones that we are pursuing in future studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The title and some sentences in the abstract give a wrong impression of the generality and the novelty of the observations presented. Below are some examples of much earlier work that dealt with mechanisms of CNV and got different conclusions. The Lobachev lab (Cell 2006) published a different scenario years ago, with a very different mechanism (hair-pin capped breaks). The Argueso lab found something different (NAHR) (Genetics 2013).</p>
<p>In fact, the CUP1 system presents a good example of this point. The Houseley group showed a complex replication transcription-based mechanism (NAR 2022, cited), the Argueso group showed Ty-based amplification and the Resnick group showed aneuploidy-based amplification. While aneuploidy is a minor factor here the numerous works in Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Yeast suggest otherwise (Selmecki et al Science 2006, Yona et al PNAS 2013, Yang et al Microbiology Spectrum 2021).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As the reviewer points out there have been several important published studies investigating mechanisms by which structural variation is generated. It is important to note that we are explicitly looking at CNVs in the context of adaptive evolution and the role of genomic features that enable different mechanisms of CNV formation. To emphasize this point, we have changed the title of our manuscript to “Template switching during DNA replication is a prevalent source of adaptive gene amplification”. Aneuploidy is indeed a mechanism of adaptive gene amplification in our current and previously reported studies. We have expanded our discussion to place our study in the context of previous studies reporting mechanisms of gene amplification.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors added a mathematical model to their experimental data. For me, it was very difficult to understand the contribution of the model to the research. I anticipated, for example, that the model would make predictions that would be tested experimentally. For example, &quot; ARSΔ and ALLΔ are predicted to be almost eliminated by generation 116, as the average predicted WT proportion is 0.998 and 0.999&quot; But to my understanding without testing the model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our previous publication (Avecilla et al. 2022, <italic>PLoS Biology</italic>) we experimentally validated the use of nnSBI to infer evolutionary parameters. In this study, we have extended our modeling framework to quantify differences between genotypes, which was not previously possible. Our results reveal that the local ARS has a key role in the overall supply rate of CNVs at this locus.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We have added all suggested references.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Page 6, third paragraph: I was surprised that a single inoculating strain was used to establish the replicate chemostats because of the possibility of non-independence of the resulting GAP1 CNVs. A nnSBI model was used to correct for this possibility later in the paper. It seems like it could have been avoided by a simple change in protocol to inoculate each chemostat with an independent inoculum. Was there a reason that the replicate chemostats were not conducted as independent events? Establishing the presence of 'founder' GAP1 CNVs without GFP seems rather secondary to the point of the paper (examining the CNVs that arise during evolution) and I would recommend it being moved to the supplement.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As is typical in microbial experimental evolution studies, we aimed to start with genetically identical homogenous populations and observe the emergence and selection of <italic>de novo</italic> variation. Therefore, we founded independent populations from a single inoculum. However, this study, and our prior work using lineage tracking barcodes, has clearly demonstrated that during the initial growth of the culture used for the inoculum CNVs are generated that contribute to the adaptation dynamics on all derived populations. This unanticipated result now suggests that the reviewer’s suggestion is a valid one - independent populations should be derived from independent inocula and this will be our standard practice in future studies.</p>
<p>We believe that our results, presented in Figure 2, establishing the presence of pre-existing GAP1 CNVs without the GFP are important as it highlights a limitation of the use of CNV reporters of gene copy number that was not previously known. However, we subsequently show that this class of variant - CNVs that are not detected by the reporter system - can be incorporated into our modeling framework enabling estimation of evolutionary parameters, which we believe is an important finding warranting inclusion in the main text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Page 7 first full paragraph: &quot;Finally, we also observe a significant delay (ANOVA, p = 0.00833) in the generation at which the CNV frequency reaches equilibrium in ARS∆ (~generation 112) compared to WT (pairwise t-test, adjusted p = 0.05) . . .&quot;. Is the delay in reaching a plateau in Figure 1E just a consequence of the later appearance of CNVs or do the authors believe there are two separate events responsible for this delay? E.g. if the authors think that the delay in reaching a plateau is related to lower selection coefficients of the CNVs that do arise compared to the CNVs of other strains, then this should be explicitly discussed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe that the delay in reaching equilibrium is a consequence of both a lower CNV formation and reduced selection coefficients. Lower values for the fitness coefficient and formation rate in ARS∆ explain both the delay in CNV appearance and CNV equilibrium as shown by the predicted dynamics (Figure S3B). We have added an explicit discussion of the effect of the ARS on CNV dynamics in paragraph 2 of the Discussion section paragraph 2 starting at line 456.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Page 7: Incorporating pre-existing CNVs into an evolutionary model: The rationale for how you are able to discount the formation rate of GFP-free CNVs (C-) in your model isn't clear to me. How are you able to assume that these C- events don't form after timepoint 0? Why do you assume a starting population of C- events but not a starting population of C+ events?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We explored the possibility of modeling C- (amplifications of GAP1 without amplification of the reporter) during the evolution experiment. However, because the rate at which C- events occurs is slower than the rate at which C+ events occur (GAP1 amplifications with amplification of the reporter) we found that the effect was negligible. Importantly, the simple model is sufficient to describe the observed dynamics and thus we do not include these possible rare events.</p>

<p>(5) Figure 1:</p>
<p>(a) Panel B: Please put the tRNAs on the line diagrams of the four strains. I first interpreted ALLΔ as missing the tRNAs, too.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion. We added tRNAs to all diagrams to provide additional detail about the structure of the <italic>GAP1</italic> locus.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(b) Panels C, D, and E: the dark shade of the colored boxplots obscures the individual points. I recommend reducing the opacity of the box or choosing a lighter shade so that the individual points are visible on top of the box. Is the percent increase in CNVs per generation (Panel D) based on the slopes of the curves in panel B? By eye the slopes of ARS∆ and ALL∆ appear at least as steep as those of wild type and LTR∆.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have now made the individual points visible on top of the boxplots in Figures 1C, 1D, and 1E. The lines in Figure 1B show the median value across populations per time point whereas each point in Figure 1D is the slope from linear regression using values from individual populations (data from individual populations are shown in Figure 3C).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Figure 2:</p>
<p>(a) Panel A: Please remind the readers what FSC-A is measuring and label the different groups of cells in each sample. Are we supposed to assume the upper scatter in generation 8 is the pre-existing CNV variants? Are the three species at generation 50 due to 1, 2, and 3 copies of GFP? Is the new species in generation 137 further amplification of the locus? And if so, how many copies does it represent? I find it fascinating that what I assume is the 2-copy CNV (presumably a direct oriented amplicon produced by NAHR) at 50 generations is lost (out-competed by a potential inverted triplication) at later times, but I didn't find any mention of this phenomenon in the text. What do the different mutant strains look like over the same time course? Please supply supplemental figures with the flow cytometry gating and vertically aligned histograms of the GFP signal so that the peaks are more easily compared. And provide this information for each of the altered strains in supplementary materials.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for these useful suggestions. We have added a gating legend to the figure to clearly indicate the copy-number for each subpopulation. We have edited the caption and main text to explain forward scatter (FSC-A). Raw flow cytometry plots are now provided as Supplementary figure 2 and distributions of cell-size normalized GFP signal are provided in Supplementary figure 3. Although our primary objective with Figure 2A was to show the persistence of the 1-copy GFP population the reviewer is correct that we did not highlight interesting aspects of the CNV dynamics. We have added additional text starting at line 251 to point out these features of the data.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(b) Panel B: It would help to label the different colored boxes inside cells in Figure 2B - it took me a while to identify the white box as an unrelated adaptive mutation elsewhere in the genome. The linear arrangement of these small colored blocks seems to indicate their structural arrangement. Is that the case? And are they inverted or direct amplicons? Perhaps the authors are being agnostic at this point but it would be better if each of the blocks were separate. If there are other mutations that can explain these GFP-non-amplified survivors, were they identified in your whole genome sequencing?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now included a complete legend for Figure 2B indicating that the white box reflects other beneficial mutations. We have separated this class of beneficial mutation from the GAP1 and reporter elements to reflect that they are not linked. We did not identify additional beneficial mutations but plan to pursue this question in a future project.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(c) Panel C: Are the two sets of lines mislabeled? One would expect the &quot;reported&quot; CNV proportions to be lower than the total CNV proportions, not the other way around. Maybe the labels &quot;total CNVs&quot; and &quot;reported CNVs&quot; are unclear to me and I am misunderstanding what &quot;reported&quot; refers to. Please clarify.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for identifying this mistake. The lines were mislabeled and have now been corrected in the revised version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Figure 3:</p>
<p>(a) A fuller discussion of panels A and B is needed. The results of panel A in particular seem like an excellent opportunity for connecting the computation to the biology. Can the authors speculate on why the ALL∆ strain has a higher CNV formation rate (𝛿c) than the ARS∆ strain? I would think that taking away one means of amplification would decrease CNV formation. Likewise, could the authors discuss why the selection coefficient (sc) for the LTR∆ strain would be the same as for the wild type? Overall, I would like to see more discussion about what these differences in formation rates and selection coefficients could mean for the types of amplicons arising in the chemostats. (In panel B I don't see the shaded area referred to in the figure legend.) A side-by-side comparison of the data in Panel A with the data shown in Supplemental Figure S3A would be instructive..</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising these points. We have added substantial text to the manuscript to address these findings. Starting at line 456 we state:</p>
<p>“The lower CNV formation rate in the LTR∆ could be a closer approximation of ODIRA formation rates at this locus as ODIRA CNVs are the predominant CNV mechanism in the LTR∆ strain (Figure 4F). Furthermore, the low formation rates in the LTR∆ relative to WT might suggest that the presence of the flanking long terminal repeats may increase the rate of ODIRA formation through an otherwise unknown combinatorial effect of DNA replication across these flanking LTRs and template switching at the GAP1 locus. ARS∆ has the lowest CNV formation rate and it could be an approximation of the rates of NAHR between flanking LTRs and ODIRA at distal origins. We find that the ALL∆ has a higher CNV formation rate than the ARS∆, even though three elements are deleted instead of one. One explanation for this is that the deletion of the flanking LTRs in ALL∆ gives opportunity for novel transposon insertions and subsequent LTR NAHR. Indeed we find an enrichment of novel transposon-insertions in the ALL∆ (Figure 4F) and subsequent CNV formation through recombination of the Ty1-associated repeats (Figure 4H, ALL∆). Both events, transposon insertion followed by LTR NAHR, would have to occur quickly at a rate that explains our estimated CNV rate in ALL∆. While remarkable, increased transposon activity has been associated with nutrient stress (Curcio &amp; Garfinkel, 1999; Lesage &amp; Todeschini, 2005; Todeschini et al., 2005) and therefore feasible explanation for the CNV rate estimated in the ALL∆. Additionally, ARS∆ clones rely more on LTR NAHR to form CNVs (Figure 4F). The prevalence of ODIRA in ARS∆ and ALL∆ are similar. LTR NAHR usually occurs after double strand breaks at the long terminal repeats to give rise to CNVs (Argueso et al., 2008). Because we use haploid cells, such double strand break and homology-mediated repair would have to occur during S-phase after DNA replication with a sister chromatid repair template to form tandem duplications. Therefore the dependency on LTR NAHR to form CNVs and the spatial (breaks at LTR sequences) and temporal (S-phase) constraints could explain the lower formation rate in ARS∆.”</p>
<p>In addition, we added a discussion of the different selection coefficients estimated and how the simulated competitions help us understand the decreased selection coefficients in the architecture mutants. In newly added text starting at line 479 we state:</p>
<p>“The genomic elements have clear effects on the evolutionary dynamics in simulated competitive fitness experiments. The similar selection coefficients in WT and LTR∆ suggest that CNV clones formed in these background strains are similar. Indeed, the predominant CNV mechanism in both is ODIRA followed by LTR NAHR (Figure 4F). While LTR NAHR is abolished in the LTR∆, it seems that CNVs formed by ODIRA allow adaptation to glutamine-limitation similar to WT. The lower selection coefficients in ARS∆ and ALL∆ suggest that GAP1 CNVs formed in these strains have some cost. In a competition, they would get outcompeted by CNV alleles in the WT and LTR∆ background.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(b) The data shown in panel C seems redundant to what is shown more clearly in Supplemental Figure S3B. It seems to me the more important comparison to make in panel C would be the overlay of the predicted data to the median proportion of cells obtained from the experimental data (Figure 1B). Also, overlays of the cultures from each strain could be added to S3A. It is difficult to see the variation within each strain when the data from all four strains are superimposed as they are in Figure 3C.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree and have edited Figure 3C to incorporate these suggestions and more clearly convey the intra- and interstrain variation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Figure 4:</p>
<p>(a) Panels A, B, and C are nice summaries and certainly helpful for understanding panel E, but it would be instructive to see some actual rearrangements of the ODIRA events, the NAHR, and the transposon-mediated rearrangements. It isn't clear to me what these last events look like. A figure that shows the specific architecture of example clones for each category would be helpful. I am also having a hard time reconciling ODIRA events with a copy number of 2. Are these rearrangements free isochromosomes with amplification to the telomere or are they secondary rearrangements like those described in Brewer et al., 2024? And what about the non-aneuploid rearrangement that includes the centromere? Is it a dicentric?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now added more detailed depictions of CNVs in Figure 4A and provide links to visualize the alignment files. We have added additional discussion starting at line 397 of the non-canonical ODIRA events and putative neochromosome amplicons with reference to Brewer et al 2024. Starting at line 397 we state:</p>
<p>“Surprisingly, we found CNVs with breakpoints consistent with ODIRA that contained only 2 copies of the amplified region, whereas ODIRA typically generates a triplication. In the absence of additional data, we cannot rule out inaccuracy in our read-depth estimates of copy numbers for these clones (ie. they have 3 copies). An alternate explanation is a secondary rearrangement of an original inverted triplication resulting in a duplication (Brewer et al., 2024); however, we did not detect evidence for secondary rearrangements in the sequencing data. A third alternate explanation is that a duplication was formed by hairpin capped double-strand break repair (Narayanan et al., 2006). Notably, we found 3 additional ODIRA clones that end in native telomeres, each of which had amplified 3 copies. In these clones the other breakpoint contains the centromere, indicating the entire right arm of chromosome XI was amplified 3 times via ODIRA, each generating supernumerary chromosomes. Thus,ODIRA can result in amplifications of large genomics regions from segmental amplifications to supernumerary chromosomes.”</p>

<p>(b) In Panel B the violin plots appear to indicate that there are two size categories for amplicons in the ARS∆ strain. Do clones from these different sub-populations share a common CNV architecture?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for making this point. (Please note that the violin plots are now Figure 4E) We added a short discussion and Supplementary Figure 14. In line 432, we state:</p>
<p>“In ARS∆, we find two CNV length groups (Figure 4E) that correspond with two different CNV mechanisms (Supplementary Figure 14). 100% of smaller CNVs (6-8kb) (Supplementary Figure 14) correspond with a mechanism of NAHR between LTRs flanking the GAP1 gene (Figure 4H, ARS∆, bottom left green points). Larger CNVs (8kb-200kb) (Supplementary Figure 14) correspond with other mechanisms that tend to produce larger CNVs, including ODIRA and NAHR between one local and one distal LTR element (Figure 4H).”</p>

<p>(c) Panels D and E: There is great information in these two panels but I find the color keys confusing. There doesn't seem to be any reason for the strain color key in panel E. I am assuming that the key should go with Panel D. Is there some way to indicate in Panel D which events are in which CNV category? It is cumbersome to find that information from Panel E. Perhaps the color-coding from Panel E could be applied to the row labels in Panel D. Being able to link amplicon to the mechanism of CNV formation is especially important for seeing which ODIRA events contain an origin.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this suggestions. We now indicate the mechanism of CNV formation using a consistent color coding in panels G and H (previously panels D and E).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(d) Panel E: I don't understand the two axes in Panel E. If both axes are log scales, why is the origin 0 for the X-axis and 1 for the Y-axis? And why are the focal amplicons (most of which are recombination events between the two LTRs) scattered in both X and Y coordinates? Shouldn't they form a single point? The same for the recombinants with distal LTRs. Also, orange and red (ODIRA and complex CNVs, respectively) are very hard to distinguish. All of these data need to be presented in a spreadsheet identifying each clone's strain ID, chemostat number, GAP1 and GFP copy numbers, sequence across the junction, and their coordinates. The SRA project (PRJNA1016460) for the sequence data was not found in SRA. Will this data be available to easily look at read depth across chromosome XI for all of the sequenced strains - perhaps as .bam files?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for calling these issues with data visualization to our attention. Indeed, the focal amplifications do form around a single point. We originally had jittered the data to show each individual focal amplification but agree that this is confusing. We now overlay the individual points and have altered opacity to enable visualization of individual values. The suggested table of clone data is provided in Supplementary File 2 and the SRA project is now publicly available. Moreover, we are providing all alignment (.bam) files, split, and discordant read depth profiles for each CNV strain and their corresponding ancestor aligned to our custom reference genomes in a public jbrowse server at:</p>

<p>(e) Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Figure S2: Please indicate which rearrangements (of the 8 reported in Figure S2A) were identified in each of the clones described in the table. If each of the 8 amplicons is identified by a letter, then this information could be added as a column in the table. I am assuming that each of the eight rearrangements was found in more than one chemostat. Showing these data is crucial for establishing the possibility that they were preexisting at the time of chemostat inoculation. The other possibility is that the clones with amplified GAP1 but a single copy of GFP could have been created by a secondary rearrangement in the outgrowth of the clones that originally had amplified both genes to the same extent. What is the structure of these amplicons? Is there a common junction between GAP1 and GFP? I couldn't find these data in the paper. A suggestion for Supplemental Figure S2A - include a zoomed-in inset for the GAP1 GFP region for each of the 8 read-depth plots. It is hard to see the exact location of GFP and GAP1 across all 8 tracks without getting out a ruler. Were these sequences aligned to your custom reference genome or the reference genome without GFP? If they were aligned to the custom reference that includes the GFP reporter, the reader could visually confirm the absence of GFP amplification.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for these suggestions. We edited Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 1A as requested. We now provide the precise CNV breakpoints in the GFP-GAP1 region (supplemental figure 1B) displaying both genome read depth and split read depth tracks. These sequences were aligned to the custom reference containing the GFP reporter, which is now clearer in the figure and caption text in line 1226.</p>
<p>The clones in this figure were sampled from the five different chemostats and we have clarified this in the edited table and text at line 210. We did not detect the same CNV allele in different chemostats and therefore we do not have evidence to support <italic>GAP1</italic> amplification without the GFP reporter pre-existing at time of inoculation. We are not able to definitively distinguish whether the amplicons were pre-existing at the time of inoculation or occurred after as we do not have barcoded lineages. We isolated clones carrying this class of amplification from the 1-GFP-copy subfraction late in the experimental evolution (generation 165-182). Given that the alleles appear to differ between populations we think the most parsimonious explanation is that these amplifications occurred after chemostat inoculation but early in the evolution experiment. We explicitly state this in the text starting in line 219.</p>

<p>HDI is a measure of certainty in an estimate, similar to confidence interval. We state this in the text in line 276. With the editing of the text we hope the modeling and its supplementary figures are more clear now.</p>

<p>(10) Page 9 top: Deletion of the ARS appears to lower the fitness of the amplified GAP1 variants. Can the authors speculate on why the ARS deletion would reduce fitness? Did they consult published replication profiles to determine the size of the origin-free gap that could result from the deletion of this mid-S phase origin? Could it explain the delay in the appearance of GAP1 amplicons in the ARS-deletion strains and be responsible for their reduced selection coefficients? Did you examine the growth properties of the starting strain or any of the amplified GAP1 derivatives? Perhaps this consideration could contribute to the discussion. Could there be a bit fuller discussion on the interaction between CNV length differences as shown in Figure 4A and differences in selection coefficient as determined by the nnSBI?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising this point. We have now added text to our discussion of the reduced fitness in ARS∆ in relation to DNA replication starting on line 359:</p>
<p>“ARS1116 is a major origin (McGuffee et al., 2013) and ODIRA CNVs found around this origin corroborate its activity. GAP1 is highly transcribed in glutamine-limited chemostats (Airoldi et al., 2016). Head-on transcription-replication collisions at this locus may be contributing to the higher CNV formation rate in wild type and LTR∆. Elimination of the local ARS could result in less transcription-replication collisions and the slower CNV formation rates estimated. Once formed they get outcompeted by faster-forming CNVs and thus in theory are less fit than CNVs in other strain backgrounds. These simulated competitions further suggest that the ARS is a more important contributor to adaptive evolution mediated by GAP1 CNVs.”</p>
<p>We examined replication profiles in McGuffee et al. Mol Cell. 2013 but could not determine the size of the origin-free gap. ARS1116 and its neighboring ARSs, ARS1118 downstream and ARS1115 upstream are efficient firing origins (Supplement 1 of McGuffee et al. 2013) and therefore the gap is likely to be minimal. The dynamics of the distal firing ARS elements involved in creating ODIRA CNVs might explain the reduced fitness, but further experiments would be required to address this. Regarding growth properties, the growth rate at steady-state in the chemostat is the same as the dilution rate regardless of strain background. Because we had the same dilution rate for each chemostat, the ARS∆ populations would have the same replication rate as the other three strains even if there may be replication rate differences in bulk culture growth. Finally, we found no significant interaction between CNV length and selection coefficients and we state this in line 359.</p>

<p>We rephrased the sentence (lines 519-520) to clarify that in their study Hays et al. 2023 found 898 novel Ty insertions across 345 nitrogen-evolved clones. As a result of this high rate of transposition, some clones are expected to have multiple Ty insertions.</p>

<p>(1) The major advancement of the manuscript is stated in the title &quot;DNA replication errors are a major source of adaptive gene amplification&quot; First, in my humble opinion the term replication errors is not quite right; the term template switching is more accurate. In that regard, recently a paper was published just on this topic (Martin et al Plos Genetics, 2024).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have changed the title to “Template-switching during DNA replication is a prevalent source of adaptive gene amplification”. We cite Martin et al Plos Genetics 2024 throughout the main text in lines 93, 126, 159, 502, 555.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) I find the statement &quot;We find that 49% of all GAP1 CNVs are mediated by the DNA replication-based mechanism Origin Dependent Inverted Repeat Amplification (ODIRA) regardless of background strain.&quot; Somewhat misleading, there were considerable differences between the strains. If I am not mistaken the range was 20-80%.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. Indeed, the range was 26-80% across the four strains. We updated this sentence in the abstract at line 40, and in the main text at line 141 to clearly state the range.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In their attempt to fill the gap of knowledge regarding the fitness effect of the adaptive CNV the authors use a mathematical model. As an experimental biologist, I found the description lacking. It is hard for me to evaluate the contribution of the model to understanding the results and I think the authors could improve this part.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have edited the text regarding the modeling and associated results and hope that it is now more clear. The mathematical model describes the experiment in a simplified manner. We use it to predict the outcomes of additional experiments without additional experimental work. For example, we used it to simulate a competition between two strains, predict the total proportion of GAP1 CNVs, and predict the relative genetic diversity.</p>

<p>b) The finding of de-novo Ty element insertion is interesting. What happens if the overdose strain of Jef Boeke is used (Retrotransposon overdose and genome integrity, PNAS 2009) or in contrast, a reverse transcriptase deficient strain?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree. Our study has revealed a critical role for novel Ty insertion in mediating CNVs. The suggested experiments as well as using strains that lack Ty sequences will be very interesting to explore in followup studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>c) The genomic analyses were based on single colony isolates. To my understanding, the CNV events are identified at least partly by split reads. Therefore, each event may have a &quot;signature&quot; that is unique and can be concluded from single reads and not necessarily from the assembled genome. If true, a distinction between the scenarios could be achieved if bulk cultures are sequenced with enough depth. Thus, a truly dynamic and quantitative determination of the different events, rate of appearance, and disappearance can be made.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion, which is a good idea but not currently feasible for several reasons. First, although split reads are a powerful way to detect CNV breakpoints, we have found that even at high coverage (21-153X, median 78.5X), in clonal samples that are rare with only 3-30 split reads (median 14) detected. These observations are from a total of 23 breakpoints across 16 sequenced clones. Thus, when sequencing heterogeneous cultures, in which different CNVs only comprise a fraction of the population, our ability to detect single CNV alleles by split reads and quantify their frequency is limited. Given our observations, with a median of 14 split reads when sequencing to 78.5X genome-wide read coverage it is possible we may be able to detect an individual CNV allele once it makes up (14/78.5) 17% of the population. However, our previous study has shown that there are tens to hundreds of unique CNV alleles initially and thus this would only be feasible at very late timepoints. Second, recurrent CNVs may occur independently at the same exact location, such as LTR NAHR. Thus, unique signatures may not be obtained even if they are independent events. Third, it would be not appropriate to pursue this analysis with our current dataset, as we lack lineage tracking barcodes to validate the results.</p>
