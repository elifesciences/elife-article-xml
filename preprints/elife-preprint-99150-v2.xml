<title>Abstract</title><p>Proteins occurring in significantly high concentrations in cellular environments (over 100 mg/mL) and functioning in crowded cytoplasm, often face the prodigious challenges of aggregation which are the pathological hallmark of aging and are critically responsible for a wide spectrum of rising human diseases. Here we combine a joint-venture of complementary wet-lab experiment and molecular simulation to discern the potential ability of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as solubilizer of protein aggregates. We show that ATP prevents both condensation of aggregation-prone intrinsically disordered protein Aβ40 and promotes dissolution of pre-formed aggregates. Computer simulation links ATP’s solubilizing role to its ability to modulate protein’s structural plasticity by unwinding protein conformation. We show that ATP is positioned as a superior biological solubilizer of protein aggregates over traditional chemical hydrotropes, potentially holding promises in therapeutic interventions in protein-aggregation related diseases. Going beyond its conventional activity as energy currency, the amphiphilic nature of ATP enables its protein-specific interaction that would enhance ATP’s efficiency in cellular processes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), universally present in all living organisms, is recognized as a fundamental energy currency essential for a myriad of cellular processes. While its traditional role in energy metabolism is well-established, recent investigations have unveiled novel dimensions of ATP’s involvement, specifically in protein stabilization and solubilization. Although the canonical functions of ATP are comprehensively understood, its impact on cellular protein homeostasis, particularly in the prevention of aggregation and the maintenance of membraneless organelles, remains a subject of growing interest <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Beyond its well-known chemical actions originating from high-energy phosphate bond breaking or allosteric effects during enzymatic catalysis, ATP exhibits contrasting physical biological roles, including the stabilization of soluble proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> and the solubilization of insoluble proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Proteome-wide profiling analyses emphasize ATP-mediated protein stabilization as a prevalent trait within the ensemble of proteins featuring an ATP recognition site <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Subsequent independent studies further validate ATP-mediated enhancement of protein stability for specific proteins, such as ubiquitin, malate dehydrogenase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, and the TDP-43 RRM domain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, all possessing an ATP-binding motif. Intriguingly, these proteins, where ATP functions as a substrate or allosteric modulator, typically require a low concentration of ATP (approximately 500 µM) for its effects <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Notably, the cellular cytoplasm maintains a significantly higher concentration of ATP (∼5mM), prompting questions about potential additional purpose for this elevated cytoplasmic ATP concentration beyond its conventional roles as an energy source and in protein stabilization, both typically requiring micromolar concentrations of ATP. As a potential function of the excess ATP concentration within the cell, a substantial influence on cellular protein homeostasis is observed, particularly in preventing protein aggregation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> and maintaining the integrity of membraneless organelles (at a millimolar range of ATP concentration). ATP has demonstrated its capability to prevent the formation of protein aggregates, dissolve liquid-liquid phase-separated (LLPS) droplets, and disrupt pathogenic amyloid fibers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Investigations into ATP’s impact on protein solubility and aggregation encompass a diverse array of proteins, including phase-separating proteins like FUS, TAF15, hnRNPA3, and PGL-3 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, as well as the aggregates of Xenopus oocyte nucleoli <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Elevated ATP concentrations are also observed in metabolically quiescent organs, such as the eye lens, where they prevent the crowding of γS-Crystallin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Proteome-wide profiling analyses underscore ATP’s ability to manage the solubility of numerous proteins, indicating a broad impact on cellular protein solubility and aggregation propensity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Remarkably, a majority of proteins lacking any ATP-binding motif, are reported to undergo solubilization in the presence of ATP. Despite past conformational analyses of water-soluble ATP-binding proteins in the presence of ATP <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, the role of ATP in biomolecular solubilization, specifically how ATP influences the structural plasticity of insoluble, non-ATP binding proteins, has yet to receive mainstream attention. In this investigation, we employ a combination of computer simulations and experimental techniques to explore how ATP influences the conformational behavior of two proteins situated at opposite ends of the structural spectrum of non-ATP binding proteins: the folded globular mini-protein Trp-cage and the amyloidogenic intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) Aβ40, associated with Alzheimer’s disease (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Our study, incorporating ThT assay and Transmission Electron Microscopy, validates hypotheses generated through computer simulations regarding ATP’s impact on the nucleating core of the Aβ40 peptide segment. The results establish a clear correlation between ATP’s effect on the conformational landscape of these proteins and its ability to impede the aggregation process, affirming its role as a solubilizing agent.</p>

<caption><p>A schematic representation shows protein undergoes spontaneous aggregation in aqueous medium through specific conformational transformation prone to aggregation. ATP can prevent protein aggregation and improves its solubility. ATP’s effect in protein conformational plasticity has been tested for two contrasting protein molecules belonging from two extreme spectrums of the protein family. One is the globular, structurally ordered protein Trp-cage and the other one is intrinsically disordered protein (IDP), Aβ40, containing comparatively more charged residues (according to the nature of typical IDPs). The highly aggregation prone Aβ40 protein is popularly well known for causing neurodegenerative disorders (<italic>Alzheimer’s disease, AD</italic>). The structures of both the proteins are shown in the new cartoon representation highlighting the protein region wise coloration scheme. For Trp-cage the three distinct regions, 1. Helix (H1, 1-9), 2. 3-10 Helix (H2, 10-15) and 3. Coil (coil, 16-20) are shown in green, pink and navy blue colors respectively. For Aβ40, the 1. N-terminal region (NTR, 1-16), 2. central hydrophobic core (CHC, 17-21), 3. turn (TR, 24-27), 4. secondary hydrophobic region (SHR, 30-35), and the 5. C-terminal regions (CTR, 36-40) are shown in gold, purple, blue, green and red colors respectively. The hydrophobicity index of each of the proteins is shown in pie chart representation containing acidic (gold), basic (green), hydrophobic (red) and neutral (blue) residue content. Each of the proteins shown in the surface model are colored according to the respective hydrophobicity nature. Protein-ATP (base part: red, sugar moiety: cyan and phosphate group: green) site specific interactions are tested. The current study of ATP’s effect on protein conformational plasticity is performed combining both simulation and experiment based on computational predictions validated by experimental measurement followed by computational reasoning and correlation of ATP driven conformational modification to protein aggregation scenario.</p></caption>

<title>ATP’s impact on a globular mini-protein</title>
<p>We initiated our investigation via computationally simulating ATP’s effect on the archetypal monomeric form of mini-protein Trp-cage which is known to have a well-defined fold under native conditions (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The effects of ATP on the structure of the Trp-cage protein were investigated using classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The protein was modeled with a99SB-<italic>disp</italic> forcefield and solvated with TIP4P-<italic>disp</italic> water molecules. The system was neutralized with chloride ions. The protein was simulated in aqueous solution and also in presence of ATP, at a temperature of 303 K. The precedent studies reporting the effect of ATP on structured proteins, had been performed by maintaining ATP:protein stoichiometric ratio in the range of 0.01*10<sup>3</sup> to 0.03*10<sup>3</sup>. Likewise, in our simulation with Trp-cage, the ATP:protein ratio of 0.02*10<sup>3</sup> was maintained. In this study, we opted to maintain the ATP stoichiometry consistent with biological conditions and previous in vitro experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Instead of keeping the protein concentration within the micromolar range and ATP concentration at the millimolar level, we chose this approach to avoid the need for an extremely large simulation box, which would greatly reduce computational efficiency by more than 150-fold.</p>
<p>Simulations were performed at three different concentrations of ATP.Mg<sup>+<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>: 0 M (aqueous media), 0.1 M, and 0.5 M. For ensuring exhaustive exploration of protein conformational landscape condition, each condition was extensively simulated via replica exchange MD simulation (see method). The results showed that ATP caused the Trp-cage protein to unfold. This was evident from an increase in the protein’s radius of gyration (R<sub>g</sub>) and a decrease in the number of intra-chain contacts (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 A-C</xref>). The R<sub>g</sub> of the protein monotonically increased by the action of ATP compared to that of the neat water system in a concentration dependent manner (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The number of overall intra-chain contacts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) and native sub-set of intra-chain contacts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) monotonically decreased upon increasing the concentration of ATP from 0.1 M to 0.5 M. This is also evident from the inter-residue contact-map (see Figure S1 A-B). The two-dimensional free energy landscape of the Trp-cage protein was also calculated (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 D-F</xref>). Since multiple previous studies has reported benchmarking of several features of proteins as well as IDPs using both linear and artificial neural network based dimension reduction techniques and have demonstrated that Rg, in combination with fraction of native contact serves as optimum features, we have chosen these two metrics for developing the 2D free energy profile.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> The landscape showed that the protein prefers to remain in its folded form (with less R<sub>g</sub> and high native contacts) in the absence of ATP. However, in the presence of ATP, the landscape becomes more populated with conformations that have a higher R<sub>g</sub> and fewer intra-chain contacts. This suggests that ATP drives the unfolding of the Trp-cage protein by stabilizing conformations that are more extended and disordered. The observation remains robust over the choice of force field. Similar to the results obtained with a99SB-<italic>disp</italic> forcefield, when the similar simulations were performed with Charmm36 force parameters of protein (with Charmm TIP3P water model) in 0 M and 0.5 M of ATP (modeled with Charmm36 force field parameters), the extension of the protein chain has been noted, as was characterized by the stabilization of protein conformations with higher R<sub>g</sub> and lower native contacts is attained in presence of ATP (figure S2). The event of unfolding of the protein upon addition of ATP is also evident from the simulation snapshots (see Figure G-H). A comparative molecular analysis of secondary structure of Trp-cage in neat water versus ATP indicates reduction of both alpha-helical and 3-10 helical content (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3 A-B</xref>) along with inter-residue hydrogen bond (figure S3). Interestingly, the protein’s solvent accessible surface area (SASA) increases slightly in presence of ATP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3 C</xref>), implying that ATP can increase the solubility of protein, a point that we would later come back to.</p>

<p>The solvation shell of ATP around Trp-cage suggested its direct interaction with the protein (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 D</xref> for a snapshot). Analysis of the preferential interaction coefficient (Γ) profiles (see method for definition) provided insights into the relative influence of different chemical components of ATP (triphosphate group, sugar moiety, and aromatic base) on the protein (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 E</xref>). Consistently higher preferential interaction coefficient (Γ) profile of the aromatic base indicated that ATP’s interaction with the protein is primarily driven by this moiety. This finding is supported by the hydrophobic nature of a significant fraction of Trp-cage residues (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> for a pie chart of residue) and the predominance of van der Waals interactions in the favorable base part of ATP-protein interaction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3 F</xref>). The preferential interaction analysis also revealed that the base part of ATP interacts more strongly with the helix (H1) region of Trp-cage compared to the 3-10 helix (H2) and coil structures (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 G</xref>). Consequently, the prominent interaction with the helical region results in a greater disruption of the helical structure (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 H</xref>) compared to others (3-10 helical or coil), leading to improved solubilization potential. These results provide valuable insights into the specific interactions between ATP and protein as the key for ATP’s actions and also enhance our understanding of the interplay between ATP and protein structure.</p>

<title>ATP’s impact on an Intrinsically Disordered Protein (IDP)</title>
<p>The observation of ATP’s unfolding effect on a model globular protein across a range of concentrations encouraged us to explore how its impact would vary on an IDP Aβ40, which sits at the other end of the spectrum of protein family. Aβ40 has also remained a regular subject of pathological neurodegeneration due to its self-aggregation propensity. Accordingly, extensively long MD (30 μs) simulation trajectory of monomeric Aβ40 in 50 mM aqueous NaCl media, as obtained from D. E. Shaw research, was analyzed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. To realize the effect of ATP on the conformational ensemble of Aβ40, we simulated the conformational repertoire of the monomeric form of Aβ40 in 0.5 M aqueous ATP solution containing 50 mM NaCl salt. The former experiments investigating protein (unstructured) aggregation in presence of ATP, had been performed by maintaining ATP:protein stoichiometric ratio in the range of 0.1*10<sup>3</sup> to 1.6*10<sup>3</sup>, similarly we have also maintained ATP/protein stoichiometry 0.1*10<sup>3</sup> in our investigation ATP’s effect on disordered protein Aβ40. The protein was modeled with CHARMM36m force field parameters and was solvated with TIP3P water molecules. To facilitate exhaustive sampling of Aβ40 in ATP medium, replica exchange MD (REMD) simulation was performed with a total 64 replicas in a temperature range of 290 to 460 K (see Method). A comparison of 2D free energy map (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 A-B</xref>) along R<sub>g</sub> and the total number of inter-residue contact of Aβ40 in aqueous media (later referred as water) containing no ATP and that in presence of 0.5 M aqueous ATP (later referred as ATP) indicates a clear shift of relative population of Aβ40 conformational sub-ensemble towards a basin with higher R<sub>g</sub> and lower number of contacts in presence of ATP, suggesting unfolding of the protein chain by ATP. To verify that the effect of ATP on conformational landscape is not an artifact of difference in sampling method (long conventional MD in absence of ATP versus REMD in presence of ATP), we repeated the conformational sampling in absence of ATP via employing REMD, augmented by adaptive sampling (figure S4). We find that the free energy map remains qualitatively similar (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4A</xref> and S4) irrespective the sampling technique. Comparison of 2D free energy map obtained from REMD simulation in absence of ATP (figure S4) with the one obtained in presence of ATP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4B</xref>) also indicates ATP driven protein chain elongation. Representative snapshot of the conformation of Aβ40 in aqueous ATP media reveals significantly enhanced disorder in protein (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 C</xref>). Aβ40 is also very prone to form β-sheet in aqueous medium and thus gets associated in extensive protein aggregation. The central hydrophobic core (residue 17-21), (CHC) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> (shown in purple color in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) participates in the β-sheet formation in water and acts as the nucleating core during the pathogenesis relevant to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Interestingly, as evident from the snapshots and from the relative comparison of ensemble-averaged residue-wise β-sheet propensity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 D</xref>), ATP reduces the content of β-sheet in CHC region and its partner β-fragment residue 30-35 (SHR, the secondary hydrophobic region). The decrease in the β-sheet signature in aqueous ATP solution is also apparent in the inter-residue contact map (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 E-F</xref>).</p>

<p>The presence of D23-K28 salt bridge <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> has been previously reported in the Aβ40 monomer present within aqueous medium. This salt bridge interaction subsequently gives rise to a structural motif which is sufficiently potent for nucleation. D23-K28 salt bridge interaction in Aβ40 has remained crucial in the context of fibrillogenic activities conducted by the pathogenic Aβ40. The salt-bridge interaction of D23-K28 stabilizes the β-turn <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> in the region of V24-N27 which consequently favors the hydrophobic contacts between the central hydrophobic core (CHC) and the C-terminal part of Aβ40. The structural bend in the zone of residue 23-28 through salt-bridge interaction helps the CHC (residue 17-21) and SHR fragments (residue 30-35) to adopt β-sheet formation which gets further stabilized with L17-I32 hydrophobic interaction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. All these intramolecular interactions (salt-bridge interaction: D23-K28, β-turn: V24-N27, hydrophobic contact: L17-I32) within Aβ40 protein in water, effectively result in the adoption of the β-structure which might be critically responsible for its higher propensity to form pathological amyloid fibrils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The present simulation trajectory of monomeric Aβ40 in 50 mM aqueous NaCl solution (water) traced all these aforementioned important fibrillogenic interactions. In particular in water the conformational ensemble of Aβ40 adopted D23-K28 salt-bridge, V24-N27 β-turn and L17-I32 hydrophobic interaction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 A-F</xref>), as evident from close pairwise distance of separation (see S5 A-C). These result in a constrained β-hairpin structure of Aβ40 in water which is capable of inducing aggregation. In presence of ATP (0.5 M ATP in 50 mM NaCl solution), contacts present in these motifs get significantly disfavoured (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 A-F</xref> and S4 A-C), thereby substantially reducing the possibility of aggregation.</p>

<p>Interestingly, ATP’s direct interaction (Figure S6) with the protein molecule allows the disruption of all these pathogenic molecular interactions. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 G</xref> represents the ATP’s region specific (PG, sugar and base) interaction with the protein Aβ40. The estimation of Coulombic and van der waal interaction energy indicates that unlike Trp-cage (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 F</xref>), Coulombic interaction of ATP with protein predominates in Aβ40 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 H</xref>), partly due to higher proportion of charge in this IDP (see the pie chart for Aβ40 in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).

<title>Experimental Investigation of ATP’s effect on aggregation of Nucleating core of Aβ40</title>
<p>The aforementioned computer simulation predicts that ATP has the potential to decrease the beta-sheet content within the nucleating core of monomeric Aβ40. This finding prompted us to conduct wet-lab experiments to investigate whether ATP plays a role in solubilizing the aggregation-prone Aβ content.</p>
<p>To explore experimental evidence of this influence on the dissolution of misfolded protein, we opted to focus on a shorter subset of the sequence rather than the entire sequence of the intrinsically disordered Aβ (1-40) amyloid. Consequently, we selected a short peptide stretch containing the important nucleating core of Aβ (1-40) from the 16th to the 22nd residue [Ac-KLVFFAE-NH<sub>2</sub>, Ac-KE] involving the fibrillogenic CHC region (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 A</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, which had been suggested by aforementioned computer simulation to impart crucial contribution in formation of β-sheet conformation.

To initiate the assembly of Ac-KE, the synthesized peptide was dissolved in a solution consisting of 40% acetonitrile-water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, pH 2).

<p>The impact of ATP on amyloid fibrils was investigated using the Thioflavin T (ThT) assay, a well-established method for probing amyloid assembly (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 B</xref>). In presence of Ac-KE assembly, ThT demonstrated an intense emission at 480 nm which suggested the presence of preformed amyloid aggregation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 B</xref>)<sup>2425</sup>. Various AcKE:ATP ratios, ranging from 1:0 to 1:66.7, were tested in HEPES buffer (pH 7.2, 10 mM) at room temperature to assess the influence of ATP on preformed amyloid assemblies (Ac-KE). Interestingly, a progressive reduction in ThT intensity at 480 nm in the presence of ATP (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>) was observed over time, compared to the control system, which contained only the peptide assembly (Ac-KE) in a similar environment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). This decrease of ThT intensity in aqueous ATP solution reported the dissolution of the peptide assembly and disruption of the binding sites. Subsequently, morphological changes were examined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) by casting the incubated samples on the TEM grid (see experimental measurement subsection in Method section). We expected that the investigation from electron microscopy would help in witnessing the visual transformation of fibrillar morphology in the presence of ATP. As a control experiment, the same concentration of Ac-KE assembly was also incubated without ATP in the similar environment for 18 h.

<title>Molecular basis of ATP’s solubilizing Role of Aβ40 aggregates</title>
<p>The experimental findings indicating ATP’s potential role in solubilizing the fibrils of the Aβ40 nucleating core motivated us to explore the molecular basis through the early step of oligomerization. To investigate this, we conducted computational simulations of the dimerization process of Aβ40 in aqueous ATP (0.5 M) media containing 50 mM NaCl and compared it with the same aqueous condition without ATP.

<p>The nucleating core (involving the CHC region) of Aβ40, the same motif used in the previously described wet-lab experiment, played a crucial role as an intermolecular glue. Its active involvement in strong interactions with neighboring Aβ40 protein chains hindered the onset of protein aggregation via the first step of dimerization.</p>
<p>The direct interaction of ATP with Aβ40, playing a pivotal role in attenuating protein-protein interactions, is evident from the preferential interaction coefficient (Γ) of ATP (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref>) with different parts of Aβ40 (NTR, CHC, TR, SHR, and CTR). Notably, ATP exhibits the strongest interactions with CHC and SHR (followed by NTR, TR, and CTR). These regions, as highlighted in the inter-residue contact map in the absence of ATP (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>), predominantly participate in inter-protein interactions during Aβ40 dimerization (refer to <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8F</xref> for a snapshot). A representative snapshot (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8G</xref>) illustrates the effective crowding of ATP molecules around Aβ40, preventing protein copies from engaging in intermolecular interactions.</p>
<p>The preferential interaction of ATP can also help to lower the probability of intermolecular steric zipper type interaction (M35-M35) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> which plays a crucial role in aggregation.

<title>ATP’s solubilizing ability of preformed oligomers</title>
<p>ATP not only prevents protein aggregation but can also dissolve pre-existing protein droplets, effectively maintaining proteostasis within cells. To explore ATP’s action on a preformed dimer, simulations were initiated with the already-formed protein dimer conformation and simulated its fate in a 50 mM NaCl solution, both with and without the presence of 0.5 M ATP in the same saline medium (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8H-J</xref>). Interestingly, ATP was found to disrupt the dimer structure (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8I</xref>), while the structure remained stable in the absence of ATP (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8H</xref>). The probability distribution (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8J</xref>) illustrates that, in the presence of ATP, the two protein chains, initially part of the dimer, become prone to be moved away from each other. This demonstrates that, in addition to inhibiting the formation of new protein aggregates, ATP is potent enough to disassemble existing protein droplets, maintaining proper cellular homeostasis. In summary, ATP has been observed to prevent protein condensation, dissolve previously formed condensates, and thereby enhance the solubility of biomolecules within aqueous cellular environments for proper cellular functions.</p>

<title>Is ATP special in its role as an aggregate solubilizer ?</title>
<p>A crucial question rises: Is ATP special in its role as an aggregate solubilizerTowards this end, to investigate ATP’s relative efficiency in inducing the solubility of hydrophobic entities (biological macromolecules) within cells, we compared it to a conventional chemical hydrotrope sodium xylene sulfonate (NaXS), routinely used in various industrial applications to solubilize sparingly soluble compounds in water. Simulations were conducted with two copies of Aβ40 proteins in a 0.5 M NaXS solution, similar to those performed for 0.5 M ATP and 0 M ATP scenarios (discussed earlier; see methods for details).</p>
<p><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref> illustrates the time profile of the distance between two protein monomers in 0.5 M NaXS solution compared with that in ATP solution (0.5 M) and neat water. Interestingly, ATP prevents the protein chains from coming closer to each other, while in NaXS solution, the proteins exhibit comparatively closer proximity. This trend is further emphasized by the probability distribution of the interprotein distance (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B</xref>), which shows a gradual decrease in the distance between protein chains from neat water to 0.5 M NaXS solution and finally to 0.5 M ATP. This suggests that, compared to NaXS, ATP is more efficient in enhancing solubility in aqueous medium by preventing the formation of aggregates.</p>

</fig>
<p>For a quantitative assessment of ATP’s efficiency over NaXS, we calculated the bound percentage of protein monomers in each of the three cases (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9C</xref>). NaXS in water reduces the percentage of bound slightly, indicating a decrease in protein aggregation. However, ATP outperforms NaXS by significantly reducing the propensity of Aβ40 dimerization.</p>
<p>The potency of ATP in inhibiting protein aggregation and maintaining solubility in an aqueous environment, compared to NaXS, is further evident from the estimation of the total number of interprotein contacts (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9D</xref>). As we move from neat water to 0.5 M NaXS solution and finally to 0.5 M ATP solution, the number of intermolecular contacts between the two protein chains gradually decreases, highlighting ATP’s efficiency over NaXS.</p>
<p>The contact map (residue-wise inter protein contact map) difference (contact map of ATP/NaXS+water from that in neat water only) reveals that in the presence of ATP, there is a significant decrease in the probability of interprotein contacts (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9E</xref>), a crucial factor in protein aggregation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>). In contrast, in the presence of NaXS (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9F</xref>), along with a decrease in some contact probabilities, there is an increase in interprotein contacts, especially involving the CHC and TR region of one chain with the SHR region of the other protein.</p>
<p>In nutshell, ATP acts more efficiently compared to NaXS by effectively inhibiting interprotein interactions, preventing aggregation, and maintaining protein solubility in an aqueous environment (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9G-H</xref>). To elucidate the factors contributing to ATP’s superiority over NaXS, we examined the interaction energy (Coulombic interaction) of both ATP and NaXS with the protein molecules (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9I</xref>). The analysis revealed that, in comparison to NaXS, ATP exhibits a stronger interaction with the proteins, resulting in higher interaction energy. This heightened interaction energy plays a crucial role in preventing protein-protein interactions, ultimately leading to the effective inhibition of aggregation.</p>
<p>Comparing the effects of ATP with other nucleotides such as ADP and GTP, we emphasize that previous studies have demonstrated GTP can dissolve protein droplets (such as FUS) with efficiency comparable to ATP. However, in vivo, the concentration of GTP is significantly lower than that of ATP, resulting in negligible impact on the solubilization of liquid compartments. In contrast, ADP and AMP show much lower efficiency in dissolving protein condensates, indicating the critical role of the triphosphate moiety in protein condensate dissolution. Furthermore, only TP-Mg exhibited a negligible effect on protein droplet dissolution, suggesting that the charge density in the ionic ATP side chain alone is insufficient for this process. These findings underscore ATP’s superior efficacy as a protein aggregate solubilizer, attributed to its specific chemical structure rather than merely its amphiphilicity.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>While previous efforts have explored ATP-driven protein disaggregation, its impact on protein conformational plasticity, crucial for self-assembly, is understudied. Our computational investigation prioritizes the examination of ATP’s influence on protein conformational thermodynamics and correlates it with preventing protein aggregation. Regardless of biomolecular structure (globular or intrinsically disordered), ATP is found to induce protein chain extension, disrupting specific secondary structures and promoting flexibility for solvation in water. We demonstrate ATP’s direct enhancement of protein aqueous solubility through calculations of solvation free energy and solvent-accessible surface area (SASA). The substantial increase in accessible surface area and more negative solvation free energy in aqueous ATP solution compared to ATP-free solution highlights ATP’s pivotal role in preventing protein aggregation by increasing aqueous solubility through protein chain extension.</p>
<p>We followed up the simulation’s prediction on ATP’s role on protein conformation via a set of proof-of-concept experiments, in which we investigated ATP’s impact on the fibrillogenic nucleating core of Aβ40 (residues 16<sup>th</sup> to 22<sup>nd</sup>). ThT assays revealed a monotonically decreasing intensity over time with increasing ATP concentrations (0 mM to 20 mM), indicating the dissolution of Aβ40 peptide assemblies. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed the dissolution of peptide assemblies within 18 hours in ATP-treated samples, contrasting with control systems containing only Ac-KE, which showed no significant alteration in fibrillar morphologies. This experimental evidence, coupled with insights into ATP’s role in enhancing aqueous solubility, necessitates an understanding of its molecular inhibitory mechanisms at the oligomerization level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Computational studies focused on the primitive aggregation stage, specifically Aβ40 dimerization, revealed that ATP disrupts dimer formation compared to the rapid dimerization observed in water. ATP’s ability to guide conformational changes, particularly by disfavoring β-sheet adoption between the CHC and SHR fragments, efficiently inhibits Aβ40 dimerization. Direct interactions between ATP molecules and the protein were identified as crucial, preventing pathological interactions (CHC-CHC, CHC-SHR, SHR-SHR) associated with the β-sheet motif. Additionally, ATP not only inhibits aggregation but also disintegrates previously formed dimers, highlighting its capability to dissolve existing protein aggregates. Overall, ATP’s multifaceted action, from inhibiting dimerization to disrupting existing dimers, underscores its potential in preventing pathological protein aggregation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, beyond its role in various energetic modulations, ATP contributes significantly and independently of energy expenditure to the proper functioning of proteins in crowded cellular environments with high salt concentrations, mitigating biomolecular instabilities linked to diseases involving pathological protein aggregation. Our study demonstrates that ATP’s micromanagement starts at the protein monomeric level, orchestrating conformational modifications to ensure adequate aqueous solubility. By perturbing intramolecular contacts, ATP induces structural flexibility, facilitating effective water solubilization of protein monomers. Simultaneously, ATP discourages the adoption of fibrillogenic protein conformations prone to aggregation. Recently described as hydrotropic activity, our findings provide a detailed understanding of the biological rationale for the exceptionally high concentration of ATP in cells compared to other nucleotides, as reported by Patel et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. While previous studies highlighted ATP’s antiaggregation property, our investigation elucidates its mechanism: ATP’s remarkable influence on protein conformational modification helps hydrophobic protein molecules remain favorably soluble in the cellular aqueous medium, thereby reducing their propensity for self-aggregation. Overall, ATP’s regulatory role in conformational plasticity emerges as a key factor behind its hydrotropic function in biological systems.</p>
<p>The mechanistic details of ATP’s interaction with proteins have been subjected to various interpretations. Few studies proposed a nonspecific ATP-protein interaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, contrasting with the some reports explaining ATP’s preferential binding to conserved residues (Arg and Lys or Tyr and Ser)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Some studies highlighted ATP’s role as a solvation mediator with the capabilities of ATP in hydrophobic, π-π, π-cation, and electrostatic interactions with proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. In our investigation, we found that ATP interacts directly with Trp-cage and Aβ40 proteins in a protein-specific manner, utilizing its chemically distinct parts—negatively charged PG group, hydrophilic sugar moiety, and hydrophobic aromatic base—to engage in electrostatic, H-bond-like, and hydrophobic interactions with protein residues. The nature of ATP’s interactions varies significantly based on the amino-acid composition of the protein. For the hydrophobic Trp-cage, ATP favors van der Waals’ interactions over electrostatic ones, while for the charged Aβ40, Coulombic interactions dominate. This protein-dependent specificity enhances ATP’s efficiency in cellular processes, aligning with recent proteome-wide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> studies showing diverse effects of ATP on protein thermal stability and solubility. Notably, intrinsically disordered proteins experience enhanced solubility with ATP, while some proteins exhibit decreased solubility.</p>
<p>In our literature survey of ATP’s concentration-dependent actions, as detailed in the Introduction section, we observed a dual role where ATP induces protein liquid-liquid phase separation at lower concentrations and promotes protein disaggregation at higher concentrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. These versatile functions emphasize ATP’s pivotal role in maintaining a delicate balance between protein stability (at low ATP concentrations) and solubility (at high ATP concentrations) for effective proteostasis within cells. Notably, ATP-mediated stabilization primarily targets soluble proteins, particularly those with ATP-binding motifs, while ATP-driven biomolecular solubilization is observed for insoluble proteins, typically lacking ATP-binding motifs. The question arises: how does ATP selectively stabilize or destabilize proteins? Recent proteome-based<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> investigations align with previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> indicating that ATP predominantly stabilizes soluble bio-molecules, especially those featuring the P-loop motif (GK[X]nS/T or G[X]nK[X]nK). Our Sequence-based analysis of reported proteins, including ubiquitin, malate dehydrogenase, and TDP-43 RRM domain, reveals conservation of the P-loop motif in their respective ATP-recognition site (see SI). Conversely, proteins like Trp-cage and Aβ40, undergoing ATP-driven solubilization at the expense of conformational stability, lack the P-loop motif (see SI). This suggests that ATP deciphers information from the primary structure (protein sequence) to govern secondary and tertiary structures, selectively stabilizing ATP-binding proteins and inducing solubilization in the absence of ATP-binding motifs during protein unfolding.</p>
<p>In summary, while previous reports emphasize ATP’s role in inhibiting protein aggregation, our work connects these findings by highlighting ATP’s influence starting at the monomeric level, thereby preventing proteins from becoming aggregation-prone. The distinctive protein-dependent and region-specific interactions between ATP and protein molecules play a pivotal role in regulating protein structure. This interaction mechanism leads to an exceptionally efficient inhibition of protein aggregation compared to conventional chemical hydrotropes. ATP orchestrates a two-stage hydrotropic action, from monomer destabilization to early-stage aggregation prevention. The necessity for higher cellular concentrations of ATP underscores its significance, potentially explaining the frequent onset of protein aggregation-related diseases with aging, attributed to ATP deficiency. The collaborative efforts of simulation and experimentation in this study suggest potential implications and therapeutic interventions using ATP for future treatments of various neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

Further equivalent number of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions were incorporated into the simulation box. The system was charge neutralized with an equivalent number of chloride ions. The protein was modeled with a99SB-<italic>disp</italic> forcefield parameters and solvated with TIP4P-<italic>disp</italic> water molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. The ion parameters were taken from a99SB-<italic>disp</italic> forcefield. During simulation with ATP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> (0.1 M and 0.5 M), ATP molecules were modeled with Amber force field parameters. For Trp-cage simulations in neat water and 0.5 M ATP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> aqueous solution the box volume was 4.4*4.4*3.1 nm<sup>3</sup> and for 0.1 M ATP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> simulation with Trp-cage the box dimension was kept fixed as 8.2*8.2*5.7 nm<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>First each system was energy-minimized followed by two consecutive steps of equilibration: 1. NVT equilibration for 1 ns at an equilibrium temperature of 300 K utilizing the Nosé–Hoover thermostat<sup>3536</sup> (1 ps time constant) and then 2. equilibration in NPT ensemble for 2 ns at 300 K temperature and 1 bar pressure maintained using the Nosé–Hoover thermostat (time constant of 1 ps) and Berendsen barostat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> (time constant of 1.0 ps) respectively. Further the system was again equilibrated in the NPT ensemble for 10 ns at an equilibrium temperature of 300 K and an equilibrium pressure of 1 bar, maintained by employing the Nosé–Hoover thermostat (time constant of 1 ps) and the Parrinello–Rahman barostat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> <underline>(</underline>time constant of 1.0 ps) respectively. The particle-mesh Ewald (PME)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> method with a grid spacing of 0.12 nm was applied for managing long-range electrostatics. For constraining the bonds associated with hydrogen atoms and the bonds and angle of water molecules, the LINCS method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> and SETTLE algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> respectively were used. To perform all the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations GROMACS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> software of version 2018.6 software was utilized.</p>
<p>To ensure exhaustive exploration of protein conformational landscape conditions, each condition (Trp-cage in neat water and 0.1 M and 0.5 M ATP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> aqueous solution of Trp-cage) was simulated via Replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. For performing REMD simulation the former equilibrated systems were employed. REMD simulation was done in the temperature range of 280–540 K with a total of 54 replicas (for 0.1 M ATP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> solution the temperature range was 290-460 K with 64 replicas). At first each of the replicas was well equilibrated for 5 ns in the NVT ensemble at the respective replica temperature employing the Nosé–Hoover thermostat (time constant 1 ps). Eventually the production simulations were performed for 400 ns (250 ns for 0.1 M ATP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> solution of Trp-cage) at each replica with a replica exchange interval of 10 ps. Finally the trajectory corresponding to the replica temperature of 303 K was considered for subsequent analysis. Further to test the robustness of our estimation across the choice of force field, the similar set of simulations for the Trp-cage protein in neat water and in 0.5 M ATP are performed with Charmm 36 force field parameters for protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> and ATP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> and using Charmm TIP3P water model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. For these simulations in the Charmm36 force field the similar simulation protocol has been utilized.</p>
<p>Apart from folded globular protein, for studying ATP’s effect on the conformation plasticity of an intrinsically disordered protein we have chosen Aβ40 which is routinely investigated in the context of protein aggregation related pathogenic conditions. Accordingly, the 30 us long MD simulation trajectory of monomeric Aβ40 in 50 mM aqueous NaCl media, from D. E. Shaw research was utilized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. To realize the impact of ATP on the conformational dynamics of Aβ40, we simulated the conformational repotiare of monomeric form of Aβ40 (initial structure same as D. E. Shaw research group) in 0.5 M (ATP/protein stoichiometry 0.1*10<sup>3</sup>) aqueous ATP solution containing 50 mM NaCl salt. At first the protein was incorporated in the simulation box of dimension 8.2*8.2*5.7 nm<sup>3</sup> followed by addition of ATP molecules to maintain ATP concentration of 0.5 M. Equivalent numbers of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions were added. Finally the system was solvated with water molecules sufficient to fill up the box. The protein was modeled with charmm36m force field parameters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> and for water molecules, Charmm TIP3P water model was employed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. The ion parameters are obtained from the Charmm 36m forcefield. ATP molecule is modeled with Charmm36 force field parameters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. For exhaustive sampling of the protein in ATP medium, REMD simulation was performed with a total 64 replicas in a temperature range of 290 to 460 K. Each of the replicas were simulated for 400 ns at the replica exchange interval of 10 ps, leading to a cumulative sampling aggregate equivalent to around 26 microseconds. The REMD conformations corresponding to 303 K were further clustered into 213 clusters via the R<sub>g</sub> and total number of inter-residue contacts of the protein chain based on regular space clustering algorithm. Finally, 213 independent MD simulations were performed for 100 ns (each) with the different initial configurations (Aβ monomer dissolved in 0.5 M ATP in 50 mM aqueous NaCl solution) chosen randomly from individual clusters. The concatenated short trajectories were employed for generating 2D energy profiles and for all other calculation 303 K REMD simulation trajectory was employed. The 213 short MD simulation trajectories are used separately for building a Markov state model (MSM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> in order to statistically map the complete process of protein conformational change using PyEMMA software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. From MSM, the stationary populations of the discrete microstates were calculated and eventually utilized for reweighing the free energy surfaces obtained from these short trajectories. To test the robustness we have also estimated the 2D free energy profile of Aβ40 in absence of ATP by performing similar REMD simulation followed by adaptive sampling simulation following the similar protocol described above.</p>
<p>Further to test the correlation of ATP’s effect on protein monomeric level with its potency to inhibit aggregation, we have carried out equilibrium dimer simulations with the aggregation prone amyloidogenic protein aβ40. We have started our simulation from three different conformations involving the protein chains at three different distances 1 nm, 2 nm and 4 nm. Two replica simulations are performed with each of the configurations for 500 ns following the similar simulation protocol as mentioned above. The similar set of dimer simulations were performed for the two copies of the Aβ40 proteins in the 50 mM aqueous NaCl solution and also 0.5 M aqueous ATP solution containing 50 mM NaCl salt. The same box size was maintained for each of the dimer simulations as 8.2*8.2*5.7 nm<sup>3</sup> (same as the monomeric Aβ40 simulation with ATP-Mg<sup>2+</sup>). Later we have repeated the similar dimer simulations for 0.5 M NaXS in the 50 mM aqueous NaCl solution, following the similar simulation protocol.</p>
<p>To assess the impact of ATP on the pre-existing protein droplets, we have tested ATP’s effect on the preformed dimer. We have started our simulation with preformed Aβ40 dimer (three dimer conformations were obtained from the previously described Aβ40 dimerization simulation in 50 mM NaCl salt solution and simulations were carried out corresponding to each of the dimer conformation) dissolved in 0.5 M ATP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> in 50 mM aqueous NaCl solution. Simulation was performed in the same box size of 8.2*8.2*5.7 nm<sup>3</sup> following the similar simulation protocol. Simulation was continued up to 1 us.</p>
<p>GROMACS software analysis tools were utilized for computing the radius of gyration (<italic>Rg</italic>), number of hydrogen bonds of the proteins. The fraction of native contacts (for Trp-cage) was estimated using PLUMED software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> with a cutoff of 0.7 nm. For calculating the total number of contacts and residue-wise contact map MDAnalysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> tool was employed along with python scripting. The secondary structure content of each of the proteins was estimated using the STRIDE program of VMD. The calculation of the solvent accessible surface area was performed with the help of the GROMACS analysis tool (gmx sasa). The 2D free energy profiles were computed for each of the systems using the PyEMMA tool. The hydrophobicity index of each of the proteins was obtained from the peptide 2.0 web server “<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.peptide2.com/N_peptide_hydrophobicity_hydrophilicity.php">https://www.peptide2.com/N_peptide_hydrophobicity_hydrophilicity.php</ext-link>”.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work combines molecular dynamics (MD) simulations along with experimental elucidation of the efficacy of ATP as biological hydrotrope. While ATP is broadly known as the energy currency, it has also been suggested to modulate the stability of biomolecules and their aggregation propensity. In the computational part of the work, the authors demonstrate that ATP increases the population of the more expanded conformations (higher radius of gyration) in both a soluble folded mini-protein Trp-cage and an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) Aβ40. Furthermore, ATP is shown to destabilise the pre-formed fibrillar structures using both simulation and experimental data (ThT assay and TEM images). They have also suggested that the biological hydrotrope ATP has significantly higher efficacy as compared to the commonly used chemical hydrotrope sodium xylene sulfonate (NaXS).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work presents a comprehensive and compelling investigation of the effect of ATP on the conformational population of two types of proteins: globular/folded and IDP. The role of ATP as an &quot;aggregate solubilizer&quot; of pre-formed fibrils has been demonstrated using both simulation and experiments. They also elucidate the mechanism of action of ATP as a multi-purpose solubilizer in a protein-specific manner. Depending on the protein, it can interact through electrostatic interactions (for predominantly charged IDPs like Aβ40), or primarily van der Waals' interactions through (for Trp-Cage).</p>

<p>Since its first experimental report in 2017 (Patel et al. Science 2017), there have been several studies on the phenomenon in which ATP functions as a biological hydrotrope of protein aggregates. In this manuscript, by conducting molecular dynamics simulations of three different proteins, Trp-cage, Abeta40 monomer, and Abeta40 dimer at concentrations of ATP (0.1, 0.5 M), which are higher than those at cellular condition (a few mM), Sarkar et al. find that the amphiphilic nature of ATP, arising from its molecular structure consisting of phosphate group (PG), sugar ring, and aromatic base, enables it to interact with proteins in a protein-specific manner and prevents their aggregation and solubilize if they aggregate. The authors also point out that in comparison with NaXS, which is the traditional chemical hydrotrope, ATP is more efficient in solubilizing protein aggregates because of its amphiphilic nature.</p>
<p>Trp-cage, featured with hydrophobic core in its native state, is denatured at high ATP concentration. The authors show that the aromatic base group (purine group) of ATP is responsible for inducing the denaturation of helical motif in the native state.</p>
<p>For Abeta40, which can be classified as an IDP with charged residues, it is shown that ATP disrupts the salt bridge (D23-K28) required for the stability of beta-turn formation.</p>
<p>By showing that ATP can disassemble preformed protein oligomers (Abeta40 dimer), the authors suggest that ATP is &quot;potent enough to disassemble existing protein droplets, maintaining proper cellular homeostasis,&quot; and enhancing solubility.</p>
<p>Overall, the message of the paper is clear and straightforward to follow. In addition to the previous studies in the literature on this subject. (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2021, 143, 31, 11982-11993; J. Phys. Chem. B 2022, 126, 42, 8486-8494; J. Phys. Chem. B 2021, 125, 28, 7717-7731; J. Phys. Chem. B 2020, 124, 1, 210-223), the study, which tested using MD simulations whether ATP is a solubilizer of protein aggregates, deserves some attention from the community and is worth publishing.</p>
<p>Weakness</p>
<p>My only major concern is that the simulations were performed at unusually high ATP concentrations (100 and 500 mM of ATP), whereas the real cellular concentration of ATP is 1-5 mM.</p>
<p>I was wondering if there is any report on a titration curve of protein aggregates against ATP, and what is the transition mid-point of ATP-induced solubility of protein aggregates. For instance, urea or GdmCl have long been known as the non-specific denaturants of proteins, and it has been well experimented that their transition mid-points of protein unfolding are in the range of ~(1 - 6) M depending on the proteins.</p>
<p>The authors responded to my comment on ATP concentration that because of the computational issue in all-atom simulations, they had no option but to employ mM-protein concentrations instead of micromolar concentrations, thus requiring 1000-folds higher ATP concentration, which is at least in accordance with the protein/ATP stoichiometry. However, I believe this is an issue common to all the researchers conducting MD simulations. Even if the system is in the same stoichiometric ratio, it is never clear to me (is it still dilute enough?) whether the mechanism of solubilization of aggregate at 1000 fold higher concentration of ATP remains identical to the actual process.</p>

<p>Thank you for your thoughtful feedback and for recognizing the value of our study. We appreciate your detailed review and the constructive comments you have provided.</p>
<p>We appreciate your understanding of the inherent limitations in MD simulations. The use of higher ATP concentrations in our simulations stems from the computational challenges of all-atom MD simulations. Due to the practical constraints of simulating micromolar protein concentrations in atomistic detail, we employed millimolar protein concentrations, which necessitated the use of ATP concentrations that are proportionally higher to maintain appropriate stoichiometry between ATP and proteins.</p>
<p>We fully agree with your point that this is a common issue faced by researchers in the MD simulation community. While it is challenging to directly replicate physiological ATP concentrations in atomistic simulations, we believe that our approach still captures the fundamental interactions between ATP and proteins. In particular, our focus was on the relative behaviors and mechanistic insights, rather than absolute concentration effects. We based our choice of ATP concentration on maintaining stoichiometric ratios with the protein concentration to ensure that the molecular mechanisms observed remain relevant. We hope our clarification addresses your concerns.</p>
<p>We would like to share that in an ongoing study focused on the role of ATP in influencing the liquid-liquid phase separation behavior of several intrinsically disordered proteins, we are employing a coarse-grained model. This approach allows us to maintain ATP concentrations within physiologically relevant ranges, as simulating micromolar protein concentrations becomes computationally feasible with this method. We believe that this complementary work will provide additional insights into the behavior of ATP at concentrations more reflective of cellular conditions and further validate the findings from our current study.</p>
<p>We would also like to emphasize that the complementary experiments presented in this study were conducted at physiologically relevant concentrations for both protein and ATP. The experimental results are in strong agreement with our computational findings, supporting the hypothesis that the mechanisms observed in the simulations closely reflect the actual biological process.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work combines molecular dynamics (MD) simulations along with experimental elucidation of the efficacy of ATP as a biological hydrotrope. While ATP is broadly known as the energy currency, it has also been suggested to modulate the stability of biomolecules and their aggregation propensity. In the computational part of the work, the authors demonstrate that ATP increases the population of the more expanded conformations (higher radius of gyration) in both a soluble folded mini-protein Trp-cage and an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) Aβ40. Furthermore, ATP is shown to destabilise the pre-formed fibrillar structures using both simulation and experimental data (ThT assay and TEM images). They have also suggested that the biological hydrotrope ATP has significantly higher efficacy as compared to the commonly used chemical hydrotrope sodium xylene sulfonate (NaXS).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work presents a comprehensive and compelling investigation of the effect of ATP on the conformational population of two types of proteins: globular/folded and IDP. The role of ATP as an &quot;aggregate solubilizer&quot; of pre-formed fibrils has been demonstrated using both simulation and experiments. They also elucidate the mechanism of action of ATP as a multi-purpose solubilizer in a protein-specific manner. Depending on the protein, it can interact through electrostatic interactions (for predominantly charged IDPs like Aβ40), or primarily van der Waals' interactions through (for Trp-Cage).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The data presented by the authors are sound and adequately support the conclusions drawn by the authors. However, there are a few points that could be discussed or elucidated further to broaden the scope of the conclusions drawn in this work as discussed below:</p>
<p>(i) The concentration of ATP used in the simulations is significantly higher (500 mM) as compared to those used in the experiments (6-20 mM) or cellular cytoplasm (~5 mM as mentioned by the authors). Since the authors mention already known concentration dependence of the effect of ATP, it is worth clarifying the possible limitations and implications of the high ATP concentrations in the simulations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their concern regarding the ATP concentration used in our simulation. The reviewer correctly noted our statement about cellular ATP concentrations being in the range of a few millimolar. We would like to highlight that, in a cellular environment, millimolar ATP concentrations coexist with micromolar protein concentrations in the aqueous phase [1].</p>
<p>In our study, we focused on the impact of ATP on protein conformational dynamics, primarily simulating a protein monomer within the simulation box. If one was required to maintain a micromolar protein concentration (e.g., 20 μM [1]) for a monomeric protein, a MD simulation box of significant dimensions (~44x44x44 nm³) would be required, which is computationally challenging to simulate at an atomistic resolution due to the excessive computational cost and time. We had observed a severe reduction of performance of simulation (with Gromacs software of version 2018.6) of more than 150 times for the 20 μM Aβ40 protein in 20 mM ATP solution containing 50 mM NaCl salt which is comprised in the simulation box of ~ 44x44x44 nm³ in comparison to the current simulation set up we have employed in our study).</p>
<p>To ensure computational efficiency, we employed a simulation protocol that would maintain the cellular protein/ATP stoichiometry. Similar to the stoichiometry in the cellular environment (i.e., micromolar protein : millimolar ATP ~ 103), our simulations maintained a consistent ratio (i.e., millimolar protein : molar ATP ~ 103). This approach allowed us to use a smaller simulation box while preserving the relevant stoichiometry, enabling us to leverage data within a realistic timeframe.</p>
<p>Based on the reviewer comment we have included the explanation in the revised manuscript as “In this study, we opted to maintain the ATP stoichiometry consistent with biological conditions and previous in vitro experiments. Instead of keeping the protein concentration within the micromolar range and ATP concentration at the millimolar level, we chose this approach to avoid the need for an extremely large simulation box, which would greatly reduce computational efficiency by more than 150-fold.” (page 4).</p>
<p>However, during our experimental measurements we have maintained micromolar concentration of protein and ATP concentration in the millimolar range, which lies consistent with the former in vitro experimental studies [1].</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It seems ATP can stabilise the proteins at low concentrations, but the current work does not address this possible effect. It would be interesting to see whether the effect of ATP on globular proteins and IDPs remains similar even at lower ATP concentrations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. We would like to refer you to the Discussion and Conclusion sections of our manuscript (on page 18), where we have noted ATP’s concentration-dependent actions on protein homeostasis, incorporating insights from previous literature as well: “In our literature survey of ATP's concentration-dependent actions, as detailed in the Introduction section, we observed a dual role where ATP induces protein liquid-liquid phase separation at lower concentrations and promotes protein disaggregation at higher concentrations [2–4]. These versatile functions emphasize ATP's pivotal role in maintaining a delicate balance between protein stability (at low ATP concentrations) and solubility (at high ATP concentrations) for effective proteostasis within cells. Notably, ATP-mediated stabilization primarily targets soluble proteins, particularly those with ATP-binding motifs, while ATP-driven biomolecular solubilization is observed for insoluble proteins, typically lacking ATP-binding motifs.”. We explain that ATP stabilizes proteins at lower concentrations, primarily targeting those with ATP-binding motifs, as illustrated by a sequence-dependent analysis. Since the proteins we studied (Trp-cage and Aβ40) do not contain any ATP-binding motifs, ATP-guided protein stabilization is not expected for these proteins. Additionally, we presented a set of simulations for Trp-cage with a comparatively lower concentration of ATP (see Figure 2), which also suggests</p>
<p>ATP-driven protein chain elongation. Thus, we believe that ATP’s effect on globular proteins and intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) lacking ATP-binding motifs would remain similar at lower ATP concentrations.”</p>

<p>(ii) The authors make a somewhat ambitious statement that the role of ATP as a solubilizer of pre-formed fibrils could be used as a therapeutic strategy in protein aggregation-related diseases. However, it is not clear how it would be so since ATP is a promiscuous substrate in several biochemical processes and any additional administration of ATP beyond normal cellular concentration (~5 mM) could be detrimental.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The authors thank the reviewer for this comment. In conjunction with earlier studies on the non-energetic effects of ATP, our study underscores ATP’s anti-aggregation properties and its ability to dissolve preformed aggregates, thereby maintaining regular protein homeostasis within cells and inhibiting protein aggregation-related diseases. Consequently, ATP has been proposed as a probable therapeutic agent in multiple previous reports [5–8]. Patel et al. also noted that as ATP levels decrease with age, this can lead to increased protein aggregation and neurodegenerative decline [1]. Therefore, the problem of excessive protein aggregation in cells may be linked to the reduction of ATP levels with aging [1,8–12]. In such circumstances, authors hypothesize introducing ATP as part of a therapeutic treatment might address the issue of excessive protein aggregation and neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>(iii) A natural question arises about what is so special about ATP as a solubilizer. The authors have also asked this question but in a limited scope of comparing to a commonly used chemical hydrotrope NaXS. However, a bigger question would be what kind of chemical/physical features make ATP special? For example, (i) if the amphiphilic property is important, what about some standard surfactants? (ii) how would ATP compare to other nucleotides like ADP or GTP? It might be useful to explore such questions in the future to further establish the special role of ATP in this regard.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for recognizing the significance and value of our exploration into the unique properties of ATP as a solubilizer. In response to the reviewer’s comment regarding the specific features that make ATP special, we would like to emphasize our analysis of ATP's region-specific interactions with biomolecules. ATP's unique structure, comprising three distinct moieties- a larger hydrophobic aromatic base, a hydrophilic sugar moiety, and a highly negatively charged phosphate group, enables it to perform multiple modes of interactions, including hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic interactions with proteins. This combination of interactions leads to its pronounced effect in a protein-specific manner. We believe that, together with its amphiphilic property, the specific chemical structure of ATP makes it an efficient solubilizer. A previous study by Patel et al. demonstrated the efficiency of ATP as a biological hydrotrope compared to other classical chemical hydrotropes (NaXS and NaTO). Our current study further rationalizes ATP’s efficiency through its effective interactions with biomolecules, driven by the chemically distinct parts of the ATP molecule.</p>
<p>Regarding the reviewer’s point about comparing ATP as a hydrotrope with standard surfactants, we would like to add that typically, hydrotropes are amphiphilic molecules that differ from classical surfactants due to their low cooperativity of aggregation and their effectiveness at molar concentrations. Hydrotropes tend to preferentially accumulate non stoichiometrically around the solute, and their aggregation depends on the presence of solute molecules. Unlike surfactants, hydrotropes do not form any well-defined superstructure on their own.</p>
<p>In response to the reviewer’s comment on comparing ATP’s effect with other nucleotides like ADP and GTP, we would like to highlight that previous studies have shown GTP to dissolve protein droplets (FUS) with similar efficiency to ATP. However, in cells, the concentration of GTP is much lower than that of ATP, resulting in negligible effects on the solubilization of liquid compartments in vivo. Conversely, ADP and AMP exhibited comparatively lower efficiency in dissolving protein condensates, suggesting the triphosphate moiety plays a considerable role in protein condensate dissolution. Additionally, only TP-Mg had a negligible effect on protein drop dissolution, indicating that the charge density in the ionic ATP side chain alone is insufficient for dissolving protein drops. Together, these findings highlight the efficiency of ATP as a protein aggregate solubilizer, which stems from its specific chemical structure and not merely its amphiphilicity.</p>
<p>According to the suggestion of the reviewer we have included the discussion in the revised manuscript as “Comparing the effects of ATP with other nucleotides such as ADP and GTP, we emphasize that previous studies have demonstrated GTP can dissolve protein droplets (such as FUS) with efficiency comparable to ATP. However, in vivo, the concentration of GTP is significantly lower than that of ATP, resulting in negligible impact on the solubilization of liquid compartments. In contrast, ADP and AMP show much lower efficiency in dissolving protein condensates, indicating the critical role of the triphosphate moiety in protein condensate dissolution. Furthermore, only TP-Mg exhibited a negligible effect on protein droplet dissolution, suggesting that the charge density in the ionic ATP side chain alone is insufficient for this process. These findings underscore ATP's superior efficacy as a protein aggregate solubilizer, attributed to its specific chemical structure rather than merely its amphiphilicity.” (page 15).</p>

<p>(iv) In Figure 2F, it seems that in the presence of 0.5 M ATP, the Rg increases (as expected), but the number of native contacts remains almost similar. The reduction in the number of native contacts at higher ATP concentrations is not as dramatic as the increase in Rg. This is somewhat counterintuitive and should be looked into. Normally one would expect a monotonous reduction in the number of native contacts as the protein unfolds (increase in Rg).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comment. As noted, the presence of 0.5 M ATP results in an increase in the protein’s radius of gyration (Rg) and a decrease in native contacts, indicating that ATP promotes protein chain extension. However, the extent of the changes in Rg and native contacts are not identical. It is important to recognize that even the disruption of a few native contacts can significantly impact protein folding, leading to considerable protein chain extension. Therefore, it is not necessary for the extent of variation in Rg and native contacts to be similar. The appropriate measure is whether the alterations in these two variables are consistent with each other, such that an increase in Rg is accompanied by a decrease in native contacts, and vice versa.</p>

<p>In this work, Sarkar et al. investigated the potential ability of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as a solubilizer of protein aggregates by combining MD simulations and ThT/TEM experiments. They explored how ATP influences the conformational behaviors of Trp-cage and β-amyloid Aβ40 proteins. Currently, there are no experiments in the literature supporting their simulation results of ATP on Trp-cage. The simulation protocol employed for the Aβ40 monomer system is conventional MD simulation, while REMD simulation (an enhanced sampling method) is used for the Aβ monomer + ATP system. It is not clear whether the conformational difference is caused by ATP or by the different simulation methods used.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. First we note that for Trp-cage, the simulation methods employed in presence and absence of ATP were identical (REMD simulation) and the difference in the free energy surfaces due to introduction of ATP in the solution were evident.</p>
<p>Nonetheless to address referee’s point if the difference in simulation method employed for generating the 2D free energy landscape in absence and presence of ATP would have introduced the observed difference, we had undertaken the initiative of carrying out a fresh set of REMD simulations with Aβ40 in neat water, followed by adaptive sampling simulation. As shown below in Author response image 1, the free energy profiles obtained from conventional MD simulation (using DESRES trajectory) as well as those obtained via REMD simulations for the same system (in neat water) are qualitatively similar. The free energy profiles obtained in presence of ATP are significantly different from that of neat water, irrespective of the simulation method. This confirms the simulation’s observation of ATP driven alteration of protein conformation.</p>

We find that the free energy map remains qualitatively similar (figure 4A and S4) irrespective the sampling technique. Comparison of 2D free energy map obtained from REMD simulation in absence of ATP (figure S4) with the one obtained in presence of ATP (figure 4B) also indicates ATP driven protein chain elongation.” on page 7 and updated the method section as “To test the robustness we have also estimated the 2D free energy profile of Aβ40 in absence of ATP by performing a similar REMD simulation followed by adaptive sampling simulation following the similar protocol described above.” on page 20.</p>

<p>ThT/TEM experiments should be performed on Aβ40 fibrils rather than on Aβ(16-22) aggregates. Moreover, to elucidate their experimental results that ATP can dissolve preformed Aβ fibrils, the authors need to study the influence of ATP on Aβ fibrils instead of on Aβ dimer in their MD simulations. The novelty of this study is limited. The role of ATP in inhibiting Aβ fibril formation and dissolving preformed Aβ fibrils has been reported in previous experimental and computational studies (Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, 2014, 41: 561; Science 2017, 2017, 356, 753-756 J. Phys. Chem. B 2019, 123, 9922−9933; Scientific Reports, 2024, 14: 8134). However, most of those papers are not discussed in this manuscript. Additionally, some details of MD simulations and data analysis are missing in the manuscript, including the initial structures of all the simulations, the method for free energy calculation, the dielectric constant used, etc.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out additional papers on ATP that were not discussed in the original manuscript. While some of the suggested papers were already cited (Science 2017, 356, 753-756), we had initially excluded the others as we did not find them directly relevant to our focus. However, in this revised version, we have included those references (on page 17 and 18).</p>
<p>Through a thorough literature review, including the papers suggested by the reviewer, we maintain that our article is novel in its investigation of ATP's role in the protein conformational landscape and its correlation with anti-aggregation effects. While previous reports emphasize ATP's role in inhibiting protein aggregation, our work connects these findings by highlighting ATP's influence starting at the monomeric level, thereby preventing proteins from becoming aggregation-prone.</p>

<p>Regarding the reviewer's concern on the details of MD simulations, we would like to mention that method part of the current article provides an elaborate explanation of the simulation set up and characterization (on page 19-21). Regarding the reviewer's comment on dielectric constant, we would like to emphasize that here we have performed simulation considering explicit presence of solvent (water molecules), which by default takes into account dielectric constants (unlike many approximate continuum modelling approaches).</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. We would like to clarify that for unstructured proteins, including Aβ40, the ATP stoichiometry [1] ranged from 0.1 × 10³ to 1.6 × 10³. In our study, we have maintained the ATP stoichiometry at 0.1 × 10³ for the disordered protein Aβ40. For structured globular mini-protein like Trp-cage, a lower concentration of 0.02 × 10³ was used, consistent with other studies investigating the effects of ATP on globular proteins such as ubiquitin, lysozyme, and malate dehydrogenase, where the ATP stoichiometry ranged [13] from 0.01 × 10³ to 0.03 × 10³.</p>
<p>In the revised manuscript we have clearly mentioned the point as “The precedent studies reporting the effect of ATP on structured proteins, had been performed by maintaining ATP:protein stoichiometric ratio in the range of 0.01x103 to 0.03x103.

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The authors claimed that &quot;coulombic interaction of ATP with protein predominates in Aβ40 (Figure 5 H)&quot; (Page 10). However, the preferential interaction coefficient in Figure 5G shows that the curve of the phosphate group lies below the other two curves when distance &lt; 1 nm, indicating the relatively weak interactions between the phosphate group and Aβ40. This seems to be in conflict with the results of energy calculation (Figure 5H).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. The author would like to emphasize that ATP, with its large and highly charged phosphate group, is highly likely to interact with intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) primarily through electrostatic interactions due to their significant charge content. In Figure 5G, it is evident that the preferential binding coefficient reaches a notably high value, indicating strong interaction between the protein and the charged phosphate group of ATP. To address the reviewer's concern regarding the curve showing the highest interaction value only after 1 nm, we would like to highlight the nature of long-range electrostatic potential, which is active in the range of approximately 1-1.2 nm [14–16]. Furthermore, Figure 5H confirms that the electrostatic interaction between the protein and ATP is favorable and predominates over the Lennard-Jones (LJ) interaction.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>The authors thank the reviewer for the concern regarding the ATP-Aβ40 interaction compared to the NaXS-Aβ40 interaction. We would like to highlight our results (Figure 5G and H) which demonstrate the dominance of Coulombic interactions (over LJ interactions) of ATP with the protein. Based on this, we compared the Coulombic interaction energy of ATP and NaXS with the protein Aβ40, as depicted in Figure 9I. We observed that ATP-protein electrostatic interactions occur more favorably than those with NaXS, leading to better action of ATP over NaXS. The favorable electrostatic interaction of ATP with the protein, compared to NaXS, is evident because ATP possesses a large and highly charged triphosphate group that can strongly interact with the protein, whereas NaXS contains a very small sulfonate group with much less charge. Therefore, due to the favorable Coulombic interaction of ATP with the protein over NaXS, ATP acts more efficiently as a hydrotrope. In the revised manuscript we have highlighted the term “Coulombic interaction” in the main text and in the figure caption (Figure 9) as well (in page 15 and 16 of the revised manuscript respectively).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Since its first experimental report in 2017 (Patel et al. Science 2017), there have been several studies on the phenomenon in which ATP functions as a biological hydrotrope of protein aggregates. In this manuscript, by conducting molecular dynamics simulations of three different proteins, Trp-cage, Abeta40 monomer, and Abeta40 dimer at a high concentration of ATP (0.1, 0.5 M), Sarkar et al. find that the amphiphilic nature of ATP, arising from its molecular structure consisting of phosphate group (PG), sugar ring, and aromatic base, enables it to interact with proteins in a protein-specific manner and prevents their aggregation and solubilize if they aggregate. The authors also point out that in comparison with NaXS, which is the traditional chemical hydrotrope, ATP is more efficient in solubilizing protein aggregates because of its amphiphilic nature.</p>
<p>Trp-cage, featured with a hydrophobic core in its native state, is denatured at high ATP concentration. The authors show that the aromatic base group (purine group) of ATP is responsible for inducing the denaturation of helical motifs in the native state.</p>
<p>For Abeta40, which can be classified as an IDP with charged residues, it is shown that ATP disrupts the salt bridge (D23-K28) required for the stability of beta-turn formation.</p>
<p>By showing that ATP can disassemble preformed protein oligomers (Abeta40 dimer), the authors argue that ATP is &quot;potent enough to disassemble existing protein droplets, maintaining proper cellular homeostasis,&quot; and enhancing solubility.</p>
<p>Overall, the message of the paper is clear and straightforward to follow. I did not follow all the literature, but I see in the literature search, that there are several studies on this subject. (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2021, 143, 31, 11982-11993; J. Phys. Chem. B 2022, 126, 42, 8486-8494; J. Phys. Chem. B 2021, 125, 28, 7717-7731; J. Phys. Chem. B 2020, 124, 1, 210-223).</p>
<p>If this study is indeed the first one to test using MD simulations whether ATP is a solubilizer of protein aggregates, it may deserve some attention from the community. But, the authors should definitely discuss the content of existing studies, and make it explicit what is new in this study.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors showed that due to its amphiphilic nature, ATP can interact with different proteins in a protein-specific manner, a. finding more general and specific than merely calling ATP a biological hydrotrope.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) My only major concern is that the simulations were performed at unusually high ATP concentrations (100 and 500 mM of ATP), whereas the real cellular concentration of ATP is 1-5 mM. Even if ATP is a good solubilizer of protein aggregates, the actual concentration should matter. I was wondering if there is a previous report on a titration curve of protein aggregates against ATP, and what is the transition mid-point of ATP-induced solubility of protein aggregates.</p>
<p>For instance, urea or GdmCl have long been known as the non-specific denaturants of proteins, and it has been well experimented that their transition mid-point of protein unfolding is ~(1 - 6) M depending on the proteins.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their concern regarding the ATP concentration used in our simulation. The reviewer correctly noted our statement about cellular ATP concentrations being in the range of a few millimolar. We would like to highlight that, in a cellular environment, millimolar ATP concentrations coexist with micromolar protein concentrations in the aqueous phase.</p>
<p>In our study, we focused on the impact of ATP on protein conformational dynamics, primarily simulating a protein monomer within the simulation box. To maintain a micromolar protein concentration (e.g., 20 μM [1]) for a monomeric protein, a simulation box of significant dimensions (~44x44x44 nm³) would be required. This size would be computationally challenging to simulate at an atomistic resolution due to the excessive computational cost and time.</p>
<p>To ensure computational efficiency, we employed millimolar protein concentrations instead of micromolar, thus requiring a higher ATP concentration to maintain the cellular protein stoichiometry. Similar to the stoichiometry in the cellular environment (i.e., micromolar protein : millimolar ATP ~ 103), our simulations maintained a consistent ratio (i.e., millimolar protein : molar ATP ~ 103). This approach allowed us to use a smaller simulation box while preserving the relevant stoichiometry, enabling us to leverage data within a realistic timeframe.</p>
<p>Based on the reviewer comment we have included the explanation in the revised manuscript as “In this study, we opted to maintain the ATP stoichiometry consistent with biological conditions and previous in vitro experiments. Instead of keeping the protein concentration within the micromolar range and ATP concentration at the millimolar level, we chose this approach to avoid the need for an extremely large simulation box, which would greatly reduce computational efficiency by more than 150-fold.” (page 4).</p>
<p>However, during our experimental measurements we have maintained micromolar concentration of protein and ATP concentration in the millimolar range, which lies consistent with the former in vitro experimental studies [1]</p>

<p>(2) The sentence &quot;... a clear shift of relative population of Abeta40 conformational subensemble towards a basin with higher Rg and lower number of contacts in the presence of ATP&quot; is not a precise description of Figures 4A and 4B.

<p>Although the full atomistic simulations were carried out, the analyses demonstrated in this study are a bit rudimentary and coarse-grained (e.g, Rg is a rather poor order parameter to discuss dynamics involved in proteins). The authors could go beyond and say more about how ATP interacts with proteins and disrupts the stable configurations.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We understand the reviewer's concern regarding the choice of the order parameter (Rg), which has been a topic of long-standing debate. However, we would like to note that in the current study, we employed Rg based on recent investigations by Dr. D. E. Shaw Research group [23] (specifically concerning the protein Aβ40 and the Charmm36m force field), which reported an almost negligible Rg penalty compared to experimental values. The experiments characterizing IDPs utilize Rg as a choice of metric. We also would like to highlight that previous investigations of our group have done careful benchmarking of several features of proteins as well as IDPs using both linear and artificial neural network based dimension reduction techniques and have demonstrated that Rg, in combination with fraction of native contact serves as optimum features [24,25]. Therefore, we believed that Rg would be a suitable order parameter for analyzing the structural behavior of this protein. Additionally, we have also analyzed other relevant characteristics, including the total number of contacts, residue-wise protein contact map, percentage of secondary structure, solvent-accessible surface area, and distances between key interacting residues, to provide a comprehensive understanding.</p>
<p>The justification of our choice of collective variable has been discussed in the revised manuscript as “Since multiple previous studies has reported benchmarking of several features of proteins as well as IDPs using both linear and artificial neural network based dimension reduction techniques and have demonstrated that Rg, in combination with fraction of native contact serves as optimum features, we have chosen these two metrics for developing the 2D free energy profile.” on page 4.</p>

<p>(3) Although the amphiphilic character of ATP is highlighted, a similar comment can be made as to GTP. Is GTP, whose cellular concentration is ~0.5 mM, also a good solubilizer of protein aggregates? If not, why? Please comment.</p>

<p>In response to the reviewer’s comment on comparing ATP’s effect with other nucleotides GTP, we would like to highlight that previous studies have shown GTP’s ability to dissolve protein droplets (FUS) with similar efficiency to ATP [1,26]. However, in cells, the concentration of GTP is much lower than that of ATP, resulting in negligible effects on the solubilization of liquid compartments in vivo [1].</p>
<p>According to the suggestion of the reviewer we have included the discussion in the revised manuscript as “Comparing the effects of ATP with other nucleotides such as ADP and GTP, we emphasize that previous studies have demonstrated GTP can dissolve protein droplets (such as FUS) with efficiency comparable to ATP. However, in vivo, the concentration of GTP is significantly lower than that of ATP, resulting in negligible impact on the solubilization of liquid compartments. In contrast, ADP and AMP show much lower efficiency in dissolving protein condensates, indicating the critical role of the triphosphate moiety in protein condensate dissolution. Furthermore, only TP-Mg exhibited a negligible effect on protein droplet dissolution, suggesting that the charge density in the ionic ATP side chain alone is insufficient for this process. These findings underscore ATP's superior efficacy as a protein aggregate solubilizer, attributed to its specific chemical structure rather than merely its amphiphilicity.” (page 15).</p>
