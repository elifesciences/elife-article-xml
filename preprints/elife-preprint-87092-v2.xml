<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Tendinopathies are debilitating diseases currently increasing in prevalence and associated costs. There is a need to deepen our understanding of the underlying cell signaling pathways to unlock effective treatments. In this work, we screen cell signaling pathways in human tendinopathies and find positively enriched IL-6/JAK/STAT signaling alongside signatures of cell populations typically activated by IL-6 in other tissues. In human tendinopathic tendons, we also confirm the strong presence and co-localization of IL-6, IL6R, and CD90, an established marker of reparative fibroblasts. To dissect the underlying causalities, we combine IL-6 knock-out mice with an explant-based assembloid model of tendon damage to successfully connect IL-6 signaling to reparative fibroblast activation and recruitment. Vice versa, we show that these reparative fibroblasts promote the development of tendinopathy hallmarks in the damaged explant upon IL-6 activation. We conclude that IL-6 activates tendon fibroblast populations which then initiate and deteriorate tendinopathy hallmarks.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tendons are essential to every human movement.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]</sup> Tendinopathies represent the largest group of common tendon diseases and approximately 22% of all sport-related injuries.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]</sup> They can strike tendons at many different anatomical locations, can dramatically diminish quality of life by limiting the associated movements, and often share a history of repetitive overuse-induced damage and repair cycles.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]</sup> Once adult tendon regions fail to keep up with functional demands, they fall into a state of non-resolving, uncontrolled lesion repair.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]</sup></p>
<p>These chronic tendon lesions underlying tendinopathies feature characteristics of normal wound healing including accelerated extracellular matrix turnover and proliferation of reparative fibroblast populations as well as their migration to replace and repopulate damaged tissues.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]</sup> In tendon, reparative (e.g. Scx<sup>+</sup>) fibroblast populations are assumed to reside primarily in the extrinsic compartment comprising epitenon and paratenon from where they are recruited to the damaged intrinsic compartment embodied by the load-bearing tendon core.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]</sup> While the mechanisms governing activation, proliferation, and recruitment of these populations are unclear, some insight can be gleaned from studies on other musculoskeletal tissues.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]</sup></p>
<p>In acute muscle lesions, mechanisms for repair, hypertrophy, and hyperplasia are dominated by the satellite cells residing in the muscle basal lamina.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]</sup> Satellite cells in muscle and dermal fibroblasts in skin are activated and recruited by interleukin-6 (IL-6), a key player in the acute phase response to stress.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]</sup> Stress-related mechanisms activating <italic>IL-6</italic> mRNA transcription in the absence of exogenous pathogens include damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), calcium signaling after membrane-depolarization, but also energetic stressors like glycogen depletion and redox signaling following exercise.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]</sup> In humans, IL-6 transmits its signal via classical or trans-signaling.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]</sup> Classical signaling involves the membrane-bound receptor IL6R, which forms a homodimer with gp130 upon IL-6 binding. Trans-signaling works similarly, except that the IL6R has been solubilized (sIL6R) by metalloproteases (mostly ADAM10 &amp; 17)<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]</sup>, which cleave it from the cell membrane.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]</sup> Since not all cell populations express IL6R, trans-signaling via sIL6R enables IL-6 signaling for a wider range of cell populations. Regardless of classical or trans-signaling initiation, further transduction of the IL-6 signal runs via two major pathways (JAK/STAT/ERK<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]</sup> &amp; SHP2/GAB2/MAPK<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]</sup>) to turn on cellular processes inducing proliferation, migration, metabolic adaptations, and tissue turnover.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]</sup> In chronic muscle lesions like Duchenne muscular dystrophy, IL-6 is persistently upregulated, and anti-IL-6 receptor antibodies have been proposed as treatment options.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]</sup> Anti-IL-6 receptor antibodies (IL-6 inhibitors) like Tocilizumab inhibit both classical and trans-signaling and are routinely used in other chronic inflammatory diseases like systemic sclerosis, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]</sup> In this context, IL-6 inhibitors have been shown to reduce disease-hallmarks including arthritis-concomitant tendon inflammation.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]</sup> Analogous to these chronic inflammatory musculoskeletal diseases, tendinopathies present with localized pain, swelling, and functional decline in the affected organ.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]</sup> Histological and molecular characteristics of tendinopathy include hypercellularity, disorganized collagen fibers including mechanically inferior collagen-3, and dysregulated extracellular matrix homeostasis.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]</sup> Based on this research performed in other tissues, repair-competent fibroblasts appear as prime targets and effectors for IL-6 signaling in a tendon wound healing context.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]</sup></p>
<p>Here, we investigated the hypothesis that IL-6 plays a vital role in activating reparative fibroblasts within the extrinsic tissue compartment (i.e. epitenon or paratenon) and recruitment of these cells to the damaged tendon core tissue in non-sheathed tendons.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]</sup> While this likely represents a critical step in normal tendon healing<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]</sup>, we propose that extended and excessive IL-6 signaling may causally exacerbate tendinopathy in non-sheathed tendons.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]</sup></p>
<p>We experimentally tested and confirmed these hypotheses in four steps:

<title>The IL-6/JAK/STAT signaling signature is positively enriched in human tendinopathic tendons alongside signatures of extrinsic cell population activation and hallmarks of clinical tendinopathy</title>
<p>To better illuminate the ongoing wound healing processes that are a central feature of chronic tendon disease, we first searched for enriched signaling pathways underlying tendinopathic tendons in a publicly available dataset (GEO: GSE26051).<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]</sup> To deduce common disease patterns affecting tendons from diverse anatomical locations, the microarray dataset contained analyzed samples from 23 normal and 23 tendinopathic human tendons of mixed anatomical origin. We excluded 5 normal and 5 tendinopathic samples from sheathed tendons originally included in the dataset, as those tendons are organized into different sub-compartments than the non-sheathed tendons remaining in the dataset (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref> &amp; <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Overall, we found 240 significantly upregulated genes, 474 significantly downregulated genes, and 20,359 not-differentially regulated genes in tendinopathic compared to normal control tendons.</p>
<p>Further analysis revealed significantly upregulated <italic>IL-6</italic> and <italic>IL-6</italic> signaling transducer (<italic>IL6ST,</italic> also known as <italic>GP130</italic>) transcripts in tendinopathic tendon tissue (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">B</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Conversely, <italic>IL-6</italic> receptor (<italic>IL6Rα</italic>) expression trended toward downregulation. Focusing on proteases that generate soluble <italic>IL6Rα</italic>, we found significant upregulation of both <italic>ADAM10</italic> and <italic>ADAM17</italic> in human tendinopathic tendons. Downstream of <italic>IL-6</italic> receptor binding, <italic>JAK1</italic> trended towards upregulation and <italic>STAT3</italic> was upregulated significantly. Other <italic>IL-6</italic> regulated signaling checkpoints such as <italic>MAPK3</italic> and <italic>GAB2</italic> trended towards downregulation. Aside from <italic>IL-6</italic>, another significantly upregulated member of the IL-6 family was interleukin-11 (<italic>IL-11</italic>).</p>

<p>In line with aberrant matrix turnover generally featured in tendinopathy, the transcripts of the following genes were significantly increased in the tendinopathic samples: <italic>COL1A1</italic>, <italic>COL1A2, COL18A1</italic>.</p>
<p>Since changes in single transcripts alone have a limited predictive value for pathway-level changes, we next performed unbiased gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using the human hallmark dataset from MSigDB.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>]</sup> Confirming the trends from the single transcript analysis, GSEA revealed a positive enrichment of the IL-6/JAK/STAT pathway (qvalue: 0.003) alongside gene sets matching well known tendinopathy hallmarks such as neo-vascularization (i.e. angiogenesis, mTORC1 signaling) and hypercellularity (i.e. G2M checkpoint, mitotic spindle, MYC targets v1, epithelial mesenchymal transition, and E2F targets) in the tendinopathic samples compared to the normal controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). We then looked further into aberrant biological processes by mapping the significantly changed single transcripts (p-value &lt; 0.01) to the respective gene ontology (GO) database in an overrepresentation analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> &amp; <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figures 3</xref>-<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The emerging processes pointed towards ongoing morphogenesis and wound healing favoring hypercellularity (i.e. proliferation, migration) and extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover, which are both established hallmarks of tendinopathy. Lastly, we matched the detected transcript changes to the human cell type signature gene sets from MSigDB in a GSEA to estimate the contribution of fibroblasts to the aberrant processes.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>]</sup> While this database does not yet include tendon-specific fibroblast populations, the signature gene sets of several fibroblast populations were significantly enriched by the transcript changes detected in tendinopathic tendons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). To confirm the increase of transcripts related to IL-6 signaling and fibroblast presence on the protein level, we next assessed human patient samples using fluorescence microscopy.</p>

<title>IL-6, IL6R, and CD90 are elevated on the protein level in tendinopathic human tendons compared to normal control tendons</title>
<p>In a second step, we sought to validate the gene array analysis highlighting elevated IL-6-IL6R signaling as well as the elevated presence of fibroblasts in non-sheathed tendinopathic tendons compared to non-sheathed normal control tendons on the protein level. We thus extracted tissue sections from tendinopathic biceps tendons and from normal control tendons leftover after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL) surgery (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>) and stained them with fluorescently labelled IL-6, IL6R, and CD90 antibodies.</p>

<p>In normal control tendons, the fluorescent signal stemming from the IL-6 antibody (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, left side, red) appeared to be confined to the extrinsic compartment, which we identified based on the clustering of cells with a roundish nucleus (blue). In tendinopathic tendons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, right side), it was challenging to identify the extrinsic compartment due to the characteristic change in cell shape from elongated to more roundish in both the extrinsic compartment and the load-bearing core tissue. While the signal of the IL-6 antibody was more evenly distributed over the tendinopathic tissue section and tendon compartments compared to the control, it was still more prominent around roundish than elongated cells. Using the nuclear staining as a mask, we attributed IL-6 secretion to cells based on spatial proximity. The percentage of IL-6 secreting cells was only slightly increased in tendinopathic compared to healthy control tendons (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>We found a high percentage of cells in close spatial proximity to fluorescent signals generated by the IL-6 antibodies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, left side, red) to be CD90<sup>+</sup> (green and blue), identifying them as a likely source of IL-6. Again, IL-6 secreting, CD90<sup>+</sup> cells assumed a more roundish phenotype in contrast to the CD90<sup>+</sup> cells not secreting IL-6. The overlap between signals from CD68<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, right side, green and blue) and the IL-6 antibodies (red) seemed less pronounced. Indeed, quantification of the spatial signal overlay showed a significantly higher percentage of cells in spatial proximity to IL-6 to be CD90<sup>+</sup> rather than CD68<sup>+</sup> cells(<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>The presence of IL6R on different cell populations could provide cues on the targets of IL-6 signaling in tendinopathic tendons. In the tendinopathic sections probed here, almost all cells that stained positively for IL6R (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, left side, magenta) were also CD90<sup>+</sup> (green and blue) but less than half of them were CD68<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, right side, green and blue). Quantifying the difference based on spatial proximity confirmed this impression (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) and the statistical analysis judged it to be statistically significant. The staining antibody and quantification method deployed here likely cannot discriminate between IL6R produced by the cell carrying it and IL6R that was solubilized participates in trans-signaling.</p>
<p>We conclude from the above analysis that IL-6 signaling in non-sheathed tendinopathic tendons plausibly contributes to chronic tendinopathic hallmarks like hypercellularity and aberrant matrix turnover, potentially by activating reparative (CD90<sup>+</sup>) fibroblast populations through IL6R.

<p>Using the assembloid model, we investigated whether IL-6 signaling could play a causative role in the hypercellularity that is a major hallmark of tendinopathy. Closely mimicking human tendinopathic tendons, we indeed found cellularity-increasing biological processes to be positively enriched in cell populations around WT compared to those around IL-6 KO tendon core explants.

<p>Representative fluorescence microscopy images taken after seven days in co-culture confirmed a higher total cell number in WT core // ScxGFP<sup>+</sup> fibroblast assembloids compared to KO core // ScxGFP<sup>+</sup> fibroblast assembloids. These cell number differences were not confined to ScxGFP<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts (green) but extended to other populations (blue). In addition, ScxGFP<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts only accumulated around the WT core in WT core // ScxGFP<sup>+</sup> fibroblast assembloids, presumably either through increased core-directional migration or faster proliferation closer to the core. These observations are consistent with IL-6 being essential to increased cellularity and core (damage)-directed migration in this model.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]</sup></p>

<p>To further confirm the specific impact of IL-6 signaling on overall cell proliferation and core-directed migration of Scx<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts, we desensitized the WT core // fibroblast assembloids to IL-6 by neutralizing IL6R with Tocilizumab and attempted to rescue the KO core // fibroblast assembloids by adding recombinant IL-6 to compensate for their reduced IL-6 levels (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref><bold>, bottom panels</bold>).

The addition of recombinant IL-6 to KO core // fibroblast assembloids significantly increased the total cell number and the number of ScxGFP<sup>+</sup> cells, rescuing the wildtype phenotype of IL-6 enhanced cell proliferation in the extrinsic compartment. However, core-directed migration was not rescued by recombinant IL-6.</p>
<p>Fully in line with transcript signature changes detected in the extrinsic compartment, these data suggest that IL-6 signaling increased local cellularity in at least one of two ways. First, IL-6 stimulated both overall and specific ScxGFP<sup>+</sup> cell proliferation.

Similarly, GSEA on the full MSigDB cell type signature gene sets proposed an amplified contribution of fibroblasts, fibroblast-like, and progenitor cells to the emerging assembloid phenotype (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 8B</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic>, extrinsic (i.e. paratenon-derived) fibroblasts differentially express selected genes compared to tendon core (i.e. tendon proper-derived) fibroblasts.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>]</sup> The GO gene sets annotated with these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) overlap with those enriched by DEGs between WT core // fibroblast and WT core // cell-free assembloids (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 9A-D</xref>). This could mean that the core explants exposed to extrinsic fibroblasts change into more paratenon-like tissue and again highlights the contribution of extrinsic fibroblast migration and accumulation to assembloid behavior.</p>
<p>To compare this phenotype to human tendinopathic tendons, we looked for ECM turnover-related transcripts that were enriched in human tendinopathic tendons compared to normal controls. Indeed, transcripts for <italic>Col3a1</italic>, <italic>Col1a1</italic>, <italic>Mmp13</italic>, <italic>Mmp3</italic>, and <italic>Mmp9</italic> were increased in core explants co-cultured with fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref> &amp; <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). When combined through ORA, many of the top 30 biological processes enriched by significantly changed transcripts (adjusted p-value &lt; 0.01) were also enriched in human tendinopathic tendons (<xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 11</xref>). The curated list presented here (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>) pinpoints significantly enriched processes likely to be involved in tendinopathic hallmarks such as ECM turnover &amp; tissue development, hypoxia &amp; glucose metabolism, and hypercellularity.</p>

<p>Overall, it appears that extrinsic fibroblasts are sufficient to invoke several tendinopathic hallmarks in tendon core explants and accelerated catabolic matrix turnover in particular. We have previously reported an increase of IL-6 in the supernatant of WT core // fibroblast assembloids that correlated with an increased catabolic breakdown of the core.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]</sup> The insights gained here connect this catabolic breakdown to gene sets involved in ECM remodeling.

<title>Disrupting IL-6 signaling in core explants diminishes emergence of tendinopathic hallmarks</title>
<p>So far, our results have shown that IL-6 signaling enhances proliferation and migration of fibroblasts towards the tendon core and that the presence of fibroblasts invokes tendinopathy-like changes in the tendon core <italic>in vitro</italic>. Consequently, the last step was to see whether an IL-6 knock-out not only prevents the fibroblast migration and proliferation, but also reduces fibroblast-invoked tendinopathic hallmarks in the core. To assess this, we again studied assembloids containing an IL-6 KO core, but this time focused on biological processes emerging in the core by leveraging bulk RNA-sequencing (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref>).</p>

<p>On the transcript level, we found 276 upregulated, 192 downregulated, and 20,204 unchanged genes in the core of KO core // fibroblast assembloids compared to that of WT core // fibroblast assembloids (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). To see whether an IL-6 knock-out would partially reverse fibroblast-invoked hallmarks, we matched the list of differentially expressed genes (p-value &lt; 0.01) to the signatures in the GO database and then compared the surfacing enriched biological processes with those enriched by differentially expressed genes between the core of a WT core // fibroblast assembloid and a WT core // cell-free assembloid. The largest overlap lay in the signaling pathways (Wnt, ERK1/2, and IL-6), where 5/5 signatures for biological processes remained similarly enriched (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9E</xref>). We found slightly fewer overlapping signatures connected to ECM turnover (6/14) and cellularity (6 /18) while there seemed to be a disconnect in hypoxia &amp; glucose metabolism (2/8). Overall, about a third of all signatures enriched by the presence of fibroblasts were also enriched by the IL-6 KO (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9E</xref>). In contrast to the signatures emerging from the presence of fibroblasts however, the respective contribution of transcripts increased and decreased by the IL-6 KO to the enriched GO biological processes and molecular functions indicates a decreasing cellularity and ECM turnover in the core (<xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 12</xref>), which could mean that IL-6 signaling contributes to the gene expression behind these tendinopathy hallmarks.</p>
<p>As we have already demonstrated the tissue-level effects of IL-6 signaling on cellularity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>), we next wanted to examine the tissue-level consequences of changed transcript signatures for ECM turnover on core biomechanics. To do so, we measured the assembloid’s linear elastic modulus as an indicator for their ability to resist longitudinal tension, which is one of the main functions of adult tendons (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9F</xref>). In WT core // fibroblast assembloids, the linear elastic modulus decreased the most between the initial clamping of the core explant and 21 days of co-culture (light blue). The linear elastic modulus of assembloids containing a KO core (violet) or a WT core explant devitalized through multiple freeze-thaw cycles (black) decreased as well, but not as fast or as strongly. In connection with the bulk RNA-seq data, the changes in the assembloid’s ability to resist tension suggest that IL-6 signaling accelerates (catabolic) ECM turnover.</p>
<p>Normally, it would be hard to predict the effect of an accelerated catabolic ECM turnover <italic>in vitro</italic> on wound healing <italic>in vivo</italic> since both ECM degradation and synthesis are required to replace damaged tissue structures. However, previous studies have already reported a delayed wound healing response in IL-6 KO mice and our experiments here suggest that the decelerated catabolic ECM turnover could be responsible for this.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]</sup></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is an attractive translational research target. Signaling cascades related to IL-6 are upregulated in tendon tissues after exercise, acute tissue damage, and in chronic tendon disease.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>]</sup> Little is currently understood of the precise role that IL-6 plays in these processes.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>]</sup> The goal of the present work was to clarify the role of IL-6 signaling in the tissues of non-sheathed tendons in the context of chronic damage, with a particular focus on inter-compartmental crosstalk between the damaged tendon core and extrinsic (reparative) fibroblasts populations targeted by it.</p>
<p>We first reanalyzed existing microarray data of (non-sheathed) tendinopathic tendons to verify a hypothesized (dys)functional role of IL-6 that seems to run partially via the JAK/STAT pathway enriched by transcripts increased in the tendinopathic samples. The JAK/STAT pathway interweaves with ERK1/2 downstream, which fits with recent data from our lab showing that ERK inhibition alone can prevent tendon matrix deterioration while reducing the secretion of IL-11, another member of the IL-6 cytokine family that was also upregulated in the tendinopathic tendons analyzed here.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>]</sup> More generally, overactivation of JAK/STAT/ERK has been associated with auto-immune arthritis.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]</sup></p>
<p>While analysis of human samples indicated the expression of <italic>IL-6</italic>, <italic>IL6ST</italic>, and <italic>ADAM10</italic> (known to transform membrane-bound IL6R into soluble IL6R) to be upregulated in tendinopathic tendons, the expression of <italic>IL6R</italic> itself was downregulated. We speculate that this points towards increased trans-signaling aimed at stromal cells unable to express <italic>IL6R</italic>, in this tendinopathic context particularly the stromal fibroblasts and fibroblast-like cell populations indicated to be enriched by the cell type signatures.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>]</sup> This theory is supported by GO terms enriched in tendinopathic samples compared to controls relating to increased morphogenesis and wound healing, both processes supposedly powered by (reparative) fibroblasts.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>]</sup> Most of the remaining top 20 enriched GO terms pointed towards increased cell proliferation, potentially increasing the leverage of the proliferating fibroblasts. Indeed, staining human samples with CD90, an established marker of reparative fibroblasts typically present in healing tissues,<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]</sup> confirmed a higher percentage of CD90<sup>+</sup> cells in (non-sheathed) tendinopathic compared to normal control tendons.</p>
<p>While beneficial in controlled dosages during normal wound healing, both excessive hypercellularity and imbalanced wound healing are hallmarks of tendinopathy.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]</sup> To decipher their connections to IL-6 signaling, we investigated IL-6 / IL6R concentration gradients, sources, and targets in patient-derived tissue sections. In tendinopathic patients, the presence of IL-6 over the whole tissue was smaller than expected. However, while IL-6 seemed to be largely confined to the extrinsic compartment in normal control tendons, it was distributed across compartments in tendinopathic tendons. The resulting gradient differences could play a role in the emergence of disease hallmarks.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>]</sup> In contrast to the relative transcript-level decrease of <italic>IL6R</italic> in tendinopathic tendons indicated by the microarray, its presence was increased on the protein level. Although we can only speculate on the clearance rate of both soluble and membrane bound IL6R as well as of the cells carrying them, the mismatch in its presence on the gene transcription and the protein expression levels could be a legacy from earlier disease stages.</p>
<p>To identify sources and targets of IL-6 and IL6R, we co-stained the tendinopathic tissue sections with established markers for macrophages (CD68) and reparative fibroblasts (CD90). Presuming that IL-6 is more concentrated around its sources than its targets due to diffusion, it seems that although both CD68<sup>+</sup> and CD90<sup>+</sup> cells express IL-6, the contribution of CD90<sup>+</sup> cells is significantly larger. This observation is in line with sources of IL-6 identified in growing mouse tendons.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>]</sup> The number of CD90<sup>+</sup> cells among IL6R<sup>+</sup> cells was also significantly larger than that of CD68<sup>+</sup> cells. Since it has yet to be shown that stromal fibroblasts express and translate IL6R, a better explanation might be that the IL6R on CD90<sup>+</sup> cells were originally produced by i.e. the CD68<sup>+</sup> cells and ended up on CD90<sup>+</sup> cells as part of a trans-signaling process. Why and how CD90<sup>+</sup> cells are targeted by soluble IL6R as part of IL-6 trans-signaling could be an interesting part of future research.</p>
<p>To dissect the specific effect of IL-6 signaling on reparative fibroblasts, we turned to tendon assembloids: hybrid explant // hydrogel models of core tendon damage and repair that were recently developed in our lab and which identified an underloaded core explant as a potentially biologically relevant source of IL-6.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]</sup> The simultaneously increased and imbalanced matrix tissue turnover perpetuated by the crosstalk between the core and an extrinsic fibroblast population seemed to put the system into a prime position to decipher the connections between IL-6, hypercellularity, and (catabolic) matrix turnover. Furthermore, their compartmentalized design adequately mimics the structure of non-sheathed tendons.</p>
<p>Replacing the wildtype core explant with an IL-6 KO core explant in our assembloids was sufficient to reduce the expression of genes in gene sets related to matrix turnover, proteolysis, cell proliferation, and cell migration in the extrinsic fibroblast population. We confirmed the IL-6-induced gene-level differences regarding cell migration by exploiting trackable ScxGFP<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts and demonstrated effective manipulation of both recruitment and proliferation of ScxGFP<sup>+</sup> cells through IL-6. We did so by using the IL-6 inhibitor Tocilizumab to desensitize resident cell populations to IL-6 and recombinant IL-6 to replace the IL-6 not secreted by an IL-6 KO core. Recombinant IL-6 rescuing proliferation but not migration of ScxGFP<sup>+</sup> cells highlights the necessity of an IL-6 gradient and / or the establishment of a secondary cytokine gradient (e.g. TGF-β) by IL-6.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]</sup> Alternatively, IL-6 has also been described as an energy allocator in other musculoskeletal tissues and could in this function be accelerating a diverse range of processes (i.e. migration) by increasing the baseline cell metabolism.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]</sup> Fittingly, the extrinsic cell populations around an IL-6 KO core upregulated biological processes related to oxidative stress and hypoxia, which indicates a disrupted energy allocation. Since we found similar biological processes to be positively enriched in human tendinopathic tendons compared to controls, future studies should more closely examine the role of hypoxic signaling in the pathogenesis of tendinopathy.</p>
<p>To transfer these insights from our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments to an <italic>in vivo</italic> setup, we used an Achilles tenotomy model of the <italic>in vivo</italic> tendon damage response. Although the number of Scx<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts did increase in injured tendons, the <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments did not detect an effect of IL-6 on activating Scx<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>]</sup> and making them migrate into or proliferate faster in the damaged and unloaded Achilles tendon stump. In addition, previous studies with mice subjected to a patellar punch procedure reported only marginally reduced mechanical properties in the healing patellar tendon of IL-6 KO mice compared to the WT after an acute injury.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]</sup> However, we are cautious in interpreting these <italic>in vivo</italic> results, mainly because 14 days after an Achilles tenotomy, the tendon niche condition represents an acute rather than a chronic tendon lesion.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>]</sup> Also, even with breeding a novel IL-6 KO x ScxGFP<sup>+</sup> mouse line to alleviate widely known problems of Scx antibodies, the collagen matrix still caused considerable background noise in our images.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]</sup> Furthermore, the ablation of IL-6 might have led to the elevation of compensatory IL-6 superfamily ligands (or other attractant chemokines or cytokines) and one can currently only speculate on their <italic>in vivo</italic> distribution as well as the resulting patterns of fibroblast migration.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>]</sup> To confirm this hypothesis, future <italic>in vivo</italic> studies could deploy IL-6 inhibitors targeting other members of the IL-6 superfamily as well.</p>
<p>Since the migrating Scx<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts <italic>in vitro</italic> were apparently targeting the damaged core tissue (likely to support the limited intrinsic regenerative potential of the explanted tendon core secreting IL-6 in the first place)<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]</sup>, the next set of experiments we conducted in this work focused on the effects of the activated and recruited fibroblasts on the tendon core.</p>
<p>According to existing literature and results presented here, Scx<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts are increasingly present in <italic>in vivo</italic> murine adult tendon lesions<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]</sup> and depleting them alternately improves or impairs adult tendon healing depending on the timepoint of depletion.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>]</sup> One underlying reason could be that adult, Scx<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts hold a bi-fated potential that enables a cartilage-like differentiation when exposed to mechanical compression or tensile unloading.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>]</sup> Our <italic>in vitro</italic> assembloid model captured these behaviors as well with increased Scx / Sox9 transcripts and enriched gene sets indicating a stronger presence of fibroblasts alongside cartilage development in a core surrounded by (migrating) fibroblasts compared to one embedded in a cell-free hydrogel. Besides, genes differentially expressed in a core explant surrounded by fibroblasts enriched gene sets related to hypercellularity, ERK1/2 signaling, oxygen / glucose metabolism, and ECM turnover. Most of these processes were reduced in an IL-6 KO core, speculatively because of the reduced presence of extrinsic fibroblasts resulting from the reduced migration and proliferation. On the tissue-level, we also found signs for a decreased catabolic matrix turnover in the more stable mechanical properties of IL-6 KO core explants, a process likely linked to ERK1/2 signaling.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>]</sup></p>
<p>In summary, our data consistently point to IL-6 signaling targeting reparative fibroblasts being upregulated in chronic human (non-sheated) tendon lesions in a manner that directly leads to fibroblast recruitment and proliferation as well as aberrant morphogenesis / matrix turnover. This activity contributes to typical hallmarks of tendinopathy including hypercellularity and loss of biomechanical tissue integrity.</p>

<title>Human microarray data analysis</title>
<p>We reanalyzed a microarray dataset (GEO: GSE26051) from 2011 with contemporary methods (principal component analysis, volcano plots, heatmaps, GSEA, and ORA), focusing on the Il-6 signaling cascade. All steps from downloading the dataset to the differential expression computation were conducted in RStudio (“Prairie Trillium”, 9f796939, 2022-02-16) running R version 4.1.2. Overall, we closely followed the steps described here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sbc.shef.ac.uk/geo_tutorial/tutorial.nb.html">https://sbc.shef.ac.uk/geo_tutorial/tutorial.nb.html</ext-link> (last visited: 02.05.22). First, we log<sub>2</sub>-transformed the expression values and checked their distribution with boxplots. Since the original dataset was gathered from a wide variety of anatomical locations and differently aged patients (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), we started with a principal-component analysis to filter-out outliers. Based on the clustering, we identified differences between sheathed and non-sheathed tendons (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). For the following analysis, we there excluded samples gathered from sheathed tendons:</p>
<p>GSM639749 (EDC), GSM639751 (Flexor-Pronator), GSM639756 (Flexor-Pronator), GSM639761 (ECRB), GSM639765 (ECRL), GSM639772 (ECRB), GSM639774 (Flexor-Pronator), GSM639779 (Flexor-Pronator), GSM639784 (ECRB), GSM639788 (ECRB).</p>
<p>To improve the power to detect differentially expressed genes, we filtered-out genes with very low expression. We considered 50% of genes to not be expressed and therefore used the median expression as the cut-off. In addition, we only kept genes expressed in more than 2 samples for further analysis and calculated the average of replicated probes. Afterwards, we applied the empirical Bayes’ step to receive the differential expression values and p-values. We plotted the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) as a volcano plot and annotated IL-6 signaling-related genes, other cytokines of the IL-6 family, their respective receptors, and genes involved in matrix turnover. Here, we considered genes with a p-value &lt; 0.05 to be differentially expressed. In addition, we plotted the row scaled z-scores of a selection of the annotated genes in a heatmap.</p>
<p>To produce the GO annotations, we fed the list of IDs from differentially expressed genes into the enrichGO function from the clusterProfiler package (version 3.0.4, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/clusterProfiler/versions/3.0.4/topics/enrichGO">https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/clusterProfiler/versions/3.0.4/topics/enrichGO</ext-link>, last visited: 31.10.22) using the org.Hs.eg.db as reference and the Benjamini-Hochberg method to calculate the false discovery rate / adjust the p-values. To visualize the data, we used the dotplot function from the enrichPlot package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://rdrr.io/bioc/enrichplot/">https://rdrr.io/bioc/enrichplot/</ext-link>, last visited: 31.10.22). We also looked at the increased (logFC &gt; 0) and decreased (logFC &lt; 0) transcripts in isolation to estimate their contribution to the enrichment and give it directionality.</p>
<p>For the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) performed in RStudio with clusterProfiler, we used the human hallmark and the cell type signature gene set annotations from the molecular signature database (MSigDB, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/">https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/</ext-link>, last visited: 31.10.22) after ranking the genes according to their p-value. We used the following input parameters: pvalueCutoff = 1.00, minGSSize = 15, maxGSSize = 500, and eps=0. Lastly, we used the gseaplot and dotplot functions from the enrichPlot package to plot the data and the sign of the enrichment score / NES to estimate the directionality.

<p>We isolated collagen-1 from rat tail tendon fascicles following an established protocol.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>]</sup> Briefly, tendon explants were extracted from the tail of adult (&gt; 8 weeks) female Sprague Dawley rats with surgical clamps. Then, the collagen was dissolved by sequentially putting the core explants into acetone (5 min), 70% isopropanol (5 min), and finally 0.02 N acetic acid (48 h). The resulting viscous solution was mixed in a house-ware blender and then frozen at −20°C. Lyophilization at - 20°C turned the viscous solution into a dry collagen sponge, which was stored at −80°C and aliquots thawed when needed. Upon thawing, the collagen aliquot was mixed with 0.02 N acetic acid and then centrifuged (15,000 rpm for 45 min) at 4°C. The supernatant was then sterilized with SPECTRAPOR dialysis bags first in non-sterile acetic acid (1 h), then 1% chloroform in ddH<sub>2</sub>O (1 h), and finally sterile acetic acid (three times for 2 d each). The concentration of the resulting solution was determined with a hydroxyproline assay (Sigma-Aldrich, MAK008), the purity was assessed with SDS-page and Western blots, and the solution itself was stored at 4°C until usage in the experiments.</p>

<title>Hydrogel preparation, core explant embedding, and assembloid culture</title>
<p>As described previously,<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>]</sup> core explants were fixated with clamps, placed into molds lining silicone chambers, and tensioned. These molds were then filled with cell-free or extrinsic fibroblast-laden collagen hydrogels. One hydrogel consisted of 10 µL PBS (20x), 1.28 µL of 1M NaOH (125x), 8.72 µL double-distilled water (ddH<sub>2</sub>O, 23x), 80 µL collagen-1 (2.5x or 1.6 mg / ml) and 100 µL culture media or cell suspension (2x). All hydrogel components were kept on ice to prevent pre-mature crosslinking. Co-culture medium (DMEM/F12 high glucose, 10% FBS, 1% non-essential amino acids, 1% Penicillin / Streptomycin, 1% Amphotericin, 200 µM L-Ascorbic Acid, 20 ng/ml macrophage-colony stimulating factor) was added to stable hydrogels after 50 min of polymerization at 37°C and tension was released. The assembloids were then cultured under tendinopathic niche conditions (37°C, 20% O<sub>2</sub>) with two media changes per week until the determined timepoint.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>]</sup> We used a final concentration of 25 ng/ml recombinant IL-6 (PeproTech, 216-16) in those assembloids to be stimulated by it, and a final concentration of 10 µg/ml Tocilizumab (TargetMol, T9911) in those assembloids to be inhibited by it.</p>

<title>RNA isolation for genome-wide RNA sequencing (bulk RNA-seq)</title>
<p>We pooled 20 – 24x 2 cm core explants and 2 extrinsic fibroblast-laden collagen hydrogels separate from each other and snap-froze them in liquid nitrogen. The core explant pools were generated from a single mouse and represent one biological replicate each. The collagen hydrogel pools contained a mixed population comprising migratory cells from the embedded core (same mouse) and the initially seeded mixed fibroblast population (cells pooled from 6 mice). The frozen samples were pulverized by cryogenic grinding (FreezerMill 6870, SPEX<sup>TM</sup>SamplePrep) and further processed with the RNeasy micro kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. We used the Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer 3.7.1 (ThermoFisher) to measure RNA concentration and purity, and the 4200 TapeStation System (Agilent) to measure RNA quality. For each condition (WT core // cell-free, WT core // fibroblasts, KO core // fibroblasts), all 6 of the collagen hydrogels pools but only 4 of the core explant pools passed both integrity control (RIN ≥ 2) and had a sufficiently high RNA concentration (30 – 100 ng / µl) for genome-wide RNA sequencing.</p>
<p>We submitted those pools to the functional genomics center Zurich (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://fgcz.ch/">https://fgcz.ch/</ext-link>, last visited 06.05.22) for the Illumina (Novaseq 6000) TruSeq TotalRNA stranded sequencing protocol including library construction from total RNA using ribo-depletion, library QC, sequencing, and data delivery.</p>

<title>RNA-seq data processing and bioinformatic analysis</title>
<p>We used the R-based SUSHI framework of the Functional Genomics Center Zurich (ETH Zurich and University of Zurich) to perform primary level bioinformatics. Specifically, we used the FastqcApp, the FastqScreenApp, and the RnaBamStatsApp for quality control, the KallistoApp (sleuth) to calculate transcript abundance after pseudoalignment, the CountQCApp to quality control after counting reads, and the DESeq2App for differential expression analysis. We then used the shiny toolset developed by the Functional Genomics Center Zurich (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/fgcz/bfabricShiny">https://github.com/fgcz/bfabricShiny</ext-link>, last visited 06.05.22) based on b-fabric and R to generate the annotated volcano plots, heatmaps, and gene set functional enrichment by applying the hypergeometric overrepresentation analysis (ORA) with the following settings:</p>

<p>We also looked at the increased (logFC &gt; 0) and decreased (logFC &lt; 0) transcripts in isolation to estimate their contribution to the enrichment and give it directionality. The emapplot of enriched biological processes independent of increased and decreased transcripts was generated in RStudio using the enrichPlot package.</p>
<p>We again used RStudio and the clusterProfiler package to perform the GSEA, taking the mouse hallmark and the cell type signature gene set annotations from the molecular signature database (MSigDB, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/">https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/</ext-link>, last visited: 31.10.22) as reference after ranking the genes according to their signed log2 ratio. We used the following input parameters: pvalueCutoff = 1.00, minGSSize = 15, maxGSSize = 500, and eps = 0. Lastly, we used the gseaplot and dotplot functions from the enrichPlot package to plot the data and the sign of the enrichment score / NES to estimate the directionality.</p>

<title>Quantifying total cell proliferation, ScxGFP<sup>+</sup> cell proliferation, and ScxGFP<sup>+</sup> cell recruitment to WT and KO core explants</title>
<p>In the assembloids used here, core explants from wildtype (WT) and homozygous (KO) B6.129S2-Il6tm1Kopf/J Il-6<sup>-/-</sup> mice were embedded with ScxGFP<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts from homo- and heterozygous Tgf(Scx-GFP)1Stzr mice. After seven days, the assembloids were removed from the clamps and washed with PBS before staining them with Ethidium Homodimer (EthD-1, Sigma-Aldrich, 2 mM stock in DMSO) diluted to 4 µM with PBS (20 min, 37°C). They were then again washed with PBS, fixated with 4% formaldehyde (Roti-Histofix, Karlsruhe) for 1 hour at room temperature, washed again with PBS, and stored in PBS at 4°C. Immediately before the imaging, nuclei were stained with NucBlue Live Ready Probes Reagent<sup>TM</sup> (R37605, ThermoFisher) for 1 hour at room temperature. We used the Nikon Eclipse T<italic>i</italic>2 confocal scanning microscope controlled by NIS-Elements to acquire the images (3 per sample), which we then processed with ImageJ 1.53q. Briefly, we first registered all cell locations by creating a mask from the NucBlue channel. Then, we put this mask over the ScxGFP-channel and measured the fluorescence intensity at the identified cell locations. We then transferred the signal intensity per location data to RStudio, where we first calculated the total cell numbers of all the images of one sample combined and normalized them to the wildtype median. Afterwards, we determined the fluorescence threshold for the ScxGFP-signal (using density plots and a negative control image) and applied this threshold to the dataset. We then calculated the total ScxGFP<sup>+</sup> cell numbers for each sample and normalized them to the wildtype median. Finally, we combined the cell location with the fluorescence intensity data to find the distance from the core where most of the ScxGFP<sup>+</sup> cells were located and to calculate the ratio between ScxGFP<sup>+</sup> present at the core and those present in the surrounding extrinsic hydrogel (Code: <bold>Supplementary Material 18</bold> and <bold>Supplementary Material 19</bold>).</p>

<title>Quantifying mechanical properties of assembloids</title>
<p>We mounted the assembloids to a custom-made uniaxial stretching device equipped with a load cell as described previously<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]</sup>. After five cycles of pre-conditioning to 1% L<sub>0</sub>, the assembloids were then stretched up to 2% L<sub>0</sub> to measure the linear elastic modulus (Emod) with a pre-load of 0.03 N. This measurement was repeated after 21 days (d21) of culture. We used Matlab R2017a and RStudio to read-out the linear elastic modulus and normalize it to the measurement immediately after assembloid fabrication (d0). Media was changed every 2-3 days. For the corresponding condition, the core explants were devitalized by snap-freezing them repeatedly in liquid nitrogen.</p>

The contralateral hindlimb was used as the undamaged control. After the surgical intervention, we closed the skin wound with an 8/O prolene suture (Ethicon, W8703) and administered an analgesic (Buprenorphine, 0.1 mg/kg s.c., 26G needle).

Prior to staining, sections were air-dried for 30 min at RT (room temperature) and washed 3x with PBS for 5 min each. Then, sections were permeabilized and blocked with 3% BSA (bovine serum albumin) in PBS-T (PBS + 0.1% TritonX) for 1h at RT. We then washed the sections again and incubated the sections that were previously stained with EdU with a reaction cocktail (Jena Bioscience, CLK-074, CuAAC Cell Reaction Buffer Kit (THPTA based)) prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions (440 µl reaction buffer, 10 µl CuSo<sub>4</sub>, 1 µl (2 µM) Alexa Fluor azide 647, and 50 µl reducing agent) at RT for 45 min. We washed the sections again, added the primary antibody for Scx (abcam, ab58655, diluted 1:200 in PBS-T with 1% BSA), TPPP3 (Invitrogen, PA5-24925, 1:200), or CD146 (BIOSS, bs-1618R, 1:200) to the sections from the one-week timepoint, and a GFP-antibody (Abcam, ab290, 1:500 in PBS-T with 1% BSA) to those from the three-week timepoint. We covered all the sections with parafilm and left them overnight in a humid chamber at 4°C.

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study defines signaling mechanisms in tendinopathy development, which is significant as there is a clear need to identify therapeutic targets to prevent or reverse tendon pathology. The evidence supporting the conclusions are <bold>compelling</bold> combining an existing human tendinopathy transcriptomics dataset with ex-vivo assembloid model, and an in vivo injury model using genetic reporter mice.

<p>This work by Stauber et al., is focused on understanding the signaling mechanisms that are associated with tendinopathy development, and by screening a panel of human tendinopathy samples, identified IL-6/JAK/STAT as a potential mediator of this pathology. Using an innovate explant model they delineated the requirement for IL-6 in the main body of the tendon to alter the dynamics of extrinsic fibroblasts. These studies are complemented by in vivo studies that include a Scx-GFP reporter. This approach facilitates examination of the effects of IL6-/- on Scx+ cells, and the differences observed between ex vivo and in vivo contexts.</p>
<p>The use of a publicly available existing dataset is considered a strength, since this dataset includes expression data from several different human tendons experiencing tendinopathy. The revised analysis that includes only non-sheathed tendons facilitates the identification of potentially conserved regulators of the tendinopathy phenotype, with immunostaining for CD90, IL-6R, and IL-6 expression in human tendinopathy samples providing important validation of the transcriptomic studies.</p>

<p><bold>eLife assessment:</bold></p>
<p>This important study details an enrichment of the IL-6 signaling pathway in human tendinopathy and applies transcriptional profiling to an advanced in vitro model to test IL-6 specific phenotypes in tendinopathy. Overall, the strength of evidence is solid yet incomplete, as transcriptomic measurements provide clarity, though functional studies including analysis of proliferation are needed to confirm these findings. This work will be of interest to stem cell biologists and immunologists.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To functionally assess the effect of IL-6 on Scx+ fibroblast proliferation in an acute injury, we repeated the <italic>in vivo</italic> studies with an EdU staining and a newly established IL-6 KO x ScxGFP+ mouse line. We found no evidence for this effect in acute injuries and acknowledge this in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>We further added data collected by combining fluorescence microscopy with human patient-derived tissue to strengthen the link between IL-6, IL-6R, and proliferation of CD90+ cells in chronic injuries.</p>

<p>(1.1) First, the experimental approach does not directly assess proliferation, as such the conclusions regarding proliferation are not well supported. In the ex-vivo model, the use of cell counting approaches is somewhat acceptable since the system is constrained by the absence of potential influx of new cells. However, given the nearly unlimited supply of extrinsically derived cells in vivo (vs. the explant model), assessment of actual proliferation (e.g. Edu, BrdU, Ki67) is critical to support this conclusion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To assess the effect of IL-6 on Scx+ fibroblast proliferation in an acute injury, we repeated the <italic>in vivo</italic> studies with an EdU staining and a newly established IL-6 KO x ScxGFP+ mouse line to combat the considerable background noise of currently available Scx antibodies.</p>
<p>Under the improved design of these experiments, we could detect no effect of IL-6 on ScxGFP+ cells in an acute injury <italic>in vivo</italic>. We have therefore replaced figure 5 with the new results in figure 7 and moved figure 5F to the supplementary materials (Supplementary figure 9).</p>
<p>We acknowledge and discuss this in the discussion section.</p>

<p>(1.2) Second, the justification for the use of Scx-GFP+ cells as a progenitor population is not well supported. Indeed, in the discussion, Scx+ cells are treated as though they are uniformly a progenitor population, when the diversity of this population has been established by the cited studies, which do not suggest that these are progenitor populations. Additional definition/ delineation of these cells to identify the subset of these cells that may actually display other putative progenitor markers would support the conclusions. As it stands, the study currently provides important information on the impact of IL6 on Scx+ cells, but not tendon progenitors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We further delineated the extrinsic cell populations isolated from mouse Achilles tendons of ScxGFP+ mice using flow cytometric analysis and RT-qPCR. We used tendon population markers suggested by sc-RNA-seq of mouse Achilles tendons.</p>
<p>(De Micheli et al., Am. J. Physiol. - Cell Physiol., 2020, 319(5), DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpcell.00372.2020">10.1152/ajpcell.00372.2020</ext-link>)</p>
<p>While a small subpopulation of these cells expressed typical progenitor markers (i.e. CD45 and CD146), we could detect no overlap with Scx+ cells. As suggested by the reviewer, we therefore replaced occurrences of “progenitor” in the manuscript with “fibroblast” and performed additional experiments with human patient-derived tissue sections and the fibroblast marker CD90.</p>

<p>(1.3) Clarity regarding the relevance of the 'sheath-like' component of the assembloid would provide helpful context regarding which types of tendons are likely to have this type of communication vs. those that do not, and if there are differences in tendinopathy prevalence. Understanding why/how this communication between structures is relevant is important.</p>
<p>Our assembloid concept is inspired by the structure of unsheathed tendons (i.e. biceps, semitendinosus, gracilis) and not sheathed tendons like the flexor tendons.</p>
<p>We agree that clarity regarding the tendon type having this type of communication is important, so we sharpened previously blurry text passages in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer 2</bold></p>
<p>(2.1) One question that comes to mind is whether the fibroblast progenitors in the extrinsic sheath of Achilles tendon is similar to those surrounding the tail tendon. The similarity of progenitors between different tendons is assumed with this model. I would consider this to be a minor issue.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Tail tendon fascicles are thought to have a low number of reparative fibroblasts / progenitor cells because they lack a developed extrinsic compartment. Achilles tendons are supposed to have a higher number of reparative fibroblasts / progenitor cells, as their fascicles are surrounded by an extrinsic compartment.</p>
<p>To verify this here, we added a better characterization and comparison of the cell populations isolated from the tail tendon fascicles and the Achilles tendons.</p>
<p>First, we added representative light microscopy images of these cells at different timepoints after being cultured on tissue-culture plastic.</p>
<p>Second, we performed flow cytometric analysis not only on the freshly digested tail tendon fascicles and Achilles tendons, but also on the cultured cells at the timepoint when they would have been embedded into the assembloids.</p>
<p>Third, we compared the expression of population-specific markers in cells derived from tail tendon fascicle and Achilles tendons.</p>
<p>As expected, tail tendon fascicle-derived cell populations appeared to be more elongated than Achilles tendon-derived populations shortly after isolation. Similarly, the “maintenance” fibroblasts in healthy tendons are more elongated than the reparative fibroblasts in diseased ones. After culture and priming in tendinopathic niche conditions, both populations assumed a more roundish, reparative phenotype.</p>
<p>This was consistent with the flow cytometric analysis, which revealed a large difference between freshly isolated populations, that disappeared after extended culture and priming in tendinopathic niche conditions. Gene expression in tail tendon fascicle-derived and Achilles tendon-derived cells was similar after extended culture and priming in tendinopathic niche conditions.</p>

<p>(2.2) The authors use core tendons from IL-6 knockout mice and progenitors from wild-type mice. The reasoning behind this approach was a little confusing... is IL-6 expressed solely in the tendon core compared to the extrinsic sheath?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Insights gained from human patient-derived tissues (Figure 2) suggest that in a healthy tendon, most of the IL-6 is located in the extrinsic compartment but distributed over compartments in the tendinopathic ones.</p>
<p>Our assembloid design mimicks this by embedding wildtype fibroblasts into the extrinsic compartment. Our hypothesis was that a wildtype core in tendinopathic niche conditions attracts reparative fibroblasts through IL-6, while an IL-6 knock-out core does not. Therefore, it was important to establish IL-6 gradients close to what they seem to be <italic>in vivo.</italic></p>
<p>Nevertheless, we have to acknowledge that the amount of IL-6 secreted by extrinsic fibroblasts in isolation is quite small compared to what is secreted by a wildtype core (Supplementary Figure 7). Attributing IL-6 in the supernatant of a WT core // WT fibroblast assembloid to the correct cell population is challenging but could be part of future research.</p>

<p>(2.3) Is a co-culture system for 7 days appropriate to model tendinopathy without the supplementation of exogenous inflammatory compounds? The transcriptomic differences in Figure 3 seem to be subtle, and may perhaps suggest that it could be a model that more closely resembles steady state compared to tendinopathy. If so, is IL-6 still relevant during steady state?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The collective experience in our lab is that core explants exposed to tendinopathic niche conditions (i.e. serum, 37°C, high oxygen, and high glucose levels) assume a disease-like phenotype. (i.e. Wunderli et al., Matrix Biology, 2020, Volume 89 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matbio.2019.12.003">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matbio.2019.12.003</ext-link> and Blache et al., Sci.

<p>Specifically for our core // fibroblast co-culture system, we have reported the emergence of exaggerated tendinopathic hallmarks in a previous publication (Stauber et al., Adv. Healthc. Mater., 2021, 10(20), <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adhm.202100741">https://doi.org/10.1002/adhm.202100741</ext-link>).</p>

<p>(2.4) The results presented in Figures 4 and 5 are impressive, demonstrating a link between IL-6 and fibroblast progenitor numbers and migration. Their experimental design in these figures show strong evidence, using Tocilizumab and recombinant IL-6 to rescue shown phenotypes. I would reduce the claims on proliferation, however, unless a proliferation-specific marker (e.g., Ki67, BrdU, EdU) is included in confocal analyses of Scx+ progenitors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As reviewer 1 pointed out as well, it is important to use a proliferation-specific marker “given the nearly unlimited supply of extrinsically derived cells <italic>in vivo</italic> (vs. the explant model)”.</p>
<p>To assess the effect of IL-6 on Scx+ fibroblast proliferation <italic>in vivo</italic>, we repeated those experiments with a proliferation-specific EdU staining and a newly established IL-6 KO x ScxGFP+ mouse line.</p>
<p>Under this improved design, we could not detect an effect of IL-6 on proliferation in an acute injury <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>We have therefore replaced figure 5 with the new results in figure 7 and moved figure 5F to the supplementary materials (Supplementary figure 9).</p>

<p>(2.5) I think it would significantly strengthen the study if they could measure tendon healing in IL-6 knockouts or in wild-type mice treated with IL-6 inhibitors, since conventional ablation of IL-6 may lead to the elevation of compensatory IL-6 superfamily ligands that could activate STAT signaling. The authors claim that reducing IL-6 signaling decreases transcriptomic signatures of tendinopathy, but IL-6 may be necessary to promote normal healing of the tendon following injury. It is supposed that a lack of Scx+ progenitor migration would delay tendon healing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, another study using the same IL-6 knock-out strain showed that a lack of IL-6 signaling resulted in slightly inferior mechanical properties in healing patellar tendons (Lin et al., J. Biomech., 39(1), 2006 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiomech.2004.11.009">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiomech.2004.11.009</ext-link>)</p>
<p>Also, it might be due to the elevation of compensatory IL-6 superfamily ligands that we found no effect of IL-6 on the proliferation of Scx+ cells in an acute injury <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Therefore, assessing the effects of IL-6 inhibitors on tendon healing following an acute injury would have been of great interest to us. Unfortunately, getting the necessary permission from the animal experimentation office for a new invasive treatment protocol was outside of our scope due to the severity degree and time limitations.</p>
<p>We incorporated and acknowledged these important points in the discussion.</p>

<p>(2.12) Please provide additional discussion points on cis- versus trans-IL6 signaling in your results found in mouse. Do you think researchers/clinicians would want to target trans-IL6 signaling based on your results? Please support these statements with the expression of IL6R on cells found in the tendon core and external sheath progenitors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To address this comment, we performed flow cytometric analysis on Achilles tendon-derived fibroblasts expanded in 2D and digested sub-compartments of the assembloids (Supplementary Figure 7).</p>
<p>These data suggest that IL6R is neither expressed by core nor extrinsic fibroblasts, but mainly comes from core-resident CD45+ tenophages.</p>
<p>Human samples co-stained for IL6R and CD68 (an established human macrophage marker) confirmed macrophages as a source of IL-6R <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, human samples co-stained for IL6R and CD90 (an established marker of reparative fibroblasts in humans) also detected IL6R on CD90+ cells, which have not yet been reported to express IL6R themselves.</p>
<p>Overall, it is likely that trans-IL-6 signaling is more important for the activation of reparative fibroblasts than cis-IL-6 signaling. We added these statements to the manuscript.</p>

<p>Detailed feedback:</p>

<p>This work by Stauber et al. is focused on understanding the signaling mechanisms that are associated with tendinopathy development, and by screening a panel of human tendinopathy samples, identified IL-6/JAK/STAT as a potential mediator of this pathology. Using an innovative explant model they delineated the requirement for IL-6 in the main body of the tendon to alter the dynamics of cells in the peritendinous synovial sheath space.</p>
<p>The use of a publicly available existing dataset is considered a strength since this dataset includes expression data from several different human tendons experiencing tendinopathy. This facilitates the identification of potentially conserved regulators of the tendinopathy phenotype.</p>
<p>The clear transcriptional shifts between WT and IL6-/- cores demonstrates the utility of the assembloid model, and supports the importance of IL6 in potentiating the cell response to this stimuli.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer 2:</bold></p>
<p>The authors of this study describe a goal of elucidating the signaling pathways that are upregulated in tendinopathy in order to target these pathways for effective treatments. Their goal is honorable, as tendinopathy is a common debilitating condition with limited treatments. The authors find that IL-6 signaling is upregulated in human tendinopathy samples with transcriptomic and GSEA analyses. The evidence of their initial findings are strong, providing a clinically-relevant phenotype that can be further studied using animal models.</p>
<p>Along these lines, the authors continue with an advanced in vitro system using the mouse tail tendon as the core with progenitors isolated from the Achilles tendon as the external sheath embedded in a hydrogel matrix. One question that comes to mind is whether the fibroblast progenitors in the extrinsic sheath of Achilles tendon is similar to those surrounding the tail tendon. The similarity of progenitors between different tendons is assumed with this model. I would consider this to be a minor issue, and would consider the in vitro system to be an additional strength of this study.</p>
<p>In order to address the IL-6 signaling pathway, the authors use core tendons from IL-6 knockout mice and progenitors from wild-type mice. The reasoning behind this approach was a little confusing... is IL-6 expressed solely in the tendon core compared to the extrinsic sheath? Furthermore, is a co-culture system for 7 days appropriate to model tendinopathy without the supplementation of exogenous inflammatory compounds? The transcriptomic differences in Figure 3 seem to be subtle, and may perhaps suggest that it could be a model that more closely resembles steady state compared to tendinopathy. If so, is IL-6 still relevant during steady state?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the results presented in Figures 4 and 5 are impressive, demonstrating a link between IL-6 and fibroblast progenitor numbers and migration. Their experimental design in these figures show strong evidence, using Tocilizumab and recombinant IL-6 to rescue shown phenotypes. I would reduce the claims on proliferation, however, unless a proliferation-specific marker (e.g., Ki67, BrdU, EdU) is included in confocal analyses of Scx+ progenitors. The Achilles tendon injury model provides a nice in vivo confirmation of Scx-progenitor migration to the neotendon.</p>
<p>Given their goal to elucidate signaling pathways that could be targeted in the clinic, I think it would significantly strengthen the study if they could measure tendon healing in IL-6 knockouts or in wild-type mice treated with IL-6 inhibitors, since conventional ablation of IL-6 may lead to the elevation of compensatory IL-6 superfamily ligands that could activate STAT signaling. The authors claim that reducing IL-6 signaling decreases transcriptomic signatures of tendinopathy, but IL-6 may be necessary to promote normal healing of the tendon following injury. It is supposed that a lack of Scx+ progenitor migration would delay tendon healing.</p>
<p>Overall, the authors of this study elucidated IL-6 signaling in tendinopathy and provided a strong level of evidence to support their conclusions at the transcriptomic level. However, functional studies are needed to confirm these phenotypes and fully support their aims and conclusions. With these additional studies, this work has the potential to significantly influence treatments for those suffering from tendinopathy.</p>
