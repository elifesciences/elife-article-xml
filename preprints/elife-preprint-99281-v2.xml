<title>Abstract</title><p>Gonorrhea, which is caused by <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic>, is the second most reported sexually transmitted infection worldwide. The increasing appearance of isolates that are resistant to approved therapeutics raises the concern that gonorrhea may become untreatable. Here, we serendipitously identified oxydifficidin as a potent <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> antibiotic through the observation of a <italic>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</italic> contaminant in a lawn of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic>. Oxydifficidin is active against both wild- type and multidrug-resistant <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic>. It’s potent activity results from a combination of DedA- assisted uptake into the cytoplasm and the presence of an oxydifficidin-sensitive ribosomal protein L7/L12 (RplL). Our data indicates that oxydifficidin binds to the ribosome at a site that is distinct from other antibiotics and that L7/L12 is uniquely associated with its mode of action. This study opens a potential new avenue for addressing antibiotic resistant gonorrhea and underscores the possibility of identifying overlooked natural products from cultured bacteria, particularly those with activity against previously understudied pathogens.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Gonorrhea is the second most reported sexually transmitted infection worldwide, its causative agent is the bacterium <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic>. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) approximately 82.4 million new adult gonorrhea infections occurred globally in 2020.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) The high dose (500 mg) of the cephalosporin ceftriaxone is currently the only recommended therapy for treating gonorrhea infections in the USA.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) The growing instances of drug resistant “superbugs”, together with the limited clinical treatment options, underscore the urgent need for additional antibiotics that target <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic>.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>) The characterization of antibacterial active natural products inspired the development of both ceftriaxone and azithromycin.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>) Bacterial natural products have been a key source of antibiotics with diverse modes of action and the most fruitful source of therapeutically useful antibiotics.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>) Here we describe the serendipitous identification of the natural product oxydifficidin(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) as a potent <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> active antibiotic and show that this activity arises from a combination of DedA flippase assisted uptake and ribosomal protein L7/L12 (RplL) sensitivity. Oxydifficidin provides a new therapeutic lead structure for addressing the growing problem of antibiotic resistant gonorrhea. Over the last century, bacteria were extensively examined for antibiotic production in screens that often focused on a small number of pathogens. This study suggests that reexamining cultured bacteria for antibiotics active against today’s emerging pathogens may be fruitful as metabolites with specific potent activity against historically less problematic pathogens may have been overlooked.</p>

<title>Oxydifficidin isomers selectively and potently inhibit <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic></title>
<p>In our day to day experiments we regularly use agar plates containing lawns of pathogenic bacteria. During these experiments we often find random environmental bacteria growing on these plates. On one lawn of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> we observed an environmental contaminant that was surrounded by a zone of growth inhibition suggesting that it produced an anti-<italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> metabolite (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). When we screened this contaminant for antibacterial activity against lawns of other Gram-negative bacteria it did not produce a zone of growth of inhibition against any of the bacteria we tested (<italic>e.g., Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>, <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>). Since antibiotics that preferentially inhibit the growth <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> are rare, we looked at this contaminant in more detail. Sequencing of the contaminant’s genome and genome clustering analysis (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1a</xref>) revealed that it was most closely related to <italic>Bacillus amyloliquefacien</italic>s, which is a root-colonizing bacterium that is used as a biocontrol agent.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) We named the anti-<italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> contaminant <italic>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</italic> BK.</p>

<p>To identify the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) responsible for the observed antibiosis we screened <italic>B. amyloliquefaciens</italic> BK transposon mutants for strains that no longer produced anti<italic>-N. gonorrhoeae</italic> activity. The sequencing of the non-producer strain revealed that it surprisingly contained four transposon insertions and one frame shift mutation (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1b</xref>). The frame shift mutation and one transposon insertion were predicted to each disrupt unique BGCs. The transposon inserted into the bacillomycin (mycosubtilin) BGC, while the frame shift mutation was predicted to disrupt the (oxy)difficidin BGC. To determine which of these two BGCs was responsible for the <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> activity we tested <italic>B. amyloliquefaciens</italic> strains with targeted disruptions of each BGC for activity against <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic>.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>) Only disruption of the (oxy)difficidin BGC eliminated the anti-<italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> activity (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1c</xref>). To confirm the identity of the <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> active antibiotic we carried out a bioassay guided fractionation of <italic>B. amyloliquefaciens</italic> BK culture broth.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) HRMS and NMR data from the major active peak we isolated were consistent with its being an oxydifficidin isomer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref> - <xref rid="s11a" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref>, and <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>). Oxydifficidin contains a 27-carbon polyketide backbone that is cyclized through a terminal carboxylic acid and an oxidation at position 21. This hydrophobic core is phosphorylated at C16. Oxydifficidin occurs naturally as a collection of interconverting thermal isomers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). As reported previously, we observed an interconversion of isomers with the compound we purified from <italic>B. amyloliquefaciens</italic> BK cultures.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) All assays were performed using the mixture of interconverting oxydifficidin isomers we obtained from <italic>B. amyloliquefaciens</italic> BK cultures.</p>
<p>We tested oxydifficidin for activity against diverse bacterial pathogens. Oxydifficidin showed only weak activity against most pathogens, however we observed potent activity against <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). When we examined other <italic>Neisseria</italic> species, we found that oxydifficidin was consistently more active against <italic>Neisseria</italic> than any of the other bacteria we tested. Among <italic>Neisseria</italic> spp., oxydifficidin was most active against <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> underscoring a unique narrow spectrum of potent activity. A key issue with the current treatment of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> infections is the development of resistance to existing therapeutics. Resistance to the standard of care cephalosporins is particularly problematic. Oxydifficidin was more potent against <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> MS11 than most other antibiotics we tested. Notably, unlike clinically used antibiotics such as ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and ciprofloxacin, oxydifficidin retained activity against all multidrug-resistant clinical isolates we examined (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Oxydifficidin’s structure is interesting as phosphorylated antibiotics, and moreover natural products in general, remain rare.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>) Its structure together with its specific and potent activity against drug resist <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> suggested it might have a unique mode of action (MOA). This is appealing from the perspective of developing therapeutics that are capable of circumventing clinically problematic resistance mechanisms and therefore we focused on characterizing the mechanism of oxydifficidin’s potent anti-<italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> activity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b">
<title>DedA assists the uptake of oxydifficidin into <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic></title>
<p>As a first step to understanding the MOA of oxydifficidin, we raised resistant mutants by directly plating <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> cultures on antibiotic containing plates (1 μg/ml, 4x MIC) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). Out of the &gt;1.5X10<sup>10</sup> cells we screened, only one resistant mutant appeared. Oxydifficidin’s MIC against this mutant increased by 8-fold (2 μg/ml). No increase in MIC was observed for any other antibiotic we tested (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). Sequencing and comparison of this mutant’s genome to the sensitive parent genome revealed a single mutation that introduced a frame shift in one of the three predicted <italic>dedA</italic> genes found in the <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> MS11 (NCBI:txid528354 <italic>dedA</italic> NGFG_RS04905(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>)). To confirm that DedA was necessary for oxydifficidin’s potent activity, we created a <italic>dedA</italic> deletion mutant in a clean <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> background. This mutant showed the same 8-fold increase in oxydifficidin’s MIC, confirming that the deletion of <italic>dedA</italic> is sufficient to reduce oxydifficidin’s potent activity. We also generated deletion mutants for two other predicted <italic>dedA</italic>-like genes, and the MIC of oxydifficidin for these mutants remained the same as for the <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> MS11 wild type strain. Interestingly, not only was <italic>dedA</italic> deficient <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> less susceptible to oxydifficidin, oxydifficidin also kills this mutant more slowly (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>) than WT <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> MS11. The <italic>dedA</italic> deletion mutant also showed an altered cell morphology with reduced membrane integrity and lower formation of micro- colonies (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4</xref>). A survey of 220 <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> strains with high-quality assemblies in NCBI found no mutations in the DedA protein.</p>

<p>The DedA protein superfamily is highly conserved, with examples in almost every sequenced genome across all domains of life.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) DedA family members are predicted to be transmembrane proteins with still largely, poorly defined, functions. However, a few recent studies indicate that DedA homologs are flippases. They have been reported to flip phospholipids (phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine) or phospholipid like structures (C55-isoprenyl pyrophosphate) across prokaryotic and eukaryotic lipid bilayers.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>) Although oxydifficidin is not a phospholipid, its overall structure resembles that of reported DedA protein substrates, especially C55-isoprenyl pyrophosphate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). Interestingly, among the two characterized bacterial family members, the DedA protein associated with oxydifficidin potency is most closely related to the C55-isoprenyl pyrophosphate flippase YghB from <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>).(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>) As oxydifficidin’s activity was not completely abrogated in the <italic>dedA</italic> knockout we postulated that DedA was not the direct target of oxydifficidin, but it instead acted to increase oxydifficidin’s potency in <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic>. The structural similarity between oxydifficidin and the known substrates of DedA homologs led us to explore the possibility that DedA was responsible for assisting with oxydifficidin uptake into <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic>.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="596031v2_fig3.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>We examined the effect of DedA on antibiotic accumulation by comparing the amount of compound found in the cell pellet collected from antibiotic treated cultures of wild type and <italic>dedA</italic> knockout <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> strains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>). In the case of oxydifficidin we saw 6 times more antibiotic in cells from wild type cultures than from <italic>dedA</italic> deletion strain cultures. For the other antibiotics we tested (tetracycline and chloramphenicol) this ratio was less than two. Based on DedA homologs flipping phospholipid-like structures across a lipid bilayer our data is consistent with DedA flipping oxydifficidin across the inner membrane to increase its cytoplasmic concentration and in turn increase its potency against <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic>. A DedA assisted uptake mechanism could also explain the slower rate of killing we observed for oxydifficidin against <italic>dedA</italic> deficient <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> compared to wild type <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic>. While we cannot definitely rule out the possibility that DedA accumulation of oxydifficidin in the membrane could also have a direct toxicity effect, we did not detect any cell lysis or membrane depolarization at even 100 times oxydifficidin’s MIC (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref>).</p>

<title>Oxydifficidin inhibits protein synthesis by interacting with RplL</title>
<p>To look for an intracellular target of oxydifficidin we carried out a second round of resistant mutant screening. In this case, we used the <italic>N. gonorrhoeae dedA</italic> deletion strain and searched for colonies with an even higher tolerance to oxydifficidin. From ∼1x10<sup>10</sup> cells plated on 8 μg/ml oxydifficidin (4x MIC for <italic>N. gonorrhoeae dedA</italic> deletion strain<italic>)</italic> we identified 12 resistant mutants. In each case the oxydifficidin MIC increased to 16 μg/ml. Sequencing of these strains revealed that each contained a point mutation in the gene encoding for the large ribosomal protein(s) L7/L12 (<italic>rpl</italic>L). Eleven strains contained the same R76C mutation and one contained a K84E mutation (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>). These two mutations were not found in the survey of the same collection of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> strains used to look for DedA mutations.</p>
<p>To determine if mutations in the <italic>rplL</italic> gene alone were sufficient to confer oxydifficidin resistance, we created an RplL R76C mutant in a wild type <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> background (<italic>i.e.,</italic> non <italic>dedA</italic> deletion). This mutant exhibited an 8-fold increase in oxydifficidin’s MIC (2 μg/ml) compared to the parent strain, confirming that the R76C mutation in L7/L12 alone was sufficient to increase the MIC of oxydifficidin. Ribosomal proteins L7 and L12 have the same sequence, however L12 has an N-terminal acetylation.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) L7/L12 is part of the L10/L7 stalk of the large (50S) subunit of the bacterial ribosome and is critical to a number of processes including GTP hydrolysis.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>)</p>
<p>The appearance of resistance mutations in <italic>rplL</italic> suggested that oxydifficidin inhibited protein synthesis, which would be consistent with isotope feeding studies performed with difficidin and <italic>E. coli</italic>.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>) We initially tested this hypothesis <italic>in vitro</italic> using a coupled transcription/translation system. While this reaction mixture contained all the components necessary to produce a protein from DNA, no protein was produced in the presence of oxydifficidin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>). Using a coupled system, it was not possible to distinguish between inhibition of RNA or protein synthesis, and therefore, to rule out inhibition of transcription, we next looked directly at RNA synthesis <italic>in vitro</italic>. In this case we saw no inhibition of RNA synthesis, even at the highest oxydifficidin concentration we tested (13.4 μg/ml) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>). Taken together these two experiments indicate that oxydifficidin inhibits translation but not transcription and are consistent with <italic>rplL</italic> mutations providing resistance to oxydifficidin.</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge <italic>rplL</italic> mutations have not been previously associated with antibiotic resistance and no characterized antibiotics have been found to bind L7/L12. When we screened for cross resistance, the L7/L12 R76C mutation did not confer resistance to any other antibiotics we tested (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These included ribosome targeting antibiotics with diverse binding sites. Antibiotics that bind different regions of the 30S decoding center, including tetracycline, gentamicin and spectinomycin showed no increase in MIC with the L7/L12 R76C mutation.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>) Similarly, the L7/L12 R76C mutation did not confer resistance to chloramphenicol or erythromycin, which interact with distinct regions of the 50S peptidyl transferase center.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>) Antibiotics that bind away from these two hot spots also showed no cross resistance.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>) The activity of avilamycin, which binds in a unique site in the 50S subunit at the entrance to the A-site tRNA accommodating corridor was also not affected by the L7/L12 R76C mutation.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>) In the case of thiostrepton A(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>), which targets the L11 protein GTPase- associated center and is part of the only class of antibiotics known to bind the ribosome in the vicinity of L10/L7 stalk, we also observed no change in MIC for <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> with the L7/L12 R76C mutation. The inability of the L7/L12 R76C mutation to confer cross resistance to known antibiotics suggests that oxydifficidin binds to a different site on the ribosome and that L7/L12 is uniquely associated with oxydifficidin’s mode of action.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>To determine whether the DedA and RplL mutations we observed were specific to oxydifficidin resistance in <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic>, we selected for resistant mutants using two other <italic>Neisseria</italic> species: <italic>Neisseria subflava</italic> and <italic>Neisseria cinerea</italic>. Both strains were natively less susceptible to oxydifficidin than <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic>. In the case of <italic>N. cinerea</italic> all resistance mutants contained the RplL K84E mutation that we first observed in <italic>N. gonorrhoeae,</italic> and in the case of <italic>N. subflava</italic> all resistance mutants contained mutations in <italic>dedA</italic> (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>). Other <italic>Neisseria</italic> species likely show higher MICs than <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> because of either the absence of DedA assisted uptake or reduced RplL protein oxydifficidin sensitivity. The model that arises from our studies is that high oxydifficidin sensitivity results from a combination of DedA assisted oxydifficidin uptake into the cytoplasm and the presence of an oxydifficidin sensitive RplL protein (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref>). <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> is uniquely sensitive to oxydifficidin because it contains both. DedA is critical to oxydifficidin’s potent activity as it not only sensitizes <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> to oxydifficidin but also decreases its kill time, both of which are appealing from a clinical development perspective.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Almost 60% of clinically approved antibiotics target the ribosome.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>) Although it is the most common target for natural product antibiotics, most of these molecules inhibit the ribosome by binding to only a small number of sites.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>) Clinically approved antibiotics generally inhibit protein synthesis by binding in either the ribosomal decoding center, peptidyl transfer center or the peptide exit tunnel. Targeting unexploited sites of the ribosome is considered a key step to developing next generation antibiotics that can circumvent the existing antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Our data suggest that oxydifficidin has a distinct binding site in the ribosome compared to other clinically used antibiotics making it an appealing therapeutic candidate. In our resistance mutant screening experiments with <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> the frequency of mutations in either <italic>dedA</italic> or <italic>rplL</italic> was quite low (∼10<sup>-9</sup>). The <italic>dedA</italic> deletion mutant exhibited altered cell morphology, characterized by diminished membrane integrity and reduced micro-colony formation (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4</xref>), indicating that it should show reduced pathogenesis and fitness, and, as a result, not accumulate in a clinical setting, which adds to the therapeutic appeal of oxydifficidin.</p>
<p>While most natural product research efforts are focused on identifying novel chemical entities, the work presented here suggests that reexamining old sources through the lens of today’s most important pathogens may also be a productive approach for identifying therapeutically appealing antibiotics. Increasing rates of antibiotic resistance present a significant clinical threat as they have the potential of rendering gonorrhea infections untreatable. The recent appearance of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> “superbugs” with high-level resistance to all currently recommended drugs treating gonorrhea infections, is particularly concerning.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>) One appealing feature in the original reports of the discovery of oxydifficidin was its activity in an animal model, a key hurdle for many natural products.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) Unfortunately oxydifficidin’s clinical significance was limited because of the weak activity it exhibited against most bacterial pathogens. Our identification of oxydifficidin as being specifically potent against <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> including multi-drug resistant <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic>, provides a potential new path forward for this structurally interesting natural antibiotic.</p>

<title>In Vitro Transcription and Translation Inhibition Assays</title>
<p>The <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription assay was conducted using the HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (NEB) following the manufacturer’s instructions. 24 μM of oxydifficidin was added to the transcription mixture, and 20 mM of EDTA was added to provide a positive control for inhibition. The yielded RNA was detected by a BioAnalyzer (Agilent). The <italic>in vitro</italic> translation assay was performed using PURExpress In Vitro Protein Synthesis Kit (NEB). 24 μM of antibiotics were added individually to the translation mixture and incubated at 37 °C for 4 hours, the samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE in a 5 – 20% gradient gel.</p>

<title>Membrane Integrity Assay</title>
<p>The membrane integrity assay was conducted using BacLight Bacterial Viability Kit (Invitrogen) following manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 1 ml of cell suspension at OD 0.7 was stained by adding 3 μl of the dye mixture and incubated in the dark at RT for 15 min. Subsequently, 1 μl of the stained culture was added onto the center of a round cover glass (Warner Instruments), a 1 mm × 1 mm GCB agar pad was overlayed on the culture. The sample was then imaged by an Eclipse Ti Microscope with a 60x objective (Nikon). DIC, GFP and Texas Red fluorescence channels were applied to the imaging. ImageJ was used to analyze all images. Membrane integrity was assessed by calculating the ratio of the number of green cells to red cells. Boiled cells were served as the negative control. The killing assays were done in 10 replicates.</p>

<title>Microcolony Formation Assay</title>
<p>100 μl of cell suspension at OD 0.7 were added to 1 ml of fresh GCB medium in a 6-well plate (VWR) and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 3 hours. Pictures were then taken using a 20x objective (Nikon).</p>

<sec id="s4a21">
<title>SEM of Neisseria gonorrhoeae</title>
<p>30 μl of cell suspension at OD 0.7 was spotted onto 12 mm glass or Aclar film round coverslips coated with 0.1% Poly-lysin. A drop of fixative (100 μl of 2% glutaraldehyde, 4% formaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer pH 7.2) was added on top of the coverslip for 30 min. Additional fixative was then added to the dish containing the coverslips and left it in the fridge overnight. Samples were gently washed three times with buffer for 5 - 10 min each time and postfixed with osmium tetroxide 1% in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer pH 7.2 for 1 hour at RT. After rinsing three times with buffer, samples were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol concentrations 30%, 50%, 70%, 90% for 10 min each and three times in 100% ethanol with molecular sieves for 15 min each and critical point dried in a Tousimis Autosamdri 931. Samples were coated with 10 nm of iridium using a Leica ACE600 sputter coater. Imaging was done in a JEOL JSM-IT500HR at 5.0 kV.</p>

<p>Kan et al. report the discovery of a Bacillus amyloliquifaciens strain that kills Nerisseria gonorrhoeae via oxydifficidin which targets ribosomal proteins. Resistance occurred via mutation in the DedA flippase to influence oxydifficidin uptake. The overall mechanism of action is well described making this an <bold>important</bold> study with implications for combating clinical antibiotic resistance. The evidence presented is <bold>convincing</bold> due to rigour employed in the methodological approach. The authors should consider performing a more comprehensive genetic analyses of DedA and RpIL in this clinically relevant strain. This work will be of broad interest to microbiologists and synthetic biologists.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Kan et al. report the serendipitous discovery of a Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain that kills N. gonorrhoeae. They use TnSeq to identify that the anti-gonococcal agent is oxydifficidin and show that it acts at the ribosome and that one of the dedA gene products in N. gonorrhoeae MS11 is important for moving the oxydifficidin across the membrane.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- This is an impressive amount of work, moving from a serendipitous observation through TnSeq to characterize the mechanism by which Oxydifficidin works.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- The genetic diversity of dedA and rplL in N. gonorrhoeae is still not clear, as the authors looked at diversity of these genes in only 220 isolates (of unclear relationship to each other).</p>
<p>It's not so much a weakness as a source of confusion: how did the authors choose to screen a tiny transposon library of 50 mutants? Since they were surprised to find 4 transposon insertions (if I'm reading it correctly), what was the motivation for even looking at this small library? And since the mutation that led them to the biosynthetic gene cluster wasn't even a transposon insertion but a frameshift, it seems they had another huge episode of serendipity.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Kan et al. presents the discovery of oxydifficidin as a potential antimicrobial against N. gonorrhoeae, including multi-drug resistant strains. The authors show the role of DedA flippase assisted uptake and the specificity of RplL in the mechanism of action for oxydifficidin. This mode of action could potentially offer a new therapeutic avenue, providing a critical addition to the limited arsenal of antibiotics effective against gonorrhea.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study shows the potential of revisiting anti-bacterial agents/products for antibacterial activity against modern-day-concerning pathogens and highlights a new anti-gonoccoal mechanism of action. Indeed there is a recent growing body of research to revisit potential antimicrobial agents and metabolites from cultured bacterial species. The discovery of oxydifficidin interaction with RplL and its DedA-assisted uptake mechanism opens new research directions in understanding and combating antibiotic resistant N. gonorrhoeae. The antimicrobial activity of oxydifficidin is also active against N. meningitidis, a closely related species. Methodologically, the study is rigorous employing various experimental techniques including Tn-mutagenesis (TraDIS, Tn-Seq).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the study demonstrates the in vitro effectiveness of oxydifficidin, there is a lack of in vivo validation (i.e., animal models) for assessing pre-clinical potential of oxydifficidin. However, I acknowledge that this would be a tremendous amount of work and likely outside the scope of this study. Potential SNPs within dedA or RplL raises concerns about how quickly resistance could emerge in clinical settings.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors have shown that oxydifficidin is a potent inhibitor of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. They were able to identify the target of action to rpsL and showed that resistance could occur via mutation in the DedA flippase and RpsL.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This was a very thorough and clearly argued set of experiments that supported their conclusions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There was no obvious weakness in the experimental design. Although it is promising that the DedA mutations resulted in attenuation of fitness, it remains an open question whether secondary rounds of mutation could overcome this selective disadvantage which was untried in this study.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>All of my suggestions were considered and the responses to the other reviewer's appears sound and has improved the manuscript.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>eLife Assessment</bold></p>
<p>This useful study reports on the discovery of an antimicrobial agent that kills Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Sensitivity is attributed to a combination of DedA assisted uptake of oxydifficidin into the cytoplasm and the presence of a oxydifficidin-sensitive RplL ribosomal protein. Due to the narrow scope, the broader antibacterial spectrum remains unclear and therefore the evidence supporting the conclusions is incomplete with key methods and data lacking. This work will be of interest to microbiologists and synthetic biologists.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>General comment about narrow scope: The broader antibacterial spectrum of oxydifficidin has been reported previously (S B Zimmerman et al., 1987). The main focus of this study is on its previously unreported potent anti-gonococcal activity and mode of action. While it is true that broad-spectrum antibiotics have historically played a role in effectively controlling a wide range of infections, we and others believe that narrow-spectrum antibiotics have an overlooked importance in addressing bacterial infections. Their advantage lies in their ability to target specific pathogens without markedly disrupting the human microbiota.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Kan et al. report the serendipitous discovery of a Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain that kills N. gonorrhoeae. They use TnSeq to identify that the anti-gonococcal agent is oxydifficidin and show that it acts at the ribosome and that one of the dedA gene products in N. gonorrhoeae MS11 is important for moving the oxydifficidin across the membrane.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is an impressive amount of work, moving from a serendipitous observation through TnSeq to characterize the mechanism by which Oxydifficidin works.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) There are important gaps in the manuscript's methods.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The requested additions to the method describing bacterial sequencing and anti-gonococcal activity screening will be made. However, we do not think the absence of these generic methods reduces the significance of our findings.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The work should evaluate antibiotics relevant to N. gonorrhoeae.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>(1) It is not clear to us why reevaluating the activity of well characterized antibiotics against known gonorrhoeae clinical strains would add value to this manuscript. The activity of clinically relevant antibiotics against antibiotic-resistant <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> clinical isolates is well described in the literature. Our use of antibiotics in this study was intended to aid in the identification of oxydifficidin’s mode of action. This is true for both Tables 1 and 2.</p>
<p>(2) If the reviewer insists, we would be happy to include MIC data for the following clinically relevant antibiotics: ceftriaxone (cephalosporin/beta-lactam), gentamicin (aminoglycoside), azithromycin (macrolide), and ciprofloxacin (fluoroquinolone).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The genetic diversity of dedA and rplL in N. gonorrhoeae is not clear, neither is it clear whether oxydifficidin is active against more relevant strains and species than tested so far.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>(1) We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We aligned the DedA sequence from strain MS11 with DedA proteins from 220 <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> strains that have high-quality assemblies in NCBI. The result showed that there are no amino acid changes in this protein. Using the same method, we observed several single amino acid changes in RplL. This included changes at A64, G25 and S82 in 4 strains with one change per strain. These sites differ from R76 and K84, where we identified changes that provide resistance to oxydifficidin. Notably, in a similar search of representative <italic>Escherichia</italic>, <italic>Chlamydia</italic>, <italic>Vibrio</italic>, and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> NCBI deposited genomes, we did not identify changes in RplL at position R76 or K84.</p>
<p>(2) While the usefulness of screening more clinically relevant antibiotics against clinical isolates as suggested in comment 2 was not clear to us, we agree that screening these strains for oxydifficidin activity would be beneficial. We have ordered <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> strain AR1280, AR1281 (CDC), and <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> ATCC 13090. They will be tested when they arrive.</p>

<p>Kan et al. present the discovery of oxydifficidin as a potential antimicrobial against N. gonorrhoeae, including multi-drug resistant strains. The authors show the role of DedA flippase-assisted uptake and the specificity of RplL in the mechanism of action for oxydifficidin. This novel mode of action could potentially offer a new therapeutic avenue, providing a critical addition to the limited arsenal of antibiotics effective against gonorrhea.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study underscores the potential of revisiting natural products for antibiotic discovery of modern-day-concerning pathogens and highlights a new target mechanism that could inform future drug development. Indeed there is a recent growing body of research utilizing AI and predictive computational informatics to revisit potential antimicrobial agents and metabolites from cultured bacterial species. The discovery of oxydifficidin interaction with RplL and its DedA-assisted uptake mechanism opens new research directions in understanding and combating antibiotic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae. Methodologically, the study is rigorous employing various experimental techniques such as genome sequencing, bioassay-guided fractionation, LCMS, NMR, and Tn-mutagenesis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The scope is somewhat narrow, focusing primarily on N. gonorrhoeae. This limits the generalizability of the findings and leaves questions about its broader antibacterial spectrum. Moreover, while the study demonstrates the in vitro effectiveness of oxydifficidin, there is a lack of in vivo validation (i.e., animal models) for assessing pre-clinical potential of oxydifficidin. Potential SNPs within dedA or RplL raise concerns about how quickly resistance could emerge in clinical settings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>(1) Spectrum/narrow scope: The broader antibacterial spectrum of oxydifficidin has been reported previously (S B Zimmerman et al., 1987). The focus of this study is on its previously unreported potent anti-gonococcal activity and its mode of action. While it is true that broad-spectrum antibiotics have historically played a role in effectively controlling a wide range of infections, we and others believe that narrow-spectrum antibiotics have an overlooked importance in addressing bacterial infections. Their advantage lies in their ability to target specific pathogens without markedly disrupting the human microbiota.</p>
<p>(2) Animal models: We acknowledge the reviewer’s insight regarding the importance of <italic>in vivo</italic> validation to enhance oxydifficidin’s pre-clinical potential. However, due to the labor-intensive process needed to isolate oxydifficidin, obtaining a sufficient quantity for animal studies is beyond the scope of this study. Our future work will focus on optimizing the yield of oxydifficidin and developing a topical mouse model for subsequent investigations.</p>
<p>(3) Potential SNPs: Please see our response to Reviewer #1’s comment 3. We acknowledge that potential SNPs within dedA and rplL raise concerns regarding clinical resistance, which is a common issue for protein-targeting antibiotics. Yet, as pointed out in the manuscript, obtaining mutants in the lab was a very low yield endeavor.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors have shown that oxydifficidin is a potent inhibitor of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. They were able to identify the target of action to rplL and showed that resistance could occur via mutation in the DedA flippase and RplL.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This was a very thorough and clearly argued set of experiments that supported their conclusions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There was no obvious weakness in the experimental design. Although it is promising that the DedA mutations resulted in attenuation of fitness, it remains an open question whether secondary rounds of mutation could overcome this selective disadvantage which was untried in this study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the positive comment. We agree that investigating factors that could compensate for the fitness attenuation caused by DedA mutation would enhance our understanding of the role of DedA.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The use of the term &quot;N. gonorrhoeae wildtype&quot; should not be used. It is uninformative, as the species contains a large amount of diversity. Instead, please name the strain. From Figure 1, it looks like the authors used MS11. Since MS11 is a longstanding lab strain and likely does not reflect circulating N. gonorrhoeae, and since H041 is no longer in circulation, the authors should ideally test the compound against more representative strains of N. gonorrhoeae. This includes panels of isolates available through the CDC, for example (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/resistance-bank/index.html">https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/resistance-bank/index.html</ext-link>). I encourage the authors to include FC428 or another recently identified isolate with the penA 60 allele to demonstrate oxydifficidin's activity against contemporary concerning isolates/lineages.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>(1) “<italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> MS11” is now used instead of “<italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> WT” in this manuscript.</p>
<p>(2) In our revised manuscript, we have added MIC data for recently identified <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> isolates AR#1280 and AR#1281 which contain the penA 60 allele (Table 1). The data shows oxydifficidin maintains its potent activity against these multidrug-resistant strains. We also added a description of this data to the results section as shown below.</p>
<p>Original text: “Oxydifficidin was more potent against <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> MS11 than almost all other antibiotics we tested. In fact, it was only slightly less active than the highly optimized third-generation cephalosporin, ceftazidime.([18]) However, unlike third-generation cephalosporins, oxydifficidin retained activity against the multidrug resistant H041 clinical isolate (Table 1).([4]) H041 is resistant to the “standard of care” cephalosporin ceftriaxone (2 µg/mL) as well as a number of other antibiotics that are normally active against <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> (penicillin G, 4 µg/mL; cefixime, 8 µg/mL; levofloxacin, 32 µg/mL).”</p>
<p>Changed to: “Oxydifficidin was more potent against <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> MS11 than most other antibiotics we tested. Notably, unlike clinically used antibiotics such as ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and ciprofloxacin, oxydifficidin retained activity against all multidrug-resistant clinical isolates we examined (Table 1).” (Line 77-79)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Does oxydifficidin have activity against N. meningitidis? It is the species most closely related to N. gonorrhoeae and the other pathogenic Neisseria.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Oxydifficidin has potent activity against <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> ATCC 13090. In our revised manuscript, we have included its MIC data in Figure 1c.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Given claims that oxydifficidin activity in N. gonorrhoeae as compared to other Neisseria reflects N. gonorrhoeae's dedA and sensitive rplL, it would be good to assess the allelic diversity of these genes in N. gonorrhoeae. There are over 20,000 genomes from clinical isolates of N. gonorrhoeae in databases. It should be straightforward to check whether dedA and rplL allelic variants already exist in the population. Should variants be observed, oxydifficidin should be tested against the associated strains of N. gonorrhoeae.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We aligned the DedA sequence from strain MS11 with DedA proteins from 220 <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> strains that have high-quality assemblies in NCBI. The result showed that there are no amino acid changes in this protein. Using the same method, we observed several single amino acid changes in RplL. This included changes at A64, G25 and S82 in 4 strains with one change per strain. These sites differ from R76 and K84, where we identified changes that provide resistance to oxydifficidin. Notably, in a similar search of representative <italic>Escherichia</italic>, <italic>Chlamydia</italic>, <italic>Vibrio</italic>, and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> NCBI deposited genomes, we did not identify changes in RplL at position R76 or K84.</p>
<p>New text: “A survey of 220 <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> strains with high-quality assemblies in NCBI found no mutations in the DedA protein.” (Line 104-105)</p>
<p>“These two mutations were not found in the survey of the same collection of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> strains used to look for DedA mutations.” (Line 143-144)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Clinically relevant antibiotics for N. gonorrhoeae are penicillin, tetracycline, spectinomycin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, ceftriaxone; moreover, zoliflodacin and gepotidacin have reportedly successfully completed phase 3 trials. The authors should redo their MIC testing with these antibiotics (e.g., for Figures 1 and 2 and Tables 1 and 2), both because this will enable direct comparison with the many clinical isolates that have undergone testing and because these are the drugs most pertinent to clinical practice. Ampicillin, ceftazidime, chloramphenicol, bacitracin, and daptomycin are not relevant. Could the authors explain why they tested vancomycin, polymyxin B, irgasan, melittin, avilamycin, and thiostrepton?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our use of antibiotics with diverse modes of action (e.g. vancomycin, polymyxin B, irgasan, melittin, avilamycin, and thiostrepton) in this study was intended to aid in the identification of oxydifficidin’s mode of action. This is true for both Tables 1 and 2.</p>
<p>To address the reviewer’s concern, in our revised manuscript, we have added MIC data for the following clinically relevant antibiotics: ceftriaxone (cephalosporin/beta-lactam), gentamicin (aminoglycoside), azithromycin (macrolide), and ciprofloxacin (fluoroquinolone) to Table 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Please describe the characteristics of the transposon library (finding four transposons in a single strain does seem unexpected, given how most transposon libraries aim for one transposon insertion per strain).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand that one transposon insertion per strain is ideal for transposon libraries. This <italic>Bacillus</italic> strain proved to be recalcitrant to genetic manipulation. In the rare cases where we obtained resistance colonies upon electroporation with the transposon, all colonies contained multiple (≥ 4) transposon insertions. This made it impractical to build a library with one transposon insertion per library member.</p>
<p>We assumed that the anti-<italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> activity most likely originated from a natural product BGC, which typically range from 10-100 kb in size.</p>
<p>Based on the average of 50 kb per BGC, ~80 transposon insertions would be required to fully search the 4.2 Mb genome of <italic>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</italic> BK for a BGC. At 4 mutations per transformant, 1x coverage of the genome would require only 20 library members.</p>
<p>After extensive electroporation of transposon into <italic>Bacillus</italic> <italic>amyloliquefaciens</italic> BK, we were able to obtain a library of 50 members, including one mutant (Tn5-3) that lacked anti-<italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> activity.</p>
<p>New text added to the methods section:</p>
<p>“A library containing 50 transposon mutants was obtained. In the mutants examined, each strain contained ≥4 transposon insertions” (Line 337-339)</p>

<p>(6) Please describe in the methods how you sequenced and annotated the genome of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens BK.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The sequencing method is now described in “Genomic Sequencing and annotation of <italic>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</italic>” section. The genome of <italic>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</italic> BK was not fully annotated. Mutations were identified as described in the updated methods section below.</p>
<p>New text:</p>
<p>“Genomic Sequencing and annotation of <italic>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</italic></p>
<p>Genomic DNA from <italic>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</italic> BK WT and transposon mutant Tn5-3 was isolated using PureLink Microbiome DNA purification kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
<p>The <italic>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</italic> BK WT genome was assembled by mapping its sequencing data onto the annotated genome of <italic>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</italic> FZB42 using Geneious Prime. Differences in the mutant strain Tn5-3 were identified by mapping its sequencing data onto the assembled <italic>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</italic> BK WT genome. The mutated genes were then annotated using NCBI BLAST. The oxydifficidin BGC was annotated using the antiSMASH online server.” (Line 253-260)</p>

<p>(7) Please describe in the methods how you screened the library for strains that lacked anti-gonococcal activity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The method is added to our revised manuscript as section “Screening of Bacillus Strains Lacking Anti-<italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> Activity”.</p>
<p>New text:</p>
<p>“Screening of Bacillus Strains Lacking Anti-N. gonorrhoeae Activity</p>
<p>The transposon mutants of <italic>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</italic> BK were grown overnight in LB medium at 30 °C. Each overnight culture was then diluted 1:5000, and 1 μl of the diluted culture was spotted onto a GCB agar plate swabbed with <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> cells. The plate was then incubated overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The mutant strain (Tn5-3) lacking anti-<italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> activity was identified due to its failure to produce a zone of growth inhibition in the resulting <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> lawn.” (Line 341-346)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Was only one strain found that was a 'non-producer' of anti-N. gonorrhoeae activity? Line 68 suggests that this was only one of multiple non-producers. Is that correct? If so, did you work up the others, and did they also have disruptions in the same biosynthetic gene cluster?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Only one strain was identified as a “non-producer” of anti-<italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> activity. We have modified the text to clarify this point.</p>

<p>The conclusions drawn in the manuscript are well-supported by the experimental data presented.</p>
<p>I have the below minor comments:</p>
<p>(1) &quot;serendipitously identified&quot; - I feel this wording should be avoided throughout the manuscript. The point of a research paper is to communicate methodology and experimental detail, and this language portrays the opposite.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While we agree that methodology and experimental procedures are paramount in scientific reporting, we believe it is equally important to convey, particularly to younger generations, that a part of the scientific process is often unplanned and can benefit from chance observations. Therefore, we would like to keep this wording.</p>

<p>(2) The introduction should include the biological roles/function of DedA proteins in bacteria.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>DedA proteins perform a wide array of biological roles and functions in bacteria. In the results section (Line 107-116), we have described the most well-established of these functions, particularly the flippase activity, which appears to be directly related to oxydifficidin sensitivity. We believe that introducing this information in the results section enhances the manuscript’s clarity and flow.</p>
