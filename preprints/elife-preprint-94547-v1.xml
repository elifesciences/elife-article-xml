<title>Abstract</title><p>A functional nervous system is built upon the proper morphogenesis of neurons to establish the intricate connection between them. The microtubule cytoskeleton is known to play various essential roles in this morphogenetic process. While many microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) have been demonstrated to participate in neuronal morphogenesis, the function of many more remains to be determined. This study focuses on a MAP called HMMR, which was originally identified as a hyaluronan binding protein and later found to possess microtubule and centrosome binding capacity. HMMR exhibits high abundance on neuronal microtubules and altering the level of HMMR significantly affects the morphology of neurons. Instead of confining to the centrosome(s) like cells in mitosis, HMMR localizes to microtubules along axons and dendrites. Furthermore, transiently expressing HMMR enhances the stability of neuronal microtubules and increases the formation frequency of growing microtubules along the neurites. HMMR regulates the microtubule localization of a non-centrosomal microtubule nucleator TPX2 along the neurite, offering an explanation for how HMMR contributes to the promotion of growing microtubules. This study sheds light on how progenitor cells utilize proteins involved in mitosis for non-mitotic functions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Animals interact with the environment through a highly intricate and organized network of interconnected cells. This network, known as the nervous system, is based on cells called neurons that are able to convey signals electrically and chemically. Neurons are also highly polarized with signal outputting compartments called axons that can extend over a meter in length and signal inputting compartments called dendrites that make the most elaborate tree branches pale in comparison. To develop such a complex and polarized morphology, neurons go through a stereotypical morphogenetic process which was initially observed <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dotti et al., 1988</xref>). Like other cellular processes in which a polarized morphology is established and maintained, neuronal morphogenesis relies on the interplay between different cytoskeletons. The microtubule cytoskeleton in particular is involved in most if not all aspects of the neuronal morphogenetic process. Microtubules are dynamic biopolymers that can undergo polymerization and depolymerization through the addition and removal of α- and β-tubulin heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Desai and Mitchison, 1997</xref>). In addition to tubulin heterodimers that make up the bulk of microtubules, a collection of proteins called microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) also regulate the dynamic nature of this cytoskeleton and play crucial roles in the morphogenesis of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Conde and Caceres, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Poulain and Sobel, 2010</xref>). To better understand the role of MAPs in establishing and maintaining the neuronal morphology, we surveyed the microtubule-associated proteome in neurons using affinity purification and quantitative proteomics (Hwang <italic>et al</italic>., unpublished data). Surprisingly, hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor (HMMR), also known as receptor for hyaluronan mediated motility (RHAMM) or intracellular hyaluronic acid binding protein (IHABP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hofmann et al., 1998</xref>), is among the most abundant MAPs on neuronal microtubules. HMMR was originally identified as a hyaluronan-binding protein from the murine fibroblast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Turley et al., 1987</xref>). HMMR-targeting antibodies have since been used to demonstrate the involvement of surface-localized HMMR in hyaluronan-dependent motility in a variety of cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hardwick et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Pilarski et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Samuel et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Savani et al., 1995</xref>). More recent data demonstrate that HMMR is also an intracellular protein and interacts with the microtubule and actin cytoskeletons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Assmann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Assmann et al., 1998</xref>). In agreement with the its role as a MAP, HMMR has also been shown to interact with other MAPs such as the microtubule motor dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Maxwell et al., 2003</xref>) and the microtubule nucleator TPX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Groen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Scrofani et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, HMMR plays crucial roles in microtubule assembly near the chromosomes and at the spindle poles, spindle architecture, as well as mitotic progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Groen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Maxwell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Scrofani et al., 2015</xref>). While the association of HMMR with microtubules is well documented in mitotic cells, very little is known about this interaction in non-mitotic cells. <italic>Hmmr</italic> mRNA has been shown to highly express in the proliferative regions of the nervous system in both developing amphibian and murine embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Casini et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Li et al., 2017</xref>). The presence of HMMR protein in the adult brain and in dissociated primary neurons have also been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Lindwall et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Nagy et al., 1995</xref>). Furthermore, HMMR is essential for proper mitotic spindle orientation in neural progenitor cells and the appropriate formation of various brain structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Connell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Li et al., 2017</xref>). These observations demonstrate a crucial mitosis function of HMMR in neural progenitor cells. However, the function of HMMR extends beyond mitosis in neurons. Using antibodies targeting the cell surface HMMR or peptides mimicking hyaluronan binding domain of HMMR, it has been shown that HMMR is involved in neurite extension in primary neurons and intraocular brainstem transplants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Nagy et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Nagy et al., 1998</xref>). These findings indicate that HMMR plays important roles in the nervous tissue and in non-mitotic neurons. However, whether HMMR exerts any effect on the microtubule cytoskeleton in neurons remains unexplored.</p>
<p>In this study, the function of HMMR in non-mitotic neurons is examined without any preconception regarding its localization. Using the shRNA-mediated depletion, HMMR knockdown negatively impacts the morphology of primary neurons. These morphological phenotypes include the decrease of axon and dendrite length as well as the reduction of branching complexity. The opposite phenotypes are observed in neurons transiently expressing <italic>Hmmr</italic>. Both endogenous and exogenous HMMR localize to the microtubule cytoskeleton and exhibit punctate distribution along the neurites. In addition to its microtubule localization, HMMR is observed to enhance the stability and promote the formation of neuronal microtubules. We also found that the effect of HMMR on microtubule formation is due to its role in recruiting the microtubule nucleator TPX2 onto the microtubules. This work demonstrates that HMMR regulates the dynamics of microtubules independent of its mitotic function or its role on the centrosome in non-mitotic cells.</p>

<title>HMMR regulates neuronal morphogenesis</title>
<p>To examine the role of HMMR in non-mitotic neurons, <italic>Hmmr</italic>-targeting shRNA was utilized to knock down <italic>Hmmr</italic>. Three different shRNA sequences were used for depleting <italic>Hmmr</italic> in mouse neurons (<bold>Figure S1A</bold>). Upon HMMR depletion, a significant decrease in total neurite length, total axon length, total dendrite length, and branch density can be detected in dissociated hippocampal neurons (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-E</xref></bold>). To eliminate the possibility of the off-target effect, we performed the rescue experiment by co-transfecting plasmids expressing human HMMR (EGFP-hHMMR) and <italic>Hmmr</italic>-targeting shRNA into hippocampal neurons at 0 days <italic>in vitro</italic> (DIV) and incubated for 4 days before fixation and immunofluorescence staining. The expression of EGFP-hHMMR rescues the phenotype of HMMR knockdown (in both total neurite length and branching density) (<bold>Figure S1B- E</bold>).</p>

<p>In addition to the loss-of-function assay, we also performed the gain-of-function assay by transiently overexpressing a mouse HMMR fused to AcGFP1 (AcGFP-mHMMR) in hippocampal neurons. Consistent with the knockdown experiments, overexpressing HMMR results in the opposite phenotypes (i.e., an increase in total neurite length, total axon length, total dendrite length, and branch density) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F-J</xref></bold>). These functional analyses demonstrate that HMMR plays important roles in regulating the morphogenetic processes in non-mitotic neurons.</p>

<title>HMMR is a microtubule-associated protein in neurons</title>
<p>To understand the cellular mechanism of HMMR in regulating neuronal morphogenesis, the localization of HMMR in neurons was examined. The HMMR antibody was first validated using shRNA-mediated HMMR depletion in neurons. A significant decrease of HMMR immunofluorescence signal was observed in the soma and along the neurites in HMMR-depleted neurons (<bold>Figure S2</bold>), confirming the specificity of the HMMR antibody. Using this antibody, HMMR is detected along the entire neuron with higher abundance in the soma (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). Given that HMMR is known to interact with microtubules in mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Assmann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Maxwell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Tolg et al., 2010</xref>), we examined whether the same interaction exists in neurons.</p>

</fig>
<p>Hippocampal neurons were permeabilized before fixation (or pre-extracted) to remove cytosolic proteins and to retain proteins anchored to insoluble structures such as cytoskeletal filaments. HMMR signal can be detected along the neurite and in the soma after pre-extraction, indicating that it may be associated with neuronal cytoskeletons (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). Upon careful examination, we found that both the endogenous HMMR and transiently expressed AcGFP-mHMMR shows punctate localization along the axon and dendrite (<bold>Figure S3</bold>). Furthermore, when transiently overexpressed AcGFP-mHMMR reaches a high abundance level, it colocalizes with microtubules and sometimes causing the formation of looped microtubules in neurons (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>). To determine whether HMMR is associated with microtubules in neurons, the proximity ligation assay (PLA) was conducted. We first examined whether the endogenous HMMR interacts with microtubules in neurons.</p>
<p>Antibodies against HMMR and neuron-specific β-III-tubulin were used in this PLA. If the two primary antibodies are localized in close proximity (&lt;40 nm), an enzymatic reaction will catalyze the amplification of a specific DNA sequence that can then be detected using a red fluorescent probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Soderberg et al., 2006</xref>). Consistent with the idea that HMMR associates with neuronal microtubules, fluorescent PLA punta can be detected in the soma and along the neurite in 3 DIV hippocampal neurons (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>). These fluorescent PLA puncta can only be observed when both primary antibodies were present, indicating that these PLA signals are highly specific (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold>). Furthermore, AcGFP-mHMMR-expressing plasmid was transfected into dissociated mouse hippocampal neurons at 0 DIV and incubated for 3 days before fixation and PLA. Antibodies against AcGFP and β-III-tubulin were selected for this PLA. Consistent with the result using endogenous HMMR, fluorescent PLA puncta can be observed in the soma and along the neurite in 3 DIV primary hippocampal neurons (<bold>Figure S4A</bold>). PLA signals can only be observed when both GFP and β-III-tubulin antibodies were present (<bold>Figure S4B</bold>). These results demonstrate that both endogenous and transiently expressed HMMR associate with microtubules in neurons.</p>
<p>Because the punctate distribution of HMMR on microtubules is reminiscent of microtubule plus-ends, we also examined the colocalization of HMMR and EB1 (a microtubule plus-end tracking protein) in neurons. Upon visual examination, HMMR and EB1 do not exhibit colocalization in neurons (<bold>Figure S5A</bold>). To quantify the extent of HMMR and EB1 colocalization in 1 DIV hippocampal neurons, linescans along the neurite and Pearson correlation coefficient were calculated. The average Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.28±0.25 (<bold>Figure S5B</bold>). This result indicates that the punctate HMMR localization in neurons does not represent microtubule plus-ends.</p>

<title>HMMR stabilizes microtubules in neurons</title>
<p>The presence of HMMR on neuronal microtubules and the formation of looped microtubules in AcGFP- mHMMR overexpressing neurons (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>) suggests HMMR may be a microtubule stabilizing factor. To test this possibility, the level of acetylated microtubules was quantified, as this post-translational modification is known to accumulate on stable and long lived microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Schulze et al., 1987</xref>). Consistent with our hypothesis, HMMR depletion via <italic>Hmmr</italic>-targeting shRNA produces a significant decrease of the level of acetylated microtubules in both axons and dendrites (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B-D</xref></bold>). In contrast, the level of microtubule acetylation increases in both axons and dendrites of HMMR-overexpressing neurons (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E-G</xref></bold>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that HMMR enhances microtubule stability in neurons.</p>

<p>In addition, we examined whether HMMR expression can resist the microtubule destabilizing effect of nocodazole in neurons. AcGFP or AcGFP-mHMMR-expressing plasmid was introduced into dissociated hippocampal neurons on 0 DIV, incubated for 1 day to allow HMMR expression, and administered solvent (DMSO) or 100 nM nocodazole for 2 additional days before neurite length examination. The addition of nocodazole causes a significant reduction of total neurite length, while the expression of HMMR rescues such phenotype (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref></bold>). This result is consistent with the idea that HMMR plays a microtubule stabilizing role in neurons.</p>

<title>HMMR regulates neuronal microtubule dynamics</title>
<p>The association of HMMR with neuronal microtubules and its effect on microtubule stabilization suggest that HMMR may also be involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics in neurons. To investigate this, we utilized the neuronal microtubule dynamics assay previously established in which EB3-mCherry is utilized as a fiduciary marker of growing microtubule plus-ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). The rationale is that changes in microtubule dynamics can be detected as alterations in the velocity (or the speed of microtubule polymerization), persistence (the duration of time when EB3-mCherry comet can be followed), and frequency (the number of EB3-mCherry comets detected in a given time span). Plasmids expressing <italic>Hmmr</italic>-targeting shRNA and EB3-mCherry were introduced into dissociated neurons at 0 DIV and incubated for 4 days before fluorescence live cell imaging. To quantify microtubule dynamics, the neurite was separated into 3 different 10 μm regions: proximal, middle, and distal neurite (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>). HMMR depletion results in a significant decrease of EB3-mCherry emanation frequency in all 3 neurite regions (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B-C</xref></bold>). Moreover, a trend of increased microtubule polymerization velocity and a trend of decreased persistence are observed in HMMR- depleted neurons. Next, we examined whether opposite effects on microtubule dynamics can be detected in HMMR overexpressing neurons. Plasmids expressing AcGFP-mHMMR and EB3-mCherry were introduced into dissociated neurons at 0 DIV and incubated for 4 days before fluorescence live cell imaging and microtubule dynamics assay. Congruent with the depletion results, a significant increase in EB3-mCherry emanation frequency is observed at the proximal, middle, and distal neurites in HMMR-expressing neurons (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D-E</xref></bold>). Further agreement comes from the decrease of microtubule polymerization velocity and the increase of microtubule persistence in neurons overexpressing HMMR. Both the decrease of microtubule polymerization velocity and the increase of microtubule persistence are consistent with the observation that HMMR can enhance the stability of neuronal microtubules. These data demonstrate that HMMR regulates the dynamics of microtubules in neurons.</p>

<title>HMMR promotes TPX2-microtubule interaction in axons and dendrites</title>
<p>While changes in microtubule polymerization velocity and persistence in the previous section can be explained by the microtubule stabilizing effect of HMMR, the alteration in microtubule emanation frequency cannot. One explanation is that HMMR influences the function of another microtubule dynamics regulator in neurons. It has been shown that HMMR interacts with the microtubule nucleator TPX2 in a cell cycle-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Maxwell et al., 2005</xref>) and this interaction is required for concentrating TPX2 at the spindle poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Groen et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, we have shown that microtubule-bound TPX2 localizes along the neurite and is responsible for non-centrosomal microtubule formation in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Combining these two observations, we hypothesized that HMMR affects the localization of TPX2 along the neurite which in turn regulates the formation of neuronal microtubules. To examine this hypothesis, the localization of TPX2 along the neurite was examined in neurons with or without HMMR depletion. Since the abundance of TPX2 along the neurite is rather low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen et al., 2017</xref>), PLA was utilized to detect this localization of TPX2. PLA using antibodies against TPX2 and β-III-tubulin produces numerous puncta along the neurite (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold>). This punctate distribution appears similar to that produced by HMMR and β-III-tubulin PLA (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>). Consistent with our hypothesis, a statistically significant increase of PLA inter-punctal distance (the distance between PLA puncta) is detected in both axons and dendrites of HMMR-depleted neurons (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B-C</xref></bold>). This result indicates that HMMR depletion reduces the localization of TPX2 on neuronal microtubules. These fluorescent PLA puncta can only be observed when both primary antibodies were present, indicating that these PLA signals are highly specific (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref></bold>). Next, the effect of HMMR overexpression on TPX2 localization is examined. Plasmids expressing AcGFP-mHMMR were introduced into hippocampal neurons on 0 DIV and incubated for 7 days before fixation and PLA. In agreement with the depletion experiment, a significant decrease in PLA inter-punctal distance is observed in HMMR overexpressing axon and dendrite (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E-G</xref></bold>). This result indicates that HMMR overexpression enhances the localization of TPX2 on neuronal microtubules. PLA puncta can only be observed when both primary antibodies were present (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref></bold>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that HMMR promotes the interaction between TPX2 and microtubules in neurons.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate that HMMR influences cellular morphogenesis in non-mitotic neurons using loss- and gain-of-function assays. Transient expression of HMMR promotes axon and dendrite elongation as well as enhances branch density, while depletion of HMMR produces the opposite phenotypes. Both endogenous and transiently expressed HMMR localize primarily to the microtubule cytoskeleton in neurons. The distribution of HMMR along the neurite has a punctate appearance but does not colocalize with the microtubule plus-ends.</p>
<p>Using transient expression and shRNA-mediated depletion, it was discovered that HMMR enhances the stability and promotes the formation of neuronal microtubules. Finally, we show that HMMR regulates the recruitment of the microtubule nucleator TPX2 onto neuronal microtubules. These results demonstrate for the first time that HMMR plays an important role in regulating microtubules and morphogenesis in non-mitotic cells.</p>
<p>HMMR has been documented to be a hyaluronate-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Turley et al., 1987</xref>) as well as a microtubule-associated protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Assmann et al., 1999</xref>). In more recent studies, HMMR is found to be associated with the centrosome in mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Maxwell et al., 2003</xref>). It contains a central rod domain with coiled-coil structures flanked by two microtubule-binding domains at the N-terminus and a centrosome-targeting bZip motif at the C- terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Assmann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Maxwell et al., 2003</xref>). While numerous studies focus on the role of HMMR in mitotic cells, studies on non-mitotic neurons are scarce. It has been documented that neutralizing HMMR with a functional blocking antibody compromises neurite extension in cell line and primary neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Nagy et al., 1995</xref>). A similar neutralizing strategy was used to demonstrate that HMMR is involved in axon outgrowth in an intraocular transplantation model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Nagy et al., 1998</xref>). Our loss- and gain-of-function assays are consistent with these aforementioned publications. In addition, our data indicate that the increase of microtubule stability is the main mechanism driving the enhanced neurite outgrowth in neurons overexpressing HMMR (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Using EB3-mCherry as a marker for growing microtubule plus-ends, we discovered that HMMR increases the amount of growing microtubules. These growing microtubules can either come from the <italic>de novo</italic> formation of microtubules or the repolymerization from paused or shrinking microtubules. The explanation of this increased number of growing microtubules lies in the observation that the localization of TPX2 (a branch microtubule nucleator) on microtubules is regulated by HMMR in neurons. This is consistent with previous publications showing that HMMR interacts with TPX2 and is required for concentrating TPX2 at the spindle pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Groen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Maxwell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Scrofani et al., 2015</xref>). Given that GTP-bound Ran (RanGTP) promotes the interaction between HMMR and TPX2 in the cell-free system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Scrofani et al., 2015</xref>), it is tempting to hypothesize that RanGTP also regulates the HMMR-TPX2 interaction in neurons. It has previously been shown that cytoplasmic RanGTP promotes the formation of non-centrosomal microtubules at the neurite tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Huang et al., 2020</xref>). This is due to the effect of RanGTP on releasing TPX2 from the inhibitory importin heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Our results suggest that the effect of cytoplasmic RanGTP on neuronal microtubules may come from recruiting TPX2 to the existing microtubules as well as enhancing its nucleator activity.</p>
<p>Given the importance of HMMR on spindle integrity and orientation, studies of HMMR on neural development have largely focused on these aspects. It has been documented that neural progenitor cells from <italic>Hmmr</italic> knockout or C-terminal truncation mice exhibit misoriented spindle and consequently these animals develop either megalencephaly or microcephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Connell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Hmmr</italic> depletion in <italic>Xenopus</italic> showed defects in anterior neural tube closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Prager et al., 2017</xref>). During CNS development, the anterior part of the neural tube closes and differentiates into the brain while the posterior part becomes the spinal cord. A series of cellular actions take place during the neural tube closure that include polarization, migration, and intercalation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Nikolopoulou et al., 2017</xref>). This failure in closing the anterior neural tube suggests an underlying defect in the microtubule cytoskeleton. Upon careful examination, interphase cells from the deep neural layer in <italic>Hmmr</italic> depleted embryos adopted a web-like microtubule organization instead of their typical linear microtubule organization. This data is consistent with our observation that HMMR plays a role in organizing the microtubule cytoskeleton in non-mitotic cells of the neural tissue. In support of this idea, <italic>Hmmr</italic> is amongst the highest expressed RNA in the corpus callosum relative to other tissues in adult humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Rouillard et al., 2016</xref>). Because HMMR plays such a critical role in mitosis of neural progenitor cells, any loss-of-function <italic>Hmmr</italic> mutation in humans will likely result in embryonic lethality and prevent the observation of non-mitotic, microtubule-based phenotypes such as corpus callosum malformation or lissencephaly. It will be of great interest to examine the microtubule-rich brain structures such as corpus callosum or microtubule-dependent processes such as neuronal migration in <italic>Hmmr</italic> conditional knockout mice.</p>

<p>For neurite length analysis, fluorescence images were manually traced with the ImageJ plugin NeuronJ 1.4.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Meijering et al., 2004</xref>). Only neurons expressing both the transfection indicator (e.g., EGFP) and specific markers (e.g., β-III-tubulin, MAP2, SMI312) were analyzed. Only neurites longer than its soma diameter were analyzed. For neurite branching analysis, neurites were manually traced using the Fiji plug-in Simple Neurite Tracer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Longair et al., 2011</xref>) before being processed with the Fiji plug-in Sholl analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Ferreira et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>For acetylated microtubule quantification, manually generated linescans along the neurite were used to obtain the signal of acetylated-α-tubulin and β-III-tubulin. The ratio of acetylated-α-tubulin/β-III-tubulin was calculated to represent the level of microtubule acetylation.</p>
<p>For microtubule plus-end dynamics analysis, NIS-Elements software was used to generate the kymograph for the EB3-mCherry images. All kymograph were generated using a window 10 μm in length and 7 pixels in width. For proximal neurite analysis, the kymograph window started from the edge of the soma and extended outwards. For mid-neurite analysis, the kymograph window was centered at the midpoint of the neurite. For distal neurite analysis, the kymograph window started at the wrist of the growth cone and extended inwards. The speed and persistence time of EB3-mCherry were quantified from the kymograph by drawing a line along an EB3-mCherry event. Only EB3-mCherry movements that could be followed clearly for equal or more than four frames (1.5 seconds) were defined as an event. The emanating frequency of EB3-mCherry was quantified from the kymograph by counting the number of EB3-mCherry events per minute.</p>

<p>In their <bold>valuable</bold> study, Chen et al. aim to define the neuronal role of HMMR, a microtubule-associated protein typically associated with cell division. Their findings suggest that HMMR is necessary for proper neuronal morphology and the generation of polymerizing microtubules within neurites, potentially by promoting the function of TPX2. While the study is recognized as a first step in deciphering the influence of HMMR on microtubule organization in neurons, the reviewers note the current work is <bold>incomplete</bold>, with significant gaps and it would benefit from further exploration of the mechanism of microtubule stability by HMMR, the link between HMMR-mediated microtubule generation and morphogenesis, and the physiological implications of disrupting HMMR during neuronal morphogenesis.</p>

<p>The microtubule cytoskeleton is essential for basic cell functions, enabling intracellular transport, and establishment of cell polarity and motility. Microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) contribute to the regulation of microtubule dynamics and stability - mechanisms that are specifically important for the development and physiological function of neurons. Here, the authors aimed to elucidate the neuronal function of the MAP Hmmr, which they had previously identified in a quantitative study of the proteome associated with neuronal microtubules.</p>
<p>The authors conduct well-controlled experiments to demonstrate the localization of endogenous as well as exogenous Hmmr on microtubules within the soma as well as all neurites of hippocampal neurons. Functional analysis using gain- and loss-of-function approaches demonstrates that Hmmr levels are crucial for neuronal morphogenesis, as the length of both dendrites and axons decreases upon loss of Hmmr and increases upon Hmmr overexpression. In addition to length alterations, the branching pattern of neurites changes with Hmmr levels. To uncover the mechanism of how Hmmr influences neuronal morphology, the authors follow the lead that Hmmr overexpression induces looped microtubules in the soma, indicative of an increase in microtubule stability. Microtubule acetylation indeed decreases and increases with Hmmr LOF and GOF, respectively. Together with a rescue of nocodazole-induced microtubule destabilization by Hmmr GOF, these results argue that Hmmr regulates microtubule stability. Highlighted by the altered movement of a plus-end-associated protein, Hmmr also has an effect on the dynamic nature of microtubules. The authors present evidence suggesting that the nucleation frequency of neuronal microtubules depends on Hmmr's ability to recruit the microtubule nucleator Tpx2. Together, these data add novel insight into MAP-mediated regulation of microtubules as a prerequisite for neuronal morphogenesis. While the data shown support the author's conclusions, the study also has several weaknesses:</p>
<p>- The study appears incomplete as the initial proteomics analysis which is referenced as an entry into the study is not presented. This surely is the authors' choice, however, without presenting this data set, it would make more sense if the authors first showed the localization of Hmmr on neuronal microtubules and then started with the functional analysis.</p>
<p>- Neurite branching is quantified, but the methods used are not consistent (normalized branch density vs. Sholl analysis) and there is no distinction between alterations of branching in dendrites vs. axons. This information should be added as it could prove informative with respect to the physiological function of Hmmr in neurite branching.</p>
<p>- The authors show that altered Hmmr levels affect neurite branching and identify an effect on microtubule stability and dynamics as a molecular mechanism. However, how branching correlates with or is regulated by Hmmr-mediated microtubule dynamics is neither addressed experimentally nor discussed by the authors. The physiological significance of altered neuronal morphogenesis also lacks discussion.</p>
<p>- Multiple times, the manuscript lacks a rationale for an experimental approach, choice of cell type, time points, regions of interest, etc. Also, a meaningful description of the methods and for how data were analyzed is missing, making the paper hard to read for someone not directly from the field.</p>

<p>The mechanism of microtubule formation, stabilization, and organization in neurites is important for neuronal function. In this manuscript, the authors examine the phenotype of neurons following alteration in the level of the protein HMMR, a microtubule-associated protein with established roles in mitosis. Neurite morphology is measured as well as microtubule stability and dynamic parameters using standard assays. A binding partner of HMMR, TPX2, is localized. The results support a role for HMMR in neurons.</p>
<p>The work presented in this manuscript seeks to determine if a MAP called HMMR contributes to microtubule dynamics in neurons. Several steps, including validation of the RNAi, additional statistical analysis, use of cells at the same age in culture, and better documentation in figures, would increase the impact of the work.</p>
<p>In many places, the data can be improved which might make the story more convincing. As presented, the results show that HMMR is distributed as puncta on neurons with data coming from a single HMMR antibody, and some background staining that was not discussed. In the discussion the authors state that HMMR impacts microtubule stability, which was evaluated by the presence of post-translational modification and resistance to nocodazole; the data are suggestive but not entirely convincing. The discussion also states that HMMR increases the &quot;amount&quot; of growing microtubules which was measured as the frequency of comet appearance. The authors did not comment on how the number of growing microtubules results in the observed morphological changes.</p>
