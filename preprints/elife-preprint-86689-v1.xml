<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The primary cilium plays important roles in regulating cell differentiation, signal transduction, and tissue organization. Dysfunction of the primary cilium can lead to ciliopathies and cancer. The formation and organization of the primary cilium are highly associated with cell polarity proteins, such as the apical polarity protein CRB3. However, the molecular mechanisms by which CRB3 regulates ciliogenesis and CRB3 location remain unknown. Here, we show that CRB3, as a navigator, regulates vesicle trafficking in γ-TuRC assembly during ciliogenesis and cilium-related Hh and Wnt signaling pathways in tumorigenesis. <italic>Crb3</italic> knockout mice display severe defects of the primary cilium in the mammary ductal lumen and renal tubule. CRB3 is essential for lumen formation and ciliary assembly in the mammary epithelium. We demonstrate that CRB3 localizes to the basal body and that CRB3 trafficking is mediated by Rab11-positive endosomes. Significantly, CRB3 directly interacts with Rab11 to navigate GCP6/Rab11 trafficking vesicles to CEP290, resulting in intact γ-TuRC assembly. In addition, CRB3-depleted cells cannot respond to the activation of the Hh signaling pathway, while CRB3 regulates the Wnt signaling pathway. Therefore, our studies reveal the molecular mechanisms by which CRB3 recognizes Rab11-positive endosomes to navigate apical vesicle trafficking in effective ciliogenesis, maintaining cellular homeostasis and tumorigenesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Epithelial tissues are the most common, widely distributed, and perform several particular functions. The integrity of the specific cellular architecture composed of epithelial cells is necessary for these functions of epithelial tissues. Establishing apical-basal cell polarity within epithelial cells is a crucial biological process for epithelial homeostasis. Most human cancers originate from epithelial tissues, and loss of apical-basal cell polarity is one of the most significant hallmarks of advanced malignant tumors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Several reports have shown that loss of some polarity proteins causes disordered cell polarity within epithelial cells, which cannot tightly control cellular growth and migration, ultimately leading to tumor formation, progression, and metastasis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. However, the relationship between polarity proteins and tumorigenesis remains incomplete.</p>
<p>The crumb complex, located apically, is vital in regulating and maintaining apical-basal cell polarity within epithelial cells. In mammals, three Crumbs orthologs are CRB1, CRB2, and CRB3, and only CRB3 is widely expressed in epithelial cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Our previous studies have shown that CRB3 is expressed at low levels in renal and breast cancers, and abnormal CRB3 expression leads to the disrupted organization of MCF10A cells in three-dimensional (3D) cultures[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Inhibition of CRB3 impairs contact inhibition and leads to migration, invasion and tumorigenesis of cancer cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. The contact inhibition results in growth arrest and causes epithelial cells to enter the quiescent phase, inducing primary cilium formation.</p>
<p>The primary cilium, an antenna-like microtubule-based organelle in most types of mammalian cells, is a sensorial antenna that regulates cell differentiation, proliferation, polarity, and tissue organization[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Dysfunction of the primary cilium can lead to developmental and degenerative disorders called ciliopathies, such as polycystic kidney disease, nephronophthisis, retinitis pigmentosa, and Meckel syndrome[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Remarkably, it has been reported that many cancers, including melanoma and breast, renal, pancreatic, and prostate cancer, exhibit loss of the primary cilium, most likely during the early stages of tumorigenesis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. The primary cilium is a significant extension on the apical surfaces of epithelial cells and is maintained by polarized vesicular traffic[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Some studies have shown that CRB3 localizes in the primary cilium and that depletion of CRB3 leads to primary cilium loss in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], indicating that CRB3 is necessary for the initiation of ciliogenesis. However, how CRB3 promotes ciliogenesis on the apical surfaces of epithelial cells remains unknown.</p>
<p>Here, we describe a novel conditional deletion of <italic>Crb3</italic> in mice and show that Crb3 is required to assemble the primary cilium in the gland, kidney and MEF cells from <italic>Crb3</italic> knockout mice and that <italic>Crb3</italic> deletion promotes breast cancer progression <italic>in vivo</italic>. We found that CRB3, which directly interacts with Rab11, navigates GCP6/Rab11 trafficking vesicles to the basal body of the primary cilium in mammary epithelial cells. Additionally, we identified that CRB3 regulates the ciliary Hedgehog (Hh) and Wnt signaling pathways in breast cancer. Thus, we found unexpected diversity in the polarity protein CRB3 navigating polarized Rab11-dependent traffic, leading to a novel assembly mechanism of the -tubulin ring complex (γTuRC) in ciliogenesis.</p>

<title><italic>Crb3</italic> deletion mice exhibit smaller and anophthalmia</title>
<p>Since <italic>Crb3</italic> knockout mice die shortly after birth[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>], we generated a novel transgenic mouse model with conditional deletion of <italic>Crb3</italic> using the Cre-loxP system. The loxP sites flanked either side of exon 3 in the <italic>Crb3</italic> gene (Supplementary Fig. 1A). The positive embryonic stem (ES) cell clone was confirmed for the wild-type gene (<italic>Crb3</italic><sup>wt/wt</sup>) and recombinant allele (<italic>Crb3</italic><sup>wt/fl</sup>) by Southern blotting (Supplementary Fig. 1B). The genotypes of the wild type, heterozygotes and homozygotes (<italic>Crb3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>) were detected with specific primers (Supplementary Fig. 1C). We first intercrossed <italic>Crb3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> with CMV enhancer/chicken β-actin promoter (CAG)-Cre mice and found that <italic>Crb3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>, <italic>Crb3</italic><sup>wt/fl</sup>; CAG-Cre and <italic>Crb3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>; CAG-Cre pups were born normally and looked well developed in size. However, most <italic>Crb3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>; CAG-<italic>Cre</italic> pups died within a few days after birth. Few surviving <italic>Crb3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>; CAG-<italic>Cre</italic> mice were smaller and showed anophthalmia than littermate <italic>Crb3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice at 4 weeks old (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-B</xref>). The eye is an organ with perfect apical-basal cell polarity. However, <italic>Crb3</italic> knockout mice showed ocular abnormalities. Together, these results indicated that Crb3 is necessary for eye development.</p>

<title>Mammary epithelial-specific <italic>Crb3</italic> deletion causes ductal epithelial hyperplasia and tumorigenesis</title>
<p>Based on our earlier studies showing that inhibition of CRB3 impairs the organization of breast epithelium, we set out to directly explore the role of Crb3 in mammary gland development. We first developed epithelial cell-specific deletion of <italic>Crb3</italic> in the mammary gland by intercrossing <italic>Crb3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice with mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat promoter (MMTV)-<italic>Cre</italic> mice. We demonstrated the expression of Crb3 in the mammary gland using immunoblotting, real-time quantitative PCR, and immunohistochemistry, and the level of Crb3 expression was deficient in mammary epithelial cells with Crb3 knockout (Supplementary Fig. 1D-F).</p>
<p>To assess the function of Crb3 in the development of mammary epithelial cells, we analyzed whole mammary mounts from 8-week-old virgin <italic>Crb3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>;MMTV-<italic>Cre</italic> and littermate <italic>Crb3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice. <italic>Crb3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>;MMTV-<italic>Cre</italic> mice displayed significantly increased numbers of terminal end buds (TEBs) and bifurcated TEBs than <italic>Crb3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C-E</xref>). The histopathology results showed that normal ductal epithelial cells were arranged as a monolayer in <italic>Crb3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, while <italic>Crb3</italic> knockout led to ductal epithelial hyperplasia with increased ductal thickness in <italic>Crb3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>;MMTV-<italic>Cre</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>).</p>
<p>To observe the role of Crb3 in the tumorigenesis of breast cancer, we observed mammary glands from 9-week-old virgin polyomavirus middle T antigen (PyMT)-cKO-Crb3 and PyMT-WT mice whose mammary glands progressed to early carcinomas and lost their normal epithelial architecture[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. The PyMT mouse model has been widely used in the study of tumor initiation and development with similar histological progression to human breast cancer. PyMT-WT mice exhibited loss of epithelial features and development of breast cancer, while PyMT-cKO-Crb3 mice grew larger tumors with faster tumor progression and a poorly differentiated phenotype (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). Thus, Crb3 knockout leads to ductal epithelial hyperplasia and promotes tumorigenesis, and it is essential for branching morphogenesis in mammary gland development and tumor progression.</p>

<title>CRB3 knockdown inhibits lumen formation in acini of mammary epithelial cells</title>
<p>MCF10A cells are spontaneously immortalized human breast epithelial cells with the characteristics of normal breast epithelium[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. MCF-10A cells could form acini similar to mammary epithelial acini under 3D basement membrane culture conditions. It has become a valuable system to study the morphogenesis and oncogenesis of the mammary epithelium[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. To confirm the function of CRB3 in mammary epithelial acini formation, we first knocked down the expression of CRB3 by lentiviral shRNA in MCF10A cells (Supplementary Fig. 2A and B). Under the 3D culture system, we found that MCF10A cells infected with no target shRNA lentivirus could form acini after 6 days (D6) and finally formed polarized acini with a hollow lumen at D14 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). However, MCF10A cells, after CRB3 knockdown, formed more number, larger diameter and aberrant acini after D6, and these acini had no lumen (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-D</xref>). Cell proliferation assays of MCF10A cells showed that CRB3 knockdown increased the proliferation rate and accelerated G1 to S phase progression (Supplementary Fig. 2C-E).</p>

<p>Apoptosis and mitotic spindle orientation during lumen formation were further investigated in a 3D culture system. The immunofluorescence (IF) results showed that more internal cleaved-caspase 3-positive acini were observed in the control groups than in the CRB3 knockdown groups at D9 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). CRB3 overexpression significantly promoted apoptosis in breast cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. 2F-H). Similarly, the staining of α-tubulin in mitotic cells exhibited more misorientation of the mitotic spindle in CRB3 knockdown groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F-H</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to verifying the effect of <italic>Crb3</italic> deletion on promoting proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis <italic>in vivo</italic>, these markers were detected in primary tumor tissue from PyMT-WT and PyMT-cKO-Crb3 mice. <italic>Crb3</italic> deletion increased the numbers of proliferative and mitotic cells and decreased the numbers of apoptotic cells in primary tumors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2I</xref>). These results demonstrate that CRB3 could promote the proliferation of mammary epithelial cells, disturb the mitotic spindle orientation, and protect the internal cells from apoptosis during acini formation, finally leading to irregular lumen formation and tumor progression.</p>

<title>CRB3 regulates primary cilium formation</title>
<p>The primary cilium, one of the apical antenna-like extensions in epithelial cells, has been reported to play an important role in controlling lumen formation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. CRB3 knockdown leads to primary cilium loss in MDCK cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], but the molecular mechanism regulating ciliogenesis on apical surfaces is still unclear. Investigating the altered effect of CRB3 on ciliogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, we found that control MCF10A cells formed primary cilia after becoming confluent, while CRB3 knockdown led to significant ciliogenesis defects (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Compared with the control, the number of cells with primary cilium was significantly increased, and the length of the existing primary cilium was not different (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Conversely, CRB3 conditional overexpression, adding doxycycline (+dox), resulted in restoring ciliary assembly in MCF7 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). CRB3 overexpression increased the proportion of primary cilium formation in breast cancer cells, and the length of the restored primary cilium was increased (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Importantly, the primary cilium could be directly visualized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). MCF10A cells with primary cilia were significantly decreased after CRB3 knockdown, while CRB3 conditional overexpression did not increase these populations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>).</p>

<p>To further corroborate these findings <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used breast and kidney tissue to assess ciliogenesis in the <italic>Crb3</italic> knockout mouse model. Renal epithelial cells can form prominent primary cilia, and the absence of primary cilia leads to ciliopathies. We used immunofluorescence to detect ciliary formation in the mammary ductal lumen and renal tubule. Compared with tissues of <italic>Crb3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, <italic>Crb3</italic> knockout led to the absence of primary cilium in the mammary ductal lumen and renal tubule from <italic>Crb3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>; CAG-<italic>Cre</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G, H</xref>). In particular, the proportion of cells forming the primary cilium plummeted (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G, H</xref>). This same phenomenon was also observed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from <italic>Crb3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>; CAG-<italic>Cre</italic> mice (Supplementary Fig. 3A, B). We conclude that CRB3 plays a central role in ciliogenesis in various tissues and mammary cells.</p>

<title>CRB3 localizes to the basal body of the primary cilium</title>
<p>CRB3, a polarity protein, was mostly reported to be localized on the tight junctions of the apical epithelium membrane[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Additionally, we noted that CRB3 could be closely colocalized with centrosomes at prophase, metaphase, and anaphase[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. To investigate the relationship between CRB3 and ciliary formation, we first examined CRB3 localization in MCF10A cells that expressed CRB3-GFP. In MCF10A cells, exogenous CRB3 was mainly localized at cell tight junctions and could colocalize with pericentrin (a centrosome marker) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). And approximately 40% of cells had this co-localization of exogenous CRB3 and pericentrin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). We observed the localization of endogenous CRB3 with another centrosome marker to verify this phenomenon. Similarly, we detected that CRB3 accumulated on one side of the cytoplasm and had a CRB3 focous located at the basal body represented by γ-tubulin in MCF10A cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C, D</xref>). Importantly, CRB3 knockdown disturbed the accumulation of γ-tubulin at the basal body in the confluent quiescence cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). To demonstrate the relationship of this colocalization to the primary cilium, we employed acetylated tubulin to mark the primary cilium. Double immunostaining showed that this CRB3 focous was the basal body of the primary cilium, and CRB3 knockdown inhibited ciliary assembly in MCF10A cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E, F</xref>). These results suggest that CRB3 is located at the basal body of the primary cilium and that CRB3 knockdown disturbs the accumulation of γ-tubulin in quiescent cells.</p>

<title>CRB3 trafficking is mediated by Rab11-positive endosomes</title>
<p>To better investigate the molecular mechanisms of CRB3 in regulating primary cilium formation, we detected a series of genes related to ciliogenesis, including markers of centriole or primary cilium, basal body (BB) components, intraflagellar transport (IFT)-A and IFT-B anterograde transport. However, CRB3 knockdown did not alter the mRNA expression of these genes (Supplementary Fig. 4A). Then, we carried out coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) tandem mass spectrometry using tagged exogenous CRB3 as bait to identify its interacting proteins (Supplementary Fig. 4B). Pathway aggregation analysis of these proteins revealed that these interacting proteins of CRB3 were significantly involved in Golgi vesicle transport and vesicle organization (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). We focused on these pathways because smaller distal appendage vesicle (DAV) formation is critical for ciliogenesis initiation, and it requires the Rab GTPase Rab11-Rab8 cascade to function[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Interestingly, some Rab small GTPase family members identified as CRB3-binding proteins were aggregated in these pathways, such as Rab10, Rab11A, Rab11B, Rab14, Rab1A, Rab1B, Rab21, Rab2A, Rab32, Rab35, Rab38, Rab5B, Rab5C, and Rab6A. Several centriolar proteins were also identified, including tubulin gamma-1, tubulin gamma-2, CENP-E, CEP290, CEP192, CEP295, and CEP162 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p>

<p>Rab11-positive vesicles bind to centrosomal Rabin8, leading to ciliary membrane formation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. This report suggested that the trafficking of Rab11-positive vesicles and polarized vesicles is an essential process for early ciliary assembly. Next, we examined the polarized vesicle traffic of CRB3 in MCF10A cells. Our studies found that CRB3 could colocalize with EEA1-positive early endosomes, CD63-positive late endosomes and Rab11-positive recycling endosomes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). In addition, after 2 hours of treatment with dynasore, an endocytosis inhibitor, CRB3 significantly accumulated at the cytomembrane, and the colocalization of CRB3 with EEA1-, CD63-, and Rab11-positive endosomes was significantly decreased (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C, D</xref>). We have reported that CRB3 expression correlates with the contact-dependent change, which is CRB3 expression reduced considerably in confluent MCF10A cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Then, dynasore could also rescue the CRB3 downregulation induced by the increasing cell density of MCF10A cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). CRB3 knockdown did not affect Rab11 expression (Supplementary Fig. 4C). These results suggest that the intracellular trafficking of CRB3 is mediated by Rab11-positive endosomes at different cell densities.</p>

<title>CRB3 knockdown destabilizes γTuRC assembly during ciliogenesis</title>
<p>According to our findings, we assumed that CRB3 might play an important role in polarized vesicle trafficking. The γ-Tubulin ring complex (γTuRC) is a central regulator of microtubule nucleation and is a nucleation site of α-Tubulin and β-Tubulin at the microtubulecorganizing center in mitotic cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. The primary cilium is a microtubule-based structure attached to the basal body transformed from the mother centriole. As we found that CRB3 knockdown disturbed the accumulation of γ-tubulin, we analyzed γTuRC assembly in ciliogenesis. The γTuRC is composed of multiple copies of the γctubulin small complex (γTuSC), GCP2 and GCP3, plus GCP4, GCP5, and GCP6[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>] (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). CRB3 downregulation did not affect the expression of γTuRC subunits (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>). Then, we performed co-IPs directed against GCP6 in CRB3-depleted cells and assessed the relative levels of both γTuSC-specific proteins compared with the control shRNA-treated cells. Interestingly, CRB3 knockdown significantly reduced the interaction of GCP6 with GCP3 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>). To verify this phenomenon, we observed the localization of GCP3 with GCP6 foci in MCF10A cells. Correspondingly, CRB3 downregulation significantly disturbed the colocalization of GCP3 with GCP6 foci in quiescence cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>). To investigate whether CRB3 facilitate γTuRC assembly, we fractionated MCF10A cytoplasmic proteins on sucrose gradients according to the method published[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. We noticed that γTuSC were regimented mainly in fractions 3 and γTuRC sediment in fractions 6 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5J</xref>). However, CRB3 downregulation caused most of GCP6 and GCP5 to be precipitated independently of γTuRC in the low-density fractions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5J</xref>). Together, these results have established that the depletion of CRB3 interferes with the molecular interactions between the γTuRC proteins, failing microtubule formation in the primary cilium. However, it may not affect the expression of these molecules during γTuRC assembly. According to these results, we hypothesized that CRB3 could mediate the polarized vesicle trafficking of some γTuRC-specific proteins during Rab11-positive endosomes.</p>

<sec id="s2h">
<title>CRB3 directly interacts with Rab11</title>
<p>To fully prove this hypothesis, we first examined CRB3 interaction with Rab11-positive endosome and γTuRC-specific proteins in MCF10A cells. Using CRB3 as bait, we identified that CRB3 could interact with Rab11 instead of GCP6 and GCP3 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). In contrast, Rab11 could interact with CRB3 and GCP6 instead of GCP3 by tagging Rab11 as bait (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). Thus, does CRB3 knockdown affect the trafficking of γTuRC-specific proteins during Rab11-positive vesicles? The co-IP results showed that CRB3 knockdown did not affect Rab11 interacting with GCP6, and the level of Rab11 binding to GCP6 had a tendency to decrease in MCF10A cells with CRB3 knockdown (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). The colocalization rate of Rab11 and GCP6 was significantly decreased in MCF10A cells with CRB3 knockdown (Supplementary Fig. 5A-C). Consistent with other reports[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], Rab11 knockdown significantly inhibited primary cilium formation in MCF10A cells (Supplementary Fig. 5D-F).</p>

<p>Based on these results, we further detected the region of CRB3 interacting with Rab11 by using coexpression and co-IP in HEK293 cells. CRB3 consists of a signal peptide (SP), extracellular domain, transmembrane (TM), FERM-binding domain (FBD), and carboxy-terminal PDZ-binding domain (PBD). Due to the specificity of the C- and N-terminal domains, we constructed CRB3-GFP fusion proteins where GFP tags were fused to the extracellular domain as previously reported[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>] (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). According to these domains, we also constructed the truncations of CRB3-GFP fusion proteins with serial C-terminal deletions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>) and another Flag-Rab11a fusion protein. The coexpression and co-IP results showed that Flag-Rab11a interacted with full-length CRB3 (1-120), CRB3 (1-116), CRB3 (1-83), and CRB3 (1-58) but not CRB3 (1-26) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>). Therefore, the region of CRB3 interacting with Rab11 is amino acids 27 to 58.</p>
<p>Rab11, a small GTP-binding protein, is an essential regulator of the dynamics in recycling endosomes, which are required to undergo GDP/GTP cycles. In particular, Rab11a[S25N] is a GDP-locked form, Rab11a[S20V], and Rab11a[Q70L] is a GTP-locked form[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. To further investigate the GTP-bound form of Rab11a interacting with CRB3, we constructed these mutant variants of Rab11a. Next, we found that the weaker interaction of CRB3 and these mutant variants, Rab11a[Q70L], Rab11a[S20V] and Rab11a[S25N], compared with Rab11aWT, was observed using co-IP analysis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>). Together, these results indicate that CRB3 directly interacts with Rab11a, depending on the GTPase activity of Rab11a.</p>

<title>CRB3 navigates GCP6/Rab11 trafficking vesicles to CEP290 in the primary cilium</title>
<p>Since CRB3 knockdown does not affect the interaction with Rab11-positive endosome and γTuRC-specific proteins GCP6, we wanted to know whether CRB3 affected the localization of GCP6/Rab11 trafficking vesicles to the basal body of the primary cilium. Reviewing the identification of CRB3 interacting proteins, there are some centriolar proteins. CEP290 is located in the transition zone of the primary cilium and is required for the formation of microtubule-membrane linkers[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Then, we verified that exogenous CRB3 could bind to CEP290, Rab11, GCP6 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>), and Rab11 also interacted with CEP290, CRB3-GFP, GCP6 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Similar to <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>, the amount of GCP6 bonded to Rab11 was reduced within CRB3 knockdown. Importantly, CRB3 knockdown showed that Rab11 hardly bonded to CEP290 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). We checked the colocalization of the basal body foci of GCP6 and γ-tubulin, γ-tubulin and Rab11 in MCF10A and MEF cells to corroborate this result. In quiescence control cells, GCP6 foci and γ-tubulin formed a prominent focus at the basal body of the primary cilium, as observed by immunofluorescence. However, CRB3 downregulation eliminated this focus and significantly disturbed the basal body foci of GCP6 and γ-tubulin in MCF10A cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>), and γ-tubulin and Rab11 in MEF cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>). At the beginning of this experiment, we also tried to show the interaction of CRB3, Rab11 and GCP6 with expressing fluorescence tagged GCP6 protein and FRET assay. However, the centrosomal foci of fluorescent GCP6 was difficult to capture because of too weak signal, and this may require re-overexpression of ninein-like protein (Nlp) to promote γTuRC enrichment[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>].</p>

<p>Although CRB3 knockdown had little effect on the formation of GCP6/Rab11 trafficking vesicles, it could significantly inhibit the γTuRC assembly during ciliogenesis, thus affecting the transport of GCP6/Rab11 trafficking vesicles to the basal body of the primary cilium.

<title>CRB3 regulates the Hh and Wnt signaling pathways in tumorigenesis</title>
<p>To examine the role of CRB3 in regulating ciliary assembly in breast cancer, we explored the relationship between CRB3 and the primary cilium in breast cancer tissues.

Consistent with previous findings, CRB3 was localized at the basal body of the primary cilium in adjacent para-carcinoma tissues (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>).

<p>To detect some functional consequences of the absence of the primary cilium, we measured alterations in the Hedgehog (Hh) and Wnt signaling pathways in CRB3-depleted cells. We first detected the translocation of SMO into the primary cilium and the expression of the target gene GLI1. SAG is a potent Smoothened (SMO) receptor agonist that activates the Hh signaling pathway. CRB3 knockdown did not promote the translocation of SMO into the primary cilium in MCF10A cells treated with SAG (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8E</xref>). After SAG treatment, the mRNA expression of GLI1 was significantly decreased in CRB3-depleted cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8F</xref>). Crb3 knockout did not alter the expression or cellular localization in primary tumors from PyMT-cKO-Crb3 mice (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8H</xref>). We have reported that CRB3 expression was high in immortalized mammary epithelial cells while loss of CRB3 expression in breast cancer cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. On the other hand, western blotting results showed that GSK3-β was significantly downregulated after CRB3 knockdown in MCF10A cells. In addition, β-catenin, the major effector of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, was upregulated. CRB3 overexpression resulted in upregulation of GSK3-β and downregulation of β-catenin in breast cancer cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8G</xref>). Visibly, β-catenin was significantly upregulated and markedly localized in the nucleus from PyMT-cKO-Crb3 mice (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8I</xref>). Together, these data suggest that CRB3 knockdown cannot activate the Hh signaling pathway but can activate the Wnt signaling pathway, which is ultimately involved in tumorigenesis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Apical-basal cell polarity is essential for cellular architecture, development and homeostasis in epithelial tissues. Most malignant cancers lack cell polarity because of the unconstrained cell cycle and cell migration with decreased adhesion. CRB3, an important apical protein, is significantly reduced in various tumor cells and tissues and promotes metastasis and tumor formation in nude mice[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Here, we generate a novel transgenic mouse model with conditional deletion of Crb3 to study the role of polarity proteins in tumorigenesis. <italic>Crb3</italic> knockout mice were reported to have cystic kidneys, improper airway clearance in the lung, villus fusion, apical membrane blebs, and disrupted microvilli in intestine airway clearances, which demonstrated that CRB3 is crucial for the development of the apical membrane and epithelial morphogenesis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Importantly, our studies in the <italic>Crb3</italic> knockout mouse model suggest that in addition to death after birth, it is characterized by smaller size, ocular abnormality, bronchial smooth muscle layer defect, reduced pancreatic islets and hyperplasia mammary ductal and renal tubular epithelium (some data not shown). These important phenotypic changes are due to disruption of epithelial polarity homeostasis, which may ultimately lead to tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>In addition, we also found the absence of primary cilia in the mammary ductal lumen and renal tubule in the <italic>Crb3</italic> knockout mouse model. Consistent with other reports, CRB3 knockdown regulated ciliary assembly in MDCK cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, CRB3 was localized in the inner segments of photoreceptor cells and concentrated with the connecting cilium during the whole development of the mouse retina[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. These ocular defect phenotypes remarkably resemble EHD1 knockout mice, which regulate ciliary vesicle formation in primary cilium assembly[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Hence, CRB3 can affect primary cilium formation in various epithelial tissues, such as the breast, kidney, and retina.</p>
<p>Previous literature has reported that CRB3 localizes in the primary cilium in differentiated MDCK cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], but we mainly found that it is not located on the basal body of the primary cilium in mammary epithelial cells. The immunofluorescence results in these literatures showed that CRB3 was scattered on the primary cilia, and had a strong foci at the basal body. Especially in rat kidney collecting ducts, the localization of CRB3 on primary cilia was significantly reduced, while the obvious localization was basal body[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Another literature also reported the co-localization of CRB3 and γ□tubulin in MDCK cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. This result is consistent with our conclusion, and we also verified its co-localization with centrosome by overexpressing CRB3 in mammary epithelial cells, indicating that CRB3 mainly localized to the basal body of the primary cilium. Given that CRB3 also alters primary cilium formation in the mammary epithelium, it is important to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which CRB3 regulates primary cilium formation.</p>
<p>Polarized vesicular traffic plays an important role in extending the primary cilium on apical epithelial surfaces, and the molecular mechanism and relationship to tumorigenesis remain unclear. Here, we reveal that Rab11-positive endosomes mediate the intracellular trafficking of CRB3 and that CRB3 can navigate GCP6/Rab11 trafficking vesicles to CEP290 for correct γTuRC assembly during primary cilium formation. Moreover, in the presence of CRB3, the epithelium can form contact inhibition and an intact primary cilium in quiescence to achieve cellular homeostasis. In contrast, loss of contact inhibition and primary cilium formation with CRB3 deletion can activate the Wnt signaling pathway, affect the Hh signaling pathway, and disrupt the imbalance of this cellular homeostasis, resulting in significant cell proliferation during tumorigenesis (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>).</p>

<caption><p>Schematic model of CRB3 regulating ciliary assembly.</p>
<p>Graphic summary of prominent phenotypes observed after CRB3 deletion. CRB3 is localized on apical epithelial surfaces and participates in tight junction formation to maintain contact inhibition and cell homeostasis in quiescence. Inside the cell, Rab11-positive endosomes mediate the intracellular trafficking of CRB3, and CRB3 navigates GCP6/Rab11 trafficking vesicles to CEP290. Then, GCP6 is involved in normal γTuRC assembly in ciliogenesis. In CRB3 deletion cells, the primary cilium does not assemble properly, and the Wnt signaling pathway is activated through β-catenin upregulation and nuclear localization, but the Hh signaling pathway fails to be activated. This cellular imbalance is disrupted, leading to tumorigenesis. γTuRC, γ-tubulin ring complex; TJ, tight junction; EE, early endosome; LE, late endosome.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>The formation of the primary cilium has been divided into several distinct phases. It begins with the maturation of the mother centriole, also known as a centriole-to-basal-body transition[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. DAVs, which are small cytoplasmic vesicles originating from the Golgi and the recycling endosome, accumulate in the vicinity of distal appendages of the mother centriole[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. Rab8a is localized to cytoplasmic vesicles and the Golgi/trans-Golgi network in growing RPE1 cells, while Rab8-positive vesicles are rapidly redistributed to the mother centriole with binding to Rab11-positive recycling and are endosomes under serum starvation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. The EHD1 protein converts these DAVs to form larger ciliary vesicles, which elongate through continuous fusion with Rab8-positive vesicles to produce the primary cilium membrane[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Thus, Rab11-positive recycling endosomes, as important transporters, are necessary for primary cilium formation and a centriole-basal-body transition in the early phase. Our study found that CRB3 could bind to some Rab small GTPase family members to significantly participate in Golgi vesicle transport and vesicle organization pathways through mass spectrometry identification. And coexpression and co-IP results showed that CRB3 directly interacted with Rab11 via extracellular domain, which mediated the intracellular trafficking of CRB3 within Rab11-positive endosomes at different cell densities.</p>
<p>Unlike motile cilia, primary cilia have only nine outer doublet microtubules without a central pair of microtubules (9+0 structure). Similar to microtubule assembly at microtubulecorganizing centers (MTOCs) during mitosis, γ-tubulin, which is a part of γTuRC, is also concentrated in the basal body of the cilium in interphase[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. γ□Tubulin complexes have been shown to form microtubule templates and regulate microtubule nucleation through longitudinal contacts with α□tubulin and β□tubulin[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. The γTuRC consists of multiple copies of γTuSC, which is composed of two copies of γ□tubulin and one each of GCP2 and GCP3. Then, GCP2 and GCP3 interact with GCP4, GCP5 and GCP6 to form γTuRC[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. Our experiments showed that CRB3 knockdown does not affect the expression of the γTuRC-specific proteins GCP3, GCP6 and γ□tubulin but inhibits the interaction between GCP6 and GCP3, resulting in destabilization of γTuRC. Further analysis revealed significant colocalization between GCP6- and Rab11-positive vesicles at low cell density, while at high cell density, GCP6 accumulated at the centrosome together with GCP3. CRB3 knockdown results in the disappearance of this accumulated GCP6. These results indicated that GCP6/Rab11 trafficking vesicles must be transported to the basal body for ciliogenesis. While it is still unclear how CRB3 interferes with γTuRC assembly during primary cilium formation, we hypothesize that Rab11-positive endosomes mediate the intracellular trafficking of CRB3 and that CRB3, as a navigator interacting with CEP290, can navigate GCP6/Rab11 trafficking vesicles to the transition zone for γTuRC assembly in primary cilium formation.</p>
<p>CEP290 is considered a centriolar or ciliary protein localized to the centrosomes in dividing cells, the distal mother centriole in quiescent cells, and the transition zone in the primary cilium[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. <italic>CEP290</italic> mutations are associated with various diseases, such as the devastating blinding disease Leber’s Congenital Amaurosis (LCA), nephronophthisis, Senior Lǿken syndrome (SLS), Joubert syndrome (JS), Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), and lethal Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MGS)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. In particular, the phenotypes of CEP290-associated ciliopathies are very similar to those in our <italic>Crb3</italic> knockout mouse model, with lethality and ocular and renal abnormalities. CEP290 knockdown significantly decreased the number of cells with primary cilia, and CEP290 knockout mice showed mislocalization of ciliary proteins in the retinas[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. Additionally, the depletion of CEP290 disrupts protein trafficking to centrosomes and affects the recruitment of the BBSome and vesicular trafficking in ciliary assembly[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. Although CEP290 serves as a hub to recruit many ciliary proteins, it has not been reported to be involved in polarized vesicle trafficking or localization. Our study verified that CEP290 could interact with the polarity protein CRB3. CRB3 knockdown disrupts the interaction between CEP290 and Rab11-positive endosomes. Thus, these results validate our hypothesis. Although CRB3 navigates GCP6/Rab11 trafficking vesicles to CEP290, we further need to detect the region of CRB3 interacting with CEP290 and what other cargos are transported by CRB3/Rab11 trafficking vesicles in ciliary assembly.</p>
<p>In addition, our results showed that CRB3 knockdown could not activate the Hh signaling pathway with SAG in MCF10A cells. Under untreated conditions, PTCH1 located at the ciliary membrane inhibits SMO, and Suppressor of Fused (SuFu) sequesters Gli transcription factors, leading to its degradation. SAG can activate the Hh signaling pathway, resulting in dissociation into the nucleus to regulate the expression of downstream target genes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. The Hh signaling pathway mainly regulates cellular growth and differentiation and is abnormal in different types of tumors. Some studies indicate that cilia are double-sided, promoting and preventing cancer development through the Hh signaling pathway <italic>in vivo</italic>. It is thought that cilia deletion could activate SMO to inhibit tumor growth, while promoting carcinogenesis was induced by activated Gli2[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. Although SAG cannot activate the Hh signaling pathway in CRB3-depleted cells, CRB3 regulation of the carcinogenic process through the ciliary Hh signaling pathway still needs further research. In addition, another canonical Wnt signaling pathway was altered after CRB3 knockdown. The Wnt signaling pathway is an important cascade regulating development and stemness, and aberrant Wnt signaling has been reported in many more cancer entities, especially colorectal cancer[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. CRB3 downregulated the expression of β-catenin in our study. Thus, CRB3 can affect cilium-related signaling pathways in tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>In summary, our study provides novel evidence for the apical polarity protein CRB3 in the regulation of viability, mammary and ocular development, and primary cilium formation in germline and conditional knockout mice. CRB3 deletion causes irregular lumen formation and ductal epithelial hyperplasia in mammary epithelial-specific knockout mice. Further study uncovered a new function of CRB3 in directly interacting with Rab11, navigating GCP6/Rab11 trafficking vesicles to CEP290 for γTuRC assembly during ciliogenesis. In addition, CRB3 also participates in regulating cilium-related Hh and Wnt signaling pathways in tumorigenesis. Understanding these polarity protein-mediated vesicle trafficking mechanisms will shed new light on luminal development and tumorigenesis.</p>

<p>The role of CRB3A/B in ciliogenesis was discovered several years ago in epithelial cells and in vivo, but the mechanism by which CRB3A/B regulates ciliogenesis has been unknown. Here, the authors confirm the requirement of CRB3A/B expression for primary ciliogenesis in both mouse and human cells and propose a mechanism by which CRB3A/B promotes ciliogenesis. The results are <bold>useful</bold> but currently <bold>incomplete</bold>: further experimentation and data analysis are needed to support some of the authors' central claims.</p>

<p>In this study the authors first perform global knockout of the gene coding for the polarity protein Crumbs 3 (CRB3) in the mouse and show that this leads to perinatal lethality and anopthalmia. Next, they create a conditional knockout mouse specifically lacking CRB3 in mammary gland epithelial cells and show that this leads to ductal epithelial hyperplasia, impaired branching morphogenesis and tumorigenesis. To study the mechanism by which CRB3 affects mammary epithelial development and morphogenesis, the authors turn to MCF10A cells and find that CRB3 shRNA-mediated knockdown in these cells impairs their ability to form properly polarized acini in 3D cultures. Furthermore, they find that MCF10A cells lacking CRB3 display reduced primary ciliation frequency compared to control cells, which is in agreement with previous studies implicating CRB3 in primary cilia biogenesis. Using a combination of biochemical, molecular- and imaging approaches the authors then provid evidence indicating that CRB3 promotes ciliogenesis by mediating Rab11-dependent recruitment of gamma tubulin ring complex component GCP6 to the centrosome/ciliary base, and they also show that CRB3 itself is localized to the base of primary cilia. Finally, to assess the functional consequences of CRB3 loss on ciliary signaling function, the authors analyze the effect of CRB3 loss on Hedgehog and Wnt signaling using cell-based assays or a mouse model.</p>
<p>Overall, the described findings are interesting and in agreement with previous studies showing an involvement of CRB3 in epithelial cell biology, tumorigenesis and ciliogenesis. The results showing a role for CRB3 in mammary epithelial development and morphogenesis in vivo seem convincing. However, a major weakness of this study is that quantitative analysis of several key results is either lacking, not done appropriately, or is incompletely described. In addition, some of the cell-based experiments are lacking appropriate controls, and the claim that CRB3 directly binds to Rab11 is not supported by the data provided.</p>

<p>In this work, the authors investigate the role of CRB3 in the formation of the primary cilium both in a mouse model and in human cells. They confirm in a conditional knock-out (KO) mouse model that Crb3 is necessary for the formation of the primary cilium in mammary and renal epithelial tissues and the new-born mice exhibit classical traits of ciliopathies. In the mouse mammary gland, the absence of Crb3 induces hyperplasia and tumorigenesis and in the human mammary tumor cells MCF10A the knock-down (KD) of CBR3 impairs ciliogenesis and the formation of a lumen in 3D-cultures with less apoptosis and spindle orientation defects during cell division.</p>
<p>To determine the subcellular localization of CRB3 the authors have expressed exogenously a GFP-CRB3 in MCF10A and found that this tagged protein localizes in cell-cell junctions and around pericentrin, a centrosome marker, while endogenous CRB3 localizes at the basal body. To dissect the molecular role of CRB3 the authors have performed proteomic analyses after a pull-down assay with the exogenous tagged-CRB3 and found that CRB3 interacts with Rab11 and is present in the endosomal recycling pathway. CRB3 KD also decreases the interactions between components of the γTuRC complex. In addition, the authors showed that CRB3 interacts with a tagged-Rab11 by its extracellular domain and that CRB3 promotes the interaction between Rab11 and CEP290 while CRB3 KD decreased the co-localization of GCP6 with Rab11 and γTub. Finally, the authors showed that CRB3 depletion cannot activate the Hh pathway as opposed to the Wnt pathway.</p>
