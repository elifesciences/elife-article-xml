<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system is a hallmark of aging. The cellular mechanisms behind this overactivity remain poorly understood, with most attention paid to likely central nervous system components. In this work, we hypothesized that aging also affects the function of motor neurons in the peripheral sympathetic ganglia. To test this hypothesis, we compared the electrophysiological responses and ion-channel activity of neurons isolated from the superior cervical ganglia of young (12 weeks), middle-aged (64 weeks), and old (115 weeks) mice. These approaches showed that aging does impact the intrinsic properties of sympathetic motor neurons, increasing spontaneous and evoked firing responses. A reduction of M current emerged as a major contributor to age-related hyperexcitability. Thus, it is essential to consider the effect of aging on motor components of the sympathetic reflex as a crucial part of the mechanism involved in sympathetic overactivity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This study focuses on the mechanisms underlying the deterioration of the sympathetic nervous system as we age. With advancing age, the sympathetic nervous system tends to become overactive, evidenced by increased electrical activity in sympathetic nerves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hart et al. (2009)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ito et al. (1986)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Narkiewicz et al. (2005)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wallin et al. (1974)</xref>. This overactivity, observed in humans and animal models, leads to heightened release of norepinephrine over organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Esler et al. (1995)</xref>; Goldstein et al. (1983a,b); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Veith et al. (1986)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Ziegler et al. (1976)</xref>, triggering compensatory processes and cellular deterioration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hogikyan and Supiano (1994)</xref>. Understanding the physiology and pathophysiology of this age-associated overactivity is crucial, as many common age-driven diseases are linked to sympathetic overactivity. For instance, dysregulation of norepinephrine release is associated with age-related hypertension and arrhythmias. However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying the overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system remain to be elucidated.</p>
<p>During execution of sympathetic reflexes, three essential cellular components of the nervous system come into play: sensory neurons for detecting and transmitting signals of internal conditions, neurons of the sympathetic nuclei in the brain for integrating information and responding to internal changes, and the sympathetic motor neurons in the ganglia for receiving and delivering information to target organs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Age-associated overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system has been predominantly ascribed to changes in the central system, specifically focusing on the hypothalamic and brainstem nuclei. In the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, the activation of glutamatergic neurons through leptin pathways has emerged as a significant contributor to sympathetic overactivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shi et al. (2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">2020</xref>). At the same time, glial senescence and subsequent inflammatory mechanisms in brainstem nuclei also have been linked to sympathetic nervous system overactivity during aging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Balasubramanian et al. (2021)</xref>. However, one key question remains: Is age-related sympathetic overactivity limited solely to changes in the central system?</p>

<p>Aging impacts the morphology and calcium responses of sympathetic motor neurons, the peripheral component of the sympathetic reflex. Notably, sympathetic innervation to the spleen and lymph nodes reduces, while thymus innervation increases with age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Madden et al. (1997)</xref>. Similarly, innervation to vascular smooth muscle changes with age, and the extent and implications of these changes depend on the specific target and neuropeptide content <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Andrews et al. (1996)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Andrews and Cowen (1994)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Burnstock (1990)</xref>. Additionally, aging affects the function of sympathetic motor neurons, as evidenced by altered calcium responses. Old sympathetic motor neurons display reduced expression of SERCA pumps, an essential component for calcium transport into the endoplasmic reticulum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Buchholz et al. (2007)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Pottorf et al. (2000)</xref>. The results of these experiments suggest that aging has a distinct influence on the intrinsic function of sympathetic motor neurons, irrespective of any changes in the central system. As a result, the main objective of our study was to examine directly the impact of aging on the intrinsic membrane electrical properties of sympathetic motor neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Our work was structured around three main objectives: 1) To standardize the isolation of sympathetic motor neurons from adult to old age in mice, 2) To compare the spontaneous and evoked electrical activity of sympathetic motor neurons at three life stages, 3) To identify potential molecular candidates underlying the observed altered electric properties and neuronal activity.</p>

<title>Sympathetic motor neurons from old mice are healthy in culture</title>
<p>Our first goal was to assess the viability of neurons isolated from young adult and old mice. We isolated sympathetic motor neurons enzymatically from the left and right superior cervical ganglia (SCG) of young adults (12 weeks old) and old animals (115 weeks old, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The same enzymatic digestion was used for both ages. Single neurons exhibited no visible neurite growth before 18 hours (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, left); however, after 72 hours in culture, both young and old sympathetic motor neurons showed evident neurite growth (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, right). The mean diameter of the cell soma was found to be similar in young (19.7 Â± 0.6 Âµm) and old (19.6 Â± 0.6 Âµm) neurons after 24 and 72 hours in culture (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). The dendritic arborization after 24 hours in culture was comparable between young (37 Â± 2 Âµm<sup>2</sup>) and old (42 Â± 3 Âµm<sup>2</sup>) neurons. However, after 72 hours in culture, the dendritic arborization in old neurons (105 Â± 7 Âµm<sup>2</sup>) was more extensive compared to that of young neurons (74 Â± 5 Âµm<sup>2</sup>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). We continued the culture for seven days and noted that the neurites grew until they contacted other neurons in the same dish. Furthermore, glial cells became apparent at this stage in cultures of young and old cells. The ability of neurons to regenerate neurites and contact each other was considered an indicator of viability and health. We ruled out the possibility that any functional differences between neurons from animals of different ages were due to potential damage to old neurons during the isolation and culture process. From now on, we report electrical measurements on neurons that had been incubated for approximately just 12-18 h after isolation.</p>

<title>Old sympathetic motor neurons fire action potentials spontaneously</title>
<p>To investigate whether aging alters the function of sympathetic motor neurons, we first compared the spontaneous activity and passive electrical properties of neurons isolated from mice at different ages: 12 weeks (young), 64 weeks (middle age), and 115 weeks (old). For reference, we also provide comparable human ages (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Spontaneous activity was recorded using the current clamp modality without applying any holding or current stimulus. Electrical access to the cell was obtained using the perforated patch technique (See Methods for details). Young neurons had a resting membrane potential (RMP) of -64 Â± 1 mV and very little spontaneous activity, which aligns with the expected behavior of motor neurons that respond to presynaptic commands (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B-C</xref>). Only 3% exhibited spontaneous firing (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). In contrast, middle-aged neurons showed an RMP of -58 Â± 1 mV, and 37% of these neurons displayed spontaneous firing (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B-D</xref>). The depolarized RMP and the increased number of neurons spontaneously firing persisted in old neurons, where the RMP was -54 Â± 1 mV and 58% of neurons exhibited spontaneous firing (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B-D</xref>). Despite the higher percentage of old neurons firing spontaneously compared to middle-aged neurons, the mean firing frequency in old neurons (60 Â± 20 action potentials (APs)/minute) was significantly lower than that observed in middle-aged neurons (177 Â± 41 APs/minute; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>We measured the input resistance, another passive membrane property, in cells polarized to a potential of -65 mV by injecting a negative holding current that did not exceed -50 pA. Cells requiring larger holding currents were excluded. From the response to additional negative current pulses (-40 to 0 pA, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>) we calculated the input resistance (ÎV/injected current). At these membrane potentials, without activation of voltage-activated ion channels, the change in voltage is proportional to the injected current. Input resistance was not affected by age. Young adult neurons (0.8 Â± 0.09 Gâ¦), middle-aged neurons (1.1 Â± 0.06 Gâ¦), and old neurons (1.1 Â± 0.11 Gâ¦) exhibited similar input resistance (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). In conclusion, our findings suggest that aging leads to a gradual depolarization of the RMP without significant alteration of the input resistance.</p>

<title>Sympathetic motor neurons from old mice are more responsive to electrical stimulation</title>
<p>During sympathetic reflexes, the peripheral motor neurons increase their firing frequency in response to commands from the central sympathetic nuclei. These commands can be mimicked as direct electrical stimulation, as shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>. To test whether aging increases the sensitivity of sympathetic motor neurons to electrical stimulation, neurons were injected with 1-second current steps of amplitude ranging from 10 pA to 100 pA starting from a potential of -65 mV (â0 pA currentâ) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Young neurons exhibited a characteristic firing pattern demonstrated in the left panel of <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>. With injections of 10 pA, no AP was elicited (red trace), and with a 40 pA stimulus lasting 1 second, only one AP was evoked (black trace), illustrating the phenomenon known as spike adaptation that is typical of young sympathetic motor neurons. In contrast, both middle-aged and old neurons displayed a different response. A 10 pA stimulus was sufficient to elicit APs in middle-aged and old neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D-E</xref>), and in middle-aged neurons, the 40 pA stimulus induced the firing of eleven APs in a typical example (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), and similarly, in old neurons, it led to the firing of ten APs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess the impact of age on the excitability of sympathetic motor neurons in a population sample, we compared stimulus-response curves, rheobase values (minimum current needed to elicit at least one AP), and the number of APs elicited with the maximum stimulus. Our results revealed that middle-aged and old neurons fired more APs with each stimulus (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>) than young neurons. Older neurons exhibited a reduced threshold for eliciting APs (64 weeks: 20 Â± 2 pA; 115 weeks: 23 Â± 5 pA) compared to young neurons (34 Â± 4 pA, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). Furthermore, older neurons fired more APs with a 100 pA current injection (64 weeks: 15 Â± 1 APs; 115 weeks: 15 Â± 2 APs) compared to young neurons (12 weeks: 7 Â± 1 APs, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). These findings support the concept that aging leads to increased excitability of sympathetic motor neurons.</p>

<title>Analysis of neuronal subpopulations</title>
<p>Sympathetic motor neurons display stereotyped distinct repetitive firing patterns, which classify them into three categories: tonic (Class I), phasic (Class II), and adapting (Class III) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kim et al. (2019)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Malin and Nerbonne (2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">2001</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Springer et al. (2015)</xref>. In our experiments, we classified cells based on their responses to a supra-threshold current injection (20 pA above their rheobase), ensuring that the firing response was not saturated. Representative traces of firing patterns from middle-aged neurons are illustrated in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>. The increased number of APs at maximal stimulus compared with 20 pA above the rheobase, shows that the firing response was not saturated during classification (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). In agreement with previous reports, subpopulations showed differences in frequency-stimulus curves (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Also, tonic cells have a more depolarized RMP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref> left, tonic = -53 Â± 2 mV, phasic = -61 Â± 1 mV, adapting = -60 Â± 2 mV), while adapting neurons have a lower input resistance (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref> right, tonic = 1.13 Â± 0.08 Gâ¦, Phasic = 1.16 Â± 0.09 Gâ¦, Adapting = 0.55 Â± 0.18 Gâ¦). Tonic cells were also more spontaneously active (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref> middle). In general, the responses from the three neuronal subpopulations are consistent with previous reports.</p>
<p>Next, we examined the effect of aging on neuronal subpopulations. We observed an altered subtype distribution in older neurons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>, p-value &lt; 0.0001 using a contingency table and Chi-square/Fisher test). The percentage of adapting neurons decreased in middle age (10%) and old (12%) compared to young (29%). The percentage of phasic neurons decreased only in old (42%) compared to middle-aged (56%) and young (55%) neurons. Accordingly, the percentage of tonic neurons increased in middle-aged (34%) and old (46%) compared to young (19%) neurons. These findings highlight how aging impacts the distribution of firing subtypes in sympathetic motor neurons.</p>
<p>While age does impact the distribution of firing subtypes, the question remains whether intrinsic properties are affected within each subpopulation across different ages. Therefore, we analyzed the intrinsic properties across subpopulations between different age groups. The RMP of adapting and phasic firing neurons was more depolarized in middle age and old compared to young neurons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). The RMP of tonic neurons tended to become more depolarized with age, but the effect was not significant (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Similar to the observation when the entire population was analyzed, the input resistance was not significantly different with age within phasic and adapting neurons. The input resistance of tonic neurons was significantly larger only in old (1.44 Â± 0.16 Gâ¦) neurons compared to young (0.93 Â± 0.16 Gâ¦) neurons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). This analysis suggested that, regardless of the subpopulation type, older neurons tend to have more depolarized RMP with no changes in input resistance.</p>

<p>Interestingly, aging leads to an increase in the number of spontaneous APs in phasic and tonic neurons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>). In the phasic class, middle-aged neurons fired 3 Â± 2 APs per minute and old neurons fired 5 Â± 3 APs, compared to zero APs in phasic young neurons. In the tonic class, middle-aged neurons fired 179 Â± 46 APs and old neurons fired 86 Â± 27 APs, in striking contrast to zero APs in tonic young neurons. Next, we compared the maximum number of APs elicited by the strongest stimulus (100 pA, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>). In phasic neurons, the number of APs at 100 pA increased by 53% in middle age (9.5 Â± 1.0 APs) and 133% in old (14.5 Â± 2.1 APs) compared to young neurons (6.2 Â± 1.0 APs). In tonic firing neurons, the number of APs at 100 pA increased by 36% in middle age (25 Â± 1.4 APs) and 27% in old (24.1 Â± 1.0 AP) compared to young neurons (19.0 Â± 1.9 APs).</p>
<p>We conclude that the changes observed when categorizing neuronal classes occur across the entire population. In addition, aging is associated with a shift in the proportion of neurons falling in each class. As a result, we hypothesized that the underlying age-related molecular mechanism is broadly shared among sympathetic motor neurons and plays a role in controlling the firing frequency.</p>

<title>Aging reduces M current</title>
<p>We next directed our attention to identifying molecular candidates underlying changes in membrane excitability. Sympathetic motor neurons express at least one voltage-gated sodium channel isoform (Na<sub>V</sub>1.7) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Schofield et al. (2008)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Toledo-Aral et al.

Specifically, K<sub>V</sub>4, K<sub>V</sub>2, and K<sub>V</sub>7 (KCNQ) channels are crucial in controlling the RMP, rheobase, firing frequency, and spike adaptation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Liu and Bean (2014)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Malin and Nerbonne (2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">2001</xref>). These channels are of particular interest as potential contributors to the age-related alterations in neuronal excitability that we observed.</p>
<p>Previous work by our group and others demonstrated that cholinergic stimulation leads to a decrease in M current and increases the excitability of sympathetic motor neurons at young ages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brown and Adams (1980)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brown et al.

The molecular determinants of the M current are channels formed by KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 in these neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wang et al. (1998)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Selyanko et al. (2000)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Shapiro et al. (2000)</xref>. Thus, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref> shows a voltage response (measured in current-clamp mode) and a consecutive M current recording (measured in voltage-clamp mode) in the same neuron upon stimulation of Gq-coupled M1 mAChRs. It illustrates the temporal correlation between the decrease of M current with the increase in excitability and firing of APs. This strong dependence led us to hypothesize that aging decreases M current, leading to a depolarized RMP and hyperexcitability (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). For these experiments, we measured the RMP and evoked activity using perforated patch, followed by the amplitude of M current using a whole-cell voltage clamp in the same cell. We also measured the membrane capacitance as a proxy for cell size. Interestingly, M current density was smaller by 29% in middle age (7.5 Â± 0.7 pA/pF) and by 55% in old (4.8 Â± 0.7 pA/pF) compared to young (10.6 Â± 1.5 pA/pF) neurons (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C-D</xref>). The average capacitance was similar in young (30.8 Â± 2.2 pF), middle-aged (27.4 Â± 1.2 pF), and old (28.8 Â± 2.3 pF) neurons (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>), suggesting that aging is not associated with changes in cell size of sympathetic motor neurons, and supporting the hypothesis that aging alters the levels of M current. Next, we tested the effect on the abundance of the channels mediating M current. Contrary to our expectation, we observed that KCNQ2 protein levels were 1.5 Â± 0.1 -fold higher in old compared to young neurons (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F-G</xref>). Unfortunately, we did not find an antibody to detect consistently KCNQ3 channels. We concluded that the decrease in M current is not caused by a decrease in the abundance of KCNQ2 protein.</p>
<p>To explore the hypothesis that a reduction in M current is responsible for the age-associated depolarization of the RMP, we compared these two parameters measured in the same cells. We observed a correlation between M current and RMP in young (coefficient of determination (r2) = 0.22, p-value for the correlation fit = 0.007, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6K</xref>) and middle-aged neurons (r2 = 0.20, p-value for the correlation fit = 0.002, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6K</xref>). In old neurons, the M current and RMP were no longer correlated (r2 = 0.05, p-value for the correlation fit = 0.1, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6J</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6K</xref>). <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6K</xref> shows the decrease in the coefficient of determination (r2) with aging. Similarly, the M current amplitude also correlated well with the number of APs elicited at 100 pA in young and middle-aged neurons but not in old ones. The variance in M current amplitude explained 32% of the variation in the number of APs in young (r2 = 0.32, p-value for the correlation fit = 0.001, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6L</xref>) and 24% in middle-aged neurons (r2 = 0.24, p-value for the correlation fit =0.0001, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6M</xref>). In old neurons, the variance in M current amplitude explained only 0.05% of the variation in the number of APs (r2 = 0.05, p-value for the correlation fit = 0.15, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6N</xref>). <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6O</xref> shows the decrease in the coefficient of determination with aging for the number of APs. These analyses support the hypothesis that a reduction in M current alters the electrical properties, and in the case of old neurons, the marked decrease in M current compromises its role in maintaining the RMP and spontaneous firing.</p>

Therefore, we also looked for potential age-associated changes in other voltage-gated potassium currents.

This recording solution contained 100 nM tetrodotoxin (TTX) to suppress voltage-gated sodium channels, 100 ÂµM Cd<sup>2+</sup> to inhibit calcium channels and 10 ÂµM XE-991 to block KCNQ channels. Next, we compared the outward current density before and after application of a cocktail of 100 nM phiroxotoxin and 100 nM guangxitoxin to block K<sub>V</sub>4 and K<sub>V</sub>2 channels. <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A and C</xref> show representative traces and the comparison of the current density between young and old neurons.

<title>Pharmacological inhibition of KCNQ channels mimics aged phenotype while pharmacological activation of KCNQ channels mimics young phenotype</title>
<p>To further test the hypothesis that the decrease of M current is responsible for the hyperexcited state in old neurons, we used a pharmacological approach targeting KCNQ channels and assessed whether the age-dependent phenotype could be mimicked or reversed. To inhibit KCNQ channels, we used linopirdine at a concentration of 25 ÂµM. Linopirdine inhibits both KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 channels with an IC<sub>50</sub> of around 5 ÂµM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Attali et al. (2023)</xref> and with an inhibition time constant of around 3 s at negative potentials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Greene et al. (2017)</xref>. In the presence of linopirdine, the resting membrane potential of young neurons became less negative, from -64.3 Â± 5.1 mV to -50.4 Â± 5.1 mV on average. In 5 out of 8 cases, neurons that were not firing started firing after washing linopirdine into the bath (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A and B</xref>).</p>
<p>Conversely, we used retigabine at a concentration of 10 ÂµM to increase M current. This is achieved as retigabine induces both a negative shift in the voltage-dependence of activation and a voltage-independent increase in the open probability of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 channels. Retigabine activates KCNQ2 with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 2.5 ÂµM and KCNQ3 with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 600 nM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Attali et al. (2023)</xref>. The onset of its action takes about 3 minutes, according to information provided by the manufacturer. In the presence of retigabine, the resting membrane potential of old neurons became more negative, from -49.9 Â± 3.8 mV to -74.7 Â± 3.0 mV on average. Aged neurons that were firing action potentials stopped firing after the activation of KCNQ channels, and some of these fired again after washing out the drug (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C and D</xref>). In fact, the resting membrane potential became more positive (-58.2 Â± 2 mV) after removal of retigabine. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that a reduction of KCNQ channel activity is responsible for the hyperexcitability of sympathetic motor neurons in aged animals.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This research investigates the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying age-associated sympathetic overactivity. Our results support the idea that, alongside age-related central changes, the peripheral component of the sympathetic autonomic reflex is also affected by aging. Key findings are that aging influences the intrinsic membrane properties of sympathetic motor neurons in the following ways: 1) older motor neurons exhibit a more positive RMP and increased rheobase, 2) the percentage of motor neurons displaying spontaneous activity increases with age, 3) older motor neurons respond with higher firing rates to electrical stimulation, 4) older motor neurons show a predominant tonic firing subpopulation, 5) older neurons exhibit reduced M current, 6) spontaneous activity in aged neurons can be reversed using pharmacological activation of KCNQ2/3 channels.</p>

<title>Age-related changes in neuronal excitability</title>
<p>The decline in nervous system function during healthy aging has been attributed to alterations in the intrinsic membrane properties of neurons and glial cells (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These changes in electrical behavior have been observed in various experimental models, ranging from simple organisms like C. elegans and Drosophila to more complex ones like rodents and monkeys. Notably, age-related hyperexcitability has emerged as a predominant characteristic in neurons across different brain regions (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Research on this topic has emphasized the central nervous system. However, recent evidence suggests that aging also impacts the intrinsic properties of peripheral sensory neurons leading to hyperexcitability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hanani et al. (2023)</xref>. In line with this observation, our research reveals increased excitability in old sympathetic motor neurons. Collectively, these findings underscore that aging affects the intrinsic properties of peripheral neurons, challenging the notion that age-related changes are limited to the central nervous system. Hence, it is crucial to reconsider our understanding of aging-related sympathetic overactivity with a holistic perspective. Investigating how aging affects the intrinsic properties of sensory, central, and sympathetic motor neurons throughout a lifetime will be essential research to comprehend the underlying cause-and-effect mechanisms.</p>

<title>The molecular mechanism underlying the age-related excitability changes</title>
<p>The expression, distribution, regulation, and function of ion channels play a pivotal role in determining the intrinsic membrane properties of neurons. The mechanism underlying changes in age-associated excitability encompass alterations in cholinergic and glutamatergic responses and the function and expression of voltage-gated ion channels, such as Ca<sub>V</sub>, K<sub>V</sub>, and HCN. In recent years, research on aging has revealed a significant impact of ion channels in the aging process. For example, repressing glutamate-gated chloride channels and L-type channels extends longevity in C. elegans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zullo et al. (2019)</xref>. Furthermore, inhibiting A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels has shown the potential to revert the intrinsic excitability of aged CA3 pyramidal neurons to a young-like state in rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Simkin et al. (2015)</xref>.</p>
<p>Our data show a decrease in M current and suggest that it is a key mechanism behind the development of a more depolarized resting membrane potential and hyperexcitability in old sympathetic motor neurons. Work done in other systems has also underscored the importance of M current in the development of age-associated neuronal dysfunction. In Drosophila, aging is associated with reduced M expression in the brain, while KCNQ overexpression in mushroom body neurons reverses age-related memory impairment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cavaliere et al. (2013)</xref>. Similarly, in macaques, blocking KCNQ channels partially restores memory-related firing of aged neurons to more youthful levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Wang et al. (2011)</xref>. Recent findings by Li et al. demonstrate that aged hypocretin/orexin neurons exhibit hyperexcitability with lower KCNQ expression. Their study shows that selectively disrupting <italic>Kcnq2/3</italic> genes in young hypocretin neurons is sufficient to depolarize these neurons and cause sleep fragmentation, mimicking the sleep instability observed in aged mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Li et al. (2022)</xref>. In our work, we also analyzed the effect of aging on other currents without seeing significant differences, suggesting that KCNQ channels are particularly susceptible to a process occurring during aging.</p>
<p>In our study, we found a reduction in M current but an increase in KCNQ2 channel abundance; why? We speculate the increase in KCNQ2 abundance is a compensatory mechanism that does not achieve to restore the function of the cell. This experiment assessed total protein abundance, which includes synthesized protein in traffic and inserted at the plasma membrane. Our experiments did not investigate the abundance of KCNQ2/3 channels only in the plasma membrane. Multiple mechanisms, independent from increased synthesis, could underlie a reduction in M current including alterations in traffic, insertion, posttranslational modifications, and cofactors of KCNQ2 or KCNQ3 channels. This mechanism remains elusive and open for exploration.</p>

<title>Limitations and Conclusion</title>
<p>We want to point out that linopirdine has been reported to affect other ionic currents besides M current <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Neacsu and Babes (2010)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lamas et al. (1997)</xref>. Despite this limitation, the application of linopirdine to young sympathetic motor neurons led to depolarization and firing of action potentials.</p>
<p>The hypothesis of age-associated hyperexcitability of sympathetic motor neurons should be tested in the neurons of other sympathetic ganglia, including the stellate and celiac. While our study allowed us to determine the effect of aging on sympathetic neurons in isolation from other components of the sympathetic reflex, it did not provide insight into whether the hyperexcitability of motor neurons is a compensatory mechanism responding to earlier changes in the brain or target tissues. This question has posed a long-standing challenge, especially in various pathologies where sympathetic overactivity, such as arrhythmias and hypertension, play a role. In such cases, sympathetic overactivity could result from deterioration in the target organs or sensory components, such as the heart and carotid body. Further research and exploration are needed to unravel these complex interactions and establish a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying age-related changes in the sympathetic nervous system.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates that aging directly impacts the intrinsic electrical properties of sympathetic motor neurons. Furthermore, our research postulates that the decrease in KCNQ function underlies the hyperexcitability of sympathetic motor neurons. These findings shed light on the mechanisms involved in age-related changes within the sympathetic nervous system and offer a promising avenue for further investigation and potential intervention.</p>

<title>Animal Models</title>
<p>Male C57BL/6 WT mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (12 weeks, RRID:IMSR_JAX: 000664) or obtained from the NIA-NIH colony (ages 64 weeks and 115 weeks). All animals were kept in an animal facility with controlled conditions and were given standard chow and water ad libitum. The animal handling protocol was approved by the University of Washington Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p>

<title>Sympathetic motor neuron cell culture</title>
<p>Neurons from superior cervical ganglia (SCG) were prepared by enzymatic digestion following a standardized protocol for rats Vivas et al. (2014b) but reducing the enzyme concentration in half. Isolated neurons were plated on poly-L-lysine (#Cat: P1524-25MG, Sigma) coated glass coverslips and incubated in 5% CO2 at 37Â°C in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.2% penicillin/streptomycin.</p>

<title>Imaging of neurite growth</title>
<p>Cells were imaged in culture medium at 24 and 72 h and one week after isolation for neurites analysis. Images were taken using the bright field of an LSM 880 confocal microscope (Zeiss).</p>

<title>Electrophysiological Recordings</title>
<p>Voltage responses were recorded using the perforated-patch configuration in the current-clamp mode, whereas M currents were recorded using the whole-cell configuration in voltage-clamp mode. We used an Axopatch 200B amplifier coupled with an Axon Digidata 1550B data acquisition board (Molecular Devices Electrophysiology) and HEKA EPC 9 amplifier (HEKA Elektronik) to acquire the electrical signals. Patch pipettes had a resistance of 2 â 4 Mâ¦. A liquid junction potential of 4 mV was calculated using the pCLAMP 10 software and not corrected while recording. Instead, V<sub>rest</sub> reported in the Results section was corrected during analysis. Voltage responses were sampled at 5 KHz, whereas currents were sampled at 2 KHz. For current recordings in voltage clamp mode, cell capacitance was canceled, and series resistances of &lt;10 Mâ¦were compensated by 70%. The voltage error due to any remaining series resistance is expected to be &lt;4 mV. The bath solution (Ringerâs solution) contained 150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES, and 8 mM glucose, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. The internal solution used to fill the whole-cell pipettes contained 175 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM HEPES, 0.1 mM K<sub>4</sub>BAPTA, 3 mM Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, and 0.1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>GTP, adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH. For current-clamp recordings by perforated patch, 60 amphotericin B (Cat #: A4888) was added to the pipette solution to facilitate electrical access to the cell. The bath solution was perfused at 2 ml/minute, permitting solution exchange surrounding the recording cell with a time constant of 4 s. Sodium currents were recorded 2-8 h after isolation using a low-sodium ringer.</p>

<title>Protein extraction and abundance determination</title>
<p>Protein from sympathetic ganglia was harvested in RIPA buffer (#89900, Thermo Scientific) with Complete, Mini, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (#11836170001, Roche) for 15 min at 4Â°C. Post-nuclear supernatant was isolated by centrifuging for 20 minutes at 13,600 g at 4Â°C. Protein concentration was quantified on a plate reader using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit (#23225, Thermo Scientific). Gel lanes were loaded with 30 Âµg of total protein. Protein samples were resolved in 4-12% Bis-Tris gels under reducing conditions. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (0.2 Âµm; #LC2000, Life Technologies) using the Mini-Bolt system (#A25977, Thermo Scientific). Membranes were blotted using rabbit anti-KCNQ2 (ab22897, Abcam, RRID: AB_775890, 1:500). Blotted bands were detected using HRP conjugated secondary antibodies goat anti-rabbit conjugated with HRP (#1706515, Bio-Rad, 1:15, 000). ImageJ was used to calculate the fluorescence density of each band. The abundance of KCNQ2 was reported as normalized to total protein and relative to the abundance in tissue from young animals.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study describes changes in excitability in motor neurons of the peripheral autonomous nervous system during aging. The manuscript provides <bold>convincing</bold> evidence indicating that sympathetic neurons from aged mice show higher excitability compared to neurons from young mice which was linked to decreased activity of KCNQ2/3 potassium channels. This research has implications for understanding the age-related changes that occur in the peripheral nervous system.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors study age-related changes in the excitability and firing properties of sympathetic neurons, which they ascribe to age-related changes in the expression of KCNQ (Kv7, &quot;M-type&quot;) K+ currents in rodent sympathetic neurons, whose regulation by GPCRs has been most thoroughly studied for over 40 years.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strengths include the rigor of the current-clamp and voltage-clamp experiments and the lovely, crisp presentation of the data, The separation of neurons into tonic, phasic and adapting classes is also interesting, and informative. The ability to successfully isolate and dissociate peripheral ganglia from such older animals is also quite rare and commendable! There is much useful detail here.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Whereas the description of the data are very nice, and useful, the manuscript does not provide much in the way of mechanistic insights. As such, the effect is more of an epi-phenomenon of unclear insight, and the authors cannot ascribe changes in signaling mechanisms, such as that of M1 mAChRs to the phenomena that is supported by data.</p>
<p>Comments on latest version:</p>
<p>I do not have any additional issues to be addressed by the authors.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This research provides compelling and detailed evidence showing that aging influences intrinsic membrane properties of peripheral sympathetic motor neurons, which become hyperexcitable. The authors found that sympathetic motor neurons from old mice exhibit increased firing rates (spontaneous and evoked), more depolarized membrane resting potential, and increased rheobase. Furthermore, the study investigates cellular mechanisms underlying age-associated hyperexcitability and shows solid evidence supporting that a decreased activity of KCNQ2/3 channels during aging is a major contributor to the increased excitability of sympathetic old neurons. The conclusions of this paper are supported by the data.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Detailed and rigorous analysis of electrical responses of peripheral sympathetic motor neurons using electrophysiology (perforated patch and whole-cell recordings). The study identifies a decreased KCNQ2/3 current as a cellular mechanism behind age-induced hyperexcitability in sympathetic motor neurons.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The revised version of the manuscript has addressed all my concerns.</p>

<p>This revised study described changes in membrane excitability and Na+ and K+ current amplitudes of sympathetic motor neurons in culture. The findings indicate that neurons isolated from aged animals show increased membrane excitability manifested as increased firing rates in response to electrical stimulation and changes in related membrane properties including depolarized resting membrane potential, increased rheobase, and spontaneous firing. By contrast, neuron cultures from young mice show little to no spontaneous firing and relatively low firing rates in response to current injection. These changes in excitability correlate with reductions in the magnitude of KCNQ currents in neurons cultured from aged mice compared to neurons from cultured from young mice. The authors conclude that aging promotes hyperexcitability of sympathetic motor neurons through changes in KCNQ channels.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors</bold>:</p>
<p>Please make corrections as suggested by reviewer 1 to improve the manuscript. Specifically, reviewer 1 suggests making changes to p values in Figure 5, and the importance of citing original scholarly works related to effects of increase in excitability of sympathetic neurons by M1 receptors, and the terminology for M currents and KCNQ currents. These changes will improve the manuscript and are strongly recommended.</p>
<p>The section dealing with Aging Reduces KCNQ currents seems to contain a lot of extraneous information especially in the last part of the long paragraph and this section should be rewritten for improved clarity and - the implications or lack thereof - of the correlation of KCNQ with AP firing rates. The apparent lack of correlation between KCNQ current and KCNQ2 protein needs to be better explained. This is a central part of the study and this result undercuts the premise of the paper. Additionally, the poor specificity of Linordipine for KCNQ should be pointed out in the limitations.</p>
<p>Finally, the editor notes that the author response should not contain ambiguities in what was addressed in the revision. In the original summary of consolidated revisions that were requested, one clearly and separately stated point (point 4) was that experiments in slice cultures should be strongly considered to extend the significance of the work to an intact brain preparation. The author response letter seems to imply that this was done, but this is not the case. The author response seems to have combined this point with another separate point (point 3) about using KCNQ drugs, and imply that all concerns were addressed. Authors should be clear about what revisions were in fact addressed.</p>
<p>Summary of recommendations from the three reviewers:</p>
<p>Please make corrections as suggested by reviewer 1 to improve the manuscript.</p>
<p>Specifically, reviewer 1 suggests making changes to p values in Figure 5,</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As a team, we have decided to keep p values. Here is our rationale:</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>I separated the long paragraph in two. I also removed extraneous information in that section. It now reads:</p>
<p>Previous work by our group and others demonstrated that cholinergic stimulation leads to a decrease in M current and increases the excitability of sympathetic motor neurons at young ages.67-71 The molecular determinants of the M current are channels formed by KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 in these neurons.70, 76, 77 Thus, Figure 6A shows a voltage response (measured in current-clamp mode) and a consecutive M current recording (measured in voltage-clamp mode) in the same neuron upon stimulation of cholinergic type 1 muscarinic receptors. It illustrates the temporal correlation between the decrease of M current with the increase in excitability and firing of APs. This strong dependence led us to hypothesize that aging decreases M current, leading to a depolarized RMP and hyperexcitability (Figure 6B). For these experiments, we measured the RMP and evoked activity using perforated patch, followed by the amplitude of M current using a whole-cell voltage clamp in the same cell. We also measured the membrane capacitance as a proxy for cell size. Interestingly, M current density was smaller by 29% in middle age (7.5 Â± 0.7 pA/pF) and by 55% in old (4.8 Â± 0.7 pA/pF) compared to young (10.6 Â± 1.5 pA/pF) neurons (Figure 6C-D). The average capacitance was similar in young (30.8 Â± 2.2 pF), middle-aged (27.4 Â± 1.2 pF), and old (28.8 Â± 2.3 pF) neurons (Figure 6E), suggesting that aging is not associated with changes in cell size of sympathetic motor neurons, and supporting the hypothesis that aging alters the levels of M current. Next, we tested the effect on the abundance of the channels mediating M current. Contrary to our expectation, we observed that KCNQ2 protein levels were 1.5 Â± 0.1 -fold higher in old compared to young neurons (Figure 6F-G). Unfortunately, we did not find an antibody to detect consistently KCNQ3 channels. We concluded that the decrease in M current is not caused by a decrease in the abundance of KCNQ2 protein.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>B. and - the implications or lack thereof - of the correlation of KCNQ with AP firing rates.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>I am not sure to understand the request in the section on the correlation of KCNQ with AP firing rate. I divided the long paragraph.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The apparent lack of correlation between KCNQ current and KCNQ2 protein needs to be better explained. This is a central part of the study and this result undercuts the premise of the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, total KCNQ2 protein abundance increases while M current decreases. We do not claim in our work that changes in excitability are caused by a reduction in the expression or density of KCNQ2 channels. On the contrary, our current working hypothesis is that the reduction in M current is caused by changes in traffic, degradation, posttranslational modifications, or cofactors for KCNQ2 or KCNQ3 channels. I have modified the description in the results section and discussion to clarify this concept. We also note that the discussion section contains a paragraph discussing this discrepancy.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Additionally, the poor specificity of Linordipine for KCNQ should be pointed out in the limitations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the suggestion. I have added the following sentences to the Limitations section. It reads: âWe want to point out that linopirdine has been reported to affect other ionic currents besides M current (Neacsu and Babes, 2010; Lamas et al., 1997). Despite this limitation, the application of linopirdine to young sympathetic motor neurons led to depolarization and firing of action potentials.â</p>

<p>Finally, the editor notes that the author response should not contain ambiguities in what was addressed in the revision. In the original summary of consolidated revisions that were requested, one clearly and separately stated point (point 4) was that experiments in slice cultures should be strongly considered to extend the significance of the work to an intact brain preparation. The author response letter seems to imply that this was done, but this is not the case. The author response seems to have combined this point with another separate point (point 3) about using KCNQ drugs, and imply that all concerns were addressed. Authors should be clear about what revisions were in fact addressed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for this omission. After reviewing this comment, I realized I did not respond to the Major points in the section of the Recommendations for the authors from Reviewer 3. We missed that entire section. Our previous responses addressed the Public review of Reviewer 3. When doing so, we did not separate the sentences, omitting the request to perform the experiment in slices.</p>
<p>The proposed experiments will require an upward microscope coupled to an electrophysiology rig; unfortunately, we do not have the equipment to do these experiments. We agree that our findings need to be tested in intact preparations to understand how the hyperactivity of sympathetic motor neurons affects systemic responses and the function of controlling organ function. This is a crucial step to move the field forward. Our laboratory is trying to find the appropriate experimental design to address this problem. We believe we must go beyond redoing these experiments in slices.</p>

<p>(3) The emphasis on a particular muscarinic agonist favored by many ion channel physiologists, oxotremorine, is not meaningful (lines 192, 198). The important point is stimulation of muscarinic AChRs, which physiologically are stimulated by acetylcholine. The particular muscarinic agonist used is unimportant. Unless mandated by eLife, &quot;cholinergic type 1 muscarinic receptors&quot; are usually referred to as M1 mAChRs, or even better is &quot;Gq-coupled M1 mAChRs.&quot; I don't think that Kruse and Whitten, 2021 were the first to demonstrate the increase in excitability of sympathetic neurons from stimulation of M1 mAChRs. Please try and cite in a more scholarly fashion.</p>

<p>(4) The authors may want to use the term &quot;M current&quot; (after defining it) as the current produced by KCNQ2&amp;3-containing channels in sympathetic neurons, and reserve &quot;KCNQ&quot; or &quot;Kv7&quot; currents as those made by cloned KCNQ/Kv7 channels in heterologous systems. A reason for this is to exclude currents KCNQ1-containing channels, which most definitely do not contribute to the &quot;KCNQ&quot; current in these cells. I am not mandating this, but rather suggesting it to conform with the literature.</p>

The explanation of &quot;The decrease in KCNQ current and the increase in the abundance of KCNQ2 protein suggest a potential compensatory mechanism that occurs during aging, which we are actively investigating in an independent study.&quot; is rather odd, considering that the entire thesis of this paper is that changes in excitability and firing properties are underlied by changes in KCNQ2/3 channel expression/density. Suddenly, is this not the case?? What about KCNQ3? It would be very enlightening if the authors would just quantify the ratio of KCNQ2:KCNQ3 subunits in M-type channels in young and old mice using simple TEA dose/response curves (see Shapiro et al., JNS, 2000; Selyanko et al., J. Physiol., Hadley et al., Br. J. Pharm., 2001 and a great many more). It is also surprising that the authors did not assess or probe for differences in mAChR-induced suppression of M current between SCG neurons of young and old mice. This would seem to be a fundamental experiment in this line of inquiry.</p>

<p>Our laboratory is working to deeply understand the mechanism behind the changes in M current and its regulation by mAChRs in young and old ages.

</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned, our laboratory is working to understand the mechanism behind M current and its regulation in young and old ages deeply. Our preliminary data show that M currents recorded in old neurons show two behaviors with the activation of mAChR: 1) they do not respond (blue line), or 2) they show a smaller and slower current inhibition than young neurons (red line). This data shows the complexity of the mechanism behind the M current in old neurons where changes in basal levels of PIP2, phospholipids metabolism, KCNQ2/3 changes in traffic/degradation, and M current pharmacology need to be addressed together for a proper interpretation. Showing only one part of this set of experiments in this article may lead to misinterpretation of results.</p>

<p>(7) Why do the authors use linopirdine instead of XE-991? Both are dirty drugs hardly specific to KCNQ channels at 25 uM concentrations, but linopirdine less so. The Methods section lists the source of XE991 used in the study, not linopirdine. Is there an error?</p>
<p>A. Why do the authors use linopirdine instead of XE-991?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We use linopiridine with the experimental goal of observing the recovery phase during the washout. The main difference between the effects of XE991 and linopiridine on Kv7.2/3 is associated with the recovery phase. Currents under XE991 treatment recover 30% after 10 min compared to 93.4% with linopiridine in expression systems at -30 mV (Greene DL et al., 2017, J Pharmacol Exp Ther). After validation of KCNQ2/3 inhibition by linopirdine (IC50 value of 2.4 ÂµM), we found linopirdine the most appropriate drug for our experiments.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we were not able to observe a recovery in our experiments. The limited recovery after washout may be associated with the membrane potential of our conditions (-60 to -50 mV).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>B. Both are dirty drugs hardly specific to KCNQ channels at 25 uM concentrations, but linopirdine less so.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand the concern of the reviewer. The specificity of XE-991 and linopiridine is not absolute. Linopiridine has been reported to activate TRPV1 channels (EC50 =115 ÂµM, Neacsu and Babes, 2010, J Pharmacol Sci) or nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and GABA-induced Cl- currents (EC50 =7.6 ÂµM and 8.1 ÂµM respectively; Lamas et al, 1997, Eur J Neurosci).</p>
<p>To clarify this limitation in the article, we have added the following sentence in the section Limitations and Conclusions. âWe want to point out that linopirdine has been reported to affect other ionic currents besides M current (Neacsu and Babes, 2010; Lamas et al., 1997).

<p>(8) Can the authors use a more scientific explanation of RTG action than &quot;activating KCNQ channels?&quot; For instance, RTG induces both a negative-shift in the voltage-dependance of activation and a voltage-independent increase in the open probability, both of which differing in detail between KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 subunits. The authors are free to use these exact words. Thus, the degree of &quot;activation&quot; is very dependent upon voltage at any voltages negative to the saturating voltages for channel activation.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p>
<p>The main weakness is that this study is a descriptive tabulation of changes in the electrophysiology of neurons in culture, and the effects shown are correlative rather than establishing causality.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the previous revision, Reviewer 3 wrote: âIt is difficult to know from the data presented whether the changes in KCNQ channels are in fact directly responsible for the observed changes in membrane excitability.â And suggested the âuse of blockers and activators to provide greater relevance.â</p>
<p>Attending this recommendation, we performed experiments in Fig. 8. Young neurons exposed to linopirdine depolarize membrane potential and promote action potential firing. In contrast, the old neurons treated with retigabine repolarize membrane potential and stop firing action potentials. This new set of experiments suggests age-related electrophysiological changes in old neurons are associated with changes in M current. The main finding of our article.</p>
<p>If Reviewer 3 refers to establishing causality between aging and a reduction in M current, I would like to emphasize that our laboratory is working toward a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of how M current is affected by aging; however, it will be part of a different article.  One of our attempts was to reverse aging with rapamycin, but the previous recommendation was to remove those experiments.</p>
