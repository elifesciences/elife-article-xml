<title>Abstract</title><p>The larval zebrafish is a vertebrate model for in vivo monitoring and manipulation of whole-brain neuronal activity. Tracing its neural circuits still remains challenging. Here we report an applicable methodology tailored for larval zebrafish to achieve efficient retrograde trans-monosynaptic tracing from genetically defined neurons via EnvA-pseudotyped glycoprotein-deleted rabies viruses. By combinatorially optimizing multiple factors involved, we identified the CVS strain trans-complemented with advanced expression of N2cG at 36°C as the optimal combination. It yielded a tracing efficiency of up to 20 inputs per starter cell. Its low cytotoxicity enabled the viable labeling and calcium imaging of infected neurons 10 days post-infection, spanning larval ages commonly used for functional examination. Cre-dependent labeling was further developed to enable input cell-type-specific tracing and circuit reconstruction. We mapped cerebellar circuits and uncovered the ipsilateral preference and subtype specificity of granule cell-to-Purkinje cell connections. Our method offers an efficient way for tracing neural circuits in larval zebrafish.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Given the small transparent brain and accessible genetic manipulations, the larval zebrafish has been emerging as a promising animal model for systems neuroscience. Large-scale molecular, light- and electron-microscopical (LM and EM) morphological, and physiological datasets have been gathered over the past decade to decipher the identity and connectivity of its whole-brain cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Whole-brain neurons’ activity can be monitored and manipulated in awake as well as behaving zebrafish larvae, providing an unprecedented research paradigm for dissecting neural mechanisms of brain functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Further mechanistic insights into the roles of different cell types in brain-wide activity require effective tools for dissecting underlying neural circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Virus-based tracing tools have opened new avenues for disentangling neural circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Among them, the EnvA-pseudotyped glycoprotein (G)-deleted rabies virus (RV) (RV<italic>d</italic>G[EnvA]) has achieved the most success<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Its success derives from being a native retrograde transsynaptic tracer engineered for cell-type-specific targeting through the recognition between EnvA and its receptor TVA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> and crossing only one synaptic step via trans-complementation of rabies G<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. This tool has revolutionized the structural analysis of neural circuits in rodents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> and has continually evolved to adapt to functional studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. However, its application in other species including zebrafish is retarded due to a lack of tailored methodologies.</p>
<p>The G-deleted RV (RV<italic>d</italic>G) infection of neurons in zebrafish was first demonstrated in 2009. Ten years later, RV<italic>d</italic>G[EnvA] was applied to trace input neurons in the adult zebrafish cerebellum, but the efficiency showed very low<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Recently, the herpes simplex virus (HSV1) was used as a helper virus to deliver TVA and rabies G, leading to an increased efficiency of around one input per starter neuron in the brain of adult zebrafish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. For larval zebrafish, efforts have been focused on the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), another rhabdovirus similar to RV but with anterograde spread<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. However, these reported VSV tools for larval zebrafish appeared relatively high cytotoxicity and have not been iterated to utilize the EnvA-TVA system to achieve initial infection specificity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Therefore, developing applicable efficient viral tracing methods is still an important mission in the field, and will boost the application of larval zebrafish in systems neuroscience research.</p>
<p>In the present study, we established applicable methodologies to implement RV<italic>d</italic>G[EnvA] for efficient retrograde trans-monosynaptic tracing from genetically defined neurons in larval zebrafish. We first demonstrated that the transient co-expression of the helper proteins TVA and rabies G in specific neurons through one-cell-stage microinjection of the GAL-UAS binary DNA plasmids could successfully help the RV<italic>d</italic>G[EnvA] microinjected later on to infect and spread from targeted starter cells. This simple two-round microinjection procedure ensures the high feasibility of our method. Then via practicing in the cerebellar circuit, we iteratively tested key factors that influence the tracing efficiency and cytotoxicity, which include the virus strain, G protein type, G expression level, and working temperature. We discovered an optimal combinatory condition: CVSdG trans-complemented with advanced expression of N2cG at 36°C. The optimality lies in the high tracing efficiency and low cytotoxicity, embodied by a 20-fold increase in efficiency compared to previous studies in zebrafish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> and a long enough time window (final fish age up to 2 - 3 weeks old) for conducting functional studies in larval zebrafish. Furthermore, by using Cre-expressing RV<italic>d</italic>G, we developed a transgenic reporter framework to enable input cell-type-specific tracing and circuit reconstruction based on single-neuron morphology. As an application demonstration, we applied the method to map the monosynaptic inputs to Purkinje cells (PCs) from granule cells (GCs) in the cerebellum and revealed the wiring relationship between morphological subtypes of GCs and PCs. These endeavors prove the applicability and efficiency of our method in dissecting interested circuits in larval zebrafish.</p>

<title>Implementation of RV<italic>d</italic>G[EnvA]-based neural circuit tracing in larval zebrafish</title>
<p>To implement RV<italic>d</italic>G[EnvA]-based retrograde tracing in larval zebrafish, we first verified that larval zebrafish themselves do not express endogenous TVA. In wild type (WT) larvae without exogenous TVA expression, the injected SAD<italic>d</italic>G-mCherry[EnvA], a type of RV<italic>d</italic>G[EnvA], did not infect any cells (<xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The observed mCherry-positive puncta co-localized with microglia (<xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting the clearance of uninfected virus particles by microglia. These data demonstrate that similar to mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, zebrafish do not express endogenous TVA.</p>

</fig>
    <p>Then we specifically expressed TVA in neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A and B</xref>), and found that injected SAD<italic>d</italic>G-mCherry[EnvA] infected TVA-expressing cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C and D</xref>, dashed yellow circles). The targeted expression of TVA and the fluorescent indicator enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in neurons was achieved through transient transgene of GAL4-UAS constructs in which the GAL4 activator is driven by <italic>elavl3</italic>, a pan-neuronal marker in zebrafish (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, and “<italic>UGT</italic>” in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). As the G protein is necessary for viral spread, SAD<italic>d</italic>G-mCherry[EnvA] did not spread beyond the initially infected neurons (i.e. starter cells) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C,E–G</xref>).</p>
<p>We next examined whether viral particles can spread to other cells by complementing the G protein in starter neurons. As the efficiency of virus spread is reported to be positively correlated with the level of G expression in starter neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, we generated two helper plasmids, <italic><underline>U</underline>AS:E<underline>G</underline>FP-P2A-<underline>T</underline>VA-T2A-<underline>B</underline>19G</italic> (<italic>UGTB</italic>) and <italic><underline>U</underline>AS:E<underline>G</underline>FP-P2A-<underline>B</underline>19G-T2A-<underline>T</underline>VA</italic> (<italic>UGBT</italic>), to search for a plasmid design with higher G expression while ensuring the co-expression of TVA and G (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, see Methods). The position of the RV G-protein-coding gene SAD B19G was varied in the tri-cistronic 2A constructs for adjusting its expression level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, besides starter cells (EGFP<sup>+</sup> and mCherry<sup>+</sup>, dashed yellow circles) and uninfected TVA-expressing cells (EGFP<sup>+</sup> only), we observed mCherry<sup>+</sup> only cells (arrows) of which the number increased over time, indicating the virus spread beyond the starter cells by trans-complementation with G. Notably, the traced cells included both neurons and radial glia (hereafter referred to as glia) identified by their distinct morphology (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, red and gray arrows, respectively). Notably, the trans-infection of glia was also observed in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, and its mechanism remains unknown.</p>
<p>Convergence index (CI), defined as the number of trans-infected cells divided by that of starter cells, was then used to estimate the tracing efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. We calculated the CI of traced neurons and glia separately, and found a higher tracing efficiency in larvae expressing <italic>UGBT</italic> than those expressing <italic>UGTB</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E–G</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1fs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1,2—table supplement 1</xref>; CI<sub>neuron</sub>: 1.55 ± 0.29 <italic>vs</italic> 0.44 ± 0.11, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01; CI<sub>glia</sub>: 4.41 ± 1.48 <italic>vs</italic> 2.50 ± 0.65, <italic>P</italic> = 0.30; mean ± SEM), suggesting that <italic>UGBT</italic> is better for G expression and tracing efficiency. Taken together, these results demonstrate that in larval zebrafish, transneuronal tracing from genetically defined cell types can be implemented by combining the injection of RV<italic>d</italic>G[EnvA] with the co-expression of helper proteins mediated by the GAL4-UAS system.</p>

<title>Optimization and verification of the retrograde monosynaptic tracing</title>
<p>To optimize this system for high tracing efficiency and application feasibility in circuit research, we iterated it step-by-step in the cerebellum via testing different combinations of RV strains (SAD-B19 <italic>vs</italic> CVS-N2c), G proteins (SAD B19G <italic>vs</italic> CVS N2cG), and rearing temperatures (28°C <italic>vs</italic> 36°C) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The cerebellar structure is evolutionarily conserved in zebrafish compared with mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. In zebrafish, Purkinje cells (PCs), the central cell type in the cerebellar circuit, receive excitatory inputs from parallel fibers and climbing fibers originated respectively from granule cells (GCs) and inferior olivary cells (IOCs), and local inhibitory inputs from stellate cells (SCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). The helper proteins G and TVA were co-expressed in PCs by using the plasmid in <italic>UGBT</italic> mode, driven by <italic>cpce</italic>, a <italic>ca8</italic> promoter-derived PC-specific enhancer element<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>
    <p>With the same G protein SAD B19G and rearing temperature at 28°C, CVS<italic>d</italic>G[EnvA] exhibited around a 6-fold increase in neuron tracing efficiency compared to SAD<italic>d</italic>G[EnvA] (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C,D</xref>, <xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-C</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1fs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1,2—table supplement 1</xref>; CI<sub>neuron</sub>: 0.41 ± 0.07 <italic>vs</italic> 0.06 ± 0.03, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). After replacing SAD B19G with CVS N2cG to complement CVS<italic>d</italic>G[EnvA], the tracing efficiency was further increased by ∼ 2 times (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C,D</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1fs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1,2—table supplement 1</xref>; CI<sub>neuron</sub>: 1.02 ± 0.18 <italic>vs</italic> 0.41 ± 0.07, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). In addition, CVS<italic>d</italic>G[EnvA] showed a greater tendency to spread to neurons rather than glia in comparison with SAD<italic>d</italic>G[EnvA] (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C,E</xref>). In all experiments, virus injection was performed at 4–6 days post-fertilization (dpf). The labeling of input neurons usually emerged around 2 days post injection (dpi), and all CIs were calculated at 6–10 dpi, during which the viral transfer was relatively stable (<xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p>
    <p>After elevating the temperature from 28°C to 36°C for rearing virus-injected larvae, the neuron tracing efficiency of SAD<italic>d</italic>G[EnvA] became obvious (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C,D</xref>, <xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>, and <xref rid="tbl1fs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1,2—table supplement 1</xref>; CI<sub>neuron</sub>: 4.96 ± 1.01 <italic>vs</italic> 0.06 ± 0.03, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001); for CVS<italic>d</italic>G[EnvA] trans-complemented with N2cG, the efficiency further increased by one order of magnitude (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C,D</xref>, <xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1fs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1,2—table supplement 1</xref>; CI<sub>neuron</sub>: 11.61 ± 2.43 <italic>vs</italic> 1.02 ± 0.18, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). In addition, the elevated temperature also significantly increased the proportion of initially infected larvae (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>) and the tendency of viral spread to neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). This efficient trans-synaptic viral transfer from PCs allowed clear labeling of GC parallel fibers and long-range contralateral inputs from IOCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G–I</xref>). We then generated a <italic>Tetoff</italic> element-based advanced helper plasmid (<italic>UGNT-A</italic>) to enhance the expression level of CVS N2cG (A-N2cG) (<xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>, see Methods), and this optimization resulted in a nearly two-fold increase in the neuron tracing efficiency (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C,D</xref>, <xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figures 2—figure supplement 1F,G</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1fs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1,2—table supplement 1</xref>; CI<sub>neuron</sub>: 20.35 ± 3.45 <italic>vs</italic> 11.61 ± 2.43, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The improvement was also observed for tracing glia (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H,I</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1fs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1,2—table supplement 1</xref>).</p>
<p>To further functionally test the synaptic specificity of RV retrograde spread in the cerebellar circuit, we conducted in vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of starter PCs while simultaneously activating single traced GCs via electrical stimulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>, see Methods). To monitor the activity of starter PCs, the fluorescent protein in the helper plasmid was replaced with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP6s (<italic>UG6sNT-A</italic>, Methods). In total, we stimulated 33 individual GCs across 32 animals, among which 15 elicited detectable calcium responses in putative postsynaptic PCs. In 11 of these 15 cases where the stimulated GC was successfully ablated, the GC-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in starter PCs was abolished after two-photon laser-based ablation of the GC (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K–M</xref>). These results indicate that RV can retrogradely spread to GCs which are functionally connected with starter PCs, confirming the capability of RV to trace monosynaptic inputs in larval zebrafish.</p>

<title>Time window for normal neuronal health after RV infection</title>
<p>In sum, we have identified the optimal conditions for efficient retrograde monosynaptic tracing in zebrafish larvae: CVS<italic>d</italic>G[EnvA] trans-complemented with A-N2cG via the GAL4-UAS system at 36°C. The high efficiency of these optimal tracing conditions prompted concerns regarding the potential cytotoxicity of CVS<italic>d</italic>G and CVS N2cG. In line with previous reports in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, we found lower toxicity of CVS<italic>d</italic>G compared with SAD<italic>d</italic>G. At 36°C, the survival rate of larvae infected with CVS<italic>d</italic>G was significantly higher than those infected with SAD<italic>d</italic>G (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>; 75% ± 3% <italic>vs</italic> 52% ± 7%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05).

<p>To further test whether the physiological functions of starter cells were impaired by CVS<italic>d</italic>G trans-complemented with A-N2cG, we conducted in vivo whole-cell recordings on starter PCs at around 10 dpi (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>, see Methods). Infected PCs exhibited normal spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents and potentials (sEPSCs and sEPSPs), and current injection-evoked firing patterns (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3F,G</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Then we examined Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity of infected (i.e., starter cells) and uninfected PCs (i.e., non-starter cells) in response to complex visual stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> (see Methods). No significant differences were detected between starter and non-starter PCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H–L</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that under the optimal tracing conditions, infected neurons can remain relatively healthy up to 10 days after infection in larval zebrafish, allowing for functional probing of traced neural circuits.</p>

<title>Input cell-type-specific tracing and circuit reconstruction in the cerebellum</title>
<p>One important application of neural circuit tracing is to map the structural connectivity of specific neuron types to build the brain connectome atlas. As shown above, even under the optimal tracing conditions, glia still constituted around 47% on average of the traced cells (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C,E</xref>). This will certainly affect the discrimination of traced neurons and their neural fibers. To confine retrograde tracing to neurons instead of glia, we generated a Cre-Switch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> transgenic reporter fish <italic>Tg(elavl3:Tetoff-DO_DIO-Hsa.H2B-mTagBFP2_tdTomato-CAAX)</italic>. This reporter expresses pan-neuronally nuclear-localized blue fluorescent protein (mTagBFP2) by default, which serves as a reference for image registration and data integration. It also achieves Cre-dependent neuron-specific labeling with tdTomato-CAAX via the <italic>elavl3</italic> promoter (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, see Methods). We employed this reporter together with Cre-expressing CVS<italic>d</italic>G (CVS<italic>d</italic>G-Cre[EnvA]) to map neuronal inputs to PCs in the cerebellum (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). The transgenic labeling of traced neurons showed much brighter and sharper fluorescence compared with virus-assisted labeling (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Among all 13 fish examined, we detected tdTomato-CAAX signals exclusively in neurons without any labeling of glia (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), facilitating the reconstruction of traced neural circuits (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). We noticed a relatively lower tracing efficiency of this Cre-dependent tracing system (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4C</xref>, 2C; CI<sub>neuron</sub>: 5.20 ± 1.09 <italic>vs</italic> 11.61 ± 2.43).

</fig>
<p>To demonstrate the feasibility of our tracing system in building and analyzing brain input maps, we then generated a three-dimensional (3D) reference template brain from the transgenic reporter fish at 17 dpf (see Methods). To incorporate cerebellar expression patterns, we generated the transgenic lines <italic>Tg(2</italic>×<italic>en.cpce:tdTomato-CAAX)</italic> and <italic>Tg(cbln12:GAL4FF)</italic> to label PCs and GCs, respectively. By utilizing H2B-mTagBFP2 expression in the reporter fish as a bridge, we mapped the two cerebellar expression patterns and circuit tracing results of 13 fish mentioned above onto the common coordinate space of the reference template (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B,E</xref>, see Methods). We delineated the cerebellar brain area and reconstructed each starter PC (n = 24) and its input GCs (n = 58) with clearly visible morphology (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E,F</xref>), resulting in a digital cellular-resolution input atlas of cerebellar PCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>).</p>
<p>This input atlas clearly shows an ipsilateral preference of afferents from GCs to PCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>), which was in accordance with the summarized results of non-Cre-dependent viral tracing data (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4H</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>,D). Interestingly, all reconstructed GCs also innervated contralaterally by crossing the midline. We found two morphological subtypes for both GCs and PCs in the reconstruction, and each included one local subtype with axonal projections within the cerebellar area and one long projection subtype with axons extending caudally to the dorsal hindbrain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>). This classification of GC subtypes (GC1 and GC2) is consistent with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>: GC1 corresponds to rostromedial GCs with T-shaped axons and somata located in the valvula cerebelli (Va) and corpus cerebelli (CCe), whereas GC2 corresponds to caudolateral GCs that project to the dorsal hindbrain and innervate crest cells, with somata in the eminentia granularis (EG) and lobus caudalis cerebelli (LCa). Interestingly, although a single PC can receive inputs from the two subtypes of GCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>), the two subtypes of PCs prefer inputs from different subtypes of GCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K,L</xref>). These results demonstrate how cellular-level connectivity can advance our understanding of circuit wiring patterns.</p>

In zebrafish, previous studies expressed these proteins through generating transgenic fish lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> or injecting helper viral vectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Both strategies allow genetic targeting of specific neuronal types or populations via the GAL4-UAS system. However, transgenic expression typically labels the majority of the targeted neuron type, often distributed across multiple brain regions. Viral delivery can provide regional specificity, but achieving precise targeting in the compact larval zebrafish brain remains technically challenging. Our method employs the transient transgene technique in zebrafish to express helper proteins. This involves temporarily introducing GAL4-UAS binary DNA plasmids into the fish’s genome through microinjection into fertilized eggs (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). It enables sparse expression of TVA and G in genetically defined cell types, even in a single neuron. Tracing from a single neuron can help cell-subtype-specific circuit dissection.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we linked the two helper protein genes with the 2A element to co-express TVA and G in the same neuron (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). Co-expression guarantees that the tracing is monosynaptically restricted. If G is expressed in neurons lacking TVA and a fluorescent indicator, these cells may act as input cells for the initially infected starter cells, resulting in further trans-complementation and spread of RV<italic>d</italic>G across the second and even more synaptic steps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Previous studies expressed TVA and G separately, either using two transgenic lines or dual viral vectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, raising the risk of their expression in different neurons and potentially compromising monosynaptic specificity.</p>
<p>On the other hand, our helper protein expression strategy is also compatible with multi-synaptic circuit tracing. By combining sparse, cell-type-specific helper expression with an EnvA-pseudotyped, glycoprotein-competent rabies virus and time-lapse imaging, multi-step trans-synaptic spread can be monitored within individual animals. Assuming a consistent temporal delay between successive rounds of viral transmission, this approach may enable the temporal resolution of successive higher-order presynaptic populations based on their sequential emergence over time. Our study demonstrated that the transient expression of helper proteins effectively facilitates subsequent viral infection and trans-complementation, offering a time-efficient and cost-effective alternative to generating stable transgenic lines. It also addresses the potential cytotoxicity effects associated with the use of helper viral vectors. With commercially available recombinant RV tools, our method can be easily implemented by zebrafish research laboratories using three commonly used techniques: plasmid construction, microinjection (with DNA constructs and recombinant RV injected 3–6 day apart), and live optical imaging. Additional enhancements for the helper plasmid could include the implementation of light-responsive inducible systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> to achieve both temporal and spatial control of helper protein expression.</p>

<title>Key factors that influence tracing efficiency</title>
<p>To enhance RV<italic>d</italic>G tracing efficiency, we introduced the CVS-N2c rabies strain in zebrafish for the first time. It has been reported that the CVS-N2c strain exhibits significantly higher tracing efficiency in mice compared to the SAD-B19 strain, with an improvement of almost tenfold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. In zebrafish larvae, CVS<italic>d</italic>G, when trans-complemented with its native N2cG, also showed an average increase close to tenfold compared to SAD<italic>d</italic>G trans-complemented with its native B19G (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1fs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1,2—table supplement 1</xref>, CI<sub>neuron</sub>). This improvement may be attributed to the reduced replication and protein expression of the CVS-N2c<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. This could result in decreased toxicity to host cells, longer reproductive times, and ultimately higher spread efficiency. Consistently, in zebrafish larvae, we found that neurons infected with CVS-N2c displayed lower fluorescence intensity and longer survival times compared to those infected with SAD-B19. Notably, N2cG exhibited higher tracing efficiency than B19G when they were used to trans-complement the same CVS<italic>d</italic>G (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1fs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1,2—table supplement 1</xref>). This could be attributed to the greater neurotropism of N2cG compared to B19G, or potential mismatches between the cytoplasmic domain of B19G and the CVS-N2c capsid. Further investigation into the impact of different G proteins on RV<italic>d</italic>G tracing efficiency in zebrafish would benefit from the construction of chimeric G proteins for comparison<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Besides the virus strain, temperature also plays a pivotal role. Under the optimal temperature for virus replication at 36°C, the tracing efficiency of CVS-N2c increased more than tenfold in comparison with that under the standard rearing temperature for zebrafish at 28°C. This effect was more pronounced for SAD-B19, showing an increase of over 80 times (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1fs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1,2—table supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, no significant increase in mortality or behavioral abnormalities was observed in either non-injected or virus-injected larvae maintained at elevated temperatures. In virus-injected (CVS-N2c) larvae, survival rates decreased slightly from 100% to ∼80% at both 28°C and 36°C, likely due to electrode insertion-related injury rather than temperature-dependent toxicity. Virus-injected larvae could be maintained at 36°C for over a month without adverse consequences, indicating that elevated temperature is well tolerated. This is consistent with a previous report showing no temperature-dependent effects on various behaviors in adult zebrafish between 28°C and 36°C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p>The expression level of G proteins is another determinant for efficient rabies tracing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Building upon the codon optimization of the G protein, we further increased the expression of N2cG by inserting the Tetoff element upstream of the N2cG gene (A-N2cG) in the UAS helper plasmid (see <xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1F</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1fs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1,2—table supplement 1</xref>). This integration enables dual amplification of N2cG and TVA expression by both the GAL4-UAS and tTA-TRE binary systems. Combining the three key optimal conditions: CVS-N2c strain, 36°C temperature, and A-N2cG, we have achieved the highest tracing efficiency in zebrafish to date, with a 20-fold increase compared to previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To assess the efficacy of our trans-synaptic labeling relative to endogenous connectivity, we quantified PC, GC, and IOC populations based on transgenic labeling in <italic>Tg(2×en.cpce-E1B:tdTomato-CAAX)</italic>, <italic>Tg(cbln12:GAL4FF);Tg(5×UAS:EGFP)</italic>, and <italic>Tg(elavl3:H2B-GCaMP6s)</italic> lines, respectively. At ∼7 dpf, we counted approximately 330 PCs, 2300 GCs, and 330 IOCs in fish brain. Considering developmental scaling and anatomical constraints (e.g., a subset of GCs project exclusively ipsilaterally), we estimate that by 10–14 dpf, a single PC receives ∼1000–2000 GC inputs. The IOC-PC connectivity is primarily one-to-one<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Under optimal tracing conditions, we labeled an average of ∼20 GC inputs per PC (∼1–2% capture rate) and observed IOC labeling in 7 of 248 starter PCs (∼3%). While the capture efficiency is modest, it aligns with values reported in mammalian systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, this indicates inherent limitations of rabies virus-based circuit tracing in zebrafish. Fundamentally addressing this limitation may require the development of viral tracing tools engineered from viruses that naturally infect fish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Monosynaptic specificity of the tracing</title>
<p>Employing the cerebellar circuit as a model, we examined the complete pattern of traced neurons from PCs in larval zebrafish, and found that CVS<italic>d</italic>G was able to trace well-known presynaptic neurons of PCs, including both intra-cerebellar GCs and extra-cerebellar IOCs (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G–I</xref>). Importantly, IOCs were the only labeled cells outside of the cerebellum, even after extended periods allowing for viral spread, demonstrating the retrograde and monosynaptic specificity of the rabies viral tracer in the zebrafish brain.</p>
<p>We further provided functional evidence that CVS<italic>d</italic>G, even at its highest efficiency with A-N2cG, spreads retrogradely between neurons through synaptic connections (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J–M</xref>). In all experiments involving the successful activation of PCs in response to electrical stimulation of single GCs, we consistently did not observe PC activation after ablating the GCs. In addition, as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2L</xref>, calcium imaging at 5 Hz revealed PC responses with an average latency of 152 ± 35 ms (mean ± SEM), indicative of immediate and likely monosynaptic activation. Together with the anatomical tracing data, these findings provide strong evidence that CVS<italic>d</italic>G spreads retrogradely and monosynaptically from postsynaptic PCs to functionally connected presynaptic GCs.</p>

<title>Transneuronal labeling of glial cells</title>
<p>Transneuronal labeling of radial glia mediated by VSV, a member of the Rhabdoviridae family like RV, has been commonly observed in larval zebrafish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. In our experiments, labeled radial glia were consistently located near the somata and dendrites of starter neurons (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). In zebrafish, radial glia—also referred to as radial astroglia—are considered functional equivalents of mammalian astrocytes. These cells are known to participate in tripartite synapses and may express endogenous receptors capable of mediating RV<italic>d</italic>G uptake at postsynaptic sites. This anatomical proximity suggests that rabies-based trans-synaptic tracing could not only resolve neuronal connectivity but also identify glial populations that are synaptically associated and functionally coupled to defined neuronal targets. Leveraging this feature offers a promising strategy for investigating neuron–glia interactions in vivo.</p>
    <p>Glial labeling typically emerged around 2 dpi and increased over time; however, the rate of labeling plateaued or declined during the late phase (6–10 dpi), in contrast to the continued increase in neuronal labeling (see <xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement C, G</xref>). This divergence was quantified using a labeling rate index, calculated as R<sub>glia</sub> - R<sub>neuron</sub>, which shifted from 0.87 to −0.80 between the early (2–6 dpi) and late (6–10 dpi) phases. Moreover, glial labeling observed at 2 or 4 dpi was largely diminished by 6 dpi (∼11 dpf), regardless of onset timing. This age-dependent, rather than duration-dependent, decline is consistent with a model of abortive infection, in which the host’s innate antiviral responses suppress viral replication, preventing progeny virion production and resulting in the eventual loss of reporter expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Supporting this interpretation, we did not observe punctate fluorescent debris characteristic of apoptotic cell death, suggesting that fluorescence loss reflects functional silencing of viral gene expression rather than glial degeneration. These findings imply that abortive infection becomes more prominent with larval maturation, potentially accounting for the negligible glial labeling observed in adult zebrafish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Notably, the eventual disappearance of glial fluorescence does not indicate a lack of initial viral entry. Glial infection likely competes with neuronal infection for viral particles, thereby reducing neuronal tracing efficiency. Future studies should elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying glial susceptibility—particularly receptor-mediated viral entry at synaptic sites. Targeted suppression of viral receptors in glial cells may help minimize off-target labeling and enhance the efficiency of neuronal circuit tracing.</p>

<title>Low cytotoxicity that enables functional experiments in a wide time window</title>
<p>We found that the CVS-N2c strain did not significantly affect the neuronal health and physiology of starter cells for at least 10 days after infection (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D–L</xref>). Meanwhile, consistent with previous reports in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, the SAD-B19 strain exhibited higher cytotoxicity than CVS-N2c, resulting in more cell death of starter cells (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). It indicates that CVS-N2c is more suitable for application in zebrafish. We could observe the labeling of starter cells even one month later after CVS-N2c infection, and the infected zebrafish could be raised to adulthood.</p>
<p>A potential concern is whether viral titer or injection volume contributes to cytotoxicity. However, RV<italic>d</italic>G-EnvA infection generally occurs at a rate of one viral particle per cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, indicating that a higher viral dose does not proportionally increase the viral load per infected cell, and is therefore unlikely to enhance tracing efficiency or aggravate cytotoxicity at the single-cell level. Consistently, in our experiments, increasing the injection volume up to 20 nL had no detectable effect on starter cell survival.</p>
<p>The enhanced G protein expression achieved through the introduction of the Tetoff element (i.e. A-N2cG) in the helper plasmid improved tracing efficiency, but also resulted in elevated levels of cytotoxicity, though lower than that induced by SAD-B19 (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). This indicates an association between the expression levels of G proteins and cytotoxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Given the transferred RV is deficient in G, it is expected that retrogradely infected input cells will have lower cytotoxicity levels than starter cells. Therefore, input cells will survive for longer periods of time.</p>
<p>Based on our experience, the CVS-N2c can be microinjected into zebrafish larvae between 3 and 6 dpf, and stable and viable labeling of traced circuits can be observed within 6 to 16 dpi. Therefore, the observation time window ranges from 9 to 22 dpf, spanning the larval ages commonly used for whole-brain functional imaging studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Functions and expandability of the transgenic framework</title>
<p>In the transgenic reporter framework (i.e. <italic>elavl3DoDioBR</italic>) (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), we designed three expansion motifs: 1) a promoter (<italic>elavl3</italic>) motif that allows genetic access to the expression of reporter cassettes in specific cell types, e.g. the <italic>vglut2a</italic> and <italic>gad1b</italic> gene promoters to restrict excitatory and inhibitory targeting, respectively; 2) a Cre-dependent “Switch-On” reporter (tdTomato-CAAX) motif that allows the expression of various structural and functional tools in traced neurons after viral spread, such as photoconvertible fluorescent proteins and optogenetic tools; 3) a Cre-dependent “Switch-Off” reporter (H2B-mTagBFP2) motif that allows a default reporter to be turned off specifically in infected neurons. In addition, the helper plasmid can serve as an additional expansion motif that works together with the Cre-dependent transgenic reporter, allowing for full genetic visualization and dissection of neural circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In this study, we used the <italic>elavl3</italic> promoter to restrict the fluorescence reporter to neurons and the “Switch-On” reporter tdTomato-CAAX to label the membrane of traced neurons. This enables clear neuron morphology labeling (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), facilitating the reconstruction of traced neural circuits based on single-neuron morphology. We used H2B-mTagBFP2 as the default “Switch-Off” reporter to provide a reference expression pattern for registering and integrating traced circuit images from different individual fish and experiments. As an application demonstration, we applied the transgenic framework to map the monosynaptic inputs to PCs from GCs in the cerebellum of larval zebrafish at ∼ 2.5 weeks old (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Interestedly, we uncovered two properties of the cerebellar circuit: 1) the ipsilateral preference of GC-to-PC connections; 2) the subtype specificity of GC-to-PC connections. Further investigation is required to elucidate the functional implications of subtype-specific GC-to-PC connections and the apparent contradiction between the bilateral projection of GC parallel fibers and the GCs’ preference for ipsilateral connections to PCs. The reference expression pattern can serve as a reference atlas to integrate other modal data from brain-wide images with information on gene expression, neurochemistry and neuronal activity.

<p>Within 6 to 15 days after virus injection, larvae were paralyzed with α-bungarotoxin (1mM) for 1 min, then mounted in 1.5% low-melting agarose on a chamber filled with the extracellular solution. The agarose and skin over the caudal side of the cerebellum were removed for the access of recording pipettes. A recording micropipette (15 - 20 MΩ, 1 - 1.5 µm tip opening) filled with internal solution was approached to the target PC by a motorized micromanipulator (MP-225, Sutter Instruments). The internal solution consisted of (in mM): 100 K-gluconate, 10 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>•2H<sub>2</sub>O, 2 Mg<sub>2</sub>•ATP, 0.3 GTP•Na<sub>4</sub>, 2 phosphocreatine, 10 EGTA, and 10 HEPES (pH = 7.4, osmolality = 270LmOsm). The target PC was identified by double fluorescence (sfGFP<sup>+</sup> and tdTomato<sup>+</sup>) using confocal imaging and was recorded at whole-cell mode with similar procedures as our previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. The EPSP recording and current-step delivery were conducted in current-clamp mode, and the EPSC was assessed in voltage-clamp mode. Data were acquired using a patch-clamp amplifier (MultiClamp 700B, Axon Instruments) and a digitizer (Digidata 1440A, Axon Instruments), and signals were sampled at 10 kHz with Clampex 10.6 software (Molecular Devices).</p>

<title>Visual stimulation</title>
<p>Larvae examined were not anesthetized and were fully embedded in low-melting agarose. Visual stimuli were generated by a custom program written in Python and presented using an LCD screen covered with red filter paper to avoid spectrum interference. The visual stimuli basically followed a prior study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Briefly, three trials were presented and each trial consisted of three types of stimuli in the following order: (1) four-directional whole-field gratings in black and white (including three forward, one backward, one leftward, and one rightward directions); (2) windmill patterns in black and white rotating at 0.2 Hz and varying in velocity following a sine function (including six whole, two right-half, and two left-half filed stimuli presented in alternating clockwise and counterclockwise directions); (3) whole-field flashes of 1-second duration (alternating between white and black, repeated 4 times). Except for the flash, each stimulus lasted 5 seconds, with a 5-second inter-stimulus interval.</p>

<title>Quantification of RV<italic>d</italic>G[EnvA]-based circuit tracing</title>
<p>Cells were counted by manually annotating the center of their cell bodies in image stacks using the Cell Counter plugin in ImageJ. This was done for cells showing green (sfGFP/GCaMP6s; i.e., infected and uninfected TVA-expressing cells), red (tdTomato/mCherry; i.e., traced input cells and starter cells), or yellow (both green and red; i.e., initially infected starter cells) fluorescence separately. To count the traced neurons and glia separately, we also manually identified and marked the neurons based on their significant morphological distinctions with glia in larval zebrafish. The number of traced glia was then calculated by subtracting the number of starter cells and traced neurons from the total number of cells with red fluorescence. To determine virus tracing efficiency, a convergence index (CI) was calculated as the number of traced inputs (neurons, glia, or all) divided by the number of starter cells.</p>

<title>Analysis of calcium imaging data</title>
<p>The acquired time-lapse images were aligned first, and individual regions of interest (ROIs) were manually circled on the averaged image. Each ROI corresponds to either a starter cell or a non-starter cell, and the mean grayscale value within each ROI over time was represented as F. In the electrical stimulation experiment, the baseline value F<sub>0</sub> was calculated as the average value of F from a 10-second interval before each stimulus. In the visual stimulation experiment, F<sub>O</sub> was calculated as the average value of F over a 30-second period preceding the stimuli. The relative change in the intensity of each ROI was calculated using the formula (F - F<sub>O</sub>)/F<sub>O</sub>. Response latency was defined as the time interval between the onset of electrical stimulation and the first post-stimulus imaging frame in which ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> exceeded the pre-stimulus baseline by more than 3× standard deviations (SD). The area under the curve (AUC) and the number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity events were determined by applying a threshold of 2× SD of a 60-second baseline activity. All of the mentioned calculations were performed using custom Python scripts.</p>

Confocal images were acquired at 1 × 1 × 1 μm resolution. Both templates were shape-based average representations from 6 transgenic larvae after 7 iterations. Using normalized cross correlation (NCC) as a metric to evaluate the registration accuracy between <italic>elavl3DoDioBR</italic> templates and individual <italic>elavl3DoDioBR</italic> scans of larvae used for circuit tracing, we determined the <italic>elavl3DoDioBR</italic> in <italic>Tg(2×en.cpce:tdTomato-CAAX);elavl3DoDioBR</italic> template space as the common coordinate reference for registration. The expression pattern of <italic>Tg(cbln12:GAL4FF);Tg(5×UAS:EGFP)</italic> and circuit tracing results were transformed into the common coordinate space by using <italic>elavl3DoDioBR</italic> as a bridge. For image registration, we used antsRegistration and antsApplyTransforms functions in ANTs, following the registration parameters for live fish scans reported in previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. Neuron reconstructions (SWC files<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>) were aligned using antsApplyTransformsToPoints function in ANTs.</p>

<title>Cerebellum delineation and neuron reconstruction</title>
<p>The 3D cerebellum region was delineated manually using 3D Slicer software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.slicer.org/">https://www.slicer.org/</ext-link>) based on the expression patterns of <italic>elavl3DoDioBR</italic>, <italic>Tg(2×en.cpce:tdTomato-CAAX)</italic>, and <italic>Tg(cbln12:GAL4FF);Tg(5×UAS:EGFP)</italic> in the common coordinate space. The boundary delineation was performed on <italic>elavl3DoDioBR</italic>, assisted by overlaying the other two patterns.</p>
<p>To reconstruct the morphology of neurons in virus-traced circuits, neurons expressing membrane-bound tdTomato were semi-automatically traced using the simple neurite tracer (SNT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup> plugin in ImageJ. The classification of dendritic and axonal compartments of neurites was based on structural knowledge. Neurons with low fluorescence intensity and ambiguous morphology were excluded during reconstruction. The resulting individual neuron skeletons were saved in SWC format. Tracings containing undistinguished several neuron skeletons were also saved as individual SWC files. Connectivity between individual starter PCs and traced GCs was determined by examining original confocal image stacks for clear appositions between GC axons and PC dendrites or somata.</p>
<p>The co-volume rendering of template cerebellum and cerebellum region (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>) was performed using ParaView<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.paraview.org">https://www.paraview.org</ext-link>).

<p>(1) Presentation of Figures in the Response Letter</p>
<p>I would like to note that the figures included in the response letter would benefit from improved organization. For example, Author response image 1 lacks clarity for experimental conditions. From the response letter, my understanding is that a &quot;Labeling rate index&quot;, Rg−Rn, was calculated to represent the difference in the rate of increase in labeling between neurons and glial across two time intervals based on experiments shown in Figure 2-figure supplement 1C and G. It seems that a mean convergence index was calculated for each experimental condition at each time point for glial and neurons, and then the differences in mean convergence index increase between time intervals were calculated for glial and neurons. The legend needs more detail to enhance clarity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the manuscript should clearly distinguish between figures generated from re-analysis of existing data and those based on newly conducted experiments. This distinction should be explicitly stated in the figure legends and/or main text.</p>
<p>
I recommend that all response figures containing data integral to the authors' rebuttal be properly integrated into the manuscript's existing supplementary figure set, rather than remaining isolated in the response document. This would enhance clarity and ensure that key supporting data are fully accessible to readers. For instance, Author response image 1 can be integrated with Figure 2-figure supplement.</p>
<p>(2) Glial Cell Labeling and Specificity of Trans-Synaptic Spread</p>
<p>The authors provided a comprehensive and well-reasoned response to the concern regarding the labeling of radial glial cells. The inclusion of a dedicated section in the revised Discussion and response figures (possibly to be integrated with supplementary figures), strengthens the manuscript.</p>
<p>The authors have made an interesting observation in Author response image 2 that glial labeling was frequently observed near the soma and dendrites of starter cells, suggesting that transneuronal labeled glial cells may be synaptically associated with the starter neurons. Also astroglia starter cells lead to infection of nearby TVA-negative astroglia, suggesting astroglia-to- astroglia transmission.</p>
<p>I find the response scientifically satisfactory and appreciate the authors' transparency in addressing the limitations of their approach.</p>
<p>(3) Temperature Effects and Larval Viability</p>
<p>The authors' justification for raising larvae at 36C to improve labeling efficiency is reasonable. The supporting data indicating minimal impact on larval viability within the experimental timeframe are convincing. Referencing prior behavioral studies and including survival data under controlled conditions adds credibility to their claims. I find this issue satisfactorily addressed.</p>
<p>(4) Viral Toxicity and Dosage Considerations, Secondary Starter Cells</p>
<p>The authors present a well-reasoned explanation that viral cytotoxicity is primarily driven by replication and not by viral titer or injection volume. However, the inclusion of experimental data directly testing the effects of higher titer or volume on starter cell viability would have strengthened this point, particularly since such tests are relatively straightforward to perform.</p>
<p>Regarding the potential contribution of secondary starter cells, the authors provide a convincing rationale for why such effects are unlikely under their sparse labeling conditions. However, in cases where TVA and G are broadly expressed-such as under the vglut2a promoter, as shown in Author response image 2-it would be valuable to directly evaluate this possibility experimentally. While the authors' interpretation is reasonable, empirical validation would further strengthen their conclusions.</p>

<p>The study by Chen, Deng et al. aims to develop an efficient viral transneuronal tracing method that allows efficient retrograde tracing in the larval zebrafish. The authors utilize pseudotyped-rabies virus that can be targeted to specific cell types using the EnvA-TvA systems. Pseudotyped rabies virus has been used extensively in rodent models and, in recent years, has begun to be developed for use in adult zebrafish. However, compared to rodents, the efficiency of spread in adult zebrafish is very low (~one upstream neuron labeled per starter cell). Additionally, there is limited evidence of retrograde tracing with pseudotyped rabies in the larval stage, which is the stage when most functional neural imaging studies are done in the field. In this study, the authors systematically optimized several parameters of rabies tracing, including different rabies virus strains, glycoprotein types, temperatures, expression construct designs, and elimination of glial labeling. The optimal configurations developed by the authors are up to 5-10 fold higher than more typically used configurations.</p>
<p>The results are convincing and support the conclusions. There are some additional changes that are recommended:</p>
<p>(1) The new data included in the response to reviewer's letter are important to support the main conclusions and should be included in the manuscript.</p>
<p>(2) Line 357-362: This section should include all of the Author response image and associated details. Additionally, the Author response image 3 is at odds with Fig 2-supplement 1G. In Author response image 3, ~75% of glial cells labeled at 4 dpi loses their fluorescence by 10 dpi. However, Figure 2-supplement 1G shows that glial overall labeling increases ~2 fold from 4 dpi to 10 dpi. This would suggest that the de novo labeling rate for glia is much higher than the net labeling rate calculated from the convergence index. The authors should clarify these findings.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>EnvA-pseudotyped glycoprotein-deleted rabies virus has emerged as an essential tool for tracing monosynaptic inputs to genetically defined neuron populations in the mammalian brain. Recently, in addition to the SAD B19 rabies virus strain first described by Callaway and colleagues in 2007, the CVS N2c rabies virus strain has become popular due to its low toxicity and high trans-synaptic transfer efficiency. However, despite its widespread use in the mammalian brain, particularly in mice, the application of this cell-type-specific monosynaptic rabies tracing system in zebrafish has been limited by low labeling efficiency and high toxicity. In this manuscript, the authors aimed to develop an efficient retrograde monosynaptic rabies-mediated circuit mapping tool for larval zebrafish. Given the translucent nature of larval zebrafish, whole-brain neuronal activities can be monitored, perturbed, and recorded over time. Introducing a robust circuit mapping tool for larval zebrafish would enable researchers to simultaneously investigate the structure and function of neural circuits, which would be of significant interest to the neural circuit research community. Furthermore, the ability to track rabies-labeled cells over time in the transparent brain could enhance our understanding of the trans-synaptic retrograde tracing mechanism of the rabies virus.</p>
<p>To establish an efficient rabies virus tracing system in the larval zebrafish brain, the authors conducted meticulous side-by-side experiments to determine the optimal combination of trans-expressed rabies G proteins, TVA receptors, and recombinant rabies virus strains. Consistent with observations in the mouse brain, the CVS N2c strain trans-complemented with N2cG was found to be superior to the SAD B19 combination, offering lower toxicity and higher efficiency in labeling presynaptic neurons. Additionally, the authors tested various temperatures for the larvae post-virus injection and identified 36℃ as the optimal temperature for improved virus labeling. They then validated the system in the cerebellar circuits, noting evolutionary conservation in the cerebellar structure between zebrafish and mammals. The monosynaptic inputs to Purkinje cells from granule cells were neatly confirmed through ablation experiments.</p>
<p>However, there are a couple of issues that this study should address. Additionally, conducting some extra experiments could provide valuable information to the broader research field utilizing recombinant rabies viruses as retrograde tracers.</p>
<p>(1) It was observed that many radial glia were labeled, which casts doubt on the specificity of trans-synaptic spread between neurons. The issues of transneuronal labeling of glial cells should be addressed and discussed in more detail. In this manuscript, the authors used a transgenic zebrafish line carrying a neuron-specific Cre-dependent reporter and EnvA-CVS N2c(dG)-Cre virus to avoid the visualization of virally infected glial cells. However, this does not solve the real issue of glial cell labeling and the possibility of a nonsynaptic spread mechanism.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In agreement with the reviewer’s suggestion, we have incorporated a standalone section in the revised Discussion (page 9) to address the issue of transneuronal glial labeling, including its spatial distribution, temporal dynamics, potential mechanisms, and possible strategies for real resolution.</p>
<p>Regarding the specificity of trans-synaptic spread between neurons, we have demonstrated that our transsynaptic tracing system reliably and specifically labels input neurons. Structurally, we only observed labeling of inferior olivary cells (IOCs) outside the cerebellum, which are the only known extracerebellar inputs to Purkinje cells (PCs), while all other traced neurons remained confined within the cerebellum throughout the observation period (see Figure 2G–I). Functionally, we verified that the traced neurons formed synaptic connections with the starter PCs (see Figure 2J–M). Together, these findings support the conclusion that our system enables robust and specific retrograde monosynaptic tracing of neurons in larval zebrafish.</p>
<p>Regarding the transneuronal labeling of radial glia cells, we observed that their distribution closely correlates with the location of neuronal somata and dendrites (see Author response image 2). In zebrafish, radial glial cells are considered functional analogs of astrocytes and are often referred to as radial astroglia. The adjacent labeled astroglia may participate in tripartite synapses with the starter neurons and express viral receptors that enable RV particle entry at postsynaptic sites. This suggests that rabies-based tracing in zebrafish may serve as a valuable tool for identifying synaptically associated and functionally connected glia. Leveraging this approach to investigate glia–neuron interactions represents a promising direction for future research.</p>
<p>In our system, the glial labeling diminishes at later larval stages, likely due to abortive infection (see Author response image 3 and relevant response). However, the eventual clearance of infection does not preclude the initial infection of glial cells, which may compete with neuronal labeling and reduce overall tracing efficiency. Notably, transneuronal infection of glial cells by RV has also been observed in mammals (Marshel et al., 2010). To minimize such off-target labeling, future work should focus on elucidating the mechanisms underlying glial susceptibility—such as receptor-mediated viral entry— and developing strategies to suppress receptor expression specifically in glia, thereby improving the specificity and efficiency of neuronal circuit tracing.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In addition, wrong citations in Line 307 were made when referring to previous studies discovering the same issue of RVdG-based transneuronal labeling radial glial cells. &quot;The RVdG-based transneuronal labeling of radial glial cells was commonly observed in larval zebrafish29,30&quot;.</p>
<p>The cited work was conducted using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). A more thorough analysis and/or discussion on this topic should be included.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the citation inaccuracy. The referenced study employed vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), which, like RV, is a member of the Rhabdoviridae family. We have revised the text accordingly—from &quot;RVdG-based transneuronal labeling of radial glial cells…&quot; to &quot; Transneuronal labeling of radial glial cells mediated by VSV, a member of the Rhabdoviridae family like RV, has been commonly observed in larval zebrafish&quot; (page 9, line 347).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Several key questions should be addressed:</p>
<p>Does the number of labeled glial cells increase over time?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, as shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and G, the number of labeled radial glial cells significantly increased from 2 to 6 days post-injection (dpi). This phenomenon has been addressed in the revised Discussion section (page 9, line 357).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Do they increase at the same rate over time as labeled neurons?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although glial cell labeling continued to increase over time, we observed a slowdown in labeling rate between 6 and 10 dpi, as shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and G. Therefore, we divided the timeline into two intervals (2–6 and 6–10 dpi) to compare the rate of increase in labeling between neurons and glia. The rate (R) was defined as the daily change in convergence index. To quantify the difference between neuronal and glial labeling rates, we calculated a labeling rate index: R<sub>g</sub>−R<sub>n</sub>, where R<sub>g</sub> and R<sub>n</sub> denote the rates for glia and neurons, respectively) (Author response image1). Our analysis revealed that, between 2 and 6 dpi, glial cells exhibited a higher labeling rate than neurons. However, this trend reversed between 6 and 10 dpi, with neurons surpassing glial cells in labeling rate. These findings have been included in the revised Discussion section (page 9).</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Are the labeled glial cells only present around the injection site?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe the reviewer is inquiring whether labeled glial cells are spatially restricted to the vicinity of starter neurons. The initial infection is determined by the expression of TVA rather than the injection site. For example, injecting a high volume of virus into the anterior hindbrain resulted in the infection of TVA-expressing cells in distant regions, including the 109 tectum and posterior hindbrain (Author response image 2).</p>
<p>Regarding glial labeling, PC starter experiments showed that labeled glial cells (i.e. Bergmann glia) were predominantly localized within the cerebellum, likely due to the confinement of PC dendrites to this region. When using vglut2a to define starter neurons, glial labeling was frequently observed near the soma and dendrites of starter cells (14 out 114 of 17 cases; Author response image 2). These observations suggest that transneuronal labeled glial cells may be synaptically associated with the starter neurons. We have included this point in the revised Discussion section (page 9).</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Can the phenomenon of transneuronal labeling of radial glial cells be mitigated if the tracing is done in slightly older larvae?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, we agree. As elaborated in the following response, we hypothesize that the loss of fluorescence in radial glial cells at later developmental stages is due to abortive infection (see Author response image 3 and associated response). This supports the notion that abortive infection becomes increasingly pronounced as larvae mature, potentially explaining the negligible glial labeling observed in adult zebrafish (Dohaku et al., 2019; Satou et al., 2022). However, as noted in our response to the first comment, the disappearance of fluorescence does not indicate the absence of viral entry. Viral receptors may express on glial cells, allowing initial infection despite a failure in subsequent replication. Consequently, glial infection—though abortive—may still compete with neuronal infection and reduce tracing efficiency.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>What is the survival rate of the infected glial cells over time?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We observed the disappearance of glial fluorescence after transneuronal labeling, while we did not observe punctate fluorescent debris typically indicative of apoptotic cell death. Therefore, we favor the hypothesis that the loss of glial fluorescence results from abortive infection rather than cell death. Abortive infection refers to a scenario in which viral replication is actively suppressed by host antiviral responses, preventing the production of infectious viral particles. For example, recent studies have shown that lab-attenuated rabies virus (RV) induces the accumulation of aberrant double-stranded DNA in astrocytes, which activates mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and subsequent interferon expression (Tian et al., 2018). This antiviral response inhibits RV replication, ultimately resulting in abortive infection.</p>
<p>In addition, we quantified the proportion of glial cells labeled at 2 dpi and 4dpi that retained fluorescence over time. By 6 dpi (approximately 11 dpf), glial labeling had largely diminished in both groups (Author response image 3). These results suggest that the decline in glial fluorescence is more closely linked to larval age than to the duration of glial infection, supporting the notion of abortive infection. This also addresses the reviewer’s earlier concern and indicates that glial labeling is mitigated in older larvae.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>If an infected glial cell dies due to infection or gets ablated, does the rabies virus spread from the dead glial cells?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our system, glial cells do not express the rabies glycoprotein (G). Therefore, even if glial cells are transneuronally infected, they cannot support viral budding or assembly of infectious particles due to the absence of G (Mebatsion et al., 1996), preventing further viral propagation to neighboring cells.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>If TVA and rabies G are delivered to glial cells, followed by rabies virus injection, will it lead to the infection of other glial cells or neurons?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have conducted experiments in which TVA and rabies G were specifically expressed in astroglia using the gfap promoter, followed by RVdG-mCherry[EnvA] injection. This resulted in initial infection of TVA-positive astroglia and occasional subsequent labeling of nearby TVA-negative astroglia (Author response image 4), suggesting astroglia-toastroglia transmission. Notably, no neuronal labeling was observed. This glial-to-glial spread is consistent with previous rabies tracing studies reporting similar phenomena involving the interaction of astrocytes with astrocytes and microglia (Clark et al., 2021). However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear, and we have discussed this in response to the first comment.</p>

<p>Answers to any of these questions could greatly benefit the broader research community.</p>
<p>(2) The optimal virus tracing effect has to be achieved by raising the injected larvae at 36C. Since the routine temperature of zebrafish culture is around 28C, a more thorough characterization of the effect on the health of zebrafish should be conducted.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, 36°C is required to achieve optimal labeling efficiency. Although this is above the standard zebrafish culture temperature (28°C), previous work (Satou et al., 2022) and our observations indicate that this transient elevation does not adversely affect larval health within the experimental time window.</p>
<p>In the previous study, Satou et al. reported no temperature-dependent effects on swimming behavior, social interaction, or odor discrimination in adult fish maintained at 28°C and 36°C. In larvae, both non-injected and virus-injected fish showed a decrease in survival at later time points (7 dpi), with slightly increased mortality observed at elevated temperatures.</p>
<p>In our study, we raised the same batch of non-virus-injected larvae at 28°C and 36°C, and found no mortality over a 10-day period. For CVS-N2c-injected larvae, electrode insertion caused injury, but survival rates remained around 80% at both temperatures (see Figure 3A). Moreover, we successfully maintained CVS-N2c-injected larvae at 36°C for over a month, indicating that elevated temperature does not adversely affect fish health. Notably, higher temperatures were associated with an accelerated developmental rate.</p>
<p>This point was briefly addressed in the previous version and has now been further elaborated in the revised Discussion section (page 8).</p>

<p>(3) Given the ability of time-lapse imaging of the infected larval zebrafish brain, the system can be taken advantage of to tackle important issues of rabies virus tracing tools.</p>
<p>a) Toxicity.</p>
<p>The toxicity of rabies viruses is an important issue that limits their application and affects the interpretation of traced circuits. For example, if a significant proportion of starter cells die before analysis, the traced presynaptic networks cannot be reliably assigned to a &quot;defined&quot; population of starter cells. In this manuscript, the authors did an excellent job of characterizing the effects of different rabies strains, G proteins derived from various strains, and levels of G protein expression on starter cell survival. However, an additional parameter that should be tested is the dose of rabies virus injection. The current method section states that all rabies virus preparations were diluted to 2x10^8 infection units per ml, and 2-5 nl of virus suspension was injected near the target cells. It would be interesting to know the impact of the dose/volume of virus injection on retrograde tracing efficiency and toxicity. Would higher titers of the virus lead to more efficient labeling but stronger toxicities? What would be the optimal dose/volume to balance efficiency and toxicity? Addressing these questions would provide valuable insights and help optimize the use of rabies viruses for circuit tracing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an important concern. Viral cytotoxicity is primarily driven by the level of viral transcription and replication, which inhibits host protein synthesis (Komarova et al., 2007). The RVdG-EnvA typically infects cells at a rate of one viral particle per cell (Zhang et al., 2024), suggesting that increasing viral concentration does not proportionally increase percell infection. Accordingly, viral titer and injection volume are unlikely to influence cytotoxicity at the single-cell level. In our experiments, injection volumes up to 20 nl (i.e., 4 to 10 times the standard injection volume) did not affect starter cell survival. However, higher titers or volumes may increase the number of initially infected starter cells, potentially leading to greater overall mortality in larval zebrafish.</p>
<p>Similarly, given that rabies virus typically infects cells at one particle per cell, increasing viral titer alone is unlikely to enhance tracing efficiency once the virus type is fixed. In contrast, the level of G protein expression significantly influences tracing efficiency (see Figure 2D). However, excessive G protein expression reduces the survival of starter cells (see Figure 3D). Therefore, careful control of G protein levels is essential to balance tracing efficiency and cytotoxicity.</p>
<p>Notably, regardless of whether infected cells undergo apoptosis or necrosis due to cytotoxicity, the resulting disruption of the plasma membrane severely impairs viral budding. As a result, the formation of intact, G protein-enveloped viral particles is prevented, limiting further infection of neighboring neurons.</p>
<p>The latest second-generation ΔGL RV vectors (Jin et al., 2024), which lack both the G and L (viral polymerase) genes, have been shown to markedly reduce cytotoxicity. These improved tracing strategies may be explored in future zebrafish studies to further optimize labeling efficiency and cell viability.</p>
<p>The issue of viral titer and volume has been addressed in the revised Discussion section (page 10).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>b) Primary starters and secondary starters:</p>
<p>Given that the trans-expression of TVA and G is widespread, there is the possibility of coexistence of starter cells from the initial infection (primary starters) and starter cells generated by rabies virus spreading from the primary starters to presynaptic neurons expressing G. This means that the labeled input cells could be a mixed population connected with either the primary or secondary starter cells.</p>
<p>It would be immensely interesting if time-lapse imaging could be utilized to observe the appearance of such primary and secondary starter cells. Assuming there is a time difference between the initial appearance of these two populations, it may be possible to differentiate the input cells wired to these populations based on a similar temporal difference in their initial appearance. This approach could provide valuable insights into the dynamics of rabies virus spread and the connectivity of neural circuits.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewers suggestion is valuable. Regarding the use of Purkinje cells (PCs) as starter cells, we consider the occurrence of secondary PCs to be extremely rare. Although previous evidence suggests that PCs can form synaptic connections with one another (Chang et al., 2020), our sparse labeling strategy—typically involving fewer than 10 labeled cells— significantly reduces the likelihood of viral transmission between PC starter cells. In addition, if secondary starter PCs were frequently generated, we would expect increased tracing efficiency at 10 dpi compared to 6 dpi. However, our results show no significant difference (see Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and G).</p>
<p>Given the restricted expression of TVA and G in PCs, even if a limited number of secondary starters were generated, the labeled inputs would predominantly be granule cells (GCs), thereby preserving the cell-type identity of upstream inputs. While this raises a potential concern regarding an overestimation of the convergence index (CI). Notably, within the GC-PC circuit, individual GCs often project to multiple PCs. Consequently, a GC labeled via a secondary PC may also a bona fide presynaptic partner of the primary starter population. This overlap could mitigate the overestimation of CI. Taken together, we believe that the CI values reported in this study provide a reasonable approximation of monosynaptic connectivity.</p>
<p>In scenarios where TVA and G are broadly expressed—for example, under the control of vglut2a promoter—secondary starter cells may arise frequently. In such cases, long-term time-lapse imaging in the zebrafish whole brain presents a promising strategy to distinguish primary and secondary starter cells, along with their respective input populations, based on the timing of their appearance. This approach potentially enables multi-step circuit tracing within individual animals. An alternative strategy is to use an EnvA-pseudotyped, G-competent rabies virus, which allows targeted initial infection while supporting multisynaptic propagation. When combined with temporally resolved imaging, this strategy could facilitate direct labeling of higher-order circuits and allow clear differentiation between multi-order inputs and the original starter population over time.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we find this suggestion compelling and will explore these strategies in future studies to optimize and broaden the application of rabies virus-based circuit tracing.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The study by Chen, Deng et al. aims to develop an efficient viral transneuronal tracing method that allows efficient retrograde tracing in the larval zebrafish. The authors utilize pseudotyped-rabies virus that can be targeted to specific cell types using the EnvA-TvA systems. Pseudotyped rabies virus has been used extensively in rodent models and, in recent years, has begun to be developed for use in adult zebrafish. However, compared to rodents, the efficiency of the spread in adult zebrafish is very low (~one upstream neuron labeled per starter cell). Additionally, there is limited evidence of retrograde tracing with pseudotyped rabies in the larval stage, which is the stage when most functional neural imaging studies are done in the field. In this study, the authors systematically optimized several parameters of rabies tracing, including different rabies virus strains, glycoprotein types, temperatures, expression construct designs, and elimination of glial labeling. The optimal configurations developed by the authors are up to 5-10 fold higher than more typically used configurations.</p>
<p>The results are solid and support the conclusions. However, the methods should be described in more detail to allow other zebrafish researchers to apply this method in their own work.</p>
<p>Additionally, some findings are presented anecdotally, i.e., without quantification or sufficient detail to allow close examinations. Lastly, there is concern that the reagents created by the authors will not be easily accessible to the zebrafish community.</p>
<p>(1) The titer used in each experiment was not stated. In the methods section, it is stated that aliquots are stored at 2x10e8. Is it diluted for injection? Are all of the experiments in the manuscripts with the same titer?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We injected all three viral vectors as undiluted stock aliquots. The titer for SADdGmCherry[EnvA], CVSdG-tdTomato[EnvA], and CVSdG-mCherry-2A-Cre[EnvA]) was 2 × 10<sup>8</sup>, 2 × 10<sup>8</sup>, and 3 × 10<sup>8</sup> infectious units/mL, respectively. This has been clarified in the updated Methods section (page 12).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The age for injection is quite broad (3-5 dpf in Fig 1 and 4-6 dpf in Fig 2). Given that viral spread efficiency is usually more robust in younger animals, describing the exact injection age for each experiment is critical.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestions. For the initial experiments tracing randomly from neurons in Figure 1, the injection age was primarily 3–4 dpf, with a one-day difference. Due to the slower development of PCs, the injection age for experiments related to Figure 2,3, and 4, is mainly 5 dpf. To clarify the developmental stages at the time of injection for each experiment, we have  newly added tables (see Figure 1,2—table supplement 2) listing the number of fish used at each injection age for all experimental groups shown in Figure 1 and 2.</p>

<p>(3) More details should be provided for the paired electrical stimulation-calcium imaging study. How many GC cells were tested? How many had corresponding PC cell responses? What is the response latency? For example, images of stimulated and recorded GCs and PCs should be shown.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, these are important details for the paired electrical stimulation-calcium imaging study. We stimulated 33 GCs from 32 animals and detected calcium responses in putative postsynaptic PCs in 15 cases. Among these, we successfully ablated the single GC in 11 pairs and observed a weakened calcium response in PCs following ablation (see Figure 2M). The response latency was determined as the first calcium imaging frame where ΔF/F exceeded the baseline (pre-stimulus average) by 3 times the standard deviation. Imaging was performed at 5 Hz, and as shown in Figure 2L, the calculated average response latency was 152 ± 35 ms (mean ± SEM), indicating an immediate response with calcium intensity from the first post-stimulus imaging frame consistently exceeding the threshold.</p>
<p>We have added additional details to the Results (page 5), Discussion (page 9), and Methods (page 15) sections. A representative image showing both the stimulated GC and the recorded PC has been added to Figure 2 in the revised manuscript (see Figure 2K).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) It is unclear how connectivity between specific PC and GC is determined for single neuron connectivity. In other images (Figure 4C), there are usually multiple starter cells and many GCs. It was not shown that the image resolution can establish clear axon dendritic contacts between cell pairs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our experiments, sparse labeling typically results in 1–10 starter cells per fish. Regarding the case shown in Figure 4C (right column), only two PC starters were labeled, which simplifies the assignment of presynaptic inputs to individual PCs. Connectivity is determined based on clear axon-dendritic or axon-cell body apposition between GCs and PCs. We have accordingly added more details to the Methods (page 16) section regarding how we determined connectivity between specific PCs and GCs.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors establish reagents and define experimental parameters useful for defining neurons retrograde to a neuron of interest.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A clever approach, careful optimization, novel reagents, and convincing data together lead to convincing conclusions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In the current version of the manuscript, the tracing results could be better centered with  respect to past work, certain methods could be presented more clearly, and other approaches worth considering.</p>
<p>Appraisal/Discussion:</p>
<p>Trans-neuronal tracing in the larval zebrafish preparation has lagged behind rodent models,limiting &quot;circuit-cracking&quot; experiments. Previous work has demonstrated that pseudotyped rabies virus-mediated tracing could work, but published data suggested that there was considerable room for optimization. The authors take a major step forward here, identifying a number of key parameters to achieve success and establishing new transgenic reagents that incorporate modern intersectional approaches. As a proof of concept, the manuscript concludes with a rough characterization of inputs to cerebellar Purkinje cells. The work will be of considerable interest to neuroscientists who use the zebrafish model.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The main limitations of the work are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The optimizations might differ for different neurons. Purkinje cells are noteworthy because they develop considerably during the time window detailed here, almost doubling in number between 7-14dpf. Presumably, connectivity follows. This sort of neurogenesis is much less common elsewhere. It would be useful to show similar results in, say, tectal neurons, which would have spatially-restricted retinal ganglion cells labelled.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge that Purkinje cells (PCs) undergo significant development between 7–14 dpf, which may influence synaptic connectivity and result in differences in tracing efficiency. However, all experimental conditions were standardized across groups, and the selection of starter PCs was unbiased, typically focusing on PCs in the lateral region of the CCe (corpus cerebelli) subregion, ensuring that the relative comparisons remain valid.</p>
<p>We agree that testing other neuronal populations would be valuable, as tracing efficiency is influenced by multiple factors, such as the number of endogenous inputs, synaptic maturation, and developmentally regulated synaptic strength. Tectal neurons, which receive spatially restricted retinal ganglion cell inputs, would be a suitable choice for further investigation. However, due to the various tectal cell types and the opacity of the eyeball, such studies present additional technical challenges and are beyond the scope of this paper.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The virus is delivered by means of microinjection near the cell. This is invasive and challenging for labs that dont routinely perform electrophysiology. It would be useful to know if coarser methods of viral delivery (e.g. intraventricular injection) would be successful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our protocol does not require the level of precision needed for electrophysiology. The procedure can be performed using a standard high-magnification upright (135× magnification, Nikon SMZ18) or inverted fluorescence microscope (200× magnification, Olympus IX51). The virus suspension was loaded into a glass micropipette with a ~10 µm tip diameter and directly microinjected into the target region using a micromanipulator. The procedure was comparable to embryonic microinjection in terms of precision and operational control. Notably, direct contact with the target cells is not necessary, as the injected virus solution can diffuse and effectively infect nearby cells.</p>
<p>We had attempted intraventricular injection as an alternative, but it failed to produce robust labeling, reinforcing the necessity for direct tissue injection.</p>
<p>We have now included additional methodological details in the Methods section (page 13).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Because of the combination of transgenic lines, plasmid injection, and viral type, it is often confusing to follow exactly what is being done for a particular experiment. It would be useful to specify the transgenic background used for each experiment using standard nomenclature e.g. &quot;Plasmids were injected into Tg(elavl3:GAL4) fish.&quot; This is particularly important for the experiments in Figure 4: it isnt clear what the background used for the sparse labels was.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank the reviewer for bringing this issue to our attention. In order to improve clarity, we have revised the figure legends to explicitly state the transgenic background, injected plasmids, and viral type used in each experiment, particularly for Figure 4.</p>

<p>(5) It would be useful to know if there were more apoptotic cells after transfection -- an acridine orange or comparable assay is recommended, rather than loss of fluorescence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to assess apoptosis using acridine orange staining or comparable assays. We agree that such methods can provide more direct detection of apoptotic events. However, we believe that the difference in cytotoxicity is already evident in our current data: SAD-infected cells exhibit greater loss than CVSinfected cells (see Figure 3D). This is consistent with previous observations in mice, where greater toxicity of SAD compared to CVS was demonstrated using propidium iodide (PI) staining in cultured cells (Reardon et al., 2016).</p>

<p>(8) The experiments in 2J-2L would be more convincing if they were performed on inferior olive inputs as well -- especially given the small size of the granule cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the reviewers observation that granule cells (GCs) are relatively small, which may underline the finding that, out of 33 stimulated GCs, only 15 were capable of eliciting calcium responses in putative postsynaptic PCs. However, in all 11 pairs where a single GC was successfully ablated, we observed a weakened calcium response in PCs after the ablation (see Figure 2M), suggesting our tracing approach specifically identifies synaptically coupled neurons. We have clarified this point in the revised manuscript (page 5).</p>
<p>We agree that verifying the IO inputs to PCs would strengthen the validity of our findings. However, in our experiments, the probability of tracing upstream IO cells was relatively low. This may be due to the developmental immaturity of the synapse and the fact that each PC typically receives input from a single IO cell. Additionally, the deep and distant anatomical location of the IO presents technical challenges for paired electrical stimulationcalcium imaging study. To address these limitations, we are currently exploring the integration of viral tracing and optogenetics to further investigate IO-PC connectivity in future studies.</p>

<p>(9) It would be useful if the manuscript discussed the efficacy of trans-synaptic labelling. What fraction of granule cell / olivary inputs to a particular Purkinje cell do the authors think their method captures?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an important point for assessing the efficacy of our trans-synaptic labeling. Ideally, electron microscopy (EM) data would provide the most precise evaluation. In the absence of EM data, we estimated the number of GCs, IOs and PCs using light microscopy-based cell counting.</p>
<p>At approximately 7 dpf, we manually counted 327 ± 14 PCs and 2318 ± 70 GCs in the Tg(2×en.cpce-E1B:tdTomato-CAAX) and Tg(cbln12:GAL4FF);Tg(5×UAS:EGFP) zebrafish cerebellum, across all subregions (Va, CCe, EG, and LCa). Given the developmental increase in the number of GCs and the fact that some GCs that have exclusively ipsilateral projections, and that a single PC would not receive input from all parallel fibers, we estimate that by 10–14 dpf, a single PC receives approximately 1000– 2000 GC inputs. Under optimal tracing conditions, we observed an average of 20 labeled GC inputs per PC, yielding a capture fraction of ~1–2%. Although this represents only a subset of total inputs, it is consistent with mammalian studies (Wall et al., 2010; Callaway et al., 2015), suggesting inherent limitations of this viral labeling approach.</p>
<p>For IO inputs, we counted 325 ± 26 inferior olivary neurons in Tg(elavl3:H2B-GCaMP6s) fish. A single PC likely receives input from one IO neuron, though an IO neuron may innervate multiple PCs. Accordingly, the observed capture rate for IO inputs was lower (7 out of 248 starters).</p>
<p>Further optimization is required to enhance the tracing efficiency. We have now incorporated a Discussion on this point in the revised manuscript (page 8).</p>
