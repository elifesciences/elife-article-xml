<abstract>
<p>Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have enabled major advances in neural organoid research, yet reconstructing spinal cord development in vitro remains challenging, as it requires mimicking the early environment of body axis elongation. Here, by exposing hPSCs to defined extrinsic signals, we directed their self-organizing capacity to generate organoids that recapitulate the transcriptional profile, cellular composition, and tissue architecture of the early human posterior spinal cord. Furthermore, we refined our culture system to more closely model the in vivo morphogenetic events of secondary neurulation. Using this approach, we identified cell intercalation—regulated by Yes-associated protein (YAP) activity—as a key morphogenetic mechanism driving de novo lumen formation and resolution. These biomimetic models provide a powerful platform to investigate the molecular and mechanical processes underlying human spinal cord development and offer new opportunities to elucidate the origins of neural tube defects, among the most common congenital defects.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The integration of stem cell biology and bioengineering has paved the way for the creation of in vitro organs. This field relies on pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), which can be directed into specific cell types through the careful regulation of signaling pathways. When combined with three-dimensional scaffolds, this method facilitates the formation of organoids—3D cellular structures that closely mimic the architecture of actual organs. Over the past decade, extensive research involving human PSCs has resulted in notable progress in the development of neural organoids. Groundbreaking studies have led to the creation of organoids that replicate neural structures such as the optic cup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Nakano et al., 2012</xref>), cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kadoshima et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lancaster et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lancaster and Knoblich, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Pasca et al., 2015</xref>), midbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jo et al., 2016</xref>), hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kasai et al., 2020</xref>), and brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Eura et al., 2020</xref>), all of which closely resemble their in vivo counterparts in terms of organization and function.</p>
<p>However, reconstructing spinal cord development in vitro has proven to be a complex challenge, as it demands a culture environment that closely resembles the early stages of body axis elongation and the associated signaling mechanisms. During embryonic development, the spinal cord originates from a population of bipotent stem cells termed neuro-mesodermal progenitors (NMPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Tzouanacou et al., 2009</xref>), which are organized within a transient embryonic structure known as the neural tube (NT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Saade and Martí, 2025</xref>). Spinal cord morphogenesis differs along its anterior-posterior axis: most of the NT (including the regions that will develop into the brain and the anterior spinal cord) forms via primary neurulation, but the establishment of the posterior region of the spinal cord involves de novo formation in a process named secondary neurulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Saade and Martí, 2025</xref>).</p>
<p>Human PSCs can be directed to form NMPs by mimicking key events of early embryogenesis in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gouti et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">2014</xref>). These NMPs then organize themselves into spinal cord-like organoids, exhibiting several hallmark features of the spinal cord, such as the formation of patterned neuronal subsets with distinct dorsal-ventral identities, self-directed axial elongation, and gene expression profiles characteristic of specific spinal cord regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gribaudo et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Libby et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Xue et al., 2024</xref>). Additionally, these organoids can partially replicate NT morphogenesis through primary neurulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Karzbrun et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lee et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Rito et al., 2025</xref>). However, effective in vitro models of secondary neurulation, crucial for studying the origins of congenital NT defects (NTDs), are still lacking in the field.</p>
<p>Here we set to generate human spinal cord organoids, by exposing hPSCs to various extrinsic signals which play crucial roles in controlling the temporal and spatial regulation of gene expression necessary for building the NT along the anterior-to-posterior embryo axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Simunovic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Turner et al., 2017</xref>). Our screening strategy demonstrated that the self-assembling properties of hPSC can be directed to generate organoids to mimic the developmental time window and the correct posterior axis identity of the early human embryo posterior spinal cord.</p>
<p>Moreover, to investigate the tissue dynamics of secondary neurulation, we refined our in vitro system to more closely mimic the in vivo morphogenetic process. In our posterior organoid model of secondary neurulation, we demonstrated that cell intercalation, regulated by the activity of Yes-associated protein (YAP), acts as a key morphogenetic mechanism for lumen formation. This indicates a conserved mechanism, similar to that observed in chick embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gonzalez-Gobartt et al., 2021</xref>). Collectively, these findings establish the first human organoids with a posterior spinal cord transcriptional identity and provide a reliable model of secondary neurulation, which may advance our understanding of the biological basis of NTDs.</p>

<title>Generation of human neural organoids with different anterior-posterior identities</title>
<p>During neural tube (NT) formation and elongation, progenitor cells are sequentially exposed to a variety of extrinsic signals, including members of the TGFβ/BMP, WNT, FGF and RA signalling families (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). These signals play crucial roles in controlling the temporal and spatial regulation of gene expression, which in turn regulates lineage restriction and the generation of specific cell identities necessary for building a functional nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Olivera-Martinez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ribes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wilson and Hemmati-Brivanlou, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wilson et al., 2009</xref>).

<p>Members of the TGFβ/BMP signalling pathway are known to be present and active during neural induction and neural plate formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wilson and Hemmati-Brivanlou, 1995</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> studies conducted in both 2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chambers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Verrier et al., 2018</xref>) and 3D cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Haremaki et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>) have reported that double inhibition of TGFβ and BMP leads to rapid neural conversion. We initially seeded human embryonic stem cells (hESC; RUES2) on matrigel and cultured them in neural induction medium (N2B27) with transient inhibition of BMP and TGFβ signalling (48-hour treatment with the BMP type I receptor ALK1-3 inhibitor LDN193189, and the TGFβ type I receptor ALK4,5,7 inhibitor SB431542). This resulted in the organization of multicellular cysts, termed neural organoids, consistently composed of SOX2+ cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B, D</xref>). Concomitantly with the neural lineage restriction of hESCs, these SOX2+ cells underwent epithelialization, as evidenced by the apical localization of aPKC, and self-organized around a single central lumen (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). A 48-hour pulse of TGFβ/BMP inhibition mimicked neural induction, as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Ogura et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Simunovic et al., 2019</xref>), but some neural organoids still expressed Bra, likely because the inhibition period was shorter than in earlier studies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B, D</xref>).</p>
<p>Our aim was to establish a combination of extrinsic signals that closely mimics the environment of the elongating embryo, and hence the posterior spinal cord formation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). This combination should effectively guide the conversion of NMP cells, as monitored by the dynamic expression of SOX2/BRA, and consecutively promote the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition and the self-organization around a single lumen. To begin to mimic the signalling environment of the posterior embryo, we exposed the hESC to the WNT agonist CHIR (CHIR99021) for initial 24 hours followed by a 48 hours pulse along with basic FGF (bFGF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Edri et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Takemoto et al., 2006</xref>). Consistent with previous studies in mouse ES cells and mouse epiblast cells, this resulted in the transient presence of BRA+ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Edri et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Koch et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, this condition appeared to be insufficient to guide neural progenitor conversion, reflected by the failure of the maintained SOX2+ expressing cells, the lack of complete a MET, and the failure to organize a central lumen (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1F</xref>). In vivo, the neural specification from NMPs is regulated by Noggin (a BMP antagonist) secreted by the notochord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">McMahon et al., 1998</xref>). To mimic this embryonic environment, we next exposed hESCs to WNT/bFGF along with TGFβ and/or BMP inhibition, to burst neural induction. Results showed that, in the presence of WNT/bFGF, neither BMP inhibition alone, nor the double TGFβ/BMP inhibition, were sufficient to promote a robust neural conversion, since the percentage of organoids fully formed by SOX2+ cells were low in both culture conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1B,C</xref>).</p>
<p>In the elongating embryo, Retinoic Acid (RA) mainly secreted from the somites (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) plays an instructive role by opposing WNT activity and regulating the balance between the NMP cell fate and neural identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Del Corral et al., 2003</xref>). Hence, we next exposed hESCs to neural induction medium supplemented with WNT/bFGF, BMP inhibition, and RA for 48 hours. After three days in culture, hESCs efficiently formed small organoids consisting of NMP-resembling cells expressing SOX2/BRA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 C,D</xref>). The temporal evolution of these NT organoids also resembled the lineage restriction of NMP cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, with the presence of BRA+ cells gradually decreasing. Furthermore, these organoids efficiently self-organized to form a single central lumen (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 C,D</xref>). We next tested whether, in the presence of RA, BMP inhibition was dispensable for the formation of these neural organoids. After three days of growing hESCs in medium supplemented with WNT/bFGF and RA for 48 hours, organoids were formed where the presence of BRA+ cells decreased along the time in culture, while that of SOX2+ cells was low (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 D</xref>; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1 E</xref>), altogether indicating the relevance of BMP inhibition for an efficient neural induction.</p>
<p>Next, to investigate whether the caudal limit observed in mouse ESC differentiation without WNT signalling is conserved in human cells, we examined organoids generated from hESCs cultured under conditions that inhibited TGFβ/BMP activity. In these organoids, the presence of CDX2+ cells was rare, indicating an anterior identity of these organoids (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). However, when hESCs were cultured in the presence of WNT/bFGF, BMP inhibition, and RA, organoids consistently and robustly exhibited the presence of CDX2+ cells, indicative of a posterior (spinal cord) identity of these organoids (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1D</xref>). In summary, we generated neural organoids exhibiting a posterior spinal cord identity using an in vitro protocol that mimics the elongating embryonic environment and that, compared with previous methods, requires a shorter treatment pulse to establish this identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Iyer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Maury et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Tang et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, to demonstrate the robustness of our protocol in generating neural organoids, we utilized induced pluripotent stem cell (human iPSC) lines, namely Kolf2-C1 and CRTD1. We cultured these iPSCs in neural induction medium with different conditions to guide the generation of organoids with distinct anterior and posterior identities. When iPSCs were cultured with transient inhibition of TGFβ/BMP signalling for 48h, they were directed to form NT organoids with anterior neural identity. In contrast, iPSCS cultured in neural induction medium with WNT/bFGF, BMP inhibition, and RA formed organoids where the temporal evolution resembled that of lineage restriction of NMP cells in vivo (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2A-G</xref>). These findings demonstrate that the self-assembling properties of human pluripotent stem cells can be directed to generate NT organoids with defined anterior and posterior identities.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Transcriptome profiling of neural organoids revealed different anterior and posterior identities</title>
<p>To better define the identity of the <italic>in vitro</italic>-generated neural organoids, we performed bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) using three biological replicates of anterior (A) and three replicates of posterior (P) neural organoids (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). These organoids were generated from human embryonic stem cells (hESC; RUES2) and were grown <italic>in vitro</italic> for 6 days. During this culture period, the organoids acquired the A and P identities, respectively, but neurogenesis was not yet initiated.</p>

<p>We employed the DNASEQ platform from BGI to identify 17,462 genes, with an average mapping ratio to the reference genome of 98.03% (Reference Genome Version: GCF_000001405.39_GRCh38.p13). The Pearson correlation coefficients between samples revealed low gene expression variability among the three A and the three P organoid samples (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). A total of 8,728 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified when comparing the transcriptomes of A and P organoids, confirming the distinct identities of these two types of neural organoids (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>We first examined the overall tissue identity of these organoids by assessing the combinatorial expression of a curated set of marker genes previously used to classify tissue types in early human embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Rayon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Zeng et al., 2023</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). This analysis revealed that the generated organoids were primarily composed of neural cells. A mesodermal component was detected in the posterior organoids, consistent with the neuro-mesodermal identity of early spinal cord progenitors. In contrast, endodermal gene expression was largely absent from both anterior and posterior neural organoids.</p>
<p>Next, to investigate the antero-posterior identity of the neural organoids, we mapped anterior (A) and posterior (P) samples onto the spatial transcriptome of neural tube cells from early human embryos at Carnegie stage 7 (week 3 of development), which encompasses the forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain, and spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Zeng et al., 2023</xref>). In A organoid samples, we observed strong expression of <italic>SIX3</italic> and <italic>OTX2</italic>, consistent with a forebrain-like identity, whereas these genes were nearly absent in P samples (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3A</xref>). Midbrain-associated genes, including <italic>EN1</italic> and <italic>FGF17</italic>, were expressed at low levels in both A and P organoids. By contrast, hindbrain- and spinal cord–defining genes were expressed at higher levels in P than in A organoids, consistent with their posterior identity (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3A</xref>). Moreover, HOX gene expression, which reflects the established antero-posterior patterning of the hindbrain and spinal cord, was largely restricted to posterior organoids (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3A</xref>).</p>
<p>To refine the spatial characterization of A and P organoids, we next compared our samples with RNA-sequencing data from forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain, and spinal cord samples of human embryos at Carnegie stage 14 (corresponding to week 5 of development), a stage comparable to mouse embryonic day 10, when neurogenesis in the spinal cord is just beginning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lindsay et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we examined the expression levels of a diagnostic panel of 41 genes that are specifically expressed along the antero-posterior axis of the developing CNS in distinct domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Akin and Nazarali, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Basson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Deng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">de Vries et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hirata et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kumamoto and Hanashima, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Porter et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yan et al., 2011</xref>). Principal components analysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>) and hierarchical clustering (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>) of expression profile for all samples confirmed that A organoid samples group together with the anterior nervous system samples, including CS14 forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain controls, whereas P organoid samples were closer to the CS14 spinal cord control.</p>
<p>Detail examination of individual markers revealed that although anterior organoids exhibited similarity with forebrain samples, genes expressed in the dorsal telencephalon and neural retina domains, such as <italic>EMX2</italic>, <italic>RAX2</italic>, <italic>FOXG1</italic>, <italic>LHX2</italic>, <italic>FEZF2</italic>, and <italic>DLX2</italic> show low expression levels in the organoids (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). This finding suggests that our culturing conditions did not favour the <italic>in vitro</italic> specification of the precursors towards dorsal retina and forebrain identities. Instead, they directed them towards ventral midbrain and retinal (i.e., optic stalk) derivatives, as indicated by the expression of genes like <italic>VAX1</italic>, <italic>SIX6</italic>, <italic>SIX3</italic>, or <italic>FEZF1</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>).</p>
<p>On the contrary, the gene expression clustering of P organoids samples revealed the remarkable absence of brain-specific gene markers, while these neural progenitors are capable of generating a full range of anterior-posterior spinal cord derivatives (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). As such, the P organoids expressed both anterior (e.g., <italic>HOX2-4</italic>) and posterior <italic>HOX</italic> (e.g., <italic>HOX9-10</italic>) spinal cord genes, as well as very distal markers such as <italic>CDX2</italic> or <italic>EFNA2</italic>.</p>
<p>Next, we assessed the dorso-ventral (DV) identity of the posterior NT organoids by examining a diagnostic panel of 35 DV markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Alaynick et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Rayon et al., 2021</xref>) (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3B, C</xref>). This analysis revealed that in contrast to the CS14 spinal cord controls, which expressed a full range of DV markers, our posterior NT organoids have a dorsal identity, with most ventral genes (e.g. <italic>SHH</italic>, <italic>NKX2.2</italic>, or <italic>OLIG2</italic>) being almost absent (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3 B, C</xref>). However, this dorsal identity of the organoids reflects an early developmental stage in spinal cord formation, and it is consistent with our culture condition which is lacking any ventralization signal such as Sonic hedgehog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Saade and Martí, 2025</xref>). Hence, for these early organoids to form a bona fide spinal cord biomodel, symmetry breaking is further required by the addition of ventralizing signals such as Sonic hedgehog to the culture media, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Krammer et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>Importantly though, to our knowledge these are the first neural organoids exhibiting a robust spinal cord transcriptome identity, including the most posterior spinal cord, at the regions were the NT is developed through the morphogenetic process called secondary neurulation (SN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Saade and Martí, 2025</xref>).</p>

<title>Neural organoids are organized by cells exhibiting cell architecture and dynamics resembling those of the early neural tube progenitor cells</title>
<p>Regardless of the differential origin along the anterior to posterior axis of the NT, the architecture of the early embryonic NT (midbrain/hindbrain and spinal cord) is conserved along its entire A P axis, consisting on a hollow tube built by highly polarized neural progenitor cells (NPCs).

<p>During NPCs elongation, the perinuclear centrosome relocates apically, as indicated by its alignment with N-Cadherin expression along the NT lumen. <italic>En face</italic> imaging of organoids revealed the localization of N-Cadherin to the NPC apical belt and the central localization of Pericentrin (PCNT+) labelled centrosomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 C, D</xref>). Quantification of the distance between the PCNT+ labelled centrosomes and the nucleus showed their apical localization in elongated NPCs of both in both A and P organoids (median ±IQR distance mesenchymal cells = 1.46 ±0.63 μm vs P organoids NPCs = 7.21 ±7.55 μm, and A organoids NPCs = 10.18 ±11.54 μm; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 C,D</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4 C, D</xref>). The distance of PCNT+ centrosomes from the nucleus exhibited wide variation, which could be attributed to the onset of interkinetic nuclear migration (INM), a process that separates or brings together the centrosome and the nucleus depending on the phase of the cell cycle, similar to what occurs in the developing NT <italic>in vivo</italic>. These findings indicate that our organoids display cellular and subcellular organization resembling that of the embryonic NT, including the elongation of NPCs and the apical localization of centrosomes in relation to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Saade et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>NPCs are characterized by the presence of a single primary cilium at their apical surface, which is nucleated by the basal body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blanco-Ameijeiras et al., 2022</xref>), and extends into the lumen of the NT in the developing embryo. In both P and A organoids, the lumen surface was found to be decorated with primary cilia, identified by the expression of the protein ADP-ribosylation factor-like 13b (ARL13B), which specifically associates with the ciliary membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Paridaen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Saade et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 E</xref>). The length and dynamics of these primary cilia in human NPCs generated <italic>in vitro</italic> were similar to those observed in the chick embryo NT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Saade et al., 2020</xref>). The length of Arl13b-labeled cilia protruding from the centrosome at the lumen of organoids was measured and showed comparable values (median ± IQR length: mesenchymal cells = 1.86 ± 0.98 μm; P organoids NPCs = 1.29 ± 0.92 μm; A organoids NPCs = 1.11 ± 1.03 μm; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 E, F</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4 B</xref>). During mitosis in organoids, ARL13B was observed to accumulate near one of the centrosomes that nucleated the mitotic spindle (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 E’</xref>). This finding suggests that, similar to observations in the developing mouse neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Paridaen et al., 2013</xref>) and the chick embryo NT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Saade et al., 2017</xref>), in organoids the primary cilia were not completely disassembled before mitosis. To further confirm the apical localization of the cilia, 3D reconstructions of the apical end foot of NPCs were generated, which revealed the presence of a single cilia pointing towards the lumen in organoids (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 E’’</xref>). These observations demonstrate that P and A organoids exhibit the characteristic presence and localization of primary cilia, similar to the NPCs in the developing NT.</p>
<p>During NT formation, the apical membrane of NPCs undergoes reorganization into distinct micro-domains. In these micro-domains, specific proteins involved in junctional complexes (such as N-cadherin, α-catenin, and β-catenin) are located in the subapical domain, zonular proteins (including ZO1, afadin, and actin) occupy an intermediate position, and fate-determining factors (such as PAR3, aPKC, and prominin-1) are confined to the most external domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aaku-Saraste et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Afonso and Henrique, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chenn et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Marthiens and ffrench-Constant, 2009</xref>). Transversal and <italic>en face</italic> imaging of organoids revealed the localization of N-Cadherin and β-Catenin at the apical belt of NPCs, resembling the distribution observed <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4E,F</xref>). Furthermore, co-staining of aPKC and ZO1 demonstrated that NPCs within both A and P organoids organize membrane microdomains lining the lumen, closely resembling the organization seen in NPCs of the developing NT. In this arrangement, the aPKC microdomain faces the organoid lumen and is positioned external to the ZO1 membrane domain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 G,H</xref>). These analyses collectively indicate that both A and P human organoids are composed of NPCs exhibiting a cell and tissue architecture highly similar to that of the early embryonic NT.</p>
<p>To directly investigate the dynamics of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) within the human organoids we employed the piggyBac™ transposon system (pCAG-PBase) to electroporate hESCs with a GFP vector (PBCAG-eGFP). The GFP-expressing hESCs were cultured under conditions that guide the formation of mosaic posterior neural organoids, which were then imaged using an Andor Dragonfly 505 confocal microscope. This imaging system allowed organoids to grow at a similar rate as in normal culture conditions and enabled the segmentation and tracking of fluorescently labelled electroporated cells over time (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 A, B</xref>). Time-lapse imaging of human organoids revealed the stereotypic movement pattern of NPCs synchronized with the cell cycle, known as INM <sup>61</sup>. GFP+ cells in contact with the organoid ventricle displayed a high circularity associated with the rounded nucleus during mitosis (M) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="video1">Supp. Movies S1, S2</xref>). Tracking the GFP+ cells allowed us to estimate the total cell cycle length within a span of 40 hours by measuring the time taken between cell shape changes, as well as the time taken for cells to transit from the organoid lumen to the basal end and back to the lumen (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="video1">Supp. Movies S1, S2</xref>). Throughout the cell cycle, the nucleus of NPCs exhibited specific movements: during the G1 phase, the nucleus travelled basally, and the cell extended two feet contacting the apical and basal tissue limits; during the S phase, the nucleus contacted the basal region (periphery of the organoid); and during the G2 phase, the nucleus travelled apically toward the organoid lumen, while the cell extended two feet contacting the apical and basal regions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="video1">Supp. Movies S1, S2</xref>). Additionally, cell tracking enabled the estimation of the duration of different cell cycle phases: G1 phase (median ±IQR time = 2.25 ±5.12 hours), S phase (median ±IQR time = 26.75 ±7 hours), G2 phase (median ±IQR time = 9.5 ±3.63 hours), and M phase (median ±IQR time = 1 ±0.38 hours) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="video1">Supp. Movies S1, S2</xref>).</p>

<p>Neurogenesis in the embryonic NT requires the detachment of newly born neurons from the neuroepithelium, referred to as delamination. This process plays a key role in ensuring the correct positioning of neurons, which is essential for shaping neuronal architecture and establishing functional circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Saade and Martí, 2025</xref>). Results show that, cells expressing pan-neuronal markers such as Tuj1, detach from the organoid lumen, delaminate laterally to occupy the periphery of the organoid, mimicking the behavior of primary neurogenesis in the embryonic spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Saade and Martí, 2025</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 F</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, these data demonstrated the robustness of the <italic>in vitro</italic> generated neural organoids, not only in terms of transcriptional identity but also in terms of cellular architecture and dynamics. Consequently, these unique biomodels can be utilized to investigate the biological processes involved in posterior spinal cord development, which is poorly understood but crucial as abnormalities during this process can lead to neural tube defects, among the most common birth defects observed in humans.</p>

<title>Modelling secondary neurulation in human spinal cord organoids</title>
<p>Our current understanding of how the posterior spinal cord develops in human embryos is fragmentary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">O’Rahilly and Müller, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Saitsu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Saitsu and Shiota, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Santos et al., 2023</xref>), and it is largely based on studies in vertebrate animal models. In the chick embryo, we have shown that the confinement of NMPs into the prospective medullary cord (which is the immediate precursor of the secondary NT, or SNT) is concomitant with the deposition of an extracellular matrix (ECM) containing classical cell-surface-associated glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gonzalez-Gobartt et al., 2021</xref>) As NMPs transform into fully epithelialized NPCs, multiple small lumens emerge <italic>de novo</italic> at the interface between the peripheral epithelial and central mesenchymal cell populations. These small lumen foci appear at a distance equivalent to one cell’s length from the developing basement membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gonzalez-Gobartt et al., 2021</xref>)</p>
<p>In line with this <italic>in vivo</italic> process, our study demonstrated that hESCs possess an intrinsic capacity to self-polarize and self-organize around a single central lumen. However, it should be noted that our culture conditions involve the clonal growth of small clusters of hESCs, where all the cells are in contact with a matrigel basement membrane-like environment. As a result, the forming organoids lack central cells with mesenchymal polarity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 B, C</xref>). To better mimic the <italic>in vivo</italic> secondary neurulation cell rearrangements, we hypothesized that starting with a larger clump of hESCs would allow the presence of central cells isolated from the matrigel. Hence, we maintained GFP-expressing hESCs in agitation for 48 hours to form cell aggregates with mesenchymal features (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 A, B</xref>). After transferring these aggregates into 3D matrigel and culturing them in neural induction medium supplemented with WNT/bFGF, BMP inhibition, and RA, neural organoids were formed. In these organoids, peripheral cells elongated and acquired epithelial polarity while central cells retained mesenchymal morphology, resembling the embryonic medullary cord (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 B</xref>). Importantly, under these culture conditions, de novo emergence of small lumen foci occurred at a distance equivalent to one cell’s length from the matrigel. Over time, these small foci resolved into a single central lumen (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 B</xref>), closely resembling the morphogenetic events observed during posterior spinal cord development in both humans and chick embryos through secondary neurulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gonzalez-Gobartt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">O’Rahilly and Müller, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Saitsu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Saitsu and Shiota, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Santos et al., 2023</xref>).</p>

<p>Notably, this capacity to organize a solid medullary cord and to open multilumens is restricted to the Posterior neural organoids. Results show that hESC that were maintained in agitation for 48 hours to form cell aggregates with mesenchymal features, when guided to form Anterior neural organoids by a 48-hour pulse of TGFβ/BMP inhibition, rarely organize multiple lumens (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5A-F</xref>). The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified when comparing the transcriptomes of A and P organoids (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), might be dictating these different tissue behaviours further indicating that, this is a morphogenetic property associated to the transcriptional identity of posterior spinal cord organoids, that indeed mimics the morphogenesis of the posterior secondary NT of the elongating embryo.</p>
<p>In the chick embryo posterior spinal cord, the resolution into a single lumen involves the intercalation of centrally located cells among the epithelialized NPCs, a process independent of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gonzalez-Gobartt et al., 2021</xref>). Our analysis of the human posterior NT organoids aimed to test the conservation of these mechanisms. We tracked the dynamics of GFP-expressing cells within the posterior NT organoids using time-lapse microscopy (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 C</xref>). Observations of GFP+ cells revealed the presence of round mesenchymal cells located centrally within the organoids (indicated by a red asterisk and depicted in the initial time-points in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 D</xref>). Importantly, we consistently observed these central cells intercalating into the lateral walls of the neuroepithelium, resulting in a lateral movement away from the centre of the organoid (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="video3">Supp. Movies S3-6</xref>). Notably, the intercalating cells exhibited a round shape and displayed high protrusiveness. The intercalation of these cells consistently led to cell elongation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 E, F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="video3">Supp. Movies S3-6</xref>). These findings suggest that the intercalation of centrally located cells into the lateral walls of the neuroepithelium, resulting in cell elongation, is a conserved mechanism for the resolution into a single continuous lumen in the posterior human NT organoids, similar to what is observed in the chick embryo secondary neural tube formation. Importantly, this process does not involve apoptosis, as demonstrated by the absence of cleaved caspase-3 staining in the peripheral NPCs or the inner cells surrounded by forming lumens in the organoids (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5 G-I</xref>).</p>

<p>In our analysis of posterior NT organoids, we made an intriguing observation regarding cell density during the process of cell intercalation.

<p>To investigate the role of YAP in lumen resolution, we examined endogenous YAP protein levels in Posterior human neural organoids during the clearance of central mesenchymal cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Immunostaining for YAP revealed that active YAP, assessed by the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, was higher in the central intercalating cells than in the peripheral NPCs (median ± IQR nuclear/cytoplasmic YAP ratio in central cells = 0.43 ± 0.20 vs. peripheral cells = 0.30 ± 0.11; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). This pattern of YAP activity correlates with the observed shift in cell density—from lower density in the central region to higher density in the peripheral NPCs (median ± IQR cell area in central cells = 178 ± 66.3 µm² vs. peripheral cells = 115 ± 37.8 µm²; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). These findings suggest a conserved role for YAP activity in regulating cell intercalation and lumen resolution in human organoids, consistent with previous observations in the chick embryo, where YAP activity governs lumen resolution during secondary neurulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gonzalez-Gobartt et al., 2021</xref>)</p>

<p>To further investigate the requirement of YAP activity in cell intercalation and lumen resolution, we conducted experiments using dasatinib, a C-SRC/YAP1 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hsu et al., 2018</xref>). 3D image reconstruction of NT organoids showed that after 4 days in matrigel, the control organoids resolve a single central lumen, while dasatinib -treated organoids present a multilumen phenotype (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 D, E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="video7">Supp. Movies S7 and 8</xref>). Following the secondary neurulation morphogenic progression, we observed that control organoids after 3 days of culture in matrigel had already coalesced the lumen foci into a single central lumen (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 F, G</xref>; day 2 7/18, day3 21/21, day4 16/16). Conversely, the organoids treated with dasatinib were unable to resolve a single lumen and instead exhibited a multi-lumen phenotype even after 4 days of culture, resembling neural tube defects (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 H, I</xref>; day 2 1/8, day3 2/5, day4 4/18). This indicates the crucial role of YAP activity in the proper resolution of lumens and suggests that dysregulation of YAP signalling could contribute to neural tube defects such as spinal bifida.</p>
<p>These findings demonstrate that the Posterior human NT organoids not only exhibit a transcriptome profile resembling the developing spinal cord of the early human embryo, but also replicate cellular dynamics observed during the morphogenesis of the human embryo’s secondary neural tube. This biomodel provides a unique platform to directly study the underlying mechanisms of neural tube defects such as spinal bifida.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we successfully replicated the early morphogenesis of the posterior human spinal cord using <italic>in vitro</italic> techniques. We directed human pluripotent stem cells, including both embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, to differentiate into neural cells, specifically those with a spinal cord identity. By creating a culture environment that mimicked the conditions of the elongating embryo, we generated 3D organoids that exhibited a transcriptional profile indicative of spinal cord tissue. These spinal cord organoids were composed of neuroepithelial cells that displayed a subcellular architecture and dynamics similar to that of the early embryonic NT, as well as reproducing the transcriptome identity of the early embryo spinal cord (5 weeks of development). Numerous organoids have been developed that mimic several traits of NT development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gouti et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gribaudo et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Karzbrun et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lee et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Libby et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Rito et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Xue et al., 2024</xref>); nonetheless, compared to previous, the protocol described in this study is shorter. Moreover, the cellular dynamics observed in the organoids also resembled the morphogenetic events involved in secondary neurulation, a process poorly understood, hence these models might bridge the knowledge gap regarding the formation of the human posterior spinal cord.</p>
<p>This understanding is crucial for elucidating the biological bases of neural tube defects (NTDs) which are frequent congenital disorders, thereby providing significant medical insights into primary prevention and reduce suffering caused by loss of movement in the legs, and bladder and bowel dysfunction, caused by NTDs such as spina bifida. Even though NTDs are common congenital malformations, their causes remain largely unknown. Environmental risks, such as folic acid deficiency and maternal diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Blom et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">McNeely and Howes, 2004</xref>) yet do not account for the estimated heritability of 60–70%. A recent large-scale study identified 187 genes with damaging de novo mutations in individuals with spina bifida (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ha et al., 2025</xref>). These genes cluster in developmental pathways, including Wnt signalling, planar cell polarity (PCP), and cytoskeleton regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ha et al., 2025</xref>), but the cell- and tissue-level consequences remain unclear. Two further studies highlighted structural variants as genetic risk factors: for 22q11.2 deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Vong et al., 2024</xref>) and rare copy number variations in genes associated with metabolic pathways and the WNT/ PCP pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Wolujewicz et al., 2021</xref>). These genetic data, together with our experimental analysis in the chick embryo secondary neurulation, support the hypothesis that NTDs might arise from defects in the NMPC dynamics, such as a) the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition of NMPCs required for full epithelialization of progenitor cells in building the caudal NT, and b) the tissue rearrangements required for the de novo lumen formation and single lumen resolution, to build a hollow NT. These are morphogenetic processes that are still to be revealed in human development, and the organoids engineered in this study holds promise for advancing our understanding of the biological bases and the tissue dynamics associated with secondary neurulation.</p>
<p>Our previous study conducted in chick embryos revealed the involvement of YAP/TAZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gonzalez-Gobartt et al., 2021</xref>), which act as key sensors of cell density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Piccolo et al., 2014</xref>), in the intercalation of central cells during the resolution of the lumen in the secondary NT Moreover, the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and the activation of YAP are required and play differential roles in modulating different phases of neural organoids self-organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Tang et al., 2022</xref>). Consistent with this model, human spinal cord organoids generated in this study exhibited higher levels of nuclear (active) YAP in the central cells compared to the peripheral neuroepithelial cells. Furthermore, when the Hippo pathway, which regulates YAP/TAZ activity, was blocked using the pharmacological inhibitor Dasatinib, the process of lumen resolution was impaired, resulting in a multilumen phenotype resembling NTDs. These findings support the idea that the YAP pathway mediates lumen resolution in response to cell density during secondary neurulation. A mechano-transduction role for YAP in NT formation has been proposed in mouse embryos, since the surface ectoderm exhibits spatially heterogenous tension that correlates with YAP localisation during spinal NT closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Marshall et al., 2023</xref>). In addition, YAP regulates expression of key patterning factors (FoxA2, Shh), and can produce NTDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cheng et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>While further research is necessary to fully understand the mechanisms underlying secondary neurulation and its association with NTDs, the results of this study lay the groundwork for generating patient-derived organoids. This approach holds promise for advancing our understanding of diseases associated with secondary neurulation and may contribute to the development of improved therapeutic strategies including the use of YAP/TAZ activators to alleviate some NTDs.</p>

<title>Apoptotic index</title>
<p>Cleaved-Caspase3 (cCaspase3) antibody was used to detect apoptosis in fixed organoids. We counted both the number of cCapase3+ cells and the number of total DAPI cells for central cells and epithelialized cells. Percentages were then calculated and presented in GraphPad Prism 8 bar graphs (mean ± SD/s.e.m.).</p>

<sec id="s4c3">
<title>Cell shape</title>
<p>βCat antibody was used to visualize cell shape in fixed organoids. Cells were delimited with the polygon selection tool and cell shape was quantified by measuring cell aspect ratio (AR), a parameter included in ImageJ Shape descriptors. AR is calculated dividing major axis diameter between minor axis diameter, with a value of 1.0 indicating a perfect circle. As the value increase over 1, it indicates an increasingly elongated shape. Results are presented in GraphPad Prism 8 violin plots.</p>

<sec id="s4c4">
<title>Centrosome positioning</title>
<p>Centrosomes were visualized with PCNT antibody and DAPI was used to stain the nucleus in organoid samples. The straight line tool of ImageJ was used to draw a line from the centrosomes to the edge of the nucleus and the distance was measured. Results are presented in GraphPad Prism 8 violin plots.</p>

<title>Relative localization of proteins</title>
<p>ZO1 and aPKC antibodies were used to assess apical components organization. An intensity profile was generated from a line drawn along the cell’s major axis for ZO1, aPKC and DAPI. Thus, the relative apico-basal position is assessed. Results are plotted in GraphPad Prism 8 XY graphs.</p>
<p>Similarly, YAP antibody and Phalloidin and DAPI stainings were used to assess differences between nuclear and cytoplasmic YAP. An intensity profile was generated from a line drawn along the cell for YAP, Phalloidin and DAPI. Results are plotted in GraphPad Prism 8 XY graphs.</p>

<title>Quantification of YAP nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio</title>
<p>PB-GFP was electroporated in order to draw the cell shape in organoids neuroepithelial cells. DAPI staining was used to detect the nucleus. YAP was stained using a YAP antibody to assess protein levels. YAP activity was inferred from the ratio of nuclear over the cytoplasmic YAP protein levels. Nuclear regions were delimitated by hand in the ImageJ using DAPI staining as reference. Cytoplasmic region was estimated subtracting the nuclear area to the total cell area delimitated by hand in the ImageJ using the GFP staining as reference. YAP protein levels were assessed in the already defined nuclear and cytoplasmic areas through the ratio of RawIntDensity over the area extension using ImageJ/Fiji. Distance was presented in GraphPad Prism 8 violin plots.</p>

<title>Limitations of study</title>
<p>In the study, we acknowledge the presence of inter-organoid variability in the generated organoids. While we observed reduced variability compared to longer protocols for organoid generation, we still noted some variability within the droplets and cell lines used. Specifically, a small proportion of organoids did not exhibit the expected lineage restriction. This variability should be considered when utilizing the model for pharmacological screenings, and further refinement of the protocols may be necessary to improve the consistency and reliability of the organoid system.</p>

<p>This study presents a <bold>valuable</bold> human stem cell-derived organoid model that captures key morphological and cellular features of spinal cord development and provides evidence for a YAP-dependent mechanism of lumen formation relevant to secondary neurulation.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Blanco-Ameijeiras et al. present an organoid-based model of the caudal neural tube that builds upon established principles from embryonic development and prior organoid work. By systematically testing and refining signaling conditions, the authors generate caudal progenitor populations that self-organize into neuroepithelia with molecular features consistent with secondary neurulation. Bulk-RNA sequencing supports the emergence of caudal neural identities, and the authors further examine cellular features such as apico-basal polarity and interkinetic nuclear migration. Finally, they provide evidence for a conserved, YAP-dependent mechanism of tube formation specific to secondary neurulation. The manuscript provides valuable methodological resources, including troubleshooting guidance that will be especially useful for the field. While this work represents a significant advance toward modeling human spinal cord development - particularly the process of secondary neurulation - the claims of complete caudalization and full AP-axis representation require additional experimental support and clarification.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Methodological clarity and transparency: The first figure and accompanying text provide an exemplary explanation of protocol optimization and troubleshooting. This transparency - showing approaches that failed as well as those that succeeded - sets a high standard for reproducibility and will be highly beneficial to laboratories aiming to adopt or build upon this model.</p>
<p>(2) Testing across multiple cell lines: Multiple hPSC and hiPSC lines were evaluated, strengthening the robustness and generalizability of the reported protocol.</p>
<p>(3) Biological relevance: The focus on secondary neurulation fills a notable gap in current human organoid models of spinal cord development. The identification of YAP-dependent mechanisms in tube formation is a valuable insight with potential translational relevance.</p>
<p>(4) Resource creation: The detailed parameters and signaling regimes will serve as a resource for the spinal cord and organoid communities.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript over-interprets bulk RNA-seq data to make strong claims on the organoid AP patterning and caudalization. Bulk sequencing provides population-level averages and cannot confirm that individual organoids represent discrete AP levels. To support claims of generating every AP identity, the authors must perform staining or in situ hybridization for HOX genes on individual organoids. Further, the current interpretation of CDX2 as marking &quot;very distal&quot; identity is inaccurate in vitro; CDX2 marks caudal progenitors across the spinal cord axis. The language should be revised accordingly.</p>
<p>(2) The claim of being the first organoid system to model secondary neurulation overlooks prior work showing HOXC9 in human organoids (Xue et al., Nature 2024; Libby et al., Development 2021), which would reflect the beginning of secondary neurulation. While this system may indeed be the first isolated secondary neurulation organoid model that expresses HOXD9/10 - a meaningful advance - bulk RNA-seq alone is insufficient to support the exclusivity of this claim. Additional single-organoid-level spatial analyses (via immunofluorescence of in situ hybridisation) and frequency quantification of regional identities are required to fully characterize the system.</p>
<p>(3) Similarly, as written, there are overstatements taken from the bulk RNA sequencing to determine dorsal-ventral identity. Although dorsal markers are present, the dataset also contains ventral-associated genes (PAX6, SP8, NKX6-1, NKX6-2, PRDM12). To claim a &quot;dorsal-only&quot; identity, the authors should perform PAX7 immunostaining to demonstrate dorsalization of the entire organoid tissue.</p>
<p>(4) The studies identifying YAP as a key driver of lumen fusion in Figure 6 are important and should be extended to the apical organoid system to demonstrate that this is truly a feature of secondary neurulation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Blanco-Ameijeiras and colleagues present the use of stem cells to create human spinal cord organoids that recapitulate anterior-posterior identity, with a large focus on posterior fates. In particular, the authors show robust transcriptional landscape specification that reflects certain anterior-posterior spinal cord development.</p>
<p>Recapitulation of spinal cord development is essential to understand the fundamentals of developmental defects in a systematic manner. This work provides a broad approach to test certain aspects of neural tube morphogenesis, particularly posterior and dorsal identities. Perhaps the shorter protocol is an interesting upgrade for current standards, and the mechanical interpretation provides good proof of concept work that aligns with the need to better understand neural tube mechanobiology.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript addresses a major gap by focusing on posterior spinal cord identity and secondary neurulation, a phase that is less well captured by existing neural tube organoid models (although some do recapitulate that). The manuscript situates the approach within vertebrate development and human embryology.</p>
<p>Morphometric quantifications are well described and provide a dynamic interpretation of cell-level interpretation, and that is a true strength of the work. This is important to develop important metrics that can later be used to compare modulations and pathway disruption.</p>
<p>The protocols are well described and documented.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some key data lacks proper quantification to robustly support the claims. For example, it is not clear how many organoids in total are counted in Figure 1D to derive the % of organoids expressing certain markers (e.g. SOX2 or BRA).</p>
<p>Some claims are overstated. In the manuscript, the organoids show primarily dorsal and posterior identities under the current conditions, yet the discussion sometimes reads as if a more complete dorsoventral recapitulation is achieved. Therefore, one can either demonstrate ventral patterning (e.g., SHH / FOXA2) or reduce the claims about spinal cord identity, which, given the results, are more specific to a particular region.</p>
<p>The mention of anterior organoids seems to distract the reader from the important work, which primarily focuses on the posterior identity. Further, it is not understood why SOX2 identity is reduced by Day 7 in Figure 1D. Since SOX2 in the manuscript is considered a neural marker (although also pluripotency along with NANOG, etc.), a further explanation should be provided. The author should also test the presence of PAX6, which is one of the earliest neuroectoderm markers in humans (Zhang X. et al., Cell Stem Cell 2010).</p>
<p>The authors position the work as a substantial addition to the field. The work is very much welcomed; however, some claims align with an interpretation that leads the readers to understand a novelty that is beyond the work presented here. For example, in certain instances in the intro, the manuscript conveys that this work consists of the first recapitulation of spinal cord fates anterior or posterior, while other works (Rifes P. Nature Cell Biology 2020, Xue X. Nature 2024) recapitulate dorsoventral and anterior-posterior patterning and identity (albeit not of secondary neurulation) through controlled gradients of WNT and RA activity. To clearly position the importance of this work, the intro should focus on secondary neurulation and posterior identities.</p>
<p>In a similar fashion, the claim that &quot;Importantly though, to our knowledge these are the first neural organoids exhibiting a robust spinal cord transcriptome identity&quot; is not very well understood when other neural tube organoid systems (including spinal cord identities) have been exhaustively profiled at the single cell level (Rifes P. Xue X. Abdel Fattah A.). Further explanation is therefore needed.</p>
<p>The mechanical angle is important and adds to the large body of research that traces NT morphogenesis to mechanics. However, the YAP localization images can be much improved. Lower magnification images are needed to show the entire organoid to robustly convince the reader of the correct and varying localization of the YAP protein. The authors should also check for YAP-associated genes in their bulk RNA sequencing.</p>
<p>The quantification of the YAP analysis in a total of 23 and 18 cells in the two conditions and in 7 organoids is by no means enough to draw a conclusion about YAP localization, and an increase in the number of cells is needed. Moreover, the use of dasatinib as an inhibitor for YAP is great, but there is no evidence shown that in this culture system, the inhibitor actually inhibits YAP. As such, IF images are required to confirm cytosolic YAP. Additionally, the authors can try other inhibitors (such as verteporfin) since most inhibitors are broadband.</p>
<p>Given the mechanically oriented conclusions, other relevant works have shown posteriorized and ventralized neural tube organoids using RA and SHH activation, which were also mechanically stimulated via actuation, such as work done from the Ranga lab (Nature comm. 2021/2023). Although not strictly related to YAP, the therein molecular profiling, mechanical stimulation, lumen measurements, and NTD-like phenotype using PCP-mutated genes make these important relevant mentions since the current work adds important aspects with YAP analysis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Blanco-Ameijeiras and collaborators describe the 3D differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into the posterior spinal cord. The authors first test the exposure of different combinations of extrinsic signals to generate human neural organoids with distinct antero-posterior identities, as shown by bulk transcriptome analysis. They show that neural organoids, whether anterior or posterior, display tissue architecture, organisation and dynamics resembling the in vivo situation. Increasing the size of initial cell aggregates leads to the formation of a single lumen through a multi-lumen stage and a process of cell intercalation, mimicking the situation that they recently described for chick secondary neurulation (Gonzalez-Gobartt et al. Dev Cell. 2021 PMID: 33878300). The authors go on to show that, as in chick, YAP is involved in the resolution of multiple lumens into a single lumen. They conclude that their human organoid approach faithfully models human secondary neurulation, which may be instrumental in unravelling the mechanisms of human neural tube defects.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, this is an important study demonstrating that lumen formation in human spinal organoids recapitulates key aspects of secondary neurulation observed in animal models. This organoid approach may be instrumental in unravelling the mechanisms of human neural tube defects.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The significance of the findings is tempered by several limitations. While the authors show convincing evidence that organoids undergo lumen formation with similar morphological, cellular and molecular features as seen in chick in their previous work (Gonzalez-Gobartt et al. Dev Cell. 2021 PMID: 33878300), whether this is linked to their caudal spinal cord identity is unclear.</p>
