<title>Abstract</title><p>The evolutionary conservation of non-core RAG regions suggests significant roles that might involve quantitative or qualitative alterations in RAG activity. Off-target V(D)J recombination contributes to lymphomagenesis and is exacerbated by RAG2’ C-terminus absence in Tp53<sup>-/-</sup> mice thymic lymphomas. However, the genomic stability effects of non-core regions from both cRAG1 and cRAG2 in <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic><sup>+</sup> Blymphoblastic leukemia (<italic>BCR-ABL1</italic><sup>+</sup> B-ALL), the characteristics, and mechanisms of non-core regions in suppressing off-target V(D)J recombination remains unclear. Here, we established three mouse models of <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic><sup>+</sup> B-ALL in mice expressing full-length RAG (fRAG), core RAG1 (cRAG1), and core RAG2 (cRAG2). The cRAG (cRAG1 and cRAG2) leukemia cells exhibited greater malignant tumor characteristics compared to fRAG cells. Additionally, cRAG cells showed higher frequency of off-target V(D)J recombination and oncogenic mutations than fRAG. We also revealed decreased RAG cleavage accuracy in cRAG cells and a smaller recombinant size in cRAG1 cells, which could potentially exacerbate off-target V(D)J recombination in cRAG cells. In conclusion, these findings indicate that the non-core RAG regions, particularly the non-core region of RAG1, play a significant role in preserving V(D)J recombination precision and genomic stability in <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic><sup>+</sup> B-ALL.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>V(D)J recombination serves as the central process for early lymphocyte development and generates diversity in antigen receptors. This process involves the double-strand DNA breaks of gene segments by the V(D)J recombinase, including RAG1 and RAG2. RAG recognizes conserved recombination signal sequences (RSSs) positioned adjacent to V, D, and J gene segments. A bona fide RSS contains a conserved palindromic heptamer (consensus 5′-CACAGTG) and A-rich nonamer (consensus 5′-ACAAAAACC) separated by a degenerate spacer of either 12 or 23 base pairs (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hirokawa, et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Schatz and Ji, 2011</xref>)</italic></bold>. The process of efficient recombination is contingent upon the presence of recombination signal sequences (RSSs) with differing spacer lengths, as dictated by the “12/23 rule” (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Banerjee and Schatz, 2014</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Eastman, et al., 1996</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Shi, et al., 2020</xref>)</italic></bold>. Following cleavage, the DNA ends are joined via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), resulting in the precise alignment of the two coding ends and the signal ends (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Rooney, et al., 2004</xref>)</italic></bold>. V(D)J recombination promotes B cell development, but aberrant V(D)J recombination can lead to precursor B-cell malignancies through RAG mediated off-target effects (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mendes, et al., 2014</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Onozawa and Aplan, 2012</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Thomson, et al., 2020</xref>)</italic></bold>.</p>
<p>The regulation of RAG expression and activity is multifactorial, serving to ensure V(D)J recombination and B cell development (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gan, et al., 2021</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kumari, et al., 2021</xref>)</italic></bold>. The RAGs consist of core and non-core region. Although non-core regions of RAG1/2 are not strictly required for V(D)J recombination, the evolutionarily conserved non-core RAG regions indicate their potential significance in vivo that may involve quantitative or qualitative modifications in RAG activity and expression (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Braams, et al., 2023</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Curry and Schlissel, 2008</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Liu, et al., 2022</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Liu, et al., 2022</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Sekiguchi, et al., 2001</xref>)</italic></bold>. Specifically, the non-core RAG2 region (amino acids 384– 527 of 527 residues) contains a plant homeodomain (PHD) that can recognize histone H3K4 trimethylation, as well as a T490 locus that mediates a cell cycle-regulated protein degradation signal in proliferated pre-B cells stage (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Liu, et al., 2007</xref>;</italic></bold></p>
<p><bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Matthews, et al., 2007</xref>)</italic></bold>. Failure to degrade RAG2 during the S stage poses a threat to the genome (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zhang, et al., 2011</xref>)</italic></bold>. Moreover, the off-target V(D)J recombination frequency is significantly higher when RAG2 is C-terminally truncated, thereby establishing a mechanistic connection between the PHD domain, H3K4me3-modified chromatin, and the suppression of off-target V(D)J recombination (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lu, et al., 2015</xref>;Mijuškovi</italic></bold>ć<bold><italic>, et al., 2015)</italic></bold>. The RAG1’ non-core region (amino acids1–383 of 1040 residues) has been identified as a RAG1 regulator. While the core RAG1 maintains its catalytic activity, it’s in vivo recombination efficiency and fidelity are reduced in comparison to the full-length RAG1 (fRAG1). In addition, the RAG1 binding to the genome is more indiscriminate (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Beilinson, et al., 2021</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Sadofsky, et al., 1993</xref>)</italic></bold>. The N-terminal domain (NTD), which is evolutionarily conserved, is predicted to contain multiple zinc-binding motifs, including a Really Interesting New Gene (RING) domain (aa 287 to 351) that can ubiquitylate various targets, including RAG1 itself (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Deng, et al., 2015</xref>)</italic></bold>.. Furthermore, NTD contains a specific region (amino acids 1 to 215) that facilitates interaction with DCAF1, leading to the degradation of RAG1 in a CRL4-dependent manner (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Schabla, et al., 2018</xref>)</italic></bold>. Additionally, the NTD plays a role in chromatin binding and the genomic targeting of the RAG complex (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Schatz and Swanson, 2011</xref>)</italic></bold>. Despite increased evidence emphasizing the significance of non-core RAG regions, particularly RAG1’s non-core region, the function of non-core RAG regions in off-target V(D)J recombination and the underlying mechanistic basis have not been fully clarified.</p>
<p>Typically, genomic DNA is safeguarded against inappropriate RAG cleavage by the inaccessibility of cryptic RSSs (cRSSs), which are estimated to occur once per 600 base pairs (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Teng, et al., 2015</xref>)</italic></bold>. However, recent research has demonstrated that epigenetic reprogramming in cancer can result in heritable alterations in gene expression, including the accessibility of cRSSs (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Becker, et al., 2020</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fatma, et al., 2022</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Goel, et al., 2022</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Khoshchehreh, et al., 2019</xref>)</italic></bold>. We selected the <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic><sup>+</sup> B-ALL model, which is characterized by ongoing V(D)J recombinase activity and <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> gene rearrangement in pre-B leukemic cells (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Schjerven, et al., 2017</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wong and Witte, 2004</xref>)</italic></bold>. The genome structural variations (SVs) analysis was conducted on leukemic cells from <italic>fRAG, cRAG1</italic>, and <italic>cRAG2, BCR-ABL1</italic><sup>+</sup> B-ALL mice to examine the involvement of non-core RAG regions in off-target V(D)J recombination events. The non-core domain deletion in both <italic>RAG1</italic> and <italic>RAG2</italic> led to accelerated leukemia onset and progression, as well as an increased off-target V(D)J recombination. Our analysis showed a reduction in RAG cleavage accuracy in <italic>cRAG</italic> cells and a decrease in recombinant size in <italic>cRAG1</italic> cells, which may be responsible for the increased off-target V(D)J recombination in <italic>cRAG</italic> leukemia cells. In conclusion, our results highlight the potential importance of the non-core RAG region, particularly RAG1’s non-core region, in maintaining accuracy of V(D)J recombination and genomic stability in <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic><sup>+</sup> B-ALL.</p>

<title>cRAG give more aggressive leukemia in a mouse model of <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic><sup>+</sup> B-ALL</title>
<p>In order to assess the impact of RAG activity on the clonal evolution of <italic>BCR-ABL1<sup>+</sup></italic> B-ALL through a genetic experiment, we utilized bone marrow transplantation (BMT) to compare disease progression in fRAG, cRAG1, and cRAG2 <italic>BCR-ABL1<sup>+</sup></italic> B-ALL (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Schjerven, et al., 2017</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wong and Witte, 2004</xref>)</italic></bold>. Bone marrow cells transduced with a BCR-ABL1/GFP retrovirus were administered into syngeneic lethally irradiated mice, and CD19<sup>+</sup> B cell leukemia developed within 30-80 days (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, Supplementary Figure 1). Western blotting results confirmed equivalent transduction efficiencies of the retroviral <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> in all three cohorts (Supplementary Figure 2A). To investigate potential variances in leukemia outcome across different genomic backgrounds, we employed Mantel-Cox analysis to evaluate survival rates in fRAG, cRAG1, or cRAG2 mice transplanted with <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic>-transformed bone marrow cells. Our results show that, during the primary transplant phase, <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic><sup>+</sup> B-ALL mice expressing cRAG1 or cRAG2 demonstrated lower survival rates compared to their counterparts with fRAG (median 74.5 days versus 39 or 57 days, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0425, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). This survival rates discrepancy was also observed during the secondary transplant phase, wherein leukemic cells were extracted from the spleens of primary recipients and subsequently purified via GFP<sup>+</sup> cell sorting. A total of 10<sup>5</sup>,10<sup>4</sup> and 10<sup>3</sup> GFP<sup>+</sup> leukemic cells that originated from fRAG, cRAG1, or cRAG2 leukemic mice were transplanted into corresponding non-irradiated immunocompetent syngenetic recipients (survival days fRAG,11-26 days, cRAG1,10-16 days, cRAG2,11-21 days, Supplementary Figure 2B). Additionally, the cRAG mice exhibited significantly higher leukemia burdens in the peripheral blood, bone marrow, and spleen compared to the fRAG mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-D</xref>). To elucidate the cellular mechanisms driving the accelerated proliferation observed in cRAG <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic><sup>+</sup> B-ALL, flow cytometry analyses were conducted to evaluate cell cycle dynamics and apoptotic activity. Results revealed a higher fraction of cRAG <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic><sup>+</sup> B-ALL cells residing in the S/G2-M phase of the cell cycle compared to their fRAG counterparts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Additionally, the enhanced proliferation in cRAG leukemic cells was attributed to a reduction in apoptosis rates (Supplementary Figure 2C). RNA-seq analysis demonstrated the changes of cell differentiation and proliferation/apoptotic pathways (Supplementary Figure 3) These findings indicate that the absence of non-core RAG regions accelerates malignant transformation and leukemic proliferation, leading to a more aggressive disease phenotype in the cRAG <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic><sup>+</sup> B-ALL mouse model.</p>

<title>The loss of non-core RAG regions corresponds to a less mature cell surface phenotype but does not impede IgH VDJ recombination</title>
<p>To delineate the developmental stages of B cells from which the leukemic cells originated, we performed flow cytometry on single cells stained with B cell-specific surface markers. Analysis revealed that 91%-98% of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in cRAG mice were CD19<sup>+</sup>BP-1<sup>+</sup>B220<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>+</sup>, indicating that most leukemic cells were at the large pre-B cell stage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hardy and Hayakawa, 2001</xref>)</italic></bold>. Conversely, in fRAG leukemic mice, the distribution was 65% large pre-B cells (GFP<sup>+</sup>CD19<sup>+</sup>BP-1<sup>+</sup>B220<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>+</sup>) and 35% small pre-B cells (GFP<sup>+</sup>CD19<sup>+</sup>BP-1<sup>+</sup>B220<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Moreover, approximately 5% of leukemic cells in fRAG mice expressed μHC, in con-trast to minimal expression in cRAG leukemic cells. This suggests that fRAG leukemic cells may differentiate further, associated with an immune phenotype (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). <italic>IgH</italic> rear-rangement initiates with D<sub>H</sub>-J<sub>H</sub> joining in pro-B cells, followed by V<sub>H</sub>-DJ<sub>H</sub> joining in pro-B cells, and ultimately, V<sub>L</sub>-J<sub>L</sub> rearrangements occur at the <italic>IgL</italic> loci in small pre-B cells (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Schatz and Ji, 2011</xref>)</italic></bold>. Genomic PCR analysis of DNA from GFP<sup>+</sup>CD19<sup>+</sup> cells was utilized to assess V<sub>H</sub>DJ<sub>H</sub> rearrangement. The results showed a pronounced oligoclonality in cRAG leukemic cells, with tumors consistently demonstrating rear-rangements involving a restricted set of V<sub>H</sub> family members. In contrast, fRAG leukemias displayed significant polyclonality, evidenced by the widespread rear-rangement of various V<sub>H</sub> family members to all potential J<sub>H</sub>1-3 segments, indicative of a broader clonal diversity (Supplementary Figure 4). This observation aligns with the more aggressive leukemia phenotype seen in cRAG <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic><sup>+</sup> B-ALL mice. Such oligoclonality in cRAG leukemic cells suggests a selection process driven by BCR-ABL1-induced leukemia, favoring the emergence of a limited number of dominant leukemic clones. The absence of non-core RAG regions appears to restrict the diversity of leukemic clones, leading to the formation of oligoclonal tumors.</p>

<title>The loss of non-core RAG regions highlights genomic DNA damage</title>
<p>The findings indicate that leukemic cells from three types of mice exhibited variable arrests at the large pre-B cell stage, deviating from normal B cell developmental trajectory. Typically, at this juncture, B cells initiate the degradation of RAG2 via the cyclin-dependent kinase cyclinA/Cdk2, leading to a downregulation of RAG activity. It is therefore crucial to explore the impact of deletions in non-core regions on the expression and functionality of RAG in these leukemic cells. Analysis showed that both RAG1 (cRAG1) and RAG2 (cRAG2) were present in GFP<sup>+</sup>CD19<sup>+</sup> splenic leukemic cells from <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic><sup>+</sup> B-ALL mice across different genetic backgrounds (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Notably, we observed an upregulation of cRAG1 and cRAG2 in leukemic cells from cRAG1 or cRAG2 mice compared to those from fRAG mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, Supplementary Figure 5A). The in vitro V(D)J recombination assay confirmed that different forms of RAG exhibited cleavage activity in <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic><sup>+</sup>B-ALL (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and Supplementary Figure 5B).</p>

<p>To examine the potential correlation between aberrant RAG activity and increased DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), we assessed levels of phosphorylated H2AX (L-H2AX), a marker of DSB response, in leukemic cells from fRAG, cRAG1, and cRAG2 mice (gated on GFP<sup>+</sup>).

<title>Off-target recombination mediated by RAG in <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic><sup>+</sup> B cells</title>
<p>Genome-wide sequencing and analysis were performed to compare somatic structural variants (SVs) in <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic><sup>+</sup> B cells derived from fRAG, cRAG1 and cRAG2 mice. The leukemic cells were sequenced with an average coverage of 25× (Supplementary Table 1). The SVs generated by RAG were screened based on two criteria: the presence of a CAC to the right (or GTG to the left) of both breakpoints, and its occurrence within 21 bp from the breakpoint (<bold><italic>Mijuškovi</italic></bold>ć<bold><italic>, et al., 2015)</italic></bold>. Further elaboration on these criteria can be found in Supplementary Figure 6. Consequently, aberrant <italic>V</italic>-to-<italic>V</italic> junctions and <italic>V</italic> to intergenic regions were encompassed in five validated abnormal rearrangements at <italic>Ig</italic> loci in cRAG leukemic mice (Supplementary Table 2). Additionally, seven samples had 24 somatic structural variations, with an average of 3.4 coding region mutations per sample (range of 0-9), which is consistent with the limited number of acquired somatic mutations observed in hematological cancers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> and Supplementary Table 3). The results of the study demonstrate that fRAG cells had low SVs (0-1 per sample), cRAG1 cells exhibited higher SVs (6-9 per sample) while cRAG2 cells had moderate SVs incidence (1-4 per sample) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, Supplementary Table 3). These findings suggest that cRAG may lead to an elevated off-target recombination, eventually posing a threat to the <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic><sup>+</sup> B cells genome.</p>

<title>Off-target V(D)J recombination characteristics in <italic>BCR-ABL1<sup>+</sup></italic>B cells</title>
<p>We further examined the characteristics of the identified structural variants (SVs). Specifically, we analyzed the exon-intron distribution profiles of 41 breakpoints from 24 SVs through genome analysis. The results indicated that 57% of the breakpoints were located within the gene body, while 43% were enriched in the flanking sequences, the majority of which were identified as transcriptional regulatory sequences (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). P and N nucleotides are recognized as distinctive characteristics of V(D)J recombination (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Repasky, et al., 2004</xref>)</italic></bold>. RSS-to-RSS and cRSS-to-cRSS recombination have P nucleotides lengths of 7 and 9, respectively, and N lengths of 5, so nucleotide lengths are basically the same during RSS-to-RSS and cRSS-to-cRSS recombination (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). However, the frequency of P and N sequences in RSS-to-RSS recombination was 50%/50% (P/N), compared to 4%/8% (P/N) in cRSS-to-cRSS recombination (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). This significant reduction in the frequency of P and N sequences suggests that DNA repair at off-target sites in <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic><sup>+</sup> B cells diverges from the classical V(D)J re-combination repair process.</p>
<p>The hybrid joints were notably prevalent in cRAG1 and cRAG2 leukemic cells (93% and 100%, respectively), suggesting that the non-core regions of RAG may play a role in inhibiting harmful transposition events (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). To evaluate the effect of deleting non-core RAG regions on the emergence of oncogenic mutations, we performed a comparative analysis of cancer-related genes across three types of leukemic cells. We found that cRAG1 leukemic cells harbored a significantly higher number of cancer genes compared to the other groups. This finding corresponds with the most aggressive leukemia phenotype observed in cRAG1 <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic><sup>+</sup> B-ALL mice and associated changes in their transcription profiles.</p>

<title>The non-core regions have effects on RAG cleavage and off-target recombination size in <italic>BCR-ABL1<sup>+</sup></italic> B cells</title>
<p>Sequence logos were employed to visually contrast RSS and cRSSs within <italic>Ig</italic> and non-<italic>Ig</italic> loci, respectively. Notably, the RSS elements in <italic>Ig</italic> loci displayed a higher similarity to the canonical RSS, especially at critical functional sites. The initial four nucleotides (highlighted) of the canonical heptamer sequence <underline>CACA</underline>GTG were recognized as the cleavage site for fRAG. Conversely, in leukemic cells, the cleavage site for cRAG was pinpointed to the first three nucleotides, the CAC trinucleotide, of the heptamer sequence (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). While both motifs (CACA and CAC) align with the highly conserved segment of the RSS heptamer sequence, differences in the cRSS sequences across off-target genes in both fRAG and cRAG mice suggest that deletion of RAG’s non-core regions broadens the spectrum of off-target substrates in <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic><sup>+</sup> B cells.</p>

The off-target recombination size was determined as the DNA fragment size spanning the two breakpoints. Our analysis demonstrated that both fRAG and cRAG2 leukemic cells produced off-target recombinations with 100% and 92% of events, respectively, spanning over 10,000 bp in length. In contrast, cRAG1 leukemic cells showed only 6% of off-target recombinations exceeding 10,000 bp, with 48% under 1,000 bp and 46% ranging between 1,000 to 10,000 bp (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6BC</xref>). These findings suggest that the cRAG1 variant primarily facilitates smaller-scale off-target recombinations in <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic><sup>+</sup> B cells, highlighting the role of the non-core RAG1 region in influencing the extent of off-target recombination. The deletion of the non-core RAG1 region appears to constrict the size of off-target recombination, potentially contributing to the elevated frequency of off-target V(D)J recombination observed in cRAG1 leukemic cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we have demonstrated that non-core region deletion of both RAG1 and RAG2 leads to accelerated development of leukemia and increased off-target V(D)J recombination in mice models of <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic><sup>+</sup> B cells. Furthermore, we report reduced cRAG cleavage accuracy and off-target recombination size in cRAG leukemia cells, which might contribute to exacerbated off-target V(D)J recombination of cRAG <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic><sup>+</sup> B cells. These findings suggest that the non-core regions, particularly the non-core region of RAG1, play a crucial role in maintaining accuracy of V(D)J recombination and genomic stability in <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic><sup>+</sup> B cells.</p>
<p>Our findings suggest that leukemic cells with cRAG regions exhibit increased production of hybrid joints, implying that non-core RAG regions might suppress the formation of these hybrid joints in vivo. Post-cleavage synaptic complexes (PSCs), comprising RAG proteins, coding ends, and RSS ends, are believed to have evolved to form with optimal conformation and/or stability for conventional coding and RSS end-joining(<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fugmann, et al., 2000</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Libri, et al., 2021</xref>)</italic></bold>. In contrast, cRAG PSCs could promote RAG-mediated hybrid joints by facilitating closer proximity of coding and RSS ends or by increasing PSC stability. It is also conceivable that fRAGs recruit disassembly/remodeling factors to PSCs, a process that could allow non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) factors to complete the normal reaction(<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fugmann, et al., 2000</xref>)</italic></bold>.</p>
<p>Conversely, cRAGs may have a diminished recruitment capacity due to changes in overall conformation or the absence of specific motifs, leading to more unstable PSCs and a heightened risk of accumulating incomplete hybrid joints (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Raghavan, et al., 2006</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Talukder, et al., 2004</xref>)</italic></bold>. Our data reveal that over 90% of junctions were hybrid joints in cRAG leukemic cells, a frequency exceeding that reported in previous studies. This suggests that deficiencies in the NHEJ pathway could contribute to chromosomal instability and lymphomagenesis(<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gaymes, et al., 2002</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Rassool, 2003</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Scully, et al., 2019</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Wiegmans, et al., 2021</xref>)</italic></bold>. Significantly, our analysis uncovered variations in the NHEJ repair pathway among leukemic cells from different genetic backgrounds, suggesting a potential aberrant expression of DNA repair pathways in cRAG leukemic cells (Supplementary Figure 3B). These findings highlight the potential of cRAG to foster increased hybrid joint formation, especially when a normal pathway for efficient coding and RSS joining is compromised in an NHEJ-aberrant context.</p>
<p>Our data demonstrates that the deletion of the RAG1 non-core region results in more severe off-target V(D)J recombination compared to the deletion of the RAG2 non-core region. This observation is supported by the fact that the RAG1 terminus contains multiple zinc-binding motifs and ubiquitin ligase activity, which are known to enhance the efficiency of the rearrangement reaction (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Beilinson, et al., 2021</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Burn, et al., 2022</xref>)</italic></bold>. Furthermore, our research reveals that RAG1 expression persists in <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic><sup>+</sup> progenitor B cells, and deletion of the non-core region of RAG1 results in elevated expression of RAG in comparison to fRAG. Consequently, as demonstrated in this study, cRAG1 from <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic><sup>+</sup> B leukemic mice is prone to generating off-target V(D)J recombination. The distinct function of RAG1’s non-core region in thymic lymphomas of Tp53-/- mice and <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic><sup>+</sup> B leukemic mice leads to dissimilar off-target activity of cRAG1 (<bold><italic>Mijuškovi</italic></bold>ć<bold><italic>, et al., 2015)</italic></bold>. Therefore, it would be intriguing to replicate these analyses across various subtypes of ALL to further investigate this phenomenon.</p>
<p>In human <italic>ETV6-RUNX1</italic> ALL, the <italic>ETV6-RUNX1</italic> fusion gene is believed to initiate prenatally, yet the disease remains clinically latent until critical secondary events occur, leading to leukemic transformation-“pre-leukemia to leukemia” (<bold><italic>Mijuškovi</italic></bold>ć<bold><italic>, et al., 2015)</italic></bold>. Genomic rearrangement, mediated by aberrant RAG recombinase activity, is a frequent driver of these secondary events in <italic>ETV6-RUNX1</italic> ALL (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen, et al., 2021</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Papaemmanuil, et al., 2014</xref>)</italic></bold>. In contrast, RAG mediated off-target V(D)J recombination is also observed in <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic><sup>+</sup> B-ALL. These oncogenic structural variations can also be considered as secondary events that promote the transition - “leukemia to aggressive leukemia”. The enhancement of <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic><sup>+</sup> B-ALL deterioration and progression by cRAG in mouse model was consistent with our previous study that RAG enhances BCR-ABL1 positive leukemic cell growth through its endo-nuclease activity (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Yuan, et al., 2021</xref>)</italic></bold>. Additionally, we showed that non-core RAG1 region deletion leads to increased cRAG1 expression and high RAG expression related to low survival in pediatric acute lymphoid leukemia (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and Supplementary Figure 7). Therefore, more attention should be paid to the non-core RAG region mutation in <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic><sup>+</sup> B-ALL for the role of non-core region in leukemia suppression and off-target V(D)J recombination.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this report, Yu et al ascribe potential tumor suppressive functions to the non-core regions of RAG1/2 recombinases. Using a well-established BCR-ABL oncogene-driven system, the authors model the development of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in mice and found that RAG mutants lacking non-core regions show accelerated leukemogenesis. They further report that the loss of non-core regions of RAG1/2 increases genomic instability, possibly caused by increased off-target recombination of aberrant RAG-induced breaks. The authors conclude that the non-core regions of RAG1 in particular not only increases the fidelity of VDJ recombination, but may also influence the recombination &quot;range&quot; of off-target joints, and that in the absence of the non-core regions, mutant RAG1/2 (termed cRAGs) catalyze high levels of off-target recombination leading to the development of aggressive leukemia.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors used a genetically defined oncogene-driven model to study the effect of RAG non-core regions have on leukemogenesis. The animal studies were well performed and generally included a good number of mice. Therefore, the finding that cRAG expression led to development of more aggressive BCR-ABL+ leukemia compared to fRAG is solid. The authors also present some nice analyses that characterize the (genomic) nature of aggressive leukemia that develop in the absence of RAG non-core regions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The paper relies on cRAG1/2 overexpression, an experimental limitation that needs to be taken into consideration when extrapolating the physiological relevance of the findings.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this report, Yu et al ascribe potential tumor suppressive functions to the non-core regions of RAG1/2 recombinases. Using a well-established BCR-ABL oncogene-driven system, the authors model the development of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in mice and found that RAG mutants lacking non-core regions show accelerated leukemogenesis. They further report that the loss of non-core regions of RAG1/2 increases genomic instability, possibly caused by increased off-target recombination of aberrant RAG-induced breaks. The authors conclude that the non-core regions of RAG1 in particular not only increase the fidelity of VDJ recombination, but may also influence the recombination &quot;range&quot; of off-target joints, and that in the absence of the non-core regions, mutant RAG1/2 (termed cRAGs) catalyze high levels of off-target recombination leading to the development of aggressive leukemia.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors used a genetically defined oncogene-driven model to study the effect of RAG non-core regions on leukemogenesis. The animal studies were well performed and generally included a good number of mice. Therefore, the finding that cRAG expression led to the development of more aggressive BCR-ABL+ leukemia compared to fRAG is solid.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In general, I find the mechanistic explanation offered by the authors to explain how the non-core regions of RAG1/2 suppress leukemogenesis to be less convincing. My main concern is that cRAG1 and cRAG2 are overexpressed relative to fRAG1/2. This raises the possibility that the observed increased aggressiveness of cRAG tumors compared to fRAG tumors could be solely due to cRAG1/2 overexpression, rather than any intrinsic differences in the activity of cRAG1/2 vs fRAG1/2; and indeed, the authors allude to this possibility in Fig S8, where it was shown that elevated expression of RAG (i.e. fRAG) correlated with decreased survival in pediatric ALL. Although it doesn't mean the authors' assertions are incorrect, this potential caveat should nevertheless be discussed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the valuable suggestions from the reviewer. BCR-ABL1+ B-ALL is characterized by halted early B-lineage differentiation. In BCR-ABL1+ B cells, RAG recombinases are highly expressed, leading to the inactivation of genes that encode essential transcription factors for B-lineage differentiation. This results in cells being trapped within the precursor compartment, thereby elevating RAG gene expression. Our interpretation of the data suggests that, in BCR-ABL1+ B-ALL mouse models, the high expression of both cRAG and fRAG and the deletion of the non-core regions influence the precision of RAG targeting within the genome. This causes more genomic damage in cRAG tumors than in fRAG tumors, consequently leading to the observed increased aggressiveness of cRAG tumors compared to fRAG tumors. We discussed the issues on Page 12, lines 295-307 in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Some of the conclusions drawn were not supported by the data.</p>
<p>(1) I'm not sure that the authors can conclude based on μHC expression that there is a loss of pre-BCR checkpoint in cRAG tumors. In fact, Fig. 2B showed that the differences are not statistically significant overall, and more importantly, μHC expression should be detectable in small pre-B cells (CD43-). This is also corroborated by the authors' analysis of VDJ rearrangements, showing that it has occurred at the H chain locus in cRAG cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the insightful comment from the reviewer. Upon reevaluation of the data presented in Fig. 2B, we identified and rectified certain errors. The revised analysis now shows that the differences in μHC expression are statistically significant. This significant expression of μHC in fRAG leukemic cells implies that these cells may progress further in differentiation, potentially acquiring an immune phenotype.

<p>(2) The authors found a high degree of polyclonal VDJ rearrangements in fRAG tumor cells but a much more limited oligoclonal VDJ repertoire in cRAG tumors. They concluded that this explains why cRAG tumors are more aggressive because BCR-ABL induced leukemia requires secondary oncogenic hits, resulting in the outgrowth of a few dominant clones (Page 19, lines 381-398). I'm not sure this is necessarily a causal relationship since we don't know if the oligoclonality of cRAG tumors is due to selection based on oncogenic potential or if it may actually reflect a more restricted usage of different VDJ gene segments during rearrangement.</p>

<p>Thank you for your insightful comments and questions regarding the relationship between the oligoclonality of V(D)J rearrangements and the aggressiveness of cRAG tumors. You raise an important point regarding whether the observed oligoclonality is a result of selective pressure favoring clones with specific oncogenic potential, or if it reflects inherent limitations in V(D)J segment usage during rearrangement in cRAG models. In our study, we observed a marked difference in the V(D)J rearrangement patterns between fRAG and cRAG tumor cells, with cRAG tumors exhibiting a more limited, oligoclonal repertoire. This observation led us to speculate that the aggressive nature of cRAG tumors might be linked to a selective advantage conferred by specific V(D)J rearrangements that cooperate with the BCR-ABL1 oncogene to drive leukemogenesis. However, we acknowledge that our current data do not definitively establish a causal relationship between oligoclonality and tumor aggressiveness. The restricted V(D)J repertoire in cRAG tumors could indeed be due to a more constrained rearrangement process, possibly influenced by the altered expression or function of RAG1/2 in the absence of non-core regions. This could limit the diversity of V(D)J rearrangements, leading to the emergence of a few dominant clones not necessarily because they have greater oncogenic potential, but because of a narrowed field of rearrangement possibilities.</p>
<p>To address this question more thoroughly, future studies could examine the functional consequences of specific V(D)J rearrangements found in dominant cRAG tumor clones. This could include assessing the oncogenic potential of these rearrangements in isolation and in cooperation with BCR-ABL1, as well as exploring the mechanistic basis for the restricted V(D)J repertoire. Such studies would provide deeper insight into the interplay between RAG-mediated recombination, clonal selection, and leukemogenesis in BCR-ABL1+ B-ALL.</p>
<p>We appreciate your feedback on this matter and agree that further investigation is required to unravel the precise relationship between V(D)J rearrangement diversity and leukemic progression in cRAG models. We have revised our discussion to reflect these considerations and to clarify the speculative nature of our conclusions regarding the link between oligoclonality and tumor aggressiveness. We added more discussion on this issue on Page 7, lines 166-170 in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(3) What constitutes a cancer gene can be highly context- and tissue-dependent. Given that there is no additional information on how any putative cancer gene was disrupted (e.g., truncation of regulatory or coding regions), it is not possible to infer whether increased off-target cRAG activity really directly contributed to the increased aggressiveness of leukemia.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We totally agree you raised the issues. In Supplementary Table 3, we have presented data on off-target gene disruptions, specifically in introns, exons, downstream regions, promoters, 3' UTRs, and 5' UTRs. However, this dataset alone does not suffice to conclusively determine whether the increased off-target activity of cRAG directly influences the heightened aggressiveness of leukemia. To bridge this knowledge gap, our future research will extend to include both knockout and overexpression experiments targeting these off-target genes.</p>

<p>(4) Fig. 6A, it seems that it is really the first four nucleotide (CACA) that determines fRAG binding and the first three (CAC) that determine cRAG binding, as opposed to five for fRAG and four for cRAG, as the author wrote (page 24, lines 493-497).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful comment. In response, we have revised the text to accurately reflect the nucleotide sequences responsible for RAG binding and cleavage. Specifically, we now clarify that the first four nucleotides (CACA) are crucial for fRAG binding and cleavage, while the initial three nucleotides (CAC) are essential for cRAG binding and cleavage. These updates have been made on page 10, lines 242-245 of the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(5) Fig S3B, I don't really see why &quot;significant variations in NHEJ&quot; would necessarily equate &quot;aberrant expression of DNA repair pathways in cRAG leukemic cells&quot;. This is purely speculative. Since it has been reported previously that alt-EJ/MMEJ can join off target RAG breaks, do the authors detect high levels of microhomology usage at break points in cRAG tumors?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's comment. Currently, we have not observed microhomology usage at breakpoints in cRAG tumors. We plan to address this aspect in a future, more detailed study. Regarding the 'aberrant expression of DNA repair pathways in cRAG leukemic cells, we acknowledge that this is speculative. Therefore, we have carefully rephrased this to 'suggesting a potential aberrant expression of DNA repair pathways in cRAG leukemic cells.' This modification is reflected on page 12, lines 290-291 of the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(6) Fig. S7, CDKN2B inhibits CDK4/6 activation by cyclin D, but I don't think it has been shown to regulate CDK6 mRNA expression. The increase in CDK6 mRNA likely just reflects a more proliferative tumor but may have nothing to do with CDKN2B deletion in cRAG1 tumors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully concur with the reviewer's comment. We have deleted this inappropriate part from the text.</p>

<p>Insufficient details in some figures. For instance, Fig. 1A, please include statistics in the plot showing a comparison of fRAG vs cRAG1, fRAG vs cRAG2, cRAG1 vs cRAG2. As of now, there's a single p-value (0.0425) stated in the main text and the legend but why is there only one p-value when fRAG is compared to cRAG1 or cRAG2? Similarly, the authors wrote &quot;median survival days 11-26, 10-16, 11-21 days, P &lt; 0.0023-0.0299, Fig. S2B.&quot; However, it is difficult for me to figure out what are the numbers referring to. For instance, is 11-26 referring to median survival of fRAG inoculated with three different concentrations of GFP+ leukemic cells or is 11-26 referring to median survival of fRAG, cRAG1, cRAG2 inoculated with 10^5 cells? It would be much clearer if the authors can provide the numbers for each pair-wise comparison, if not in the main text, then at least in the figure legend. In Fig. 5A-B, do the plots depict SVs in cRAG tumors or both cRAG and fRAG cells? Also in Fig. 5, why did 24 SVs give rise to 42 breakpoints, and not 48? Doesn't it take 2 breaks to accomplish rearrangement? In Fig. 6B-C, it is not clear how the recombination sizes were calculated. In the examples shown in Fig. 4, only cRAG1 tumors show intra-chromosomal joins (chr 12), while fRAG and cRAG2 tumors show exclusively inter-chromosomal joins.</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewer's feedback and have made the following revisions:</p>
<p>(1) The text has been adjusted to rectify the previously mentioned error in the figure legends (page 1, lines 5-6).</p>
<p>(2) We have clarified the intended message in the revised text (page 6, lines 129-130) and the figure legend (page 4-5, lines 107-113) for greater precision.</p>
<p>(3) Figure 5A-B now presents an overview of all structural variants (SVs) identified in both cRAG and fRAG cells, offering a comprehensive comparison.</p>
<p>(4) Among the analyzed SVs, 24 generated a total of 48 breakpoints, with 41 occurring within gene bodies and the remaining 7 in adjacent flanking sequences. This informs our exon-intron distribution profile analysis.</p>
<p>(5) We have defined recombination sizes as ‘the DNA fragment size spanning the two breakpoints’ for clarity (page 10, lines 251-252).</p>
<p>(6) All off-target recombinations identified in the genome-wide analyses of fRAG, cRAG1, and cRAG2 leukemic cells were determined to be intra-chromosomal joins, highlighting their specific nature within the genomic context.</p>

<p>Insufficient details on certain reagents/methods. For instance, are the cRAG1/2 mice of the same genetic background as fRAG mice (C57BL/6 WT)? On Page 23, line 481, what is a cancer gene? How are they defined? In Fig. 3C, are the FACS plots gated on intact cells? Since apoptotic cells show high levels of gH2AX, I'm surprised that the fraction of gH2AX+ cells is so much lower in fRAG tumors compared to cRAG tumors. The in vitro VDJ assay shown in Fig 3B is not described in the Method section (although it is described in Fig S5b). Fig. 5A-B, do the plots depict SVs in cRAG tumors or both cRAG and fRAG cells?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful for the reviewer's feedback and have incorporated their insights as follows:</p>
<p>(1) We clarify that both cRAG1/2 and fRAG mice share the same genetic background, specifically the C57BL/6 WT strain, ensuring consistency across experimental models.</p>
<p>(2) We define a 'cancer gene' as one harboring somatic mutations implicated in cancer. To support our analysis, we refer to the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer (COSMIC) at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic">http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic</ext-link>. COSMIC serves as the most extensive repository for understanding the role of somatic mutations in human cancers.</p>
<p>(3) Upon thorough review of the raw data for γ-H2AX and the fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) plots gated on intact cells, we propose that the observed discrepancies might stem from the limited sensitivity of the γ-H2AX flow cytometry detection method. This insight prompts our commitment to employing more efficient detection methodologies in forthcoming studies.</p>
<p>(4) Detailed procedures for the in vitro V(D)J recombination assay have been included in the Methods section (page 15, lines 384-388) to enhance the manuscript's comprehensiveness and reproducibility.</p>
<p>(5) The presented plots offer a comprehensive overview of structural variants (SVs) identified in both cRAG and fRAG cells, providing a holistic view of the genomic landscape across different models.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>I would suggest that the authors tone down some of their conclusions, which are not necessarily supported by their own data. in addition, there are some minor mistakes in figure assembly/presentation. For instance, I believe that the axes labels in Fig. 1E were flipped. BrdU should be on y-axis and 7-AAD on the x-axis. Fig. 3B, the y-axis contains a typo, it should be &quot;CD90.1...&quot; and not &quot;D90.1...&quot;. In Fig. 5C, the numbers seem to be flipped, with 93% corresponding to cRAG1 and 100% to cRAG2 (compare with the description on page 23, lines 474-475). Fig. 5C, y-axis, &quot;hybrid&quot; is a typo. Page 3, line 59: The abbreviation of RSS has already been described earlier (p4, line 53).</p>

<p>Page 3, lines 64-65: VDJ recombination promotes the development of both B and T cells, and aberrant recombination can cause both B and T cell lymphomas.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The statement about the role of V(D)J recombination in B and T cell development and its link to lymphomagenesis is grounded in a substantial body of research. Theoretical frameworks and empirical studies delineate how aberrations in the recombination process can lead to genomic instability, potentially triggering oncogenic events. This connection is extensively documented in immunology and oncology literature, illustrating the critical balance between necessary genetic rearrangements for immune diversity and the risk of malignancy when these processes are dysregulated (Thomson, et al.,2020; Mendes, et al.,2014; Onozawa and Aplan,2012).</p>

<p>We thank the reviewers for their insightful suggestion. We have revised the sentence to read, 'Although the non-core regions of RAG1/2 are not essential for V(D)J recombination, the evolutionary conservation of these regions suggests their potential significance in vivo, possibly affecting RAG activity and expression in both quantitative and qualitative manners.' This revision appears on page 3, lines 61-62, in the revised manuscript.</p>
