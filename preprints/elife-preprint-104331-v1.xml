<title>Abstract</title><p>During myogenic differentiation the cellular architecture and proteome of muscle stem cells and myoblasts undergo extensive remodeling. These molecular processes are only partially understood and display alterations in disease conditions as well as during aging resulting in impaired regeneration. Here, we used mass spectrometry to quantify the temporal dynamics of more than 6000 proteins during myogenic differentiation. We identified the actin nucleator leiomodin 1 (LMOD1) among a restricted subset of cytoskeletal proteins increasing in abundance in early phases of myogenic differentiation. We show that LMOD1 is already expressed by muscle stem cells <italic>in vivo</italic> and displays increased abundance during skeletal muscle regeneration, especially during early regeneration suggesting that LMOD1 is important for induction of myotube formation. Of note, knockdown of LMOD1 in primary myoblasts and during skeletal muscle regeneration severely affects myogenic differentiation, while overexpression accelerates and improves the formation of myotubes suggesting that LMOD1 is a critical component regulating myogenic differentiation. Mechanistically, we show that LMOD1 physically and functionally interacts with the deacetylase sirtuin1 (SIRT1), a regulator of myogenic differentiation, especially at the onset of myogenic differentiation. We demonstrate that LMOD1 influences SIRT1 localization and the expression of a subset of its target genes. Consistently, depletion or pharmacological inhibition of SIRT1 partially rescues the impairment of myogenic differentiation observed after knockdown of LMOD1. Our work identifies a new regulator of myogenic differentiation that might be targeted to improve muscle regeneration in aging and disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Muscle stem cells (MuSCs), also known as satellite cells, possess a remarkable ability to regenerate adult skeletal muscle following injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Sambasivan et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Murphy et al. 2011</xref>). These cells are typically quiescent, reside between the basal lamina and the myofiber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Mauro 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Sousa-Victor et al. 2015</xref>), and are characterized by the expression of the paired box transcription factor 7 (PAX7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Seale 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lepper, Partridge, and Fan 2011</xref>; von <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Maltzahn et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Zammit et al. 2006</xref>). In response to physiological and regeneration-inducing stimuli, MuSCs become activated, begin to self-renew, and undergo myogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Fu, Wang, and Hu 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Schmidt et al. 2019</xref>). During myogenic differentiation after injury - a process recapitulating myogenesis during development - MuSCs proliferate, differentiate, and finally fuse to damaged myofibers or form new myofibers. These processes are tightly regulated by the expression of different myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) such as MYF5, MYOD, myogenin and MRF4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chang and Rudnicki 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Schmidt et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Tiffin et al. 2003</xref>). Additionally, external cues from the surrounding microenvironment play a crucial role in regulating myogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bentzinger, Wang, Dumont, et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Hung et al. 2023</xref>). These cues involve different signaling pathways including NOTCH, WNT, BMPs, FGFs, and Hedgehog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Fre et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baghdadi, Castel, et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baghdadi, Firmino, et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bentzinger, Wang, von Maltzahn, et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Friedrichs et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Larraín et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Voronova et al. 2013</xref>). Epigenetic mechanisms and chromatin remodeling regulate the accessibility of transcription factors to regulatory regions of the DNA and, thereby, the expression of myogenic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Saccone and Puri 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Massenet et al. 2021</xref>). Histone deacetylases (HDACs) and methyltransferases, e.g., SIRT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Ryall et al. 2015</xref>), HDAC4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Moresi et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Finke et al. 2022</xref>) and SMYD3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Codato et al. 2019</xref>) are implicated in maintaining muscle integrity and differentiation. The cytoskeleton plays crucial roles in regulating cell shape, motility and signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Pollard and Cooper 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Higuchi-Sanabria et al. 2018</xref>). This is especially important during fusion of myoblasts to form myotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Abmayr and Pavlath 2012</xref>). Perturbations in signalling pathways, mechanosensitivity, and interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM) were shown to significantly affect the cytoskeletal architecture of MuSCs in disease and during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chakkalakal et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Hwang and Brack 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Lukjanenko et al. 2016</xref>). For instance, in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), mutations in the dystrophin gene can disrupt the connection between the actin cytoskeleton and the ECM, impairing the function of MuSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Winder, Gibson, and Kendrick-Jones 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Lu-Nguyen et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Mournetas et al. 2021</xref>). Similarly, mutations in plectin, a protein that connects various cytoskeletal components, result in muscle diseases known as plectinopathies, which are characterized by compromised muscle cell integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Winter and Wiche 2013</xref>). Of note, also age-related sarcopenia can be caused by changes in cytoskeletal proteins, resulting in a decline in myofiber quantity and functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Budai, Balogh, and Sarang 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Larsson et al. 2019</xref>). Changes in actin dynamics, e.g., a dysregulation of ARP2/3 and N-WASP, responsible for forming branched actin networks and cell motility, can impair the response to muscle injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lai and Wong 2020</xref>). Additionally, the distribution of desmin, an essential protein for structural integrity, was shown to affect the mechanical properties and resilience of myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Meyer, Schenk, and Lieber 2013</xref>). Aging also affects muscle regulatory factors like MyoD and myogenin, disrupting the timely expression of cytoskeletal and contractile proteins required for proper differentiation of MuSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Sousa-Victor et al. 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we set out to identify new regulators of myogenic differentiation by investigating alterations in protein dynamics during myogenic differentiation using mass spectrometry. Thereby, we identified LMOD1 among a restricted group of cytoskeletal proteins that increases in abundance during early myogenic differentiation. We confirmed the presence of LMOD1 in MuSCs <italic>in vivo</italic> and show that LMOD1 is transiently upregulated during skeletal muscle regeneration and that reducing LMOD1 expression after injury impairs skeletal muscle regeneration. LMODs are known as powerful actin filament nucleator but their role in myogenic differentiation has not been investigated so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Chereau et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Boczkowska et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Fowler and Dominguez 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Tolkatchev, Gregorio, and Kostyukova 2022</xref>). Through knockdown and overexpression experiments, we show that LMOD1, but not the closely related LMOD2, is essential for proper myogenic differentiation. Mechanistically, we show that LMOD1 interacts with the deacetylase SIRT1, a known regulator of myogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Fulco et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Ryall et al. 2015</xref>), and thereby influence its subcellular localization and the expression of a subset of target genes.</p>

<title>Proteome dynamics during myogenic differentiation</title>
<p>To comprehensively and unbiasedly examine the protein dynamics during myogenic differentiation, we performed an <italic>in vitro</italic> five-day differentiation time course experiment using mouse primary myoblasts from five different mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) and collected samples at each day of differentiation for label-free quantitative proteomics (Table S1). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based on protein intensities obtained from mass spectrometry data (6098 quantified proteins in total) revealed a progressive separation of the different cell populations by the day of differentiation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). We confirmed the expected dynamics of key myogenic regulators by qRT-PCR and mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Schmidt et al. 2019</xref>), validating our experimental setup and proper myogenic differentiation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). Next, we compared protein dynamics by clustering the obtained proteomics data (Table S1). The 3839 protein groups significantly affected in at least one measured time point of differentiation relative to undifferentiated myoblasts were assigned to six clusters by k-means clustering (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Each cluster displayed distinct dynamics and was enriched for specific KEGG pathways (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Notably, cluster 2 included proteins that progressively increased in abundance during differentiation and were closely associated with muscle contraction and function as well as cytoskeletal dynamics e.g. Actinin Alpha 2 (ACTN2), Tropomyosin alpha-1 and −3 (TPM1, TPM3) Leiomodin 1 (LMOD1) and Dystrophin (DMD) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). These findings confirm the importance of cytoskeletal dynamics during myogenic differentiation but also raise questions about the molecular mechanism responsible for this shift in the proteomic landscape.</p>

<title>LMOD1 levels increase during early myogenic differentiation, in aged MuSCs and regenerating skeletal muscle</title>
<p>Given the role of cytoskeleton remodeling as one of the drivers of myogenic differentiation, we focused on this cluster of proteins and specifically looked for proteins that increased early during the differentiation process. Among these, we found two proteins encoded by paralog genes, namely leiomodin 1 (LMOD1) and leiomodin 2 (LMOD2) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), which share 67.05 % sequence similarity, although varying in their number of amino acids and expression across tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Qualmann and Kessels 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Fowler and Dominguez 2017</xref>). Interestingly, the expression pattern of LMOD1 and LMDO2 during myogenic differentiation displayed differences: while LMOD1 showed a significant increase at the beginning (day 1) of myogenic differentiation, LMOD2 increased later in the process (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) suggesting that LMOD1 might be a key protein in driving early myogenic differentiation. To assess the <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of our finding, we queried two proteomic datasets of freshly isolated MuSCs and four different skeletal muscles (gastrocnemius, G; soleus, S; tibialis anterior, TA; extensor digitorum longus, EDL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Schüler et al. 2021</xref>). We found LMOD2 to be the most abundant leiomodin in whole skeletal muscle, as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Yuen et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Tsukada et al. 2010</xref>), while the overall abundance of LMOD1 was lower since this protein has been mainly associated with smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Nanda and Miano 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Conley et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Nanda et al. 2018</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Surprisingly, we detected LMOD1, but not LMOD2, in freshly isolated MuSCs, and noted that the protein levels of LMOD1 increased in MuSCs isolated from old mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B</xref>). To independently validate this finding, we performed immunofluorescence stainings on cryosections of TA muscles from young and geriatric mice. Consistent with previous publications, we observed a reduction in the number of PAX7+ cells with increasing age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Brack, Bildsoe, and Hughes 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Shefer et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Yamakawa et al. 2020</xref>) (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1C</xref>). Furthermore, we confirmed the age-related increase of LMOD1 abundance in MuSCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B</xref>). Of note, this was accompanied by a significant increase in the number of LMOD1+/PAX7+ cells in sections of geriatric compared to young mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Interestingly, we found LMOD1 to be mainly located in the cytoplasm of PAX7+ cells in TA muscles from young mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1D</xref>). However, in TA muscles from geriatric mice, we found a significantly higher number of PAX7+ cells that displayed nuclear localization of LMOD1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>), suggesting that LMOD1 accumulates and mis-localizes in MuSCs with increasing age and could be one contributing factor to the reduced ability of MuSCs in aged mice to differentiate.</p>

<p>Finally, we investigated the expression of LMOD1 during regeneration of skeletal muscle <italic>in vivo.</italic> Therefore, we performed a regeneration time course experiment following cardiotoxin (CTX) injury and assessed LMOD1 expression by immunoblot and immunofluorescence analyses in young mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). We observed low abundance of LMOD1 in uninjured TA muscle but found a progressive increase in abundance up to day 7 after injury and a decrease thereafter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining confirmed that LMOD1 was highly abundant in myofibers at day 5 after injury when mostly newly formed regenerating myofibers are present, hinting at a functional role of LMOD1 in early myogenic differentiation. Of note, LMOD1 abundance was barely detectable at day 7 and later time points suggesting that LMOD1 abundance decreases during maturation of myofibers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that LMOD1 abundance is not only increased at the onset of myogenic differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic> but is also expressed by MuSCs under homeostatic conditions <italic>in vivo</italic> and in MuSC and newly formed myofibers following injury, indicating its importance for myofiber differentiation and skeletal muscle regeneration.</p>

<title>Knockdown of <italic>Lmod1</italic> impairs myogenic differentiation, while overexpression of <italic>Lmod1</italic> accelerates myotube formation</title>
<p>The early increase of abundance of LMOD1 during myogenic differentiation suggests a potential functional role for this protein in promoting the initiation of myogenic differentiation. To test this hypothesis, we used a small interfering RNA (siRNA) to reduce LMOD1 expression and analyzed the impact on myoblast proliferation (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A</xref>) and differentiation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). We confirmed the successful knockdown of <italic>Lmod1</italic> mRNA by qRT-PCR (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2B</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2F</xref>) and reduced levels of LMOD1 protein by immunoblot analysis (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2C</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2G</xref>). After 48 hours of proliferation, we observed a slight (26 %) but significant decrease in the number of proliferating Ki67-positive myoblasts upon knockdown of LMOD1 (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2D</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2E</xref>). During myogenic differentiation, the cell population becomes heterogeneous with a distinct expression of myogenic markers (such as MyoD, myogenin, and devMHC) determining cellular identity thereby controlling the potential to differentiate and ultimately form new myofibers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). We characterized the cell populations after knockdown of LMOD1 based on the expression of myogenic markers using immunofluorescence staining at day three of differentiation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2M-Q</xref>). We found that the reduced levels of LMOD1 resulted in an increased frequency of cells with a pronounced spherical phenotype, also identified as non-elongated, MHC-positive cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>). Moreover, a significant reduction in the number of nuclei per myotube was observed upon knockdown of LMOD1, indicating a potential role in the fusion process (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Furthermore, we observed significantly shorter myotubes upon knockdown of LMOD1, supporting our previous finding that the cells are unable to properly differentiate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>).</p>

<p>Given the structural similarities between LMOD1 and LMOD2, we set out to determine if individual knockdown in primary myoblasts induces similar phenotypes during myogenic differentiation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). Knockdown of both <italic>Lmod1</italic> and <italic>Lmod2</italic> mRNA was validated by qRT-PCR (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2I</xref>) and confirmed at the protein level by immunoblot (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2J</xref>). Interestingly, the knockdown of LMOD2 did not lead to any noticeable phenotypes compared to primary myoblasts transfected with a scramble control siRNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2K</xref>). However, we observed a significant reduction in the number of nuclei per myotube (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>), increased frequency of non-elongated MHC-positive cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>), and increased number of shorter myotubes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>) in the <italic>Lmod1/2</italic> double knockdown. These data suggest that LMOD1 is required for myogenic differentiation in primary myoblasts, while LMOD2 appears to be dispensable.</p>
<p>To examine how reduced levels of LMOD1 affect skeletal muscle regeneration <italic>in vivo</italic>, we injured the TA-muscle of 3-months-old mice using CTX, followed by injection of a self-delivering siRNA targeting Lmod1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3L</xref>) at day 3 after injury, a time point when MuSCs start to differentiate. Subsequently, TA-muscles were isolated at day 5 after injury, the time when LMOD1 was previously shown to be highly expressed in newly formed myofibers. Knockdown of <italic>Lmod1</italic> led to a significant reduction in the number of cells expressing the early differentiation marker myogenin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3M</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3N</xref>), suggesting a critical role for LMOD1 in the transition of MuSCs from proliferation to differentiation. Together, these findings indicate that LMOD1 is not only important for myofiber formation but may also play a key regulatory role in the differentiation of MuSCs into myoblasts and myocytes during the muscle regeneration process stressing its role in controlling myogenic differentiation. To test whether LMOD1 alone is sufficient to promote myogenic differentiation, we generated six independent primary myoblast cultures that were stably transduced with a virus to overexpress either LMOD1 or GFP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3O</xref>). Overexpression (OE) of Lmod1 mRNA by qRT-PCR (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2L</xref>) and protein by immunoblot (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2M</xref>) was confirmed by comparison to a GFP OE control. Immunofluorescence analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3P</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2O</xref>) after one day of differentiation showed that overexpression of LMOD1 promotes myogenic differentiation, as shown by a higher number of nuclei per myotube (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3Q</xref>). Additionally, we observed an accelerated formation of fully differentiated myotubes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3Q</xref>) and an increase in myotube length (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2N</xref>) in LMOD1 OE cells compared to the GFP OE control construct. To further characterize the molecular alterations induced by overexpression of LMOD1 during myogenic differentiation, we generated proteomics data from LMOD1 overexpressing and GFP control cells at multiple time points of differentiation (Table S2). Using gene set enrichment analysis, we found that at day 1 of differentiation, cells overexpressing LMOD1 exhibit higher levels of proteins that are up-regulated at the beginning of differentiation, such as HSPB3, ALDH3A1, SMTNL2, ACTG1, when compared to the GFP control group (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2P</xref>) (Table S2). This proteome signature corroborates the observation that LMOD1 overexpression is sufficient to promote myogenic differentiation.</p>

<title>LMOD1 interacts with SIRT1 and SIRT2</title>
<p>To elucidate the mechanism by which LMOD1 contributes to myogenic differentiation, we performed a proximity-dependent biotinylation experiment (BioID) for LMOD1 to identify its interaction partners in HEK293T cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Given their sequence similarity but distinct functions during myogenic differentiation, we analyzed the interaction partners of LMOD1 and LMOD2 in parallel and focused on hits retrieved exclusively by LMOD1. Therefore, we fused the promiscuous biotin ligase (BirA*) C-terminal to Lmod1 or Lmod2. A cell line expressing only the sequence for BirA* was used as a control (BirA*-Ctrl) to account for non-specific biotinylation. The tetracycline-dependent expression of the respective fusion proteins was validated by immunofluorescence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>) and anti-FLAG immunoblot (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A</xref>). Biotinylation activity, after the addition of exogenous biotin, was assessed using streptavidin-HRP immunoblot (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A</xref>) and immunofluorescence staining (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>). Subsequently, biotinylated proteins were captured using streptavidin enrichment and analyzed by mass spectrometry (Table S3). PCA analysis demonstrated a distinct separation between C-terminal fused LMOD1 and LMOD2 expression constructs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Using both LMOD1 and LMOD2, we found a significant enrichment compared to the BirA*-Ctrl for known interaction partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Fowler and Dominguez 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Boczkowska et al. 2015</xref>) involved in actin filament nucleation such as Tropomodulins (TMODs) and Tropomyosins (TPMs) (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B</xref>-D), validating our constructs. Interestingly, a direct comparison of streptavidin-enriched proteins from LMOD1-BirA* vs. LMOD2-BirA* revealed a subset of interaction partners that specifically interact with LMOD1. These include the histone deacetylases sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and sirtuin 2 (SIRT2), as well as the RuvB Like AAA ATPase 1/2 (RUVBL1/2) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>). Sirtuins are involved in various biological processes, including DNA regulation, metabolism, longevity, and myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Horio et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abdel Khalek et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Vachharajani et al. 2016</xref>). In particular, one study revealed that mice with muscle-specific inactivation of Sirt1 displayed repression of the myogenic program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Ryall et al. 2015</xref>). Since SIRT1 was already identified as a potential mediator of myogenesis, we wanted to validate its preferential interaction with LMOD1 by co-immunoprecipitation independently. Therefore, we transfected SIRT1 as a GFP fusion protein in HEK293T expressing LMOD1-BirA* or LMOD2-BirA* and performed pull-down experiments using a GFP trap. Immunoblot analysis of the GFP-trap eluates using anti-BirA antibodies confirmed a co-precipitation between LMOD1 and SIRT1, while LMOD2 co-precipitated with SIRT1 to a lower extent (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). To further validate the interaction of LMOD1 and SIRT1 in primary myoblasts and myogenic differentiation, we performed <italic>in situ</italic> detection of LMOD1 and SIRT1 using proximity ligation assays (PLA) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). In proliferating myoblasts, when the abundance of LMOD1 is low, only a weak PLA signal indicating close proximity of SIRT1 and LMOD1 was detectable both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. However, at the beginning of myogenic differentiation, when the abundance of LMOD1 increases, an increase in PLA signals indicating close proximity of LMOD1 and SIRT1 was detectable almost exclusively in the cytoplasm. Together these data show that LMOD1 preferentially interacts with the deacetylase SIRT1, suggesting a potential functional interaction between these two proteins in modulating myogenic differentiation.</p>

<title>LMOD1 and SIRT1 show dynamic subcellular localization during myogenic differentiation</title>
<p>Next, we investigated how LMOD1 might influence SIRT1 activity and thereby myogenic differentiation. SIRT1 has been shown to localize both in the cytoplasm and nucleus of neural precursor cells, murine pancreatic beta cells, rat cardiomyocytes, and vascular endothelial cells, while LMODs have been mainly associated with cytoplasmic localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Hisahara et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Tanno et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Tong et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Tanno et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Conley 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Nauen et al. 2020</xref>).

Overall, the total fluorescence intensity of LMOD1 significantly increased during differentiation (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A</xref>), while the signal intensity of SIRT1 slightly decreased (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4B</xref>). However, under proliferating conditions, SIRT1 and LMOD1 predominantly localized in the nucleus (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Interestingly, after initiation of differentiation, both SIRT1 and LMOD1 were clearly detectable in the cytoplasm, indicating their translocation into the cytoplasm. At a later time point (2d of differentiation), the localization of SIRT1 can once again be observed in the nucleus, while LMOD1 remains in the cytoplasm. Using the fluorescent signal intensity, we quantified the cytoplasmic/nuclear ratios for both SIRT1 and LMOD1 and found that both proteins change their intracellular distribution during myogenic differentiation suggesting that their localization in the cell affects the differentiation process (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). Of note, we also observed a correlation between their cytoplasmic-nuclear partitioning, particularly during proliferation and at day one of differentiation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>). The correlation between their respective localization was reduced at day 2 of differentiation, with SIRT1 displaying mainly a nuclear localization while LMOD1 remained predominantly cytoplasmic (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). We confirmed these dynamic changes of sub-cellular localization for SIRT1 and LMOD1 by cellular fractionation experiments followed by immunoblot analysis (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4C</xref>).</p>

<p>Since SIRT1 protein abundance decreased with each day of differentiation as shown by our proteomics data and immunoblot analysis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4D</xref>), we hypothesized that the LMOD1-mediated change in SIRT1 location is especially required during early differentiation. Therefore, we repeated the cellular fractionation experiments focusing on the onset of myogenic differentiation with additional time points and by using LMOD1 OE cells. Next, we compared the nuclear fraction of the LMOD1 OE cells to the control cells to determine if LMOD1 alone can alter SIRT1 subcellular localization (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H-K</xref>). In particular, at 6 and 12 hours of differentiation, SIRT1 is highly abundant in the nucleus in control cells. However, these dynamics shift and the SIRT1 abundance decreases in the nucleus when LMOD1 is overexpressed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5I</xref>). In line with this observation, in LMOD1 overexpressing cells the cytoplasmic SIRT1 abundance increased at 0h (proliferation) and 6h differentiation, suggesting a shift of SIRT1 protein to the cytoplasm upon LMOD1 OE compared to the control already under proliferating conditions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5K</xref>). Together these data demonstrate that SIRT1 and LMOD1 dynamically change their subcellular localization and that overexpression of LMOD1 favors the cytoplasmic localization of SIRT1 at early stages of myogenic differentiation.</p>

<title>Reduction or inhibition of SIRT1 can partially restore the impaired myogenic differentiation caused by knockdown of LMOD1</title>
<p>Given the interaction of LMOD1 and SIRT1, we hypothesized that LMOD1 regulates SIRT1-mediated transcription of genes that are critical for myogenic differentiation. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the impact of reduced SIRT1 levels using both a genetic (siRNA targeting <italic>Sirt1</italic>) and a pharmacological approach (25 µM EX527, small molecule inhibitor specific for SIRT1) during myogenic differentiation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Peck et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Broussy, Laaroussi, and Vidal 2020</xref>). Primary myoblasts were transfected with siLmod1 and siSirt1 or incubated with EX527, at the time of induction of differentiation. After three days of differentiation, immunofluorescence staining was performed and analyzed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). We confirmed the significant decrease in LMOD1 and SIRT1 levels upon siRNA-mediated knockdown through immunoblot analysis (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5A</xref>) and qRT-PCR (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5B</xref>). Our results show that both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of SIRT1 signaling effectively promoted myogenic differentiation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>) leading to an increased number of nuclei per myotube in the siLmod1/siSirt1 double knockdown compared to the knockdown of LMOD1 alone, indicating an improvement in myotube fusion after knockdown of SIRT1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6G</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5C</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5D</xref>).

<p>Next, we performed RNA-sequencing to identify downstream effectors that could explain the improvements in myogenic differentiation observed after double knockdown of Lmod1 and Sirt1 (Table S4). Therefore, we performed a knockdown of <italic>Lmod1</italic> and <italic>Sirt1</italic> two days prior to differentiation, followed by a second siRNA transfection at the initiation of differentiation to ensure a high knockdown efficiency. After one day of differentiation, cells were harvested to quantify early transcriptional changes in the myogenic program after knockdown of <italic>Lmod1</italic> and <italic>Sirt1</italic> using RNAseq (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6J</xref>). Differential gene expression analysis confirmed a significant reduction of <italic>Lmod1</italic> and <italic>Sirt1</italic> mRNA in our experimental setup (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5E</xref>). Next, we identified 246 genes being significantly and oppositely regulated after knockdown of either <italic>Lmod1</italic> or <italic>Sirt1</italic> (Table S4). Interestingly, among these genes, we identified a subset of known SIRT1 target genes that were previously defined by ChIP-Seq analysis of MuSCs from WT and Sirt1<sup>mKO</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Ryall et al. 2015</xref>) (Table S4).

Taken together, our data show that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of SIRT1 signaling can partially reverse the impaired myogenic differentiation caused by knockdown of Lmod1 and that affecting LMOD1 level is sufficient to alter the expression of a subset of SIRT1 target genes, highlighting the role of the LMOD1-SIRT1 axis in myogenic differentiation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Myogenic differentiation involves the coordinated alterations of gene expression and reorganization of the cellular architecture. Here, we present a temporally resolved analysis of the proteome of primary mouse myoblasts undergoing differentiation <italic>in vitro.</italic> With a depth of more than 6000 proteins, our analysis covers three times more proteins compared to a previous study performed on an immortalized myoblast cell line (C2C12 cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Tannu et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kislinger et al. 2005</xref>). By using five independent primary myoblast lines, we were able to take into account the variability that typically affects primary cultures and derive robust and reproducible proteome signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Hindi et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">K. H. Kim, Qiu, and Kuang 2020</xref>). Our data highlight hundreds of changes in energy metabolism, RNA and protein synthesis as well as cytoskeletal organization that occur with specific temporal dynamics during myogenic differentiation. To demonstrate the relevance of our data, we decided to focus on LMOD1, a cytoskeletal protein whose role in myogenic differentiation has not yet been investigated. Although it is known that actin cytoskeletal dynamics are involved in myogenesis and that LMOD1 contributes to actin filament nucleation in smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Guerin and Kramer 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Heng and Koh 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Xie et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Chereau et al. 2008</xref>), the biological significance and functional role of LMOD1 during myogenic differentiation remained so far elusive. We found that LMOD1 is expressed by MuSCs, that its expression increases during myogenic differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that reduction of LMOD1 levels significantly affects myotube formation and the number of myonuclei per myotube. Furthermore, the timing of induction of LMOD1 expression during skeletal muscle regeneration suggests a role in differentiation and fusion rather than in myofiber maturation. This is further supported by our finding that knockdown of <italic>Lmod</italic>1 after injury of skeletal muscle results in reduced regeneration. Consistently, our knockdown studies revealed that the reduction of LMOD1 severely affects the myogenic differentiation and myonuclear numbers. Cells that expressed Myogenin started differentiating into proper myotubes, indicated by the quantification of Myogenin+/MHC- and Myogenin+/MHC+ cells even after knockdown of LMOD1. However, a subset of cells positive for MHC but negative for Myogenin did not progress in differentiation, possibly due to loss or insufficient activation of myogenin expression. Loss of myogenin has been shown to lead to deregulated mTORC1 signaling and results in faster cell cycle entry in MuSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ganassi et al. 2020</xref>). Since the knockdown of LMOD1 leads to an increase in the percentage of Myogenin-/MHC+ cells, the observed differentiation phenotype might be at least partially explained by a direct or indirect effect of LMOD1 on myogenin expression.</p>
<p>We found that LMOD1 selectively interacts with SIRT1. So far, there is no direct evidence suggesting that LMOD1 and SIRT1 have a specific binding domain where they can directly bind to each other. However, the comparison of primary sequences between LMOD1 and LMOD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Fowler and Dominguez 2017</xref>) reveals a 103 amino acid sequence unique for LMOD1, which could represent a possible binding interface. It is also conceivable that other proteins or molecules might be involved in mediating the interaction between LMOD1 and SIRT1, e.g., the RuvB-like AAA ATPase 1/2 (RUVBL1/RUVBL2). RUVBL1 participates in various complexes, including INO80, NuA4, SWR1, TIP60-P400, PAQosome (R2TP), as a transcriptional and/or chromatin modifier, with or without its homologue RUVBL2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Gorynia et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">P. B. Chen et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lakisic et al. 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>SIRT1 is a protein deacetylase that can localizes in the nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bai and Zhang 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Moynihan et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">I.-Y. Chen et al. 2006</xref>), and was shown to play a critical role in muscle differentiation and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Ryall et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Diaz-Ruiz et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Fulco et al. 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">2008</xref>). Myogenesis involves the shuttling of various proteins and myogenic regulators between the nucleus and cytoplasm, regulated by various signals and interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Grifone et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Nguyen et al. 2022</xref>). We have observed that the localization of SIRT1 changes dynamically during myogenic differentiation, and that the interaction between SIRT1 and LMOD1 increases during the initial stages of myogenic differentiation. Additionally, we showed that overexpression of LMOD1 affects the subcellular localization of SIRT1, leading to reduced levels of SIRT1 in the nucleus. We hypothesize that relocation of SIRT1 to the cytoplasm, mediated by LMOD1, is critical for the initiation of myogenic differentiation, resulting in the de-repression of MRFs including myogenin. Alternatively, LMOD1 might sequester SIRT1 within the cytoplasm, preventing its re-entry into the nucleus, which in turn results in the expression of MRF to initiate myogenic differentiation (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5F</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that reducing the protein levels of SIRT1 can enhance the differentiation of MuSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Ryall et al. 2015</xref>). Consistently, our data suggest that the negative impact of knockdown of <italic>Lmod1</italic> on myogenic differentiation can be partially restored by co-depletion of <italic>Sirt1</italic>. Our RNAseq analysis highlighted a subset of genes which were oppositely up- or downregulated after knockdown of either LMOD1 or SIRT1, including secreted factors and receptors that could potentially mediate this restoration of myogenic differentiation when LMOD1 and SIRT1 levels are reduced. The identified factors include <italic>Fgf6</italic>, <italic>Tgfa</italic>, <italic>Camk1d</italic>, <italic>Mcr</italic>, <italic>Lifr</italic>, <italic>Isl2</italic> and <italic>Tgm2,</italic> which were previously shown to be involved in proliferation and differentiation of MuSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Armand, Laziz, and Chanoine 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Knight and Kothary 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Yamane et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Dos Santos et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Hunt et al. 2013</xref>) by modulating signaling pathways such as mTOR, Wnt or IGF1-PI3K/Akt-Foxo signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Wang et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Cui et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Zhang et al. 2018</xref>). Further investigation of possible downstream effectors or modulators identified by RNAseq could reveal additional mechanisms by which LMOD1 interferes with the myogenic program.</p>
<p>Finally, we have discovered that the abundance of LMOD1 is approximately four times higher in MuSCs from geriatric mice compared to the abundance in MuSCs from young mice. Specifically, LMOD1 tends to accumulate in the nucleus of MuSCs as mice age. Disruption of the actin organization of the cytoskeleton and dynamics in aging and disease such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) or Nemaline myopathy (NM) were shown to impact the expression of myogenic regulators and different signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lai and Wong 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Eliazer et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Y. J. Kim et al. 2022</xref>). Studies have shown that SIRT1 maintains H4K16 in a deacetylated state in quiescent MuSCs, which leads to transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Ryall et al. 2015</xref>). Given the SIRT1-LMOD1 interaction that we have discovered, we speculate that the nuclear accumulation of LMOD1 might affect gene expression and chromatin remodeling in aged MuSCs. However, it remains to be investigated whether the accumulation of LMOD1 is a compensatory mechanism or is a causative factor leading to the dysregulation and impairment of MuSCs during aging. Identifying the molecular mechanism and potential downstream targets could be a promising strategy for discovering potential therapeutic targets for promoting muscle regeneration and improving muscle health in older adults.</p>

<title>Enrichment and digestion of biotinylated proteins (BioID)</title>
<p>The protocol was used as described in Bartolome et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bartolome et al. 2023</xref>). In short, pellets corresponding to 20 Mio cells were resuspended in 4.75 mL lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; 1mM EGTA; 1 % (v/v) Triton X-100; 1 mg/ml aprotinin; 0.5 mg/ml leupeptin; 250 U turbonuclease; 0.1 % (w/v) SDS) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Streptavidin Sepharose High Performance (GE Healthcare) was acetylated by the addition of 10 mM sulfo-NHS acetate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30 min twice and then equilibrated in lysis buffer. For each lysate 80 µl of equilibrated beads were used. Upon loading, beads were washed 5 times with 600 µl 50 mM AmBic. On-bead digest was performed with 200 µl LysC (5 ng/µl) at 37 °C overnight. First elution step was achieved using two times 150 µl of 50 mM AmBic. After pooling both fractions, peptides were further digested off-beads by adding 1 µg trypsin and incubating at 37 °C for 3 h. Biotinylated peptides were eluted in a second elution step using two times 150 µl 20 % TFA (Biosolve) in acetonitrile (Biosolve). Both fractions were pooled and neutralized to pH 8.0 by adding 50 µl 200 mM HEPES and sodium hydroxide as necessary. Peptides were digested further off-beads by adding 1 µg trypsin at 37 °C for 3 h. Digested peptides from the two elution steps were desalted using Waters Oasis® HLB μElution Plate 30 μm (Waters) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>

<title>LC-MS/MS analysis</title>
<p>Peptides were reconstituted in 10 µl reconstitution buffer at a concentration of 1 µg/µl, 0.5 μl of the HRM kit (Ki-3002-1, Biognosys) was added in a dilution recommended by the manufacturer and 1 μl were injected for measurement. Peptides were separated using the UltiMate 3000 UPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, for myoblasts) or nanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters, for BioID and Lmod1 overexpressing cell lines) fitted with trapping (nanoAcquity Symmetry C18, 5µm, 180 µm x 20 mm) and an analytical column (nanoAcquity BEH C18, 1.7µm, 75µm x 250mm). The outlet of the analytical column was coupled directly to Q-exactive HF (Thermo Fisher Scientific, for myoblasts) or Orbitrap Exploris 480 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, for BioID and Lmod1 overexpressing cell lines) using the Proxeon nanospray source. For myoblast experiment, solvent A was water, 0.1 % FA and solvent B was 80 % (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.08 % FA. Peptides were eluted via a non-linear gradient from 1 % to 62.5 % B in 131 min. Total runtime was 150 min, including clean-up and column re-equilibration. The peptides were introduced into the mass spectrometer via a Pico-Tip Emitter 360 µm OD x 20 µm ID; 10 µm tip (New Objective) and a spray voltage of 2.2 kV was applied. The RF ion funnel was set to 60 %.</p>
<p>Data Dependent Acquisition (DDA) settings were as follows: Full scan MS spectra with mass range 350-1650m/z were acquired in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 60,000 FWHM. The filling time was set at a maximum of 20ms with an AGC target of 3×10<sup>6</sup> ions. A Top15 method was employed to select precursor ions from the full scan MS for fragmentation (minimum AGC target of 1× 10<sup>3</sup> ions, normalized collision energy of 27 %), quadrupole isolation (1.6 m/z) and measurement in the Orbitrap (resolution 15,000 FWHM, fixed first mass 120 m/z). The fragmentation was performed after the accumulation of 2×10<sup>5</sup> ions or after filling time of 25ms for each precursor ion (whichever occurred first). Only multiply charged (2+ −7+) precursor ions were selected for MS/MS. Dynamic exclusion was employed with a maximum retention period of 20s. Isotopes were excluded.</p>
<p>For Data Independent Acquisition (DIA), 1 μg of reconstituted peptides were loaded using the same setup and LC conditions used for DDA. MS conditions were modified as follows: Full scan MS spectra with mass range 350-1650 m/z were acquired in profile mode in the Orbitrap with resolution of 120,000 FWHM. The filling time was set at a maximum of 60 ms with an AGC target of 3×10<sup>6</sup> ions. DIA scans were acquired with 40 mass window segments of differing widths across the MS1 mass range. The default charge state was set to 3+. HCD fragmentation (stepped normalized collision energy; 25.5, 27, 30 %) was applied and MS/MS spectra were acquired with a resolution of 30,000 FWHM with a fixed first mass of 200 m/z after accumulation of 3× 10<sup>6</sup> ions or after a filling time of 35ms (whichever occurred first). Data was acquired in profile mode. For data acquisition and processing Tune version 2.9 Q-Exactive HF</p>

<title>Proteomics data analysis</title>
<p>For myoblasts DIA search against a library was performed. Acquired data were processed using Spectronaut Professional v13 (Biognosys AG). For library creation, the DDA and DIA raw files were searched with Pulsar (Biognosys AG) against the mouse UniProt database (<italic>Mus musculus,</italic> v. 160106, 16,747 entries) with a list of common contaminants (247 entries) Swissprot database appended, using default settings. For library generation, default BGS factory settings were used.</p>
<p>DIA data were then uploaded and searched against this spectral library using Spectronaut Professional (v.10 and v.13 Biognosys) and default settings. Relative quantification was performed in Spectronaut for each pairwise comparison using a two-sided t-test performed at the precursor level followed by multiple testing correction and default settings, except: Major Group Quantity = median peptide quantity; Major Group Top N = OFF; Minor Group Quantity = median precursor quantity; Minor Group Top N = OFF; Data Filtering = Q value sparse; Normalization Strategy = Local normalization; Row Selection = Q value complete.</p>
<p>For Lmod1 overexpression cell lines, DIA raw data were analyzed using the directDIA pipeline in Spectronaut v.14 (Biognosysis, Switzerland) with BGS settings besides the following parameters: Protein LFQ method= QUANT 2.0, Proteotypicity Filter = Only protein group specific, Major Group Quantity = Median peptide quantity, Minor Group Quantity = Median precursor quantity, Data Filtering = Qvalue, Normalizing strategy = Local Normalization. The data were searched against an in-house database (<italic>Mus Musculus</italic>, 16,747 entries) and a contaminants (247 entries) Swissprot database. The data were searched with the following variable modifications: Oxidation (M) and Acetyl (Protein N-term). A maximum of 2 missed cleavages for trypsin and 5 variable modifications were allowed. The identifications were filtered to satisfy FDR of 1 % on peptide and protein level. Relative quantification was performed in Spectronaut for each paired comparison using the replicate samples from each condition. The data (candidate table) and data reports (protein quantities) were then exported, and further data analyses and visualization were performed with Rstudio using in-house pipelines and scripts.</p>
<p>BioID DIA raw data were analyzed using the directDIA pipeline in Spectronaut with v.15. The data were searched against a specific species (<italic>Homo sapiens,</italic> v. 160112, 20,375 entries) and a contaminants (247 entries) Swissprot database. The data were searched with the following modifications: Oxidation (M), Acetyl (Protein N-term) and Biotin_K. A maximum of 2 missed cleavages for trypsin and 5 variable modifications were allowed. The identifications were filtered to satisfy FDR of 1 % on peptide and protein level. Relative quantification was performed in Spectronaut using LFQ QUANT 2.0 method with Global Normalization, precursor filtering percentile using fraction 0.2 and global imputation. The data (candidate table) and data reports (protein quantities) were then exported, and further data analyses and visualization were performed with Rstudio using in-house pipelines and scripts.</p>

<title>Clustering and gene set enrichment analysis</title>
<p>Proteomics data for the myoblast differentiation time course were filtered for protein groups quantified by at least two unique (proteotypic) peptides. All the differentiation time points (1d:5d) were compared to undifferentiated myoblast (0d) and protein groups that showed an absolute AVG Log2 Ratio &gt; 0.58 and Q value &lt; 0.25 at any time point were selected for clustering analysis. Determination of an optimal number of clusters, clustering, and enrichment analysis for each cluster was performed with ClueR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Yang et al. 2015</xref>) using the AVG Log2 Ratios to 0d as input.</p>
<p>A gene set was created to analyze the LMOD1 overexpression cell line using all the protein groups differentially abundant in 1d vs. 0d myoblast differentiation time course (AVG Log2 Ratio &gt; 0.58 and Q value &lt; 0.05). This gene set was used as input for a gene set enrichment analysis based on AVG Log2 Ratios from the comparison of LMOD1 OE vs. GFP OE performed with WebGestalt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Liao et al. 2019</xref>).</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study offers insights into the role of Leiomodin-1 (LMOD1) in muscle stem cell biology, advancing our understanding of myogenic differentiation and indicating LMOD1 as a regulator of muscle regeneration, aging, and exercise adaptation. The integration of in vitro and in vivo approaches, complemented by proteomic and imaging methodologies, is <bold>solid</bold>. However, certain aspects require further attention to improve the clarity, impact, and overall significance of the work, particularly in substantiating the in vivo relevance. This work will provide a starting point that will be of value to medical biologists and biochemists working on LMOD and its variants in muscle biology.</p>

<p>This manuscript by Ori and colleagues investigates the role of Lmod1 in muscle stem cell activation and differentiation. The study begins with a time-course mass spectrometry analysis of primary muscle stem cells, identifying Lmod1 as a pro-myogenic candidate (Figure 1). While the initial approach is robust, the subsequent characterization lacks depth and clarity. Although the data suggest that Lmod1 promotes myogenesis, the underlying mechanisms remain vague, and key experiments are missing. Please find my comments below.</p>
<p>(1) The authors mainly rely on coarse and less-established readouts such as myotube length and spherical Myh-positive cells. More comprehensive and standard analyses, such as co-staining for Pax7, MyoD, and Myogenin, would allow quantification of quiescent, activated, and differentiating stem cells in knockdown and overexpression experiments. The exact stage at which Lmod1 functions (stem cell, progenitor, or post-fusion) is unclear due to the limited depth of the analysis. Performing similar experiments on cultured single EDL fibers would add valuable insights.</p>
<p>(2) In supplementary Figure 2E, the distinction between Hoechst-positive cells and total cell counts is unclear. The authors should clarify why Hoechst-positive cells increase and relabel &quot;reserve cells,&quot; as the term is confusing without reading the legend.</p>
<p>(3) The specificity of Lmod1 and Sirt1 immunostaining needs validation using siRNA-treated samples, especially as these data form the basis of the mechanistic conclusions.</p>
<p>(4) The authors must test the effect of Lmod1 siRNA on Sirt1 localization, as only overexpression experiments are shown.</p>
<p>(5) In Figure S3, the biotin signal in LMOD2 samples appears weak. The authors need to address whether comparing LMOD1 and LMOD2 is valid given the apparent difference in reaction efficiency. It would also help to highlight where Sirt1 falls on the volcano plot in S3B.</p>
<p>(6) The immunostaining data suggest that Lmod1 remains cytoplasmic throughout differentiation, whereas Sirt1 shows transient cytoplasmic localization at day 1 of differentiation. The authors should explain why Sirt1 is not constantly sequestered if Lmod1's cytoplasmic localization is consistent. It is also unclear whether day 1 is the key time point for Lmod1 function, as its precise role during myogenesis remains ambiguous.</p>
<p>(7) The introduction does not sufficiently establish the motivation or knowledge gap this work aims to address. Instead, it reads like a narration of disparate topics in a single paragraph. The authors should clarify the statement in line 150, &quot;since this protein has been...,&quot;.</p>
<p>Overall, while the identification of Lmod1 as a pro-myogenic factor is convincing, the mechanistic insights are insufficient, and the manuscript would benefit from addressing these concerns.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors identify Leiomodin-1 (LMOD1) as a key regulator of early myogenic differentiation, demonstrating its interaction with SIRT1 to influence SIRT1's cellular localization and gene expression. The authors propose that LMOD1 translocates SIRT1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm to permit the expression of myogenic differentiating genes such as MYOD or Myogenin.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A major strength of this work lies in the robust temporal resolution achieved through a time-course mass spectrometry analysis of in vitro muscle differentiation. This provides novel insights into the dynamic process of myogenic differentiation, often under-explored in terms of temporal progression. The authors provide a strong mechanistic case for how LMOD1 exerts its role in muscle differentiation which opens avenues to modulate.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>One limitation of the study is the in vivo data. Although the authors do translate their findings in vivo for LMOD1 localization and expression, the cross-sectional imaging is not highly convincing. Longitudinal cuts or isolated fibers could have been more useful specimens to answer these questions. Moreover, the authors do not assess their in vitro SIRT1 findings in vivo. A few key experiments in regenerating or aged mice would strengthen the mechanistic insight of the findings.</p>
<p>Discussion:</p>
<p>Overall, the study emphasizes the importance of understanding the temporal dynamics of molecular players during myogenic differentiation and provides valuable proteomic data that will benefit the field. Future studies should explore whether LMOD1 modulates the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of other transcription factors during muscle development and how these processes are mechanistically achieved. Investigating whether LMOD1 can be therapeutically targeted to enhance muscle regeneration in contexts such as exercise, aging, and disease will be critical for translational applications. Additionally, elucidating the interplay among LMOD1, LMOD2, and LMOD3 could uncover broader implications for actin cytoskeletal regulation in muscle biology.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the investigators identified LMOD1 as one of a subset of cytoskeletal proteins whose levels increase in the early stages of myogenic differentiation. Lmod1 is understudied in striated muscle and in particular in myogenic differentiation. Thus, this is an important study. It is also a very thorough study - with perhaps even too much data presented. Importantly, the investigators observed that LMOD1 appears to be important for skeletal regeneration, and myogenic differentiation and that it interacts with SIRT1. Both primary myoblast differentiation and skeletal muscle regeneration were studied. Rescue experiments confirmed these observations: SIRT1 can rescue perturbations of myogenic differentiation as a result of LMOD1 knockdown.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Particular strengths include: important topic, the use of primary skeletal cultures, the use of both cell culture and in vivo approaches, careful biomarker analysis of primary mouse myoblast differentiation, the use of two methods to probe the function of the Lmod1/SIRT1 pathway via using depletion approaches and inhibitors, and generation of six independent myoblast cultures. Results support their conclusions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Figure 1. Images of cells in Figure 1A are too small to be meaningful (especially in comparison to the other data presented in this figure). Perhaps the authors could make graphs smaller?</p>
<p>(2) Line 148 &quot;We found LMOD2 to be the most abundant Lmod in whole skeletal muscle.&quot; This is confusing since most if not all prior studies have shown that Lmod3 is the predominant isoform in skeletal muscle. The two papers that are cited are incorrectly cited. Clarification to resolve this discrepancy is needed.</p>
<p>(3) Figure 2. Immunoflorescence (IF) panels are too small to be meaningful. Perhaps the graphs could be made smaller and more space allocated for the IF panels? This issue is apparent for just about all IF panels - they are simply too small to be meaningful. Additionally, in many of the immunofluorescence figures, the colors that were used make it difficult to discern the stained cellular structures. For example in Figure S1, orange and purple are used - they do not stand out as well as other colors that are more commonly used.</p>
<p>(4) There is huge variability in many experiments presented - as such, more samples appear to be required to allow for meaningful data to be obtained. For example, Figure S2. Many experimental groups, only have 3 samples - this is highly problematic - I would estimate that 5-6 would be the minimum.</p>
<p>(5) Ponceau S staining is often used as a loading control in this manuscript for western blots. The area/molecular weight range actually used should be specified. Not clear why in some experiments GAPDH staining is used, in other experiments Ponceau S staining is used, and in some, both are used. In some experiments, the variability of total protein loaded from lane to lane is disconcerting. For example, in Figure S4C there appears to be more than normal variability. Can the protein assay be redone and samples run again?</p>
<p>(6) Figure S3 - Lmod3 is included in the figure but no mention of it occurs in the title of the figure and/or legend.</p>
<p>(7) Abstract, line 25. &quot;overexpression accelerates and improves the formation of myotubes&quot;. This is a confusing sentence. How is it improving the formation? A little more information about how they are different than developing myotubes in normal/healthy muscles would be helpful.</p>
<p>(8) It is impossible from the IF figures presented to determine where Lmod1 localizes in the myocytes. Information on its subcellular localization is important. Does it localize with Lmod2 and Lmod3 at thin filament pointed ends?</p>
