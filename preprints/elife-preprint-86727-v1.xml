<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) is a key player in a plethora of physiological and pathological events. Nevertheless, little is known about the dynamics of PGE<sub>2</sub> secretion from a single cell and its effect on the neighboring cells. Here, by observing confluent Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells expressing fluorescent biosensors we demonstrate that calcium transients in a single cell cause PGE<sub>2</sub>-mediated radial spread of PKA activation (RSPA) in neighboring cells. By <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging, RSPA was also observed in the basal layer of the mouse epidermis. Experiments with an optogenetic tool revealed a switch-like PGE<sub>2</sub> discharge in response to the increasing cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. The cell density of MDCK cells correlated with the frequencies of calcium transients and the following RSPA. The ERK MAP kinase activation also enhanced the frequency of RSPA in MDCK and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thus, the PGE<sub>2</sub> discharge is regulated temporally by calcium transients and ERK activity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) is an eicosanoid lipid mediator that regulates a plethora of homeostatic functions including vascular permeability, immune response, and mucosal integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Narumiya, 2007</xref>). The metabolic pathway of PGE<sub>2</sub> production, which is a major branch of the arachidonic acid cascade, was extensively studied in the mid to late 20th century. This cascade starts from the activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Park et al., 2006</xref>). Increased intracellular calcium induces the translocation and activation of cPLA2 from the cytosol to the Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, and perinuclear membrane, where cPLA2 cleaves arachidonic acid out of the membrane phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Clark et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Evans et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hirabayashi et al., 1999</xref>). The arachidonic acid is then presented to cyclooxygenases, COX1 and COX2, to yield PGH<sub>2</sub>, which is further converted to PGE<sub>2</sub> by prostaglandin E synthases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Smith &amp; Langenbach, 2001</xref>). PGE<sub>2</sub> synthesized <italic>de novo</italic> is secreted to the extracellular space either by passive diffusion or by active transport by multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Reid et al., 2003</xref>). The secreted PGE<sub>2</sub> exerts its actions by acting on four G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), EP1 to EP4, expressed in neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Narumiya, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Regan, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Although it is largely believed that the PGE<sub>2</sub> action is primarily regulated by the expression and activation of COX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Kalinski, 2012</xref>), cPLA2 appears to play a more important role in the short-term regulation of PGE<sub>2</sub> production and secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Leslie, 2015</xref>). It was shown that the secretion of arachidonic acid is induced within a few minutes after the calcium-dependent translocation of cPLA2 to endo-membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Evans et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hirabayashi et al., 1999</xref>). Moreover, ERK and p38 MAP kinases also contribute to the activation of cPLA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lin et al., 1993</xref>), which may be calcium-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Gijón et al., 2000</xref>). Importantly, these earlier biochemical studies did not elucidate the dynamics of the production and secretion of PGE<sub>2</sub> at the single-cell level, leaving many questions unanswered. For example, do all cells contribute to the production of PGE<sub>2</sub>? Does each cell keep secreting PGE<sub>2</sub> upon stimulation?</p>
<p>Genetically encoded biosensors based on the principle of Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) allow us to visualize the dynamics of intracellular signaling molecules at the single-cell resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Greenwald et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Miyawaki &amp; Niino, 2015</xref>). The development of transgenic mice expressing FRET biosensors has opened a window to the visualization of signaling molecule activity in live tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Terai et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, by using the activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and ERK MAP kinase as surrogate markers, we can also visualize the intercellular communications mediated by Gs-coupled receptors and tyrosine kinase receptors in live tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Hino et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Konishi et al., 2021</xref>). In this study, we show that PGE<sub>2</sub> discharged from a single cell causes radial spread of PKA activation (RSPA) in neighboring cells in tissue culture and the mouse epidermis. By combining a chemical biology approach, optogenetic stimulation, and a simulation model, we quantitatively analyzed the PGE<sub>2</sub> secretion and found that the PGE<sub>2</sub> discharge is regulated temporally by calcium transients and quantitatively by growth factor signaling and cell density.</p>

<title>PGE<sub>2</sub> mediates radial spread of PKA activation (RSPA)</title>
<p>In an attempt to understand intercellular communication under physiologic conditions, we observed the PKA activity of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells by using the FRET biosensor Booster-PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Watabe et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>)(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). We noticed that PKA activation propagates from a single cell to neighboring cells under a confluent condition. We named this phenomenon radial spread of PKA activation (RSPA) and pursued underlying mechanisms (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, Video 1). In a typical example, approximately 100 neighboring cells located within a 100 µm distance exhibit firework-like spread of PKA activation, which decays within several minutes. To characterize this phenomenon without preoccupations, we developed a program to identify and characterize RSPA under various conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). The frequency and the radius of RSPA depended on the cell density; i.e., RSPA was observed only when cells were maintained at more than 6×10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D, 1E</xref>). The probability of RSPA in each cell was also increased in a cell density-dependent manner (Fig. S1). To examine whether the PKA activation correlates with increased intracellular cAMP concentration, we employed another FRET biosensor for cAMP, hyBRET-Epac, and performed a similar experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ponsioen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Watabe et al., 2020</xref>)(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F, 1G</xref>). We found that the pattern of cAMP concentration change is very similar to the activity change of PKA, indicating that a Gs protein-coupled receptor (GsPCR) mediates RSPA. Previous transcriptome analysis of MDCK cells showed that ATP receptor and PGE<sub>2</sub> receptor EP2 are the most abundant GsPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Shukla et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, we examined the contribution of the ATP receptor and PGE<sub>2</sub> receptors EP2 and EP4 by using specific inhibitors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). Inhibitors against EP2, EP4, and COX, but not the ATPase apyrase, abolished RSPA, indicating that PGE<sub>2</sub> mediates RSPA.</p>

<title>RSPA is also observed in the epidermis of the PKAchu mice</title>
<p>To clarify the physiological relevance of RSPA, we used PKAchu mice, which are transgenic mice expressing a FRET biosensor for PKA, AKAR3EV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kamioka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Sato et al., 2020</xref>)(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). We previously observed that ERK MAP kinase activation is propagated radially among the basal layer cells of the mouse epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hiratsuka et al., 2015</xref>), but we failed to observe a similar propagation of PKA activation. We reasoned that this failure was due to the low frequency and short duration of this phenomenon. When we observed a region of over 1 mm square at 1 min intervals, we successfully observed RSPA in the basal layer of the mouse auricular epidermis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, Video 2). Upon i.p. injection of a COX inhibitor, RSPA almost completely disappeared within 10 min (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), indicating that RSPA in the epidermis is mediated by prostaglandins, presumably PGE<sub>2</sub>. The cell density in the basal layer is approximately 2×10<sup>6</sup> cells cm<sup>-2</sup>, which is markedly higher than that in MDCK cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). It is not clear whether this may be related to the lower frequency (∼300 cm<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>) and smaller radius of RSPA in the basal layer cells compared to MDCK cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>).</p>

<title>RSPA is triggered by calcium transients</title>
<p>What causes RSPA? In agreement with the principal role of calcium in cPLA2 activation, dual imaging of calcium and PKA showed that an intracellular calcium transient precedes RSPA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). As anticipated, the frequency of RSPA was suppressed by the calcium chelator BAPTA-AM (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Note that not all of the calcium transients induced RSPA (Fig.3C, arrowheads). Approximately only one-tenth of calcium transients evoke RSPA (compare <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3D</xref>). Moreover, the frequency of calcium transients was also cell density-dependent (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). To further pursue the relationship between calcium transient and RSPA, we employed the Gq-DREADD system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Armbruster et al., 2007</xref>). The Gq-DREADD-expressing producer cells were plated with the reporter cells expressing Booster-PKA at a 1:1,200 ratio (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>). Upon activation of the Gq protein-coupled receptor by the DREADD ligand CNO, we observed RSPA with almost the same size and time course as observed under the non-stimulated condition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). Among cells with the calcium transient, 76% exhibited RSPA, significantly higher than in the unstimulated state. Because the average calcium signal intensity was higher in RSPA (+) cells than in RSPA (-) cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>), the peak value of calcium transients appears to be important for the following induction of RSPA.</p>

<title>RSPA is a switch-like response to cytoplasmic calcium concentration</title>
<p>To further explore the relationship between the peak value of the calcium transient and RSPA, we employed OptoSTIM1, an optogenetic tool to activate the calcium influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kyung et al., 2015</xref>)(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). As anticipated, a blue light flash caused a calcium transient, followed by RSPA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). In a preliminary experiment, a 30 min interval was sufficient to restore the calcium response; therefore, we repeated the blue light flash every 30 min to 1 hour with increasing light intensity. As the light intensity was increased, the amplitude of calcium transients represented by the R-GECO signal also increased linearly (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). In stark contrast, RSPA occurred in an all-or-nothing manner. We repeated this experiment for 13 cells to find any correlations between the calcium concentration and the size of RSPA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). The R-GECO signal intensity ratio (F/F0) that evoked RSPA ranged from 1.5 to 2.1 among the different cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, left), but the size of RSAP did not show a clear correlation with the R-GECO signal intensity ratio (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, right). This observation indicates that the amount of PGE<sub>2</sub> secretion is predetermined and that there is a threshold of the cytoplasmic calcium concentration for the triggered PGE<sub>2</sub> secretion.</p>

<title>High cell density increases the sensitivity to PGE<sub>2</sub></title>
<p>We next explored the mechanism that determines the size of RSPA. First, taking advantage of the reproducibility of DREADD system, we examined the involvement of EP2/EP4, cPLA2, and COX1/2 in the calcium-induced RSPA by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). As anticipated, we did not observe any RSPA by using the reporter MDCK cells deficient from EP2 and EP4. Knockout of COX2 and cPLA2, but not COX1, in the producer cells almost completely abolished CNO-induced RSPA. These results support the idea that RSPA is mediated by PGE<sub>2</sub> via the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-cPLA2-COX2-EP2/4-cAMP-PKA pathway (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p>

The average intensity of the whole view field of mKate2 or mKOκ, at 20 to 30 min after the addition of PGE<sub>2</sub>, was applied to calculate the mKate2/mKOκ ratio. Three or four independent experiments were performed. (<bold>D</bold>) COX-DKO MDCK cells were seeded at the indicated cell densities and subjected to RNA-Seq analysis.

</fig>
<p>Next, because the size of RSPA depends on the cell density (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>), we reasoned that the sensitivity of MDCK cells to PGE<sub>2</sub> may also be regulated by cell density. To avoid the effect of PGE<sub>2</sub> produced by the cells, the COX1/2-deficient MDCK cells were challenged by the bath application of PGE<sub>2</sub>. We found an approximately 10-fold difference in the EC50 between the high and low cell densities (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>), suggesting that increased sensitivity to PGE<sub>2</sub> underlies the increased RSPA size under the confluent condition. Transcriptome analysis showed a 2-fold increase in guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(s) subunit alpha (GNAS) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>), but it is not clear whether this difference is sufficient to explain the difference in RSPA frequency. We did not observe any cell density dependence in the transcription of EP2, EP4 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>), phosphodiesterases, or adenylyl cyclases (Fig. S2). Thus, the cell density appears to increase the sensitivity to PGE<sub>2</sub> mostly in a transcription-independent manner.</p>

<title>ERK activity is required for RSPA</title>
<p>Previously, we reported that ERK activation is propagated among confluent MDCK cells in a wave-like fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aoki et al., 2013</xref>). To examine whether ERK activity also regulates RSPA, we simultaneously observed ERK and PKA activities by using EKAREV-NLS and Boobser-PKA, respectively (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). It appeared that the center of RSPA was localized primarily in areas of high ERK activity. Further quantitative analysis has shown that the ERK activity of the cells locating in the center of RSPA was significantly higher than that of the randomly chosen cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, left). However, the size of RSPA did not correlate with the ERK activity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, right). We next examined the timing of RSPA and the passage of ERK activation waves by aligning the events at the highest PKA activity. It appears that RSPA was evoked when the cells exhibited the highest ERK activity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C, 6D</xref>). Cross-correlation analysis of PKA activity and ERK activity revealed that ERK activation preceded PKA activation by approximately 3 min (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). The ERK activation wave is known to be mediated by EGFR and EGFR ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lin et al., 2022</xref>).</p>

<p>Accordingly, the addition of EGF increased the frequency of RSPA in our experiments, while the MEK and EGFR inhibitors almost completely abrogated RSPA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>).

<title>PGE<sub>2</sub> discharge causes radial spread of PKA activation in neighboring cells</title>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, only one study has visualized PGE<sub>2</sub> secretion from a single cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Zonta et al., 2003</xref>). In this study, HEK cells expressing the Gq-coupled PGE<sub>2</sub> receptor EP1 and a calcium indicator were used to monitor PGE<sub>2</sub> release from agonist-stimulated astrocytes. However, the spontaneous release of PGE<sub>2</sub> has never been visualized in either tissue culture cells or live animals. Here we have shown that PGE<sub>2</sub> is discharged after calcium transients in MDCK cells at high cell densities (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). This PGE<sub>2</sub> discharge leads to the radial spread of PKA activation, which we named RSPA, in the neighboring EP2-expressing cells. By using transgenic mice expressing the PKA biosensor, RSPA was also observed in the mouse auricular epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.2</xref>). RSPA in the epidermis is almost completely shut off by COXi, strongly suggesting that prostaglandin(s), most likely PGE<sub>2</sub>, mediates RSPA in the skin. Notably, we failed to observe RSPA in melanoma tissues in which calcium transients were frequently observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Konishi et al., 2021</xref>). We reasoned that repetitive PGE<sub>2</sub> secretion from tumor cells maintains a high PGE<sub>2</sub> concentration in the tumor microenvironment, which prevented us from observing pulsatile PKA activation. In fact, the PGE<sub>2</sub> concentration in melanoma tissue is known to reach as high as 10 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Konishi et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, RSPA in the skin may function as an alert signal in an early phase of cellular stress.</p>

<title>PGE<sub>2</sub> is discharged in a switch-like manner in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients</title>
<p>Soon after the identification of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent translocation domain within cPLA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Clark et al., 1991</xref>), Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent cPLA2 arachidonic acid release from cells has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Gijón et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hirabayashi et al., 1999</xref>); therefore, it is not surprising to find that the PGE<sub>2</sub> discharge in our present experiments was due to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent cPLA2 activation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). However, visualization of PGE<sub>2</sub> secretion at the single-cell resolution revealed a switch-like response of PGE<sub>2</sub> discharge to the increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Recruitment of cPLA2 to the ER and perinuclear membrane requires a higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration than that to Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Evans et al., 2001</xref>). If so, cPLA2 may be sequestered at Golgi at low intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, and, only when the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration exceeds the threshold, cPLA2 may reach the ER to liberate arachidonic acids.</p>

<title>ERK also regulates the probability of RSPA</title>
<p>In the cell density-dependent RSPA of MDCK cells, ERK activity regulates the probability, but not the size, of RSPA. Of note, the MEK inhibitor did not significantly decrease the frequency of calcium transients (Fig. S3), suggesting that ERK had a direct effect on the production of PGE<sub>2</sub>. Because ERK positively regulates cPLA2 by phosphorylating Ser<sup>505</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cook &amp; McCormick, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Qiu et al., 1993</xref>), it is reasonable that the RSPA is regulated by ERK activity.</p>
<p>The ERK activation wave is operated by a positive feedforward mechanism in which ERK promotes EGFR ligand shedding and the following EGFR activation increases ERK activity in the neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aoki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Hino et al., 2020</xref>). Here we found that the ERK activation functions as the “AND gate” for PGE<sub>2</sub> production together with the calcium transients (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Notably, the propagation of PKA activation, ∼100 µm/min (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>), is markedly faster than that of ERK activation, 2–4 µm/min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hiratsuka et al., 2015</xref>). Because PKA antagonizes Ras-dependent ERK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Burgering et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cook &amp; McCormick, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wu et al., 1993</xref>), the EGFR ligand-ERK and PGE<sub>2</sub>-PKA pathways fit the Turing diffusion reaction model consisting of slow positive and fast negative signaling cascades.</p>

<title>RSPA may not directly affect cell competition</title>
<p>Recently, PGE<sub>2</sub> was shown to regulate cell competition among MDCK cells. Interestingly, extrusion of Ras-transformed MDCK cells has been shown to be suppressed by PGE<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Sato et al., 2020</xref>), whereas extrusion of MDCK cells expressing constitutively active YAP was dependent on PGE<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ishihara et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, the effect of PGE<sub>2</sub> in cell competition could be markedly different according to the signaling cascades that cause the oncogenic changes of MDCK cells.</p>
<p>Importantly, PGE<sub>2</sub> promotes the extrusion of MDCK cells expressing the constitutively active YAP by internalization of E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ishihara et al., 2020</xref>), which is a relatively slow process. Since RSPA causes PKA activation for only several minutes in each cell, multiple RSPA events may be needed to reach the concentration required for the induction of extrusion.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We have shown that the PGE<sub>2</sub> discharge from a single cell is a stochastic and switch-like event in the confluent MDCK cells and mouse epidermis. The secreted PGE<sub>2</sub> can transiently activate PKA in cells within a few hundred micrometers from the producer cell. The question of why cells adopt this pulsatile rather than continuous secretion of PGE<sub>2</sub> awaits the future.</p>

<p>The program code for image analysis is available via GitHub at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/TetsuyaWatabe-1991/RSPAanalysis">https://github.com/TetsuyaWatabe-1991/RSPAanalysis</ext-link>.</p>
<p>Ratio images of MDCK cells expressing Booster-PKA were created after background subtraction. A median filter and a Gaussian 2D filter were applied to each image for noise reduction. The ratio image was normalized by a minimum intensity projection along the time axis. The processed images were binarized with a predetermined threshold and processed by morphological opening and closing to refine the RSPA area. Center coordinates and equivalent circle radii were obtained from each RSPA area. If the distance between the center coordinates of RSPA between successive frames was less than 100 μm, they were considered to be the same RSPA. For MDCK cells expressing hyBRET-Epac and mouse ear skin expressing AKAR3EV, the center coordinates of each RSPA were manually determined due to the low signal-to-noise ratio. To obtain the time course of the RSPA radius, concentric regions were defined at the center of each RSPA. The median FRET ratio in each concentric ROI was calculated. The radius of the outermost concentric region where the median ratio value exceeds a predetermined threshold was defined as the radius of the RSPA.</p>

<title>Cross-correlation analysis of ERK and PKA activity</title>
<p>Cross-correlation analysis was performed with Python using the scientific library SciPy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.scipy.org">http://www.scipy.org</ext-link>). The centers of each spontaneous RSPA in MDCK cells expressing both EKAREV and Booster-PKA were detected automatically as described above. The regions of interest were defined at the center of each RSPA with a radius of 10 µm, and the average ERK and PKA activity from 2 to 5 cells was quantified. The program code for this analysis is available via GitHub as described above.</p>

<title>RNA-Seq</title>
<p>COX1 and COX2-deficient MDCK cells expressing Booster-PKA were seeded in collagen-coated glass-bottom 96-well plates (AGC Inc.) at a density of 1.5 × 10<sup>4</sup> or 6.0 × 10<sup>4</sup> or 2.4 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. After 24 h of incubation, the culture media were replaced with phenol red-free M199 (ThermoFisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Three hours after medium replacement, RNA was extracted from each sample using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Libraries for RNA-Seq were prepared using an NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs) and sequenced on the NextSeq500 (Illumina) as 75 bp single-end reads. RNA-Seq data were trimmed using Trim Galore version 0.6.6 (Krueger 2015) and Cutadapt version 2.8 (Martin 2011). The quality of reads was checked and filtered using FastQC version 0.11.9 (Andrews 2010). The reads were mapped to a reference genome canFam3.1 (Lindblad-Toh 2005, Hoeppner 2014) using HISAT2 version 2.2.1 (Kim 2019), and the resulting aligned reads were sorted and indexed using SAMtools version 1.7 (Li 2009). Relative abundances of genes were measured in FPKM using StringTie version 2.1.4 (Kovaka 2019, Pertea 2015). Plots were created in Python using the pandas, matplotlib, NumPy, and seaborn libraries.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All statistical analyses and visualizations were performed in Python using the libraries NumPy, pandas, SciPy, pingouin, matplotlib, and seaborn. No statistical analysis was used to predetermine the sample size. Welch’s t-test was used to evaluate statistically significant diLJerences. The p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study reports investigation of the dynamics of PKA at the single-cell level in in vitro and in epithelia in vivo. Using different fluorescent biosensors and optogenetic actuators, the authors dissect the signaling pathway responsible for PKA waves, finding that PKA activation is a consequence of PGE2 release, which in turn is triggered by calcium pulses, requiring high ERK activity. The evidence supporting the claims is <bold>solid</bold>. At this stage the work is still partly descriptive in nature, and additional measurements would increase the strength of mechanistic insights and physiological relevance.</p>

<p>This research article by Watabe T and colleagues characterizes PKA waves triggered by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). What the author discovered is that waves of PKA occur both in vitro, in MDCK epithelial monolayers, and in vivo, in the ear epidermis in mice. The PKA waves are the consequence PGE2 discharge, that in turn is triggered by Calcium bursts. Calcium level and ERK activity intensity control that mechanism by acting at different levels.</p>
<p>This article is a technological tour de force using different biosensors and optogenetic actuators. What makes this article interesting is the combination of these tools together to dissect a complex, highly dynamic signaling pathway at the single-cell level. For this reason, this paper represents the essence of modern cell biology and paves the way for the cell biology of the future. However, we think that the paper in this stage is still partly descriptive in its nature, and more measurements are needed to increase the strength of the mechanistic insights. Also, the work is not conclusive, some results are over-interpreted, and more work has to be done if the authors want to support all their claims.</p>

<p>This study visualizes a specific localized form of cell-to-cell communication and conveys very well with what dynamics and sensitivity this biological phenomenon occurs.</p>
<p>Using a FRET-based PKA biosensor, the authors observed that radial localized kinase activity changes spontaneously occur in adjacent cells of certain cell density. This phenomenon of radial propagation of PKA activity changes in groups of cells was further mechanistically elucidated and characterized. Interestingly, the authors found that individual cells in the cell groups form spontaneous Ca2+ transients, which at a certain strength can trigger the biosynthesis and release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). PGE2 then acts on the neighboring cells and triggers the increase of cAMP levels and the associated activation of the PKA via G-protein-coupled receptors (EP2 and EP4). In systematic, well-structured experiments, it was then found that the frequency of occurrence of such radial activations depends not only on the cell density but also on the activation state of the ERK MAP kinase pathway. The authors skillfully used various modern genetically encoded biosensors and other tools such as optogenetic tools to visualize and characterize an interesting biological phenomenon of cell-to-cell communication. The insights gained with these investigations produce a better understanding of the dynamics, sensitivity, and spatial extent with which such communications can occur in a cell network. It is also worth noting that the authors have not limited the studies to 2D cell culture in vitro, but were also able to confirm the findings in an animal model.</p>

<p>The manuscript entitled &quot;Calcium transients trigger switch-like discharge of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in an ERK-dependent manner&quot; by Watabe et al. investigates the interaction between PGE2, PKA, calcium and ERK signaling in MCDK cells and in mouse epidermis. By expressing PKA, calcium and ERK activity reporters, the authors conclude that calcium transients trigger release of PGE2 that signals through GPCR receptors EP2 and EP4 to recruit PKA in neighboring cells. Determining the dynamics of signaling molecules and their interrelationships is important to fully identify the spatiotemporal aspects of signaling mechanisms. This study addresses some aspects of the calcium-PGE2-GPCR-Erk-PKA signaling pathway in a cell line and in mouse skin ex vivo.</p>
<p>However, the sequential recruitment of the different signaling molecules has been described in previous studies. Hence, the novelty of the findings is limited.</p>
<p>
Additionally, the interpretation of some of the data is too speculative, more likely explanations are not considered, or not well supported by the data presented. The main conclusions the authors present are potentially artifactual (ie, cell density-dependent phenomena) and the authors need to either do further experiments to better support their conclusions or re-interpret the physiological significance of their findings.</p>
