<title>Abstract</title><p>Male infertility depends on both sperm and seminal plasma and is induced by aging. In this study, male infertility was examined with seminal plasma and its synthesis mechanism. The factors ensuring <italic>in vivo</italic> fertilization potential was secreted from seminal vesicle where the factors were synthesized in an androgen-dependent manner. Androgen increased glucose uptake and glycolytic capacity in seminal vesicles, which caused activation of oleic acid synthesis rather than mitochondrial ATP synthesis. ACLY was identified as a key player in this metabolic mechanism for producing oleic acid that was incorporated into the sperm and enhanced fertilization potential <italic>in vivo</italic>. In conclusion, an important role of testosterone-induced metabolic pathways in the seminal vesicle was to ensure the synthesis of oleic acid, which is essential for sperm fertilization <italic>in vivo</italic>. These results provide new perspectives for the development of biochemical markers of semen to assess male fertility and for artificial insemination techniques.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Infertility is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the failure to conceive within 12 months despite contraceptive-free sexual intercourse. Its prevalence has increased over the decades and now accounts for 17.5% of couples worldwide (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></italic>). The male partner is thought to be solely or in combination responsible for 50% of infertility cases, and the male factor in the etiology of infertility is highly recognized. The male fertility depends largely on the quality of semen composed of sperm and seminal plasma and decreases with aging.</p>
<p>Spermatogenesis, the process by which mature sperm are generated, takes place partially in the testis, where the characteristic sperm morphology of the head, middle, and tail is formed. Within testis however, sperm are functionally immature and cannot penetrate an oocyte until they undergo a maturation process that occurs during their passage through the epididymis (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></italic>). Sperm recovered from the epididymis can fertilize a mature oocyte <italic>in vitro</italic> but cannot maintain sustained liner motility required for migration from the uterus to the oviduct (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></italic>). Thus, when epididymal sperm are artificially inseminated to the cervix or uterus, fertilization rates are low (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></italic>). However, when epididymal sperm are mixed with seminal plasma at the time of ejaculation or when sperm are exposed to seminal plasma <italic>in vitro</italic>, even for only a brief period of time, they acquire <italic>in vivo</italic> fertilization potential and are capable of passing through the female reproductive tract and fertilizing ovulated oocyte <italic>in vivo</italic> (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></italic>). Thus, sperm formation occurs in the testis, they mature in the epididymis, but only acquire the <italic>in vivo</italic> fertilization ability after exposure to seminal plasma.</p>
<p>Seminal plasma is mainly produced in the seminal vesicles (approximately 65-75%), with approximately 20-30% produced by the prostate, and small amounts secreted by the bulbourethral and urethral glands (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></italic>). Seminal plasma or TGFβ, a component of seminal plasma, increases antigen-specific Treg cells in uterus of mice and humans which induce immune tolerance, resulting in pregnancy (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></italic>). Furthermore, SVS2 that is secreted from the seminal vesicle is also known to be required for sperm to escape attack by the female immune system in uterus (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></italic>). In addition, seminal plasma is known to contain various biochemical components that support sperm metabolism, including lipids and organic acids. Specifically, Rosecrans et al. (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></italic>) found significant differences in the levels of most biochemical components in seminal plasma compared to blood, with specific factors like fructose being rarely detected in blood but abundant in seminal plasma. Our previous studies (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></italic>) documented that seminal plasma also contains creatine, and fatty acids, that are taken up by sperm within minutes. These substances play crucial roles in regulating sperm metabolic pathways and enhancing sperm motility. Collectively these observations indicate that seminal plasma not only alters the female immune system to protect sperm but also directly influences sperm metabolic pathways, facilitating the transformation of sperm capable of <italic>in vivo</italic> fertilization.</p>
<p>Some specific factors that male accessory glands contribute to seminal plasma and impact male fertility have been elucidated. For example, surgical removal of seminal vesicles in male mice and rats was associated with infertility (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></italic>). The observation that fructose (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></italic>) and citric acid (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></italic>) concentrations in seminal plasma of control mice and rats are higher than in castrated animals indicates that specific functions of the accessory glands might be affected by testicular-derived testosterone that is known to activate the intracellular androgen receptor (AR;NR3C4), required for gene regulation of transcription. AR-deficient mice have been found to be infertile (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></italic>), and long-term administration of androgen receptor antagonists, like flutamide, abolished male fertility (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></italic>). AR-deficient mice and transcriptome analyses have identified specific targets of AR (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></italic>). In both mice and human, androgen levels decrease with aging, and their concentrations have been reported to cause a decrease in male fertility, especially ejaculated sperm motility. Therefore, the reduction of androgen concentrations may affect the metabolic mechanisms of the accessory reproductive organs and alter the composition of seminal plasma with aging. However, the metabolic mechanisms that impact sperm functions are governed by a complex of enzymatic reactions and therefore, the intricate interplay between testosterone and seminal plasma synthesis in the accessory reproductive organs requires further investigation.</p>
<p>In this study, we first performed various bioassays to identify which accessory glands are essential for sperm fertility. Subsequently, comparative <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> analyses were performed using a hypoandrogenic model. In addition, biochemical and molecular techniques such as RNA-seq, flux analysis, mass spectrometry, and knockdown experiments were employed. These analyses reveal the pathways by which seminal vesicles synthesize seminal plasma, ensure fertilization ability, and provide new therapeutic and preventive strategies for male infertility.</p>

<title>Seminal vesicle and prostate-derived fluids induce functional sperm motility</title>
<p>A bioassay using epididymal sperm that had not been exposed to seminal plasma was done to clarify the effect of seminal plasma on sperm functions. For this bioassay, fluids were prepared from seminal vesicle secretion and homogenized prostate tissues, and then the fluid was mixed with the basic medium, Human Tubal Fluid (HTF) medium in various proportions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1A</xref>-D). The addition of seminal vesicle secretion alone to the basic medium (HTF medium) significantly increased the rate of sperm linear motility (LIN) compared to the HTF medium alone (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1D</xref>). The straight line velocity (VSL) of those sperm was also significantly increased (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1C</xref>). This significant increase in straightening of sperm by the seminal vesicle-derived secretion was further significantly positively affected by the addition of prostate extract 1:9 or 2:8 to the seminal vesicle secretion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1C</xref>,D). However, no significant improvement in straightness was observed with the mixture of prostate extract alone (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1C</xref>,D). These results clearly indicate that sperm exposure to seminal plasma factors significantly improves sperm linear motility and that this positive effect is mainly due to the seminal vesicle secretory factors.</p>

<p>The functions of male accessory reproductive organs are regulated by androgens. Therefore, to elucidate whether the seminal vesicle factors, which enhance sperm linear motility, are synthesized in an androgen-dependent manner, bioassays were performed using seminal vesicle secretions collected from control mice or mice treated for 7 consecutive days with flutamide, an androgen receptor antagonist, and sperm collected from the epididymis of mice not treated with flutamide (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1E</xref>). The results showed that LIN and VSL were significantly reduced in the seminal vesicle secretions from flutamide-treated mice (Flutamide) compared to the control mice (Ctrl) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1F</xref>,G). The reduction of sperm linier motility speed (VSL) was also significantly lower in the sperm treated with seminal vesicle secretions from over 12 months old mice that showed low circular testosterone level as compared with the sperm treated with seminal vesicle secretions from young adult mice (3 months old mice) (Supplemental <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1A,B</xref>). Furthermore, JC-1 staining to measure mitochondrial membrane potential, which is important for sperm linear motility, showed significantly lower mitochondrial membrane potential activity in sperm treated with the secretions of seminal vesicles from flutamide-treated mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1H</xref>). These results indicated that androgen-dependent changes in seminal vesicle functions alter the levels/activity of seminal vesicle secretion factors, which regulate sperm linear motility. The changes of seminal vesicle functions were also induced with aging.</p>

<title>Testosterone-androgen receptor activity suppresses the proliferation of seminal vesicle epithelial cells</title>
<p>To understand the difference between seminal vesicles that secrete factors for enhancing sperm linear motility and those that are impaired in this function, we performed histological analysis of seminal vesicles recovered from mice treated and non-treated with flutamide. In control mice, the seminal vesicle epithelial cells were in a single layer, and androgen receptors were localized in the nuclei of seminal vesicle epithelial cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2A</xref>). However, in mice treated with continuous administration of flutamide, seminal vesicle epithelial cells were multilayered, and the strong accumulation of androgen receptors in nucleus was not observed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2A</xref>). To investigate the cause of this multilayering of cells, we performed Ki67 staining, a marker of cell proliferation, and apoptosis detection by TUNEL staining (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2B</xref>). The results showed that the percentage of Ki67-positive cells increased significantly after treatment with flutamide, but the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells did not change, suggesting that the testosterone-androgen receptor pathway is responsible for the inhibition of proliferation of seminal vesicle epithelial cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2C</xref>). These changes of abnormal morphology and high proliferation activity were also observed in seminal vesicle of more than 12 months old mice that showed the low level of testosterone in serum (Supplemental Figure 1C-E). Therefore, seminal vesicle epithelial cells were collected and cultured in primary culture as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, and the changes in cell number were counted and cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry. When cultured without testosterone (c), the number of seminal vesicle epithelial cells increased in a day-dependent manner. However, the addition of testosterone significantly decreased the number of seminal vesicle epithelial cells during the 8-day culture period in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2E</xref>). Flow cytometric analysis of the cell cycle on day 7 showed that the G0/G1 phase was significantly increased and the G2/M1 phase was significantly decreased by the addition of testosterone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F,G</xref>). These results indicate that seminal vesicle epithelial cells are inhibited in cell division by the testosterone-androgen receptor pathway.</p>

<title>Testosterone alters metabolic gene expression in seminal vesicle epithelial cells</title>
<p>To better understand the roles of testosterone in suppressing proliferation of seminal vesicle epithelial cells, RNA sequencing was done using the epithelial cells cultured with or without testosterone. DEG (Differential Expressed Genes) analysis revealed that a total of 23,459 genes were identified, including 997 upregulated genes and 3463 downregulated genes in seminal vesicle epithelial cells by testosterone relative to control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3A</xref>). Genes largely upregulated by testosterone included those already reported in seminal vesicles (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></italic>), such as the Seminal Vesicle Secretion (<italic>Svs</italic>) family (<italic>Svs1</italic>∼<italic>6</italic>), <italic>Pate4</italic>, <italic>Spinkl</italic>, <italic>Ceacam10</italic>, and <italic>Sva</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3B</xref>,C). Therefore, the primary culture of seminal vesicle epithelial cells used in this experiment was considered to maintain the characteristics of seminal vesicle epithelial cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. Many genes were downregulated by testosterone, and those with a high rate of variation included collagen synthase and <italic>Mmp2</italic>, which are involved in extracellular matrix formation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3C</xref>). However, KEGG analysis, rather than individual genes, was used to predict functions altered by testosterone, and it was found that the expression of genes involved in the metabolic pathway was the most highly affected by testosterone (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3D</xref>). Because there is a close relationship between cell proliferation and metabolic activity, and between metabolic substrates in seminal plasma and sperm motility, we hypothesized that testosterone induced changes in seminal vesicle epithelial cell metabolism alter the components of seminal plasma to mediate the enhancement of sperm motility.</p>

<title>Testosterone sifts metabolic activity of seminal vesicle epithelial cells</title>
<p>In the presence of testosterone, the addition of glucose significantly activated glycolysis as compared with that in epithelial cells cultured without testosterone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4A</xref>,B). However, there was no difference in the glycolytic capacity, indicating that testosterone may increase glucose metabolism but does not to enhance the expression of a group of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway. To determine the metabolic fate of glycolytic end products, seminal vesicle epithelial cells were cultured with and without testosterone and then concentrations of pyruvate and lactate were measured. The concentration of pyruvate was significantly decreased by the addition of testosterone; however, the concentration of lactate was not significantly changed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4D</xref>,E). Therefore, we analyzed mitochondrial metabolism using a flux analyzer, predicting that more glucose is metabolized, pyruvate is synthesized in response to testosterone, and is further metabolized in the mitochondria. However, measuring mitochondrial respiratory metabolism with a Flux analyzer, the basal respiratory rate (the activity of the electron transport chain) was significantly decreased by testosterone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4F</xref>-I). ATP production was also significantly suppressed exposure to testosterone. Furthermore, the maximum respiration and spare respiration capacity were also significantly decreased in response to testosterone treatment, suggesting that testosterone does not educe transient enzyme activity in mitochondria, but to rather weakens the metabolic pathway of the mitochondrial TCA cycle and/or the electron transport chain due to the changes in gene expression patterns in seminal vesicle epithelial cells.</p>

<title>Testosterone causes changes in the expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in glucose catabolism and anabolism</title>
<p>The expression of genes involved in glucose catabolism and anabolism in the <italic>in vitro</italic> culture system of seminal vesicle epithelial cells was analyzed by qPCR (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5</xref>). The gene expression of glucose transporter (<italic>Glut</italic>) and enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway were not significantly affected by testosterone, consistent with the results of metabolic flux analysis, which showed that the glycolytic pathway was not enhanced despite the activation of the glycolysis. Furthermore, the expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in the TCA cycle in mitochondria was also not significantly affected by testosterone, but the expression of enzymes involved in the electron transport chain was significantly decreased. Interestingly, the expression of <italic>Acly</italic>, that encodes an enzyme that reconverts citric acid formed in the TCA cycle to Acetyl CoA and induces cholesterol synthesis and fatty acid synthesis, was significantly increased by testosterone. Although <italic>Hmgcr</italic>, which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme involved in cholesterol synthesis, was unchanged, the expression of <italic>Acc</italic>, which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme for fatty acid synthesis, was significantly upregulated by testosterone. These characteristic testosterone-induced changes in gene expression observed in cultured cells were also detected by ACLY immunostaining of <italic>in vivo</italic> seminal vesicle samples (Supplemental Figure 2). Specifically, the expression of genes encoding a group of enzymes of the electron transport chain was significantly upregulated by continuous flutamide administration <italic>in vivo</italic>, whereas the gene expression of <italic>Acly</italic> and <italic>Acc</italic> was significantly decreased by flutamide administration. Immunostaining results showed that ACLY was detected specifically in seminal vesicle epithelial cells, and their staining appeared to be reduced by flutamide treatment.

<title>Mechanism of testosterone-induced enhancement of glucose uptake and thereby fatty acid synthesis</title>
<p>The effect of testosterone on glucose uptake in seminal vesicle epithelial cells was analyzed using fluorescence-labeled glucose. As expected from the results of flux metabolic analyses, testosterone treatment significantly increased glucose uptake (Supplemental Figure 3A). Because the expression of each <italic>Glut</italic> family gene encoding glucose transporters was not altered by testosterone (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5</xref>), we focused on GLUT4, whose cellular localization is regulated, and analyzed the effects of Indinavir, a functional inhibitor of GLUT4 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></italic>). Indinavir significantly suppressed glucose uptake and significantly decreased fatty acid synthesis (the amount of fatty acids accumulated in the cell), which was increased by testosterone (Supplemental Figure 3A,B). Furthermore, immunostaining analysis of the localization of GLUT4 in seminal vesicles revealed that GLUT4 was localized outside the nucleus of seminal vesicle epithelial cells (Supplemental Figure 4), suggesting that GLUT4 was partially localized at the plasma membrane and contributed to glucose uptake, whereas in seminal vesicles from mice treated with flutamide continuously, no strong signal was detected at the presumed location of GLUT4 near the plasma membrane of seminal vesicle epithelial cells (Supplemental Figure 4). The same characteristics were observed in aged mice.</p>
<p>Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the fatty acids synthesis was performed by GC-MS. In seminal vesicles, C16:0, C18:0 and C18:1 were detected, in which C18:1 was decreased to an undetectible level in seminal vesicles of mice treated with the flutamide (Supplemental Figure 5A). In the cultured seminal vesicle epithelial cells, C18:1, oleic acid, was significantly increased by the addition of testosterone as observed in seminal vesicle (Supplemental Figure 3C). The expression of <italic>Elovl6</italic> encoding ELOVL6, which desaturates C18:0 saturated fatty acids to C18:1, was significantly up-regulated by testosterone (Supplemental Figure 3D). The testosterone-induced change was also detected in <italic>in vivo</italic> samples (seminal vesicle), where the expression of <italic>Evovl6</italic> was decreased by the flutamide treatment (Supplemental Figure 5B).</p>

<title>Oleic acid (18:1) is taken up by sperm and promotes their linear movement</title>
<p>We observed that seminal vesicles secrete testosterone-dependent factors that induce sperm to move straight and that seminal vesicle epithelial cells synthesize and secrete oleic acid in a testosterone-dependent manner. In order to examine whether oleic acid is a factor that induces sperm linear motility, we examined whether or not oleic acid is taken up by sperm and then changes of sperm motility pattern. When epididymal sperm was incubated with fluorescently labeled oleic acid, the fluorescent signal was selectively detected in the midpiece of the sperm after quenching of extracellular fluorescence (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6A</xref>). The fluorescence intensity of sperm detected by flow cytometry significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6B</xref>, C). In oleic acid-treated sperm, VSL was significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner in the range of 0 to 50 nM (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6D</xref>). LIN values were highest when 10 nM oleic acid was added (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6E</xref>). To quantify metabolic changes in mitochondrial activity, a flux analyzer was used to monitor real-time changes in mitochondrial β-oxidation. A significant increase in OCR was induced by the injection of 10 nM oleic acid. Etomoxir, a β-oxidation inhibitor, significantly decreased the OCR that was induced by oleic acid (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6F</xref>, Supplemental Figure 6). In situ ATP detection by BioTracker ATP-Red revealed that the percentage of sperm with high ATP production was significantly increased under the presence of oleic acid (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6G</xref>).</p>

<title>ACLY expression is upregulated by testosterone and is essential for the metabolic shift of seminal vesicle epithelial cells that mediates sperm linear motility</title>
<p>ACLY is up-regulated in seminal epithelial cells as a factor that enables the utilization of citric acid from the TCA cycle for fatty acid synthesis outside the mitochondria. Therefore, we performed siRNA knockdown experiments of ACLY to clarify the impact of ACLY on the cellular metabolic shift. The addition of testosterone significantly increased the amount of ACLY protein in seminal epithelial cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7A</xref>,B). Viral infection with siRNAs encoding <italic>Acly-</italic>targeted siRNAs markedly decreased the amount of ACLY (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7C</xref>). This knockdown of ACLY not only increased the oxygen consumption of seminal epithelial cells in the control and testosterone-treated group, but also significantly increased the ATP production related oxygen consumption (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7D</xref>,E,F). Thus, ACLY expression is associated with mitochondrial metabolic pathway activity in seminal epithelial cells. Furthermore, the knockdown of ACLY also significantly suppressed testosterone-induced fatty acid synthesis in seminal epithelial cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7G</xref>). Supernatants from epithelial cells of the testosterone-added group induced sperm to move linearly (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7H</xref>).

<title>This characteristic metabolic mechanism induced by testosterone is also observed in human seminal epithelial cells</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Seminal plasma has a variety of functions, including sperm transport, nutritional support, interactions with the female reproductive tract, and especially the regulation of its relationship with the female immune system. Mammalian seminal plasma is secreted mainly from the seminal vesicle and is known to be rich in cytokines, prostaglandins, and SVS family members (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></italic>). For this reason, recent studies have focused on the immunomodulatory function of seminal plasma in the female reproductive tract. On the other hand, fructose and lipids in seminal plasma are the major energy sources for sperm (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></italic>). However, although metabolomic analyses of seminal plasma have shown that there are metabolic substrates present at higher concentrations in seminal plasma than in blood (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></italic>), how these substrates are synthesized and specifically how they alter sperm motility has not been determined. Moreover, though the motility of ejaculated spermatozoa is known to decrease with aging, few reports have revealed age-related changes in the seminal vesicle glands, which are responsible for seminal plasma synthesis.</p>
<p>In this study, we focused on the reproductive organs that synthesize seminal vesicle secretion as target organs for testosterone, and found that factors formed by testosterone-dependent metabolic changes in seminal vesicles activate sperm mitochondria and enhance their linear motility. Testosterone is known to activate intracellular ARs and alter intracellular metabolic pathways in skeletal muscle (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></italic>), prostate cells (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></italic>) and cardiomyocytes (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></italic>). ARs are known to directly regulate the expression of glycolytic and lipid metabolic genes (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></italic>). In the present study, the nuclear localization of AR in seminal vesicle epithelial cells (i.e., functioning as a transcription factor) and the activation of the glycolytic system by testosterone were similar to those in the above cell types. Interestingly, however, in the seminal vesicle epithelial cells, expression of <italic>Glut</italic> family members was unchanged but GLUT4 localization was altered in a testosterone-dependent manner to promote glucose uptake. Such gene expression-independent effects of testosterone on glucose metabolism have also been reported in skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue, where testosterone leads to the phosphorylation of GLUT4 and enhances its translocation to the plasma membrane (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></italic>). This is consistent with the results of our metabolic flux analyses, that show testosterone increases the rate of glycolysis in seminal vesicle epithelial cells by increasing glucose uptake rather than by increasing glycolytic capacity. We further confirmed that GLUT4 is the transporter that mediates this glucose uptake using indinavir, a GLUT4-specific inhibitor.</p>
<p>In seminal epithelial cells, ATP production was low and cell proliferation was suppressed despite testosterone-induced activation of the glycolytic system. We hypothesized that this could be explained by the testosterone-dependent regulation of genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism, including the up-regulation of ACLY, a strategic enzyme that links the glycolytic system with lipid metabolism. Manipulation of ACLY expression in mouse myoblasts and embryonic stem cells has been shown to alter the TCA cycle into a “non-normal cycle” (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></italic>). One advantage of the non-normal TCA cycle is its ability to retain carbon instead of burning it and to regenerate the cytosolic NAD+ needed to maintain glycolysis (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></italic>). This suggests that ACLY activated by testosterone may inhibit proliferation of seminal epithelial cells by skipping some steps of the mitochondrial TCA cycle and minimizing ATP production.</p>
<p>Testosterone has been reported to cause hypertrophy of cardiac myocytes (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></italic>). Cell hypertrophy is partly due to the accumulation of fatty acids in the cytoplasm, which causes significant damage to cellular functions (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></italic>). On the other hand, the normal cell hypertrophy, especially in myofibers, involves the activation of signaling molecules such as Myc, hypoxia-inducible factor, and Pi3k-Akt-mTor, which regulate metabolic reprogramming in cancer by increasing glucose uptake in the presence of oxygen (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></italic>). In the present study, induction of ACLY expression by testosterone not only decreased cycling in the TCA cycle, but also promoted glucose assimilation, which played an important role in fatty acid synthesis. Thus, in tissues where fatty acid synthesis is promoted, either β-oxidation-dependent ATP production in mitochondria or the secretion of fatty acids occurs to maintain cellular function (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></italic>); providing evidence to explain why the presence of fatty acids in the cell has no adverse effect. In accessory reproductive glands, such as the prostate and seminal vesicles, the glycolytic system is activated in a testosterone-dependent, but ATP production is not enhanced and cell proliferation is not induced and the metabolites are used as a substrate for sperm motility. This may be because in the prostate, pyruvate synthesized by the glycolytic system in response to testosterone is converted to acetyl CoA, which is then converted to citric acid in the TCA cycle, citric acid is released as the main component of seminal plasma (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>The testosterone-dependent growth of cancerous prostate epithelial cells may be due to genetic mutations, such as elevated expression of the gene encoding aconitase, which converts citric acid to isocitrate, which blocks the TCA cycle and inhibits citric acid secretion (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></italic>). On the other hand, in the analysis of seminal epithelial cells, testosterone treatment induced the expression of <italic>Acc</italic>, which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme for fatty acid synthesis, and <italic>Elovl6</italic>, which desaturates to oleic acid, significantly increasing total saturated fatty acid and oleic acid content. Therefore, testosterone promotes glucose conversion into fatty acids, especially oleic acid, in seminal epithelial cells. Although there is a commonality in the activation of the glycolytic system testosterone target tissues, the different expression patterns of genes involved in metabolism in mitochondria may exert their specific functions in each tissue. In addition to genes involved in fatty acid synthesis such as <italic>Fasn</italic> and <italic>Elovl6</italic>, <italic>Acly</italic> is also encoded in a region in close proximity in human chromosome 17 and mouse chromosome 11, suggesting that in seminal vesicle epithelial cells, this region is targeted to promote gene expression. The co-regulation of these genes in seminal vesicle epithelial cells leads to the synthesis of seminal plasma components that ensure sperm motility.</p>
<p>Decreased testosterone synthesis in the testes is a phenomenon observed with aging, and associated with decreased spermatogenesis(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></italic>). However, the probability of obtaining sperm without ICSI or IVF is extremely low, despite the presence of sufficient numbers of sperm with normal-morphology (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></italic>). This indicates that testosterone plays a major role not only in spermatogenesis but also in functional maturation of sperm. In this study, metabolic abnormalities induced by inhibition of androgen receptor function caused abnormal proliferation of seminal vesicle epithelial cells in aged mice. In other words, the findings of the seminal vesicle epithelial cell culture experiments and flutamide treatment may mimic the changes that occur with aging. Oleic acid synthesis by testosterone-dependent metabolic pathways was regulated in seminal vesicle epithelial cells and the oleic acid stimulated sperm motility and enhanced <italic>in vivo</italic> fertilization success. Thus, results of these studies document that the quality and presence of key metabolic products in seminal plasma influence male fertility. Specifically, the results open the possibility of translational studies to understand human male infertility, especially in cases of failure to conceive by natural mating or artificial insemination. Because seminal plasma contains components specific to certain male reproductive organs, differences in protein composition may reflect pathological processes in specific organs (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></italic>). However, although proteomic and metabolomic analyses of seminal plasma have been performed (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></italic>), the functional changes in seminal plasma, especially the effects on <italic>in vivo</italic> fertilization potential, have not been well understood. Differences in fatty acid concentrations, including oleic acid, in seminal plasma may provide a predictive marker for the fertilization potential of human and domestic animal semen. Furthermore, the addition of oleic acid to low-quality semen improved fertilization rates associated with artificial insemination, providing a strategy for improving artificial insemination. In our previous study, adding fatty acids to the thawing medium of frozen bull sperm improved their linear motility and viability (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></italic>). The similarities between mouse and human seminal vesicle epithelial cells demonstrated in this study have strong potential for clinical application of these observations.</p>
<p>Overall, the results of the studies described herein strongly support the hypothesis that testosterone-dependent glucose to oleic acid conversion processes are required for normal seminal plasma functions in the seminal vesicle and normal reproductive performance in males. This study advances our understanding of the role of testosterone in glucose metabolism and fatty acid synthesis and lays the groundwork for future research and potential therapeutic interventions in reproductive biology and fertility.</p>

<p>Seminal vesicles were removed from euthanized mice, cut open vertically to expose the seminal vesicle cavity, and incubated with Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS; CaCl<sub>2</sub>・2H<sub>2</sub>O 0.185 g/L, MgSO<sub>4</sub> 0.098 g/L, KCl 0.400 g/L, KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 0.060 g/L, NaHCO3 0.350 g/L, NaCl 8.000 g/L, Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> 0.048 g/L, D-Glucose 1.0 g/L, dissolved in ultrapure water). Tissues were digested with 10 mL of HBSS containing 25 mg/mL pancreatin and 0.25% (v/v) trypsin EDTA for 1 hour at 4°C, 45 minutes at room temperature, and 15 minutes at 37°C, and epithelial cells were obtained. These were passed through a 70 µm nylon filter (352350, Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA) and seeded into collagen-coated 12-well plates (4815-010, IWAKI, Shizuoka, Japan). Cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; 10438-018, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.), 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin. The culture condition was 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 95% air, and humidity.</p>
<p>Human seminal vesicle epithelial cells (4460, ScienCell Research Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were purchased, seeded in 2 μg/cm<sup>2</sup> poly-L-lysine-coated plates according to manufacturer’s protocol, and cultured in epithelial cell medium (4101, ScienCell Research Laboratories). The cells were seeded at 10000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> on collagen-coated plates the day before 100 ng/mL testosterone treatment. Testosterone was dissolved in ethanol, and the final concentration of ethanol was adjusted to 0.1% (v/v) when used for cultured cells. The culture medium was replaced every 48 hours.</p>

<title>Artificial insemination</title>
<p>To examine the involvement of seminal vesicle secretions in fertilization, sperm from C57BL/6N mice were injected directly into the uterine bodies of superovulated CD1 mice by syringe, as previously described with minor modifications (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></italic>). CD1 female mice were injected intraperitoneally with 8 IU eCG to stimulate follicle development and used as recipients for artificial insemination 48 hours later. Artificial seminal fluid was prepared in HTF medium to a final concentration of 10 mg/mL of collected control or frutamide-derived seminal vesicle secretions. As rescue experiment, 10 nM of oleic acid was added to the frutamide-derived seminal secretions. Cauda epididymis sperm was suspended with above artificial seminal fluid (1 × 10<sup>6</sup> sperm/mL), and a total of 40 µL (20 µL each per uterus) was injected through the cervix of the female mice. After artificial insemination, 7.5 IU of hCG was injected to stimulate ovulation. Subsequently, a mixture of vaseline and paraffin with a ratio of 10:1 was injected to form an artificial plug around the cervix. After 36∼48 hours of sperm injection, the putative eggs were retrieved from the oviducts. The number of two-cell embryos and mature unfertilized eggs were counted and used to estimate the fertilization success rate.</p>

<p>This study reports a potentially <bold>important</bold> discovery that testosterone-induced metabolic changes in seminal vesicle epithelial cells lead to the production of oleic acids in seminal plasma to enhance sperm fertility. The evidence to support metabolic changes in seminal vesicles and the identification of oleic acid as a key factor in seminal plasma is <bold>solid</bold>. However, the evidence for how oleic acids support enhanced sperm fertility in vivo is not well supported, thus currently remains <bold>incomplete</bold>, and requires further study.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this report, the authors investigated the effects of reproductive secretions on sperm function in mice. The authors attempt to weave together an interesting mechanism whereby a testosterone-dependent shift in metabolic flux patterns in the seminal vesicle epithelium supports fatty acid synthesis, which they suggest is an essential component of seminal plasma that modulates sperm function by supporting linear motility patterns.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The topic is interesting and of general interest to the field. The study employs an impressive array of approaches to explore the relationship between mouse endocrine physiology and sperm function mediated by seminal components from various glandular secretions of the male reproductive tract.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Unfortunately, support for the proposed mechanism is not convincingly supported by the data, and the experimental design and methodology need more rigor and details, and the presence of numerous (uncontrolled) confounding variables in almost every experimental group significantly reduce confidence in the overall conclusions of the study.</p>
<p>The methodological detail as described is insufficient to support replication of the work. Many of the statistical analyses are not appropriate for the apparent designs (e.g. t-tests without corrections for multiple comparisons). This is important because the notion that different seminal secretions will affect sperm function would likely have a different conclusion if the correct controls were selected for post hoc comparison. In addition, the HTF condition was not adjusted to match the protein concentrations of the secretion-containing media, likely resulting in viscosity differences as a major confounding factor on sperm motility patterns.</p>
<p>There is ambiguity in many of the measurements due to the lack of normalization (e.g. all Seahorse Analyzer measurements are unnormalized, making cell mass and uniformity a major confounder in these measurements). This would be less of a concern if basal respiration rates were consistently similar across conditions and there were sufficient independent samples, but this was not the case in most of the experiments.</p>
<p>The observation that oleic acid is physiologically relevant to sperm function is not strongly supported. The cellular uptake of 10-100uM labeled oleic acid is presumably due to the detergent effects of the oleic acid, and the authors only show functional data for nM concentrations of exogenous oleic acid. In addition, the effect sizes in the supporting data were not large enough to provide a high degree of confidence given the small sample sizes and ambiguity of the design regarding the number of biological and technical replicates in the extracellular flux analysis experiments.</p>
<p>Overall, the most confident conclusion of the study was that testosterone affects the distribution of metabolic fluxes in a cultured human seminal vesicle epithelial cell line, although the physiological relevance of this observation is not clear.</p>
<p>In the introduction, the authors suggest that their analyses &quot;reveal the pathways by which seminal vesicles synthesize seminal plasma, ensure sperm fertility, and provide new therapeutic and preventive strategies for male infertility.&quot; These conclusions need stronger or more complete data to support them.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Using a combination of in vivo studies with testosterone-inhibited and aged mice with lower testosterone levels, as well as isolated mouse and human seminal vesicle epithelial cells, the authors show that testosterone induces an increase in glucose uptake. They find that testosterone induces differential gene expression with a focus on metabolic enzymes. Specifically, they identify increased expression of enzymes that regulate cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis, leading to increased production of 18:1 oleic acid.</p>
<p>Strength:</p>
<p>Oleic acid is secreted by seminal vesicle epithelial cells and taken up by sperm, inducing an increase in mitochondrial respiration. The difference in sperm motility and in vivo fertilization in the presence of 18:1 oleic acid and the absence of testosterone is small but significant, suggesting that the authors have identified one of the fertilization-supporting factors in seminal plasma.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Further studies are required to investigate the effect of other seminal vesicle components on sperm capacitation to support the author's conclusions. The author's experiments focused on potential testosterone-induced changes in the rate of seminal vesicle epithelial cell glycolysis and oxphos, however, provide conflicting results and a potential correlation with seminal vesicle epithelial cell proliferation should be confirmed by additional experiments.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Male fertility depends on both sperm and seminal plasma, but the functional effect of seminal plasma on sperm has been relatively understudied. The authors investigate the testosterone-dependent synthesis of seminal plasma and identify oleic acid as a key factor in enhancing sperm fertility.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The evidence for changes in cell proliferation and metabolism of seminal vesicle epithelial cells and the identification of oleic acid as a key factor in seminal plasma is solid.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The evidence that oleic acids enhance sperm fertility in vivo needs more experimental support, as the main phenotypic effect in vitro provided by the authors remains simply as an increase in the linearity of sperm motility, which does not necessarily correlate with enhanced sperm fertility.</p>
