<title>Abstract</title><p>Acute retinal ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion injury are the primary causes of retinal neural cell death and vision loss in retinal artery occlusion (RAO). The absence of an accurate mouse model for simulating the retinal ischemic process has hindered progress in developing neuroprotective agents for RAO. We developed a unilateral pterygopalatine ophthalmic artery occlusion (UPOAO) mouse model using silicone wire embolization combined with carotid artery ligation. The survival of retinal ganglion cells and visual function were evaluated to determine the duration of ischemia. Immunofluorescence staining, optical coherence tomography, and haematoxylin and eosin staining were utilized to assess changes in major neural cell classes and retinal structure degeneration at two reperfusion durations. Transcriptomics was employed to investigate alterations in the pathological process of UPOAO following ischemia and reperfusion, highlighting transcriptomic differences between UPOAO and other retinal ischemia-reperfusion models. The UPOAO model successfully replicated the acute interruption of retinal blood supply observed in RAO. 60-minutes of Ischemia led to significant loss of major retinal neural cells and visual function impairment. Notable thinning of the inner retinal layer, especially the ganglion cell layer, was evident post-UPOAO. Temporal transcriptome analysis revealed various pathophysiological processes related to immune cell migration, oxidative stress, and immune inflammation during the non-reperfusion and reperfusion periods. A pronounced increase in microglia within the retina and peripheral leukocytes accessing the retina was observed during reperfusion periods. Comparison of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the UPOAO and high intraocular pressure models revealed specific enrichments in lipid and steroid metabolism-related genes in the UPOAO model. The UPOAO model emerges as a novel tool for screening pathogenic genes and promoting further therapeutic research in RAO.</p>

<label>1</label><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Retinal artery occlusion (RAO) is a severe ophthalmic disease characterized by a sudden interruption of blood flow in the retinal artery, leading to retinal ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Over 60% of RAO patients suffer from impaired vision, ranging from finger counting to complete vision loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Additionally, RAO patients face increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Retinal ischemia and hypoxia can lead to irreversible damage to retinal cells within 90 minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. This damage is primarily due to the apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which is driven by inflammation and oxidative stress. Unfortunately, conservative treatments for RAO, such as ocular massage and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, provide limited therapeutic benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Although thrombolysis is effective, its application is restricted by a narrow therapeutic window (typically within 4.5 hours) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, the restoration of blood flow to the ischemic area following thrombolysis can cause a sudden increase in tissue oxidative levels, resulting in ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in the retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. IRI is a common pathological condition that can induce inflammation, retinal tissue damage and visual impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Therefore, it is crucial to develop an animal model that accurately simulates the pathological processes of RAO to thoroughly investigate the pathophysiological changes and explore potential neuroprotective treatments following retinal ischemia and reperfusion.</p>
<p>Various animal models have been employed to investigate the effects of retinal injury resulting from ischemia and subsequent reperfusion in RAO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Based on the methods used for modelling, retinal ischemia-reperfusion models can be categorized into two groups: 1) intravascular occlusion models, including photochemical-induced thrombosis model and vascular intervention model; and 2) extravascular occlusion models, including central retinal artery ligation (CRAL) model, unilateral common carotid artery occlusion (UCCAO) model, and high intraocular pressure (HIOP) model. The photochemical-induced thrombosis model and vascular intervention model have been reported to be useful tools for assessing retinal injury after ischemia and reperfusion. However, both models are limited by the need for trained interventional radiologists and the need for advanced techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. The CRAL model, which directly clips or ligates the central retinal artery, also presents drawbacks, such as potential optic nerve damage and difficulty in application to small animals such as mice, limiting its use in experiments with larger sample sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. The UCCAO model, which induces retinal hypoperfusion by occluding the unilateral common carotid artery (CCA), is more suitable for simulating chronic ischemic retinal disease than acute retinal ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. The HIOP model is widely utilized in mice for studying ischemia-reperfusion in acute primary angle-closure glaucoma (APACG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. However, the mechanical compression of the retina caused by saline injection in this model may also lead to retinal damage, potentially influencing IRI research. Therefore, it is critically important to develop a simple and low-skill-required mouse model that can simulate acute retinal ischemia and reperfusion injury in RAO patients.</p>
<p>To better simulate the retinal ischemic process and possible IRI following RAO, we developed a novel vascular-associated mouse model called the unilateral pterygopalatine ophthalmic artery occlusion (UPOAO) model. In this model, we employed silicone wire embolization and carotid artery ligation to completely block the blood supply to the retina. We characterized the major classes of retinal neural cells and evaluated visual function following different durations of ischemia (30 minutes and 60 minutes) and reperfusion (3-days and 7-days) after UPOAO. Additionally, we utilized transcriptomics to investigate the transcriptional changes and elucidate the pathophysiological process of the UPOAO model after ischemia and reperfusion. Finally, we highlighted the transcriptomic differences between this model and other retinal ischemia-reperfusion models, including HIOP and UCCAO, revealing the unique pathological processes that closely resemble retinal IRI in RAO. The UPOAO model offers new insights into the mechanisms and pathways involved in ischemia and reperfusion studies of RAO, providing a foundation for studying protective strategies for ocular ischemic diseases.</p>

<label>2.1</label><title>Animals</title>
<p>Eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were used in the experiments. Only male mice were used to exclude the potential influence of oestrogenic hormones. The mice were provided sufficient food and water and were maintained on a 12-hour dark-light cycle in a room with regulated temperature conditions. All the experimental procedures were designed and conducted according to the ethical guidelines outlined in the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. The study protocol and methods received approval from the Experimental Animal Ethics Committee of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (approval number: WDRM-20220305A).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<label>2.2</label><title>Preparation and surgical procedure of the UPOAO model</title>
<p>Eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice weighing 20-25 grams were used in this study. An isoflurane-based anaesthesia system was used to induce and maintain general anaesthesia in the mice during surgical procedures. The mice were anaesthetized with a 1.5-2% concentration of isoflurane delivered in a mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen via rubber tubing. Body temperature was maintained at 37 Â± 0.5Â°C throughout the surgery. Surgical instruments were sterilized with 75% ethanol before use to ensure sterility.</p>
<p>We drew inspiration from the widely employed middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>], commonly used in cerebral ischemic injury research, which guided the development of the UPOAO model. The mouse was gently positioned in a supine posture on a heating blanket, and its neck was exposed. The preparation involved depilation of the neck area, followed by skin disinfection, and finally, a midline incision along the neck was made. After separating the neck gland using two tweezers, careful blunt dissection was employed to separate the left CCA, internal carotid artery (ICA) and external carotid artery (ECA), avoiding the compression of nearby nerves and veins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) (<bold>Video 1</bold>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Then, the CCA and ICA were ligated with a 6-0 suture. A knot was secured using a 6-0 suture at the distal end of the ECA, and a slipknot was created at the proximal end (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). To preserve the reperfusion process and avoid bleeding and mortality during surgery, a silicone wire embolus was inserted through the ECA instead of through the CCA. Ophthalmic scissors were used to make a small inverted âVâ-shaped incision between the two suture knots on the ECA. A specialized silicone wire embolus, measuring 7 Â± 0.1 mm in length and 0.21 Â± 0.1 mm in diameter, was inserted through the incision, directing it into the ECA and further into the CCA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Next, the ligation on the ICA was removed, and the ECA was cut at the point where the artery had been previously incised with scissors. Subsequently, the silicone wire embolus was retracted to the bifurcation of the CCA, rotated counterclockwise, and inserted into the ICA and further into the pterygopalatine artery (PPA) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref><bold>1</bold>). The silicone tail of the silicone wire embolus was positioned near the bifurcation of the CCA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref><bold>2</bold>), effectively obstructing the ophthalmic artery (OA) (<bold>Video 2</bold>). Then, the slipknot was fastened, and the skin was sutured. The mouse was free to move around during arterial embolization.</p>
<p>Following a predetermined ischemia embolization time, the silicone wire embolus was carefully removed from the PPA without massive haemorrhage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). The CCA suture was removed, restoring arterial reperfusion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>) (<bold>Video 3</bold>). Then, the skin wound was sutured, and the mice were routinely fed during reperfusion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>).</p>

<label>2.3</label><title>Staining of retinal vessels</title>
<p>To clearly visualize the retinal vessels, rhodamine-labelled canavalin A was used for mouse heart perfusion. Each mouse was anaesthetized with 1% sodium pentobarbital and placed in the supine position on a foam board resting on a tray. The sternum was opened to expose the heart. A needle attached to the perfusion tube was inserted into the left ventricle via the apex of the mouse heart and secured. The right atrial appendage was dissected with scissors to allow blood outflow. Saline solution was perfused through the left ventricle using a pump system to drain blood from the arteries. Subsequently, the prepared solution of rhodamine-labelled canavalin A was injected into the mice and circulated throughout the mouse vessels for 30 minutes. The mice were then sacrificed, and their eyes were removed and immersed in paraformaldehyde (PFA) for one hour in the dark. A flat-mounted retina was obtained, and retinal images were captured using a Leica SP8 confocal microscope equipped with a 10Ã objective.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<label>2.4</label><title>Quantification of RGCs and microglia</title>
<p>The mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation, and their eyes were fixed in 4% PFA for 60 minutes at room temperature (RT). Subsequently, the cornea and lens were excised, and the intact retina was isolated for retinal flat mounting. The retina was immersed in PBS supplemented with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.5% Triton X-100 for overnight blocking and then incubated with Brn3a antibody (Synaptic Systems, Germany) or Iba1 antibody (Wako, Japan). Following a two-day incubation with the primary antibody, the retina was gently washed three times with PBS. Subsequently, the retina was incubated with Alexa Fluor 594 (AntGene, Wuhan, China) in a light-protected cassette for two days. After three rinses, the retina was uniformly sectioned into a four-leaf clover morphology and flattened using a coverslip. Retinal flat mounts labelled with Brn3a were photographed to count using a fluorescence microscope (BX51, Olympus, Japan) and representative pictures were imaged using a Leica SP8 confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP8, Germany). Retinas labelled with Iba1 were imaged utilizing a fluorescence microscope (BX63; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Each quadrant of the retina was systematically subdivided into central, middle, and peripheral fields (distance from the optic nerve head: central field: 0.1 mm to 0.5 mm, middle field: 0.9 mm to 1.3 mm, and peripheral field: 1.7 mm to 2.1 mm).

<p>Mice were dark-adapted overnight before ERG, and all subsequent procedures were carried out in the dark. Before ERG, the mice were anaesthetized with 1% sodium pentobarbital via intraperitoneal injection, and their pupils were dilated. A subcutaneous electrode was inserted into the posterior cervical skin, a tail electrode was affixed to the posterior end of the mouse tail, and the corneal electrode was gently placed on the central corneal surface. A RetiMINER-C visual electrophysiological system (3VMED Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) was used for recording electrical responses. The a-waves, b-waves, and oscillatory potentials (OPs) after flash stimuli of 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, and 10.0 cd.s/m<sup>2</sup> in scotopic adaptation were recorded.

<p>The mice were placed on the platform of a Spectralis HRA + OCT device (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) for OCT imaging following anaesthesia. Pupil dilation was performed, and normal saline was applied regularly to maintain corneal moisture. The focal length of the device was adjusted until the mouse retina was clearly visible. The head of the mouse was gently repositioned to capture images of the peripheral fundus. The multiline mode was used to scan each layer of the retina, and four quadrants of view centred on the nipple in the upper left, lower left, upper right, and lower right were recorded. In this study, the total retinal thickness was manually segmented into three parts and encompassed the entire thickness from the nerve fibre layer to the photoreceptor layer. The ganglion cell complex (GCC) was defined as the combined thickness of the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL), ganglion cell layer (GCL), and inner plexiform layer (IPL). The inner nuclear layer (INL) and the outer plexiform layer (OPL) were combined for thickness analysis due to the difficulty in distinguishing between these layers. The remaining retinal layers, including the outer nuclear layer (ONL), inner segment/outer segment (IS/OS), and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) layers, were measured together. The thickness of the retina at 1.5 papillary diameters (PD), 3.0 PD, and 4.5 PD from the centre of the optic disc was measured using the Heidelberg measuring tool.</p>
<p>For FFA, the mice were anaesthetized, and their pupils were dilated. Subsequently, fundus angiography was performed immediately following an intraperitoneal injection of sodium fluorescein. Images were acquired alternately for both eyes within 5 seconds of the injection.</p>

<p>Animals for the UCCAO model were prepared and managed according to the procedure described for the UPOAO model. After blunt dissection, the left CCA was ligated with a 6-0 suture. After 60 minutes of ligation, the suture was removed, and the skin wound was subsequently closed with sutures. Mice were routinely fed during the reperfusion period, and the retinas of UCCAO mice were harvested 7-days post-surgery.</p>
<p>The HIOP model was generated based on previously established methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Briefly, mice were anaesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 1% sodium pentobarbital. Pupils were dilated using tropicamide phenylephrine eye drops (0.5% tropicamide and 0.5% deoxyadrenaline hydrochloride, Santen Pharmaceutical) applied 5 minutes in advance. An insulin hypodermic needle attached to a silicone elastomer tube was inserted into the anterior chamber of the unilateral experimental eye. The IOP was elevated for 60 minutes by raising the height of the saline solution storage bag to 162 cm, after which the needle was removed to immediately restore the IOP to baseline levels. Iris whitening and loss of retinal red-light reflexes indicated retinal ischemia. After surgery, levofloxacin hydrochloride ophthalmic gel was applied to the eyes of the mice.

<p>RNA-seq analysis was conducted on samples from 5 mice in the non-perfusion group, 4 mice in the 3-days perfusion group, and 5 mice in the 7-days perfusion group of the UPOAO model. Additionally, retinas from both the 7-days HIOP experimental eyes and bilateral UCCAO eyes were collected (n=5) for analysis.</p>
<p>Data normalization and subsequent processing utilized the âlimmaâ package in R software (version 4.2.3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>].

<p>To investigate the optimal ischemic duration, the mice were subjected to ischemic periods of 30 and 60 minutes, followed by reperfusion periods of 3-days and 7-days. Retinal structure and visual function were assessed through flat-mounted retina analysis and flash ERG.</p>
<p>In the 30-minute ischemia group, no significant RGCs death was observed after 3-days (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, B</xref>) or 7-days of reperfusion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C, D</xref>). However, after 60 minutes of ischemia followed by either 3-days or 7-days of reperfusion, reductions in RGCs density were evident (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E-H</xref>). ERG results showed no statistical difference in amplitudes between bilateral eyes after 3- and 7-days of 30-minutes reperfusion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-C</xref>). However, the b-wave amplitude notably decreased after 60 minutes of ischemia and 3-days of reperfusion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). By 7-days of reperfusion, the b-wave amplitude had halved compared to that of the sham eyes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). The appearance times of the a-waves and b-waves in the experimental and control eyes remained consistent across all four groups (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>).

<p>For a detailed analysis of inner retinal thickness, we extracted UPOAO mouse eyes and stained them with HE. The thickness of the RNFL + GCL increased at 3-days of reperfusion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>), followed by a decrease at 7-days of reperfusion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4L</xref>). IPL thickness decreased at both 3-days and 7-days of reperfusion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I, M</xref>), while INL thickness decreased only at 7-days of reperfusion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4N</xref>). We hypothesized that the initial swelling of the GCL in response to acute ischemia and hypoxia led to early thickening, followed by gradual thinning due to tissue dysfunction. This hypothesis was supported by the observation of RGCs loss and reduced GCC thickness evaluated by OCT at 7-days (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>).</p>
<p>We observed by OCT that changes in retinal thickness became noticeable at 3-days post-UPOAO and exhibited a significant decrease at 7-days.

<label>3.4</label><title>Survival of retinal neural cells in UPOAO</title>
<p>Given that mouse retinal function heavily relies on rod cells and that scotopic (low light) vision is primarily governed by rod photoreceptors, the observed reductions in b-wave and OPs-wave amplitudes indicate impaired synaptic transmission within the inner retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Our OCT and HE findings suggested structural injuries within the inner retina. Notably, the thickness of the outer retinal layers in OCT remained unchanged.

<p>In the 3-days reperfusion group, 372 genes were upregulated, and 170 genes were downregulated (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). GO enrichment analysis revealed that the DEGs at 3-days after reperfusion were related to energy metabolism, mitochondrial regulation, and oxidative stress pathways (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). The heatmap and box displayed the upregulated and downregulated genes involved in oxidative stress-related pathways at the 3-days reperfusion stage in UPOAO, including hub genes such as Mrpl18 and Mrps23 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A</xref>). GSEA revealed changes in pathways related to the binding membrane of organelles, the cell surface and the plasma membrane protein complex (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5B</xref>). Furthermore, 44 overlapping genes between the mitochondrial genes and DEGs at 3-days post-UPOAO were mainly related to mitochondrial transport and the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5C, D</xref>). These results suggested that mitochondria and metabolism play significant roles in IRI.</p>
<p>In the 7-days reperfusion group, 429 genes were upregulated, and 310 genes were downregulated (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6G</xref>). The DEGs at this stage were enriched in pathways related to immune effector processes, positive regulation of responses to external stimuli and inflammation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref>). A heatmap was generated to show the upregulated and downregulated genes of immune inflammation-related pathways at 7-days after reperfusion in UPOAO, and most hub genes, such as Cd86, Cd48, Tlr4, and Tlr6 were also enriched in these pathways (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6I</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6A</xref>). GSEA also showed similar results (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig S6B</xref>). Moreover, RTâqPCR confirmed the upregulation of immune inflammation-related gene expression (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7</xref>). Significantly, 112 genes that overlapped between immune-related genes and DEGs at 7-days post-UPOAO were primarily associated with immune receptor activity and phagocytic vesicles (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6C, D</xref>). These results underscore the predominant role of immune responses during this stage.</p>
<p>To explore the associations between changes observed at 3-days and 7-days after reperfusion, we analyzed the DEGs and identified 17 overlapping genes (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8A</xref>), which were mainly associated with the nitric oxide biosynthetic process (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8B</xref>). Our findings suggest that the immune inflammatory response observed after 7-days of reperfusion may represent the cumulative effect of the acute oxidative stress response during the initial 3-days reperfusion period.</p>

<label>3.6</label><title>Leukocyte Infiltration and Microglial Activation</title>
<p>Time course transcriptome analysis underscored the predominant role of immune inflammatory responses during the reperfusion stage. Previous reports have indicated that the inflammatory response in retinal ischemia-reperfusion injury (RIRI) is orchestrated by peripheral immune cells and resident immune cells within the retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. In our study, we demonstrated the presence of leukocyte infiltration and microglial activation in the UPOAO model. Immunofluorescence staining for CD45 was performed on retinas at different time points post modelling to visualize the distribution and quantity of white blood cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A-D</xref>). Laser confocal Z-plane projections confirmed minimal leukocyte infiltration in the retinas of sham eyes, which showed that CD45<sup>+</sup> cells in the vascular lumen likely represented patrolling cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). A significant increase in CD45<sup>+</sup> cells was observed in UPOAO model retinas after 1 day (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>), with a progressive increase in quantity over time (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F, G</xref>). Notably, the majority of CD45<sup>+</sup> cells in UPOAO model retinas at 1-day displayed a morphology similar to that of vascular leukocytes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>), suggesting a large influx of peripheral white blood cells into the retinal tissue. In contrast, CD45<sup>+</sup> cells at 3-days and 7-days of reperfusion exhibited a combination of amoeboid and branched morphologies (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C, D</xref>), indicative of activated states.</p>

<p>Microglia, which are known to undergo activation and morphological changes in response to various insults, were examined in the superficial retinas of sham and UPOAO eyes. Immunofluorescence staining for Iba1 was conducted on flat-mounted retinas at 3-days and 7-days post-reperfusion. In sham eyes, Iba1<sup>+</sup> microglia displayed small somas and elongated dendrites that were evenly distributed within the retina (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7H</xref><bold>1, I1</bold>). Conversely, UPOAO retinas exhibited numerous activated Iba1<sup>+</sup> microglia with enlarged somas, shortened dendrites, and an ameboid appearance (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7H</xref><bold>2, I2</bold>). The number of Iba1<sup>+</sup> microglia in UPOAO retinas was approximately five times greater than that in sham eyes at 3-days (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7J</xref>), with a further increase observed at 7-days (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7K</xref>), although this increase was less pronounced than that at the 3-days time point (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7J</xref>). These results indicated a potential reduction in immune-mediated inflammation over time.</p>

<label>3.7</label><title>RNA-seq comparison between UPOAO and extravascular occlusion models</title>
<p>To further study the characteristics of UPOAO, we analyzed the transcriptomes of two extravascular occlusion models: HIOP and UCCAO. The HIOP model induces ischemia through anterior chamber perfusion with normal saline (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>), while the UCCAO model involves ligation of the unilateral common carotid artery (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8H</xref>). RNA-seq analysis of retinas subjected to 60 minutes of ischemia followed by 7-days of reperfusion in the HIOP model revealed enrichment of immune-related pathways, specifically highlighting increased activity in leukocyte-mediated immunity and regulation of immune effector processes (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>). This finding was consistent with the results of GO analysis, which revealed associations of the overlapping DEGs between the HIOP and UPOAO models with toll-like receptor binding, T-cell receptor binding, and immune-related functions (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C, D</xref>). To further explore these DEGs, we explored the remaining DEGs in the HIOP model in addition to the overlapping genes. GO analysis revealed that the remaining DEGs in the HIOP model were also enriched in immune responses, such as the T-cell receptor complex pathway, adaptive immune response, and B-cell-mediated immunity function (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>). Remarkably, upon examining the remaining DEGs specific to the UPOAO model, GO analysis revealed DEGs distinctly related to lipid and steroid metabolic processes (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F, G</xref>). This observation indicates that the UPOAO model, which is closely related to RAO, involves not only conventional immune responses but also unique regulation of lipid and steroid metabolism.</p>

<p>Similarly, the UCCAO model exhibited associations with negative regulation of B-cell proliferation, lymphocyte activation, and related processes (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8I</xref>). Additionally, the hub genes identified through proteinâprotein interaction (PPI) analysis are presented (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8J</xref>). However, the UCCAO model displayed minimal overlap with the UPOAO model, with only 15 overlapping DEGs identified in the Venn diagram analysis (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8K</xref>). Further analysis of the UCCAO DEGs revealed two genes (Mettl14 and YTHDF2) related to m6A modifications (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8L</xref>). Although arterial blood flow is occluded in both the UPOAO and UCCAO models, our results revealed that the pathophysiological processes of the two models were particularly different after 7-days of reperfusion.</p>

<label>4</label><title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study aimed to develop a more appropriate mouse model for investigating the ischemia-reperfusion process in RAO and unravelling the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. We combined silicone wire embolization with carotid artery ligation to effectively block the blood supply to the retinal artery, closely mimicking the characteristics of the acute interruption of blood supply in RAO patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. In the UPOAO model, a 60-minute ischemia period was sufficient to simulate the injury of major retinal neural cells, such as RGCs, BCs, HCs, and cholinergic amacrine cells, resulting in visual impairment. Moreover, histologic examination demonstrated thinning of the inner layer of the retina, especially the GCL. Time course transcriptome analysis revealed various pathophysiological processes related to immune cell migration, oxidative stress, and immune inflammation during non-reperfusion and reperfusion periods. The resident microglia within the retina and peripheral leukocytes that access the retina were markedly increased during reperfusion periods. Additionally, we compared the transcriptomic signatures of the UPOAO model with those of two commonly used ischemia-reperfusion mouse models (HIOP and UCCAO), highlighting the potential relevance of the UPOAO model to ocular vascular occlusive diseases.</p>
<p>The UPOAO mouse model effectively simulates the characteristic features of RAO observed in patients. RAO patients often exhibit distinctive patterns in dark-adapted ERGs, where b-waves are reduced while a-waves remain stable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. In our study, we observed almost the same phenomenon in ERG amplitude after 60 minutes of ischemia in the UPOAO model (<xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>). This observation was further confirmed by immunofluorescence staining of bipolar cells and photoreceptor cells. Importantly, a previous study linked the thinning of the inner retina with alterations in ERG in patients with RAO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. Our results showed that ischemic damage predominantly affected the inner retinal layers, while the outer layer was almost unaffected (<xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>). This distinction is attributed to the reliance of the inner layers on the retinal artery for blood supply, whereas the outer layers are supplied by the choroid. Additionally, histological examination revealed increased retinal NFL and GCL thickness and decreased IPL thickness after 3-days of reperfusion, indicating that ischemia-induced oedema had not completely subsided.</p>
<p>This study comprehensively explored the transcriptomic signature after ischemia and revealed that resident and peripheral immune cells may play major roles in pathological processes. In the non-reperfusion group, the transcriptional changes were primarily involved in the migration of immune cells such as leukocytes and neutrophils from blood vessels into ischemic retinal tissue. This process is closely linked to injury during ischemia and reperfusion, where leukocytes and neutrophils infiltrate neural tissue through the vascular endothelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Our results revealed an increase in CD45<sup>+</sup> leukocytes in the retina and retinal microvasculature, suggesting that these leukocytes were recruited from the bloodstream to the damaged retinal tissue following reperfusion. During leukocyte access to the retina, chemokines, chemokine receptors, adhesion molecules and cytoskeletal components play important roles in regulating endothelial permeability and facilitating leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. Our findings of related gene expression are consistent with this mechanism.</p>
<p>During the 3-days reperfusion period, we observed that an increased number of DEGs were significantly involved in the critical pathological response to oxidative stress in the context of IR tissues. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria and subsequent oxidative stress are widely recognized as major causes of retinal cell damage induced by IR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. This finding suggested that mitochondrial function, which is involved in oxidative stress processes, may play an important role in the pathophysiology of IRI during the early reperfusion stage. Oxidative stress can influence the permeability of the inner blood retina barrier (iBRB), allowing leukocytes to access retinal tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. The infiltration and activation of immune cells are recognized as the underlying causes of many retinal diseases, including ischemic ophthalmia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. In the UPOAO model, the increase in CD45<sup>+</sup> leukocytes and Iba1<sup>+</sup> microglia in the retina after 3-days of reperfusion supports this viewpoint.</p>
<p>In the later stage of reperfusion (7-days), the DEGs were mainly enriched in immune regulation and inflammation. With more upregulated DEGs than downregulated ones, we hypothesize that the activation of the immune inflammatory response contributes to further IRI in retinal tissue. Previous studies have shown that the retina can elicit immunological responses during ischemia-reperfusion injury and that immune inflammation is an important phenomenon in the progression of this injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. The excessive ROS generated by mitochondria in RGCs during the activation of inflammatory responses can damage cell structure and visual function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. Microglia, considered the primary resident immune cells, contribute to inflammatory responses and consequent neural damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. Infiltrating leukocytes can activate resident microglia, forming a feedback loop that exacerbates inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. Complex interactions between immune cells and retinal neurons after RIRI have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. Interestingly, in our UPOAO model, the death of major retinal neural cells, such as RGCs, BCs, and HCs, was correlated with an increase in infiltrating leukocytes and resident microglia. Therefore, we considered that the immune response and neuroinflammation observed after 7-days of reperfusion may result from the cumulative effects of acute oxidative stress and the responses of resident and peripheral immune cells (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>, <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>). In summary, we described the pathological processes at different time points and highlighted the important role of resident and peripheral immune cell responses in the UPOAO model. This finding offers valuable insights for subsequent screening of pathogenic genes and potential immunotherapy approaches.</p>

<p>Compared with the HIOP and UCCAO models, the UPOAO model is a more appropriate choice for studying retinal IRI in RAO. The HIOP model, widely used for investigating the pathogenesis of APACG, exhibits retinal degeneration features similar to those of the UPOAO model during both reperfusion periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. In our UPOAO model, histologic and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that 60 minutes of ischemia followed by 3-days or 7-days of reperfusion can cause irreversible damage to retinal structure and visual function. Specifically, we observed distinct alterations, such as thinning of the inner retina, substantial RGCs apoptosis, and decreased b-wave amplitude. Multiple studies on the HIOP model have reported consistent results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. However, some typical phenotypes in the HIOP model, such as thinning of the outer nuclear layer and the entire neuroretina and decreased a-wave amplitude, were not observed in the UPOAO model. Moreover, our transcriptome sequencing revealed a specific subset of DEGs unique to the UPOAO model, including Apoe, Abca1, Ldlr, Cyp39a1, and Bmp6. Notably, these DEGs were significantly enriched in pathways associated with lipid and steroid synthesis. Steroid and lipid metabolism homeostasis is disrupted under conditions of oxidative stress and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. In the UPOAO model, the observed lipid and steroid biological processes may result from the cumulative pathological responses triggered by IRI, as observed in the HIOP model. In the UCCAO model, RNA-seq revealed that DEGs were enriched in two main pathways: 1) epigenetic modification-related pathways, including nucleobase-containing compound catabolic process, RNA catabolic process, mRNA catabolic process and N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification; and 2) cell death pathways, including regulation of autophagosome assembly, negative regulation of neuron death, and negative regulation of the neuronal apoptotic process. Epigenetic mechanisms may play a key role in the pathophysiology of ocular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. m6A, one of the most common RNA modifications, has been reported to regulate cell death processes, including apoptosis and autophagy, in the pathological process of IRI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. These results suggest that epigenetic mechanisms may significantly influence cell death during the 7-days reperfusion period in the UCCAO model. Lee et al. evaluated the characteristics of UCCAO without reperfusion using visual, histological and immunohistochemical approaches. Their results revealed delayed perfusion of the ipsilateral retina, thinning of the inner retinal layer 10 weeks after surgery, and a dramatic decrease in the amplitudes of b-waves on day 14 after UCCAO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. This finding suggested that UCCAO primarily represents a model of retinal hypoperfusion injury and may not effectively reflect acute ischemic-induced structural and functional damage in RAO (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). These results led us to consider the UPOAO model an effective experimental model for studying the pathological processes underlying acute ischemia and IRI.</p>
<p>Our research has certain limitations that should be acknowledged. First, our study focused on the changes that occurred within 60 minutes of ischemia and within the first 7-days of reperfusion in the UPOAO model. Further exploration is needed to understand the changes induced by longer reperfusion periods. Additionally, we proposed possible pathological mechanisms, including iBRB damage, oxidative stress and immune inflammation, mainly based on the enrichment results of DEGs at three reperfusion time points. More molecular experimental validation is required to substantiate these proposed mechanisms.</p>
<p>In summary, by thoroughly exploring the injury to major retinal neural cells, visual impairment and pathophysiological changes in the UPOAO model, we confirmed that this model can effectively simulate the acute ischemia-reperfusion processes in RAO. It serves as an ideal mouse model for investigating the underlying pathological mechanisms of ischemia and reperfusion. Furthermore, our UPOAO model holds great promise as a novel model for studies on pathogenic genes and potential therapeutic interventions for RAO.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Wang, Y. et al. used a silicone wire embolus to definitively and acutely clot the pterygopalatine ophthalmic artery in addition to carotid artery ligation to completely block blood supply to the mouse inner retina, which mimic clinical acute retinal artery occlusion. A detailed characterization of this mouse model determined the time course of inner retina degeneration and associated functional deficits, which closely mimic human patients. Whole retina transcriptome profiling and comparison revealed distinct features associated with ischemia, reperfusion, and different model mechanisms. Interestingly and importantly, this team found a sequential event including reperfusion-induced leukocyte infiltration from blood vessels, residual microglial activation, and neuroinflammation that may lead to neuronal cell death.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Clear demonstration of the surgery procedure with informative illustrations, images, and superb surgical videos.</p>
<p>Two time points of ischemia and reperfusion were studied with convincing histological and in vivo data to demonstrate the time course of various changes in retinal neuronal cell survivals, ERG functions, and inner/outer retina thickness.</p>
<p>The transcriptome comparison among different retinal artery occlusion models provides informative evidence to differentiate these models.</p>
<p>The potential applications of the in vivo retinal ischemia-reperfusion model and relevant readouts demonstrated by this study will certainly inspire further investigation of the dynamic morphological and functional changes of retinal neurons and glial cell responses during disease progression and before and after treatments.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The revised manuscript has been significantly improved in clarity and readability. It has addressed all my questions convincingly.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors of this manuscript aim to develop a novel animal model to accurately simulate the retinal ischemic process in retinal artery occlusion (RAO). A unilateral pterygopalatine ophthalmic artery occlusion (UPOAO) mouse model was established using silicone wire embolization combined with carotid artery ligation. This manuscript provided data to show the changes of major classes of retinal neural cells and visual dysfunction following various durations of ischemia (30 minutes and 60 minutes) and reperfusion (3 days and 7 days) after UPOAO. Additionally, transcriptomics was utilized to investigate the transcriptional changes and elucidate changes in the pathophysiological process in the UPOAO model post-ischemia and reperfusion. Furthermore, the authors compared transcriptomic differences between the UPOAO model and other retinal ischemic-reperfusion models, including HIOP and UCCAO, and revealed unique pathological processes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The UPOAO model represents a novel approach for studying retinal artery occlusion. The study is very comprehensive.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Originally, some statements were incorrect and confusing. However, the authors have made clarifications in the revised manuscript to avoid confusion.</p>

<p>The quantifications of the thickness of retinal layers in HE-stained sections in Figure 4 (IPL) and Response Figure 2 are incorrect. For mice retina, the thickness of the IPL is approximately 50 Âµm.</p>

<p>Thank you for your meticulous review of the manuscript. We have rectified the inaccuracies in the quantification of retinal layer thickness in HE-stained sections in Figure 4, addressing the initial issue with the scale bar.</p>
<p>We consulted with a microscope engineer and used a microscope microscale to calibrate the scale of the fluorescence microscope (BX63; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) at the suggestion of the engineer.</p>
<p>We recount the thickness of all layers of the HE-stained retinal section (line 902). The inner retina thickness in Figure 4 has been adjusted under a new scale bar, and the thickness of the outer retinal layers is now displayed in</p>
<p>Author response image 1. However, the IPL thickness of the sham eye in the UPOAO model is still not aligned with the common thickness of 50 Âµm. Therefore we review the literature within our laboratory, focusing on C57BL/6 mice from the same source, revealed that the inner retina thickness (GCC+INL) in the HE-stained sections of the sham eye in the UPOAO model (around 80 Âµm) is consistent with previous findings (see Author response image 2) conducted by Kaibao Ji and published in <italic>Experimental Eye Research</italic> in 2021 [1].</p>
<p>We captured and analyzed the average retinal thickness of each layer over a long range of 200-1100 Î¼m from the optic nerve head (see Author response image 3, highlighted by the green line). The field region has been corrected in the revised manuscript (line 232). Considering the significant variation in retinal thickness from the optic nerve to the periphery, we consulted literature on multi-point measurements of HE-stained retinas. The average thickness of the GCC layer in the control group was approximately 57 Âµm at 600 Âµm from the optic nerve head and about 48 Âµm at 1200 Âµm from the optic nerve head in the literature [2] (see Author response image 4). The GCC layer thickness of the sham eye in the UPOAO model is around 50 Âµm, in alignment with existing literature. In future studies, we will pay more attention to the issue of thickness averaging.</p>
<p>We appreciate your thorough review and valuable feedback, which has enabled us to correct errors and enhance the accuracy of our research.</p>

<p>There are some typos in the summary table. For example: 'Amplitudes of a-wave (0.3, 2.0, and 10.0 cd.s/mÂ²)' should be 'Amplitudes of a-wave (0.3, 3.0, and 10.0 cd.s/mÂ²)'; and 'IINL thickness' in HE' should be 'INL thickness'.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing out the typos in the summary table (line 1073). We have corrected 'Amplitudes of a-wave (0.3, 2.0, and 10.0 cd.s/mÂ²)' to 'Amplitudes of a-wave (0.3, 3.0, and 10.0 cd.s/mÂ²)' and 'IINL thickness' to 'INL thickness'. Your attention to detail is greatly appreciated and has been very helpful in improving our manuscript.</p>
