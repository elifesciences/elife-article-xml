<title>Abstract</title><p>The apicomplexan parasite <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> infects 25-30% of the global human population and can cause life-threatening diseases in immunocompromised patients. The chronically infectious forms of the parasite, bradyzoites, persist within cysts in brain and muscle tissue and are responsible for its transmission and remission of the disease. Currently available treatment options are very limited and are only effective against the fast-replicating tachyzoites but fail to eradicate the chronic stages of <italic>T. gondii</italic>. The cause of these treatment failures remains unclear. Here, we utilized our recently developed human myotube-based culture model to screen compounds from the MMV Pathogen Box against pan-resistant in vitro bradyzoites and identified multiple compounds with simultaneous activity against tachyzoites and bradyzoites. Stable isotope-resolved metabolic profiling on tachyzoites and bradyzoites identified the mitochondrial <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub>-complex as a target of bradyzocidal compounds and defines their metabolic impacts on both parasite forms. Our data suggest that mature bradyzoites rely on mitochondrial ATP production.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> is an ubiquitous apicomplexan parasite that infects virtually all warm-blooded animals, including 25-30 % of humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Montazeri et al. 2020</xref>). Of all food-borne pathogens, <italic>T. gondii</italic> causes 20% of the total disease burden in Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Havelaar et al. 2015</xref>). Although most acute infections caused by the fast replicating tachyzoite stage of the parasite remain asymptomatic in immunocompetent individuals, the parasite persists life-long in the form of encysted semi-dormant bradyzoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Weiss and Dubey 2009</xref>). Currently, no medical treatment exists to eradicate these tissue cysts with their rigid cyst wall from infected individuals. <italic>T. gondii</italic> is transmitted through undercooked meat products of infected livestock but also via feline-shed oocysts that can contaminate water sources and soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Weiss and Dubey 2009</xref>). Severe toxoplasmosis occurs after reactivation of cysts or primary infection of immunosuppressed individuals or fetuses of seronegative mothers and can lead to systemic infections, uveitis, encephalitis as well as congenital transmission with potentially fatal outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Montoya and Liesenfeld 2004</xref>). Hence, tissue cysts of <italic>T. gondii</italic> constitute a long- term source for transmission and risk of acute disease. Also, other related cyst-forming coccidian parasites such as <italic>Neospora caninum</italic> and <italic>Besnoitia besnoiti</italic> pose an immense veterinary burden by causing abortion mainly in sheep and severe chronic infections in cattle and horses, respectively. Current treatment options exist only against the tachyzoite form of these parasites and include antifolates, such as pyrimethamine or trimethoprim, that inhibit the bifunctional dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthetase, in combination with sulfadiazine, which blocks the dihydropteroate synthetase. These enzymes are implicated in DNA synthesis in both the parasite and side-effects often require pre-mature termination of the treatment (Katlama, De Wit, et al. 1996; Alday and Doggett 2017). Another potent drug target in coccidians and other apicomplexan parasites such as <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. is the cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub>-complex in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which is inhibited by a number of approved drugs, such as the naphthoquinones atovaquone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Meneceur et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Nixon et al. 2013</xref>) and buparvaquone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sharifiyazdi et al. 2012</xref>). However, both coenzyme Q analogs including bioavailable nanosuspensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Shubar et al. 2011</xref>) fail to eradicate encysted bradyzoites of <italic>T. gondii</italic> and <italic>N. caninum</italic> from the brains of infected mice after multiple weeks of treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Doggett et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Müller et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Doggett et al. 2020</xref>). Experimental inhibitors of the <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub>-complex includes 1-hydroxy-2-dodecyl-4(1H)quinolone (HDQ) that arrests the growth of asexual blood stages of the related malaria parasite <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Vallières et al. 2012</xref>). However, in <italic>T. gondii</italic> HDQ appears to inhibit multiple mitochondrial election donors such as the alternative NAD-dehydrogenase and the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase in tachyzoites (S. S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lin, Gross, and Bohne 2009</xref>). It does not affect mature bradyzoites in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Christiansen et al. 2022</xref>), and HDQ derivatives do not clear <italic>T. gondii</italic> cysts from the brain of infected mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bajohr et al. 2010</xref>). In addition, endochin-like quinolones constitute a promising series of potent <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub>-complex inhibitors that are active against <italic>T. gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">McConnell et al. 2018</xref>) and <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Song et al. 2018</xref>). However, these compounds also do not fully eradicate the cysts <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Doggett et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">2020</xref>). Similarly, bumped kinase inhibitors that selectively inhibit parasite calcium-dependent protein kinases in various apicomplexans fail to clear tissue cysts <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Christiansen et al. 2022</xref>) and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Hulverson et al. 2019</xref>). Despite these efforts, it remains unclear whether the target proteins of these drugs are rendered dispensable for the survival of bradyzoites or whether the eradication failures have other reasons, such as poor permeability across the blood brain barrier and/or the cyst wall. To date, the genetic tools available to directly characterize the function of essential genes in bradyzoites are limited to promoter replacements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Smith et al. 2021</xref>), while no genetic methods exist to directly interrogate the fitness contribution of mitochondrially encoded genes such as the cytochrome b subunit of the cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub>-complex (J.-L. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Wang et al. 2016</xref>). Consequently, reverse pharmacological approaches, that involve screening of inhibitors against target proteins, remain difficult and the underlying reasons for limited <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacies remain uncertain.</p>
<p>To address these shortcomings, we employed a recently developed human myotube-based culture system to generate mature <italic>T. gondii</italic> drug-tolerant bradyzoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Christiansen et al. 2022</xref>) to screen the MMV Pathogen Box. Untargeted and stable isotope-resolved metabolomic analyses of dually active drugs identified established and unsuspected modes of action in tachyzoites and bradyzoites, respectively. Our data directly show metabolic consequences of <italic>bc<sub>1</sub></italic>-complex inhibition in bradyzoites and suggest its crucial role in ATP production.</p>

<title>MMV Pathogen Box Screening Procedure</title>
<p>All Pathogen Box compounds were stored at -20°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Veale 2019</xref>). DMSO-solved compounds were diluted in DMEM or RPMI media and stored at 4°C until use. Host cells were grown in transparent, flat-bottom 96-well plates and infected as described above to cultivate either tachyzoites or in vitro tissue cysts. One column per plate was left uninfected to estimate fluorescence background. Four hours after infection with tachyzoites or after four weeks of bradyzoite maturation the culture medium was replaced by medium containing either 0.1 %</p>
<p>DMSO (negative control) or 10 µM of the respective Pathogen Box compound. During the seven-day treatment period the medium was renewed every two to three days. It was then changed to tachyzoite growth medium to induce re-differentiation of viable bradyzoites to tachyzoites, and then the culture was monitored over 28 days. Prior to each medium exchange, the cultures were monitored for compound crystallization. The fluorescence was measured in a fluorescence plate reader (Tecan Infinite M200 PRO) (excitation Λ = 554 nm, emission Λ = 589 nm). Fluorescence values passing a threshold of 2,000 after background subtraction indicated proliferating parasites and hence an ineffective treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

<title>The dose response of dually active compounds</title>
<p>Tachyzoite and bradyzoite cultures were treated with the MMV compounds which were pipetted in a serial dilution across the 96-well plate and treated for 7 days. Afterwards, the compound containing medium was removed and possible regrowth was observed for another 7 days (tachyzoite assay) or 21 to 28 days (bradyzoite assay). The gathered relative fluorescence units were background-subtracted. Depending on the development of the DMSO control, a dataset that optimally reflected the dose-response was chosen to calculate the half- maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) for tachyzoites and the half-maximal lethal concentration (LC<sub>50</sub>) for bradyzoites. In tachyzoite datasets, this time point was between day 4 and 7. Bradyzoite cultures showed generally lower MOI, and the chosen LC<sub>50</sub> time point varied between experiments from 7 to 28 days post treatment. For an optimal LC<sub>50</sub>, we chose the first time points where in one condition a bradyzoite culture completed tachyzoite regrowth, another condition showed no growth and in an intermediate condition the culture showed intermediate growth (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The concentration data was log-transformed and a non-linear regression (curve fit with variable slope) was performed to determine the dose response (Prism 9, GraphPad).</p>

<title>Fluorescence stain of mitochondrial activity</title>
<p>This assay was performed on tachyzoites and bradyzoites. For the tachyzoite experiment, HFF cells were infected with RH-S9 parasites at an MOI 0.1 and treated for 24 h with 1 µM atovaquone, 25 nM buparvaquone or 5 µM MMV1028806, respectively, corresponding to five-fold of the respective IC<sub>50</sub> values, or 0.1 % DMSO as a solvent control. For the bradyzoites experiment, 4 weeks-old ME49 <italic>in vitro</italic> cysts were treated for 24h with 5 µM atovaquone, 500 nM buparvaquone or 5 µM MMV1028806, respectively, corresponding to the lowest lethal concentration, or 0.1 % DMSO as a solvent control. Cultures were then stained with 500 nM MitoTracker Deep Red FM (MT; Thermo Fisher) in DMEM for 40 min at 37 °C, followed by a 20 min de-staining with DMEM and final fixation with 1 % paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. The cyst wall was decorated with Dolichos Biflorus Agglutinin (DBA) and stained with Streptavidin-Cy2. Mowiol containing DAPI (1:3,000) was used to mount the cells. To avoid a biased image acquisition, all parasite vacuoles or cysts identified in a specimen along an horizontal axis were imaged. Tachyzoite images were taken with a Zeiss Axio Imager Z1 Microscope equipped with the ApoTome 2 at identical exposure times (DAPI 200 ms, MT 500 ms, S9-GFP 200 ms, Brightfield 10 ms) using a Zeiss Plan APOCHROMAT 63x/1.4 oil objective lens. Bradyzoite images were acquired on a Leica Stellaris 8 laser scanning confocal microscope using a Leica HC PL APO CS2 63x/1.4 oil objective lens. The pinhole diameter was set to 1 AU. All detectors were operating in photon counting mode. The acquisition parameters were set as follows. DAPI: diode laser at 405nm<sub>exc</sub> with 2.2%, 430-550nm<sub>em</sub> with a HyD S-detector. Cy2: WLL at 468nm<sub>exc</sub> with 8.5%, 473-591nm<sub>em</sub> with a HyD S-detector. MitoTracker: WLL at 641nm<sub>exc</sub> with 2.7%, 650-784nm<sub>em</sub> with a HyD X-detector (4x line average). The zoom was set to 7x, images were acquired in frame-sequential mode with a unidirectional scan speed of 400 Hz, the pixel dwell time for all channels was 3.18µs. For z- Stacks, z-step size was set to 0.299 µm.</p>
<p>Using ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Schindelin et al. 2012</xref>), the intensity threshold of individual pixels of MT (190 to 255 for tachyzoites and 125 to 65535 for bradyzoites) and DAPI (140 to 255 for tachyzoites and 363 to 65535) channels was cut off and the signal intensity was calculated per parasitophorous vacuole or cyst.</p>

<p>The <italic>T. gondii in vitro</italic> cyst culture was performed as described above. After four weeks, cells were treated with 5 µM atovaquone, 500 nM buparvaquone, 5 µM MMV1028806, corresponding to the lowest lethal concentration, or 0.1% DMSO, as a solvent control, for 24h. Cells were fixed by covering the monolayer with a fixation solution of 1% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde (Electron Microscopy Services) in 0.05 M HEPES buffer (pH 7.4).

Approximately 64 h later, the cultures were treated with 1.5 µM MMV019189, 7 µM MMV1028806, 30 µM MMV228911, 1.2 µM MMV595321, 5 µM MMV688762, 2 µM MMV688854, respectively, and 0.1 % DMSO as a control for 3h. These concentrations correspond to the five-fold respective IC<sub>50</sub> value. Cultures were quenched in ice-cold PBS and parasites were isolated from their host cells by passaging scraped monolayers through a 23G needle, filtered through a 3 µm polycarbonate filter and after microscopic counting distributed at 1 x 10<sup>8</sup> parasites per sample.

<title>The Pathogen Box contains dually active compounds</title>
<p>To initially identify compounds that simultaneously target the tachyzoite and the bradyzoite stage of <italic>T. gondii</italic>, we tested 371 of 400 compounds from the Pathogen Box at a concentration of 10 µM against both stages. We excluded previously reported active compounds against <italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Spalenka et al. 2018</xref>) from this initial screen. HFF cells were infected with tachyzoites of the Pru strain expressing tandem Tomato fluorescent protein in its cytosol (PruTom) at an MOI of 1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). 47 compounds completely inhibited growth during 7 days of exposure while the parasitemia of DMSO-treated controls already peaked after 4 days (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). To also identify bradyzocidal compounds, we differentiated KD3 myoblasts for one week into multinucleated myotubes and infected them under bicarbonate-deplete conditions and at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 for four weeks to allow maturation of tissue cysts (Fig. S1). We exposed the cultures to 10 µM of the 371 MMV compounds for one week, removed the inhibitors and stimulated re-differentiation into tachyzoites by bicarbonate supplementation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Growth of DMSO-treated cultures became detectable after 10 to 14 days. Interestingly, 31 compounds prevented any tachyzoite regrowth (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), indicating their bradyzocidal activity. To exclude host cytotoxicity-dependent suppression of parasite growth, we measured cell viability via the reductive potential of myotubes and HFF cells using a resazurin assay. At 10 µM, 30, 12 and 13 compounds inflicted cytotoxicity onto HFFs, myotubes or both cell types, respectively. This initial screen identified 14 compounds with activity against both tachyzoites and bradyzoites and no apparent cytotoxicity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>; Fig. S2).</p>

<title>Validation of screening hits</title>
<p>To validate our results, we determined half-inhibitory concentrations (IC<sub>50</sub>) in PruTom tachyzoites (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, B</xref>) and half-maximal lethal concentration (LC<sub>50</sub>) in bradyzoites. We also included 28 compounds that were previously reported to target tachyzoites (Spalenka et al. <sup>2</sup>018<sup>)</sup>. We confirmed dual activity of 16 compounds that exhibited mean IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging between 70 pM and 1.1 µM for tachyzoites (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>) and LC<sub>50</sub> values between 0.15 and 8.2 µM for bradyzoites (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). To allow a comparison between the tachyzoite and bradyzoite data, we also determined the respective minimal lethal concentrations (MLC) over a seven- day treatment duration of tachyzoites as well (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). Except for four compounds (MMV021013, MMV022478, MMV658988, MMV659004), minimal lethal concentrations were higher in bradyzoites, potentially reflecting their lower metabolic activity and/or the cyst wall as a diffusion barrier.</p>

<title>Dually active MMV Pathogen Box hits share high lipophilicity and are indicated to be active against other pathogens</title>
<p>To gain insight into general properties of active compounds from our initial screen (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>), we tabulated indicated activities as provided by MMV (Fig. S2A, D). As expected, these compounds were mostly earmarked as active against <italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites (67%), however, none of those compounds exhibited bradyzocidal activity. Instead, 27% of dually active compounds were considered active against <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>. Also, despite the relative phylogenetic proximity of <italic>P. falciparum,</italic> only 5% of the 125 potential antimalarials blocked growth of both <italic>T. gondii</italic> stages. To characterize physicochemical properties of these dually active hits, we approximated their lipophilicity by their logP values (Supplemental File 1) and compared them to compounds that were inactive or active against a single stage of <italic>T. gondii</italic> (Fig. S2B). We found that tachyzocidal compounds possess a statistically significantly higher lipophilicity than the average Pathogen Box compounds and this trend was more accentuated for bradyzocidal and dually active compounds. We estimated permeability through the blood brain barrier (bbb) using LightBBB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Shaker et al. 2020</xref>) and gastrointestinal absorbability (GIA) using swissADME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Daina, Michielin, and Zoete 2017</xref>) (Supplemental File 1). Most of the dually active drugs were predicted to be both permeable across the bbb and absorbed in the intestine (Fig. S2C). Together, these data support phylogenetic relationship as a weak predictor of activity of Pathogen Box compounds against <italic>T. gondii</italic> bradyzoites and highlight the role of lipophilicity.</p>

<title>Metabolic drug responses in tachyzoites indicate conserved and novel modes of action</title>
<p>To investigate how dually-active compounds impacted parasites, we analyzed the metabolic responses of treated parasites. To that end, we choose five compounds based on their availability and yet unknown mode of action (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and Supplemental File 2). Infected monolayers were treated for three hours with a 3-fold of respective IC<sub>50</sub> concentrations of MMV compounds or the solvent DMSO. The inhibitor MMV688854 (BKI 1294) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Doggett et al. 2014</xref>) is considered to inhibit a non-metabolic target (calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK1)) at the employed concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hayward et al. 2023</xref>) and served as an additional control to estimate the metabolic impact of growth inhibition. We filter-purified parasites from quenched monolayers and analyzed their acetonitrile extracts by LCMS using both, pHILIC and BEH- amide chromatography columns. We generated 9 samples per condition from three repeats of the experiment with triplicate samples. A principal component analysis illustrates that batch effects are the main contributors to biological variances within the dataset (Fig. S3A,B). Despite that, all compounds elicited a distinct metabolic phenotype on both LCMS systems (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The CDPK1 inhibitor increased levels of AMP, oxidized glutathione, pseudouridine, citrulline, glycolate and glutamyl glutamine, while reducing the abundances of GABA, carbamoyl aspartate, phosphoenolpyruvate and a hexose phosphate. Shifts in these metabolites are shared among many treatments and indicate their implication in a general stress response and thus do not signify direct interference with parasite metabolism.</p>

<p>Inhibitor-specific responses include the accumulation of cGMP-AMP after treatment with MMV019189, accumulation of carbamoyl aspartate and dihydroorotate upon MMV1028806 treatment, and a general depletion of central carbon metabolites (succinate, citrate, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, ATP, MEP) in MMV228911-treated parasites. MMV595321 caused an accumulation of N-acetylated amino acids, and MMV688762 led to uracil deficiency and an accumulation of dihydroorotate and orotate.

<p>To test these hypotheses, we exposed intracellular parasites to MMV1028806 or buparvaquone (BPQ) while substituting glucose with <sup>13</sup>C6-glucose for three hours. We then measured the incorporation of <sup>13</sup>C into the central carbon metabolites as well as the intermediates of the pyrimidine synthesis pathway. As controls, we utilized the known <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub>- complex inhibitor atovaquone (ATQ) and the solvent DMSO (Supplemental File 3). Treatment with all three inhibitors led to a dramatic accumulation of carbamoyl aspartate and dihydroorotate which was accompanied by a depletion of uracil and uridine, in particular of the +5-labeled uridine isotopologue. These changes are consistent with impaired function of the <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub>-complex-dependent dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B,C</xref>). Another common effect was the accumulation of succinate and depletion of fumarate, suggesting reduced recycling of FADH<sub>2</sub> via the <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub>-complex. Anaplerotic substrates were also affected by all three treatments, most notably a strong accumulation of aspartic acid.</p>
<p>To independently verify our results, we hypothesized that <italic>T. gondii</italic> also incorporates glutamine-derived nitrogen into pyrimidines. We replaced glutamine with its <sup>15</sup>N-amide-labeled isotopologue in the tachyzoite culture media for three hours while simultaneously exposing the parasites to ATQ, BPQ or MMV1028806. As expected from our previous experiments, we observed a marked decrease of uracil and uridine levels while aspartate, carbamoyl aspartate and dihydroorotate accumulated again (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, Supplementary File 5). Consistently, <sup>15</sup>N- incorporation into pyrimidines was diminished while carbamoyl aspartate and dihydroorotate were heavily labeled as M+1 isotopologues (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, these data show that treatments with all three compounds lead to the accumulation of metabolites upstream of the <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub>-complex-dependent reactions during pyrimidine biosynthesis and the TCA cycle and to the depletion of downstream metabolites (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>).

<p>The inhibition of the <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub>-complex by ATQ leads to the collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential in <italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Vercesi et al. 1998</xref>) and we anticipated a similar phenotype in BPQ or MMV1028806-treated parasites. We treated intracellular tachyzoites and bradyzoites for 24 h with the three inhibitors or 0.1 % DMSO alone and estimated the mitochondrial membrane potential and morphology using a fluorescent Mitotracker dye. The mitochondria of control tachyzoites appeared as extended loops but largely collapsed after treatments with all three compounds (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A, B</xref>). Notably, also host mitochondria appear influenced. In bradyzoites, mitochondria appeared mostly as spheres or were donut-shaped (Supplementary File 6) and their relative fluorescence decreased after 24 h treatment with ATQ, BPQ or MMV1028806 at 5 µM, 500 nM or 5 µM, respectively while their morphology appeared unchanged (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C, D</xref>). Analysis by thin section electron microscopy revealed a largely unaffected sub-mitochondrial ultrastructure but the area of mitochondrial profiles and their relative abundance were changed in comparison to control after exposure with ATQ and MMV1028806 but not with BPQ (Fig. S5). This indicates that the latter decreases Mitotracker fluorescence intensity directly, while ATQ and MMV1028806 cause both, a drop in Mitotracker fluorescence and a reduced size of the mitochondria which leaves open whether a change of the membrane potential, of the size, or even of both parameters were responsible for the drop in Mitotracker fluorescence.</p>

<p>Next, we sought to confirm this mode of action directly on bradyzoites and record the metabolic impact of ATQ, BPQ or MMV1028806. To that end, we exposed intracellular four-week-old cysts to 5 µM, 500 nM or 5 µM of the respective compounds and for three hours and used 0.2% DMSO as a mock treatment. These concentrations represent their LC<sub>50</sub> against bradyzoites and were chosen to minimize off-target effects. The cysts were isolated for LCMS analysis using magnetic beads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Christiansen et al. 2022</xref>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Common to all three metabolic phenotypes is the accumulation of AMP and NADH, while varying TCA cycle intermediates, such as malate, succinate and α-ketoglutarate and mitochondria-independent energy sources such as glucose and phosphocreatine were depleted (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B-D</xref>). These metabolic changes suggest an energy starvation scenario marked by rising AMP levels and reduced recycling of NADH via the <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub>-complex. Interestingly, in BPQ and MMV1028806 treated cysts, we also observed prominent accumulation of several acyl-carnitines species which are mobile intermediates of ß-oxidation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B-D</xref>). Since this pathway is thought to be absent in <italic>T. gondii,</italic> we attribute these changes to inhibition of host mitochondria (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Notably, we did not observe changes in the pyrimidine synthesis pathway, which may reflect low nucleic acid demand from largely dormant bradyzoites. These data demonstrate that bradyzoites, which were considered metabolically inactive, exhibit metabolic responses to inhibitory compounds. Although we characterized AMP accumulation as part of a general stress response in tachyzoites, the metabolic profiles of inhibited bradyzoites are consistent with inhibition of their mitochondrial <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub>-complex and suggest its role in ATP generation.</p>

However, while ATQ inhibits the <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub>- complex, HDQ inhibits dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHOD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hegewald, Gross, and Bohne 2013</xref>) and the alternative NADH dehydrogenase (NDH2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Saleh et al. 2007</xref>). Both compounds block tachyzoite growth at low nanomolar concentrations in vitro with IC50s at 20 and 4 nM, respectively (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). However, in contrast to ATQ, HDQ does not affect the viability of mature <italic>T. gondii</italic> bradyzoites despite diminishing their mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Christiansen et al. 2022</xref>). Up to 20 µM HDQ did not arrest re-differentiation into proliferating tachyzoites, while bradyzoites that were treated with 5 µM ATQ (LC<sub>50</sub> 2.5 µM) did not generate proliferating tachyzoites (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). To investigate how these modes of actions affect the mitochondrial transport chain in bradyzoites, we tested their influence on mitochondrial ATP production by luciferase-based ATP assay. This assay shows a linear response to parasite cell equivalents between 10<sup>3</sup> and 10<sup>6</sup> parasites per 100 μL, and in order to minimize variance we decided to work with 10<sup>5</sup> parasites (Fig. S6). To maximize mitochondrial ATP production, we starved three-week-old bradyzoites for one additional week of glucose. As a comparison, we utilized tachyzoites that were cultured for two days in glucose-deplete conditions. Untreated tachyzoite samples contained in average 196 ± 21 fmol ATP per 10<sup>5</sup> parasites, whereas untreated bradyzoites only contained 14.1 ± 1.1 fmol. (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). Three hour-long treatment with 5 µM ATQ decreased ATP levels in both stages by 75 % (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). In contrast, HDQ reduced ATP levels by 60 % in tachyzoites but only marginally affected bradyzoites (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). These data indicate that bradyzoites can maintain very low ATP levels and suggest the presence of a diminished but obligate production of ATP in the mitochondria that functions independently of exogenous glucose and HDQ-target enzymes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>New treatment options for chronic <italic>T. gondii</italic> infections are needed because so far, they cannot be cured and currently available treatments of acute toxoplasmosis are associated with severe side-effects, in particular in infants after congenital transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Konstantinovic et al. 2019</xref>). To foster the simultaneous identification of drug targets in bradyzoites and along with respective inhibitory compounds, we utilized a recently developed <italic>in vitro</italic> culture system of pan-drug tolerant bradyzoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Christiansen et al. 2022</xref>) to screen 400 compounds of the MMV Pathogen Box. 16 compounds exhibited confirmed cidal activity against bradyzoites while also inhibiting growth of tachyzoites. Metabolic profiling and stable isotope tracing in treated tachyzoites suggested the inhibition of the mitochondrial <italic>bc<sub>1</sub>-</italic>complex by MMV1028806 and the reference compound BPQ.</p>
<p>Interestingly, of the 15 compounds in the Toxoplasmosis disease set, as earmarked by MMV, only 10 were found to be active against tachyzoites and none against bradyzoites. These differences may be attributed to strain-specific susceptibilities which are known for anti-folates and atovaquone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Meneceur et al. 2008</xref>) and differences in the design of growth assays. MMV assessed activities via plaque assays that prevent media change and rely on visual inspection of growth of a low number of parasites and might overestimate inhibitory effects.</p>
<p>We found that bradyzocidal compounds exhibit higher predicted logP coefficients, suggesting that the parasite entry might occur via diffusion across the cyst wall and less via solute transporter proteins. A known example were high polarity and low import rates caused poor efficacy against <italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites is fosmidomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Nair et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Baumeister et al. 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>This case, might also be made for the antifolates, pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, trimethroprim and sulfamethoxazole which exhibit low consensus logP values of 2.09, 0.4, 1.16 and 0.92 and also fail to eradicate tissue cysts (Alday and Doggett 2017; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Enshaeieh et al. 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, MMV675968 is a dually active compound with a logP value of 2.46, that has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) in a range of pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Songsungthong et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Kim et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Borba-Santos, Vila, and Rozental 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Nugraha et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Rollin-Pinheiro et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Vila and Lopez-Ribot 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cantillon et al. 2022</xref>). Its target in <italic>T. gondii</italic>, however, remains to be identified.</p>
<p>Another important diffusion barrier that needs to be overcome to eradicate <italic>T. gondii</italic> tissue cysts is the blood brain barrier (BBB). Pyrimethamine and trimethroprim, both penetrate the blood brain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Geils et al. 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ineichen et al. 2020</xref>) but do not clear brain-resident cysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Montazeri et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Enshaeieh et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Christiansen et al. 2022</xref>) highlighting the cyst wall as a potentially decisive obstacle. Consistent with this hypothesis is the tolerance of mature in vitro cysts tissue cysts against high dosis of sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Christiansen et al. 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>We also used metabolomics to characterize the modes of actions of four additional inhibitors. In general, metabolic phenotypes reflect direct consequences of target inhibition as well as indirect effects resulting from attenuated growth and stress responses. We chose the bumped- kinase inhibitor MMV688854 (BKI-1294) that targets the calcium-dependent protein kinase 1 (CDPK1) as a control compound to identify metabolites implicated in a general stress response and adaptation to slow growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Winzer et al. 2015</xref>). CDPK1 is needed for invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Johnson et al. 2012</xref>) and also affects formation of daughter cells. An accumulation of AMP and oxidized glutathione are the most conserved responses across the six treatments and may indicate depleted energy levels and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Caro et al. 2012</xref>). Also, pseudouridine is elevated in many treatments. Enhanced pseudouridylation of RNA is considered to be implicated in stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cerneckis et al. 2022</xref>) and modulates RNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Davis 1995</xref>). It remains to be tested which of these conserved metabolic responses to a panel of growth inhibitors signify cellular decay and which ones take part in a productive metabolic response in <italic>T. gondii</italic>. Nonetheless, metabolic profiling data on antibiotics-exposed bacterial pathogens has been used to design combination therapies, by either interfering with productive metabolic stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Zampieri et al. 2017</xref>) or by simultaneously inhibiting otherwise non-essential pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Campos and Zampieri 2019</xref>). We found that the systematic identification of target structures and drug modes of action from profiling data alone remains challenging due to inherent non-linear relationships within the cellular metabolic network, the underlying regulatory mechanisms of enzyme functions. A systematic mapping of genetic disruptions to metabolic phenotypes, as demonstrated in <italic>E. coli,</italic> may alleviate these restrictions (Anglada- Girotto et al. 2022).</p>
<p>Apart from the general metabolic stress response to the treatment with MMV688854, three compounds caused apparent inhibitor-specific signatures. MMV019189, which is known to inhibit <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Duffy et al. 2017</xref>), but also <italic>C. parvum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hennessey et al. 2018</xref>) and <italic>L. mexicana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Berry et al. 2018</xref>), lead to the accumulation of c-GMP-AMP in the parasite. This dinucleotide is produced by the c-GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) in mammalian cells in response to cytosolic DNA and triggers a type-I interferon response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Sun et al. 2013</xref>). While cGas is considered absent in <italic>T. gondii</italic>, host c-GMP-AMP induces STING-signaling as a response to <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection (P. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Wang et al. 2019</xref>). Hence, MMV019189 may implicate the host in its antiparasitic activity.</p>
<p>MMV228911-treated tachyzoites showed the depletion of the DXR product 2-C- methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP), a metabolite that occurs in the non-mevalonate pathway in <italic>T. gondii’</italic>s apicoplast. Other metabolites upstream of DXR are either not detected or depleted, such as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, but also partake in other pathways. Interestingly, MMV228911 also caused a broader dysregulation of central carbon metabolism marked by a decrease of many phosphorylated metabolites such as nucleotide triphosphates and PEP but also citric acid and acetyl-CoA. This is consistent with metabolic signaling beyond the apicoplast, which also has been implicated in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, where a cytosolic sugar phosphatase is responsible for resistance to the DXR inhibitor Fosmidomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Guggisberg et al. 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>We identified MMV1028806 as a candidate <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub>-complex inhibitor by comparing its metabolic impact with the one of BPQ with ATQ. All three compounds cause a sharp increase of pyrimidine synthesis substrates, depletion of pyrimidines and dysregulation of TCA cycle intermediates. This is consistent with previous mass spectrometry-based studies that characterized metabolic fingerprint of atovaquone on <italic>P. falciparum</italic> intraerythrocytic blood- stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Creek et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Allman et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Antonova-Koch et al. 2018</xref>). Additionally, we confirmed the <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub><italic>-</italic>complex as a target by measuring the synthesis of TCA cycle and pyrimidine biosynthesis intermediates via the monitoring of the incorporation of <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>15</sup>N stable isotopes from glucose and glutamine, respectively. Both, the isotopologue distributions and metabolite abundances strongly suggest attenuation of pyrimidine production and TCA cycle fluxes by all three inhibitors (Hortua <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Triana et al. 2016</xref>). TCA cycle intermediates show characteristic isotopologue distributions that are indicative of a <sup>13</sup>C-label incorporation via acetyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">MacRae et al. 2012</xref>). A relatively increased M+3 isotopologue species in dicarboxylic acids in ATQ- and BPQ-treated parasites may indicate enhanced anaplerotic synthesis from glycolytic intermediates. These distinctions from MMV1028806 metabotypes may reflect a combination of off-target effects and differential timing of the metabolic inhibition.</p>
<p>Interestingly, six compounds from the MMV Pathogen Box have recently been shown to inhibit O<sub>2</sub> consumption in tachyzoites through <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub>-complex inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hayward et al. 2023</xref>). We co- identified Buparvaquone as a <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub>-complex inhibitor but we did not test the remaining five compounds for their targets. However, in our screen at 10 µM we found MMV024397 and MMV688853 to be dually active, while Trifloxystrobin (MMV688754) and Auranofin (MMV688978) lacked inhibitory activity in bradyzoites, and Azoxystrobin (MMV021057) was inactive. In addition, the previously described <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub>-complex inhibitor ELQ400 (MMV671636) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">McConnell et al. 2018</xref>) was dually active. Overall, these data are consistent with the fact that the <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub>-complex is indeed needed for survival of bradyzoites, while not every tachyzocidal <italic>bc<sub>1</sub></italic>- inhibitor also inhibits bradyzoites.</p>
<p>In contrast to tachyzoites, the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase in bradyzoites does not dominate the metabolic phenotype (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B, C, and</xref> D), as we neither observe the accumulation of carbamoyl-aspartate, dihydroorotate, aspartate, nor the decrease in pyrimidines. Instead, AMP and NADH accumulate, which in eukaryotes signifies a low cellular energy status (S.-C. Lin and Hardie 2018; X. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Fu et al. 2019</xref>) that typically induces AMP-activated protein kinase and a glycolytic response. AMPK is a conserved enzyme with a pivotal role in cellular homeostasis: it responds to elevated AMP levels by repressing anabolic activity and by stimulating glucose uptake and glycolysis, β-oxidation, and ketogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Winder and Hardie 1999</xref>; S.-C. Lin and Hardie 2018). <italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites express AMPK which serves an important role in metabolic reprogramming during the lytic cycle of tachyzoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Li et al. 2023</xref>). Transcriptomic and proteomic data indicate its presence in bradyzoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Garfoot et al. 2019</xref>) but its function remains unknown. We observed decreased levels of free glucose during all three treatments that are consistent with stimulated glycolysis. We also observe depleted phosphocreatine levels in bradyzoites (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) during treatments. In muscle cells, phosphocreatine acts as an ATP buffer system and replenishes ATP pools from ADP via creatine kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kuby, Noda, and Lardy 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Perry 1954</xref>). It remains to be seen whether bradyzoites possess this mechanism. We also detect elevated levels of acyl-carnitines in BPQ and MMV1028806 treated bradyzoites. These molecules act as shuttles for the mitochondrial import of fatty acids for β- oxidation. However, this pathway is deemed absent in <italic>T. gondii</italic> and the presence of acyl- carnitines in bradyzoites might reflect import from the host. It is conceivable that their elevation in response to buparvaquone and MMV1028806 indicates compromised functionality of the host <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub>-complex and subsequently accumulating β-oxidation substrates. Indeed, BPQ has a very broad activity across Apicomplexa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hudson et al. 1985</xref>) and kinetoplastids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Croft et al. 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>We investigated the functionality of the mitochondrial electron transport chain of tachyzoites and bradyzoites in response to ATQ, BPQ, and MMV1028806 by Mitotracker staining and thin section electron microscopy. All three treatments decrease overall Mitotracker fluorescence, consistent with decrease mitochondrial electron potential. ATQ and MMV1028806 but not BPQ also shrink areas of mitochondrial cross-sections indicating a potential contribution to the observed change in overall fluorescence. These differences might reflect In agreement with previous observations (Place et al. 2023), we found bradyzoite mitochondria to differ in morphology compared to tachyzoites, as they predominantly occur as “blobs” and rarely as tubes or loops and our observations align (Supplementary File 6).</p>
<p>Our metabolomic and inhibition data suggest that the mitochondrial electron transport is essential for bradyzoite survival. Previously, we showed that the mitochondrial electron transport chain inhibitor, HDQ, inhibits tachyzoite growth at low nano molar concentrations while failing to target bradyzoites. A decreased mitochondrial membrane potential in HDQ- treated bradyzoites indicates its uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Christiansen et al. 2022</xref>) and implies differences in modes of action between bradyzocidal and non-bradyzocidal Coenzyme Q analogs, which might be responsible for the distinct efficacies. A number of metabolic reactions involve the mitochondrial electron transport chain in <italic>T. gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Maclean et al. 2021</xref>). To estimate which of those are essential, we tested the requirement of mitochondrial ATP production by measuring ATP concentrations in glucose-starved bradyzoites. ATP levels collapse in the presence of bradyzocidal ATQ but not HDQ, while both compounds act cidal in tachyzoites and deplete ATP (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). This suggests that mitochondrial ATP production is tightly linked to the survival of mature bradyzoites and that HDQ does impair active but non-essential processes in bradyzoites. Interestingly, while HDQ inhibits the <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub>-complex directly in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Vallières et al. 2012</xref>), in <italic>T. gondii</italic> it blocks pyrimidine synthesis and mitochondrial NADH oxidation via DHOD and NDH2, respectively (S. S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lin, Gross, and Bohne 2009</xref>), and ATQ directly inhibits the ubiquinone reductase center of the <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub>-complex in <italic>T. gondii</italic> (McFadden et al. 2000). These results also agree with the notion that the canonical TCA cycle in bradyzoites is a non-essential source of mitochondrial reduction equivalents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Christiansen et al. 2022</xref>). The electron sources feeding into electron transport chain and the <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub>-complex in bradyzoites remain to be established and may include HDQ-insensitive glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase (complex 2) and the malate:quinone oxidoreductase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Maclean et al. 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Bradyzoites can also utilize glycolysis to generate ATP. In relatively immature, seven-day-old bradyzoites, glycolysis and mitochondria generate ATP as shown by 2-deoxyglucose and oligomycin A dependent inhibition (Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Fu et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Shukla et al. 2018</xref>). While we did not directly test the production of glycolytic ATP, the role of hexokinase on cyst formation and the remodeling of glycolytic enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Pan et al. 2022</xref>) emphasize its importance. It remains to be investigated how mature bradyzoites rely on glycolysis to produce ATP and how this is integrated with mitochondrial ATP production.</p>
<p>Interestingly, despite its profound effect on ATP levels and viability of bradyzoites, ATQ fails to eradicate all <italic>T. gondii</italic> cysts from mouse brains and does not reliably prevent toxoplasmosis relapse in AIDS patients and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Araujo, Huskinson, and Remington 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Kovacs 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ferguson et al. 1994</xref>; Katlama, Mouthon, et al. 1996). Underlying reasons for this discrepancy need to be established but may include insufficient bioavailability. Quinolones are known to be poorly soluble in aqueous environments and the predicted permeability of the blood-brain barriers to either ATQ, BPQ and HDQ is low, suggesting that insufficient exposure to the drug may play a role in treatment failure. Indeed, improved bioavailability of ATQ in nanosuspensions improved efficacies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Shubar et al. 2011</xref>). Also, BPQ treatment of mice that were experimentally infected with closely related <italic>Neospora caninum</italic> parasites did target parasites in muscle but not brain tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Müller et al. 2015</xref>). A similar conjecture arose when comparing endochin-like quinolones. Here, favorable pharmacokinetics of a variant with lower intrinsic potency likely conferred higher <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy against cysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Doggett et al. 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, our data illustrate the functional importance of the <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub>-complex for the viability of bradyzoites and encourage the pursuit of <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub>-complex inhibitors as candidates for eradicating toxoplasmosis treatment. Both, efforts to develop multi-site-directed inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Doggett et al. 2020</xref>; Alday, Nilsen, and Doggett 2022) and re-purposing of respective drugs are promising avenues. However, our data also underline the importance of favorable pharmacokinetics to ensure passage through the blood-brain barrier and the cyst wall.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors' goal was to advance the understanding of metabolic flux in the bradyzoite cyst form of the parasite T. gondii, since this is a major form of transmission of this ubiquitous parasite, but very little is understood about cyst metabolism and growth.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, this is an important advance in understanding and targeting bradyzoite growth.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study used a newly developed technique for growing T. gondii cystic parasites in a human muscle-cell myotube format, which enables culturing and analysis of cysts. This enabled the screening of a set of anti-parasitic compounds to identify those that inhibit growth in both vegetative (tachyzoite) forms and bradyzoites (cysts). Three of these compounds were used for comparative Metabolomic profiling to demonstrate differences in metabolism between the two cellular forms.</p>
<p>One of the compounds yielded a pattern consistent with targeting the mitochondrial bc1 complex and suggests a role for this complex in metabolism in the bradyzoite form, an important advance in understanding this life stage.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Studies such as these provide important insights into the overall metabolic differences between different life stages, and they also underscore the challenge of interpreting individual patterns caused by metabolic inhibitors due to the systemic level of some of the targets, so that some observed effects are indirect consequences of the inhibitor action. While the authors make a compelling argument for focusing on the role of the bc1 complex, there are some inconsistencies in the patterns that underscore the complexity of metabolic systems.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>A particular challenge in treating infections caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii is to target (and ultimately clear) the tissue cysts that persist for the lifetime of an infected individual. The study by Maus and colleagues leverages the development of a powerful in vitro culture system for the cyst-forming bradyzoite stage of Toxoplasma parasites to screen a compound library for candidate inhibitors of parasite proliferation and survival. They identify numerous inhibitors capable of inhibiting both the disease-causing tachyzoite and the cyst-forming bradyzoite stages of the parasite. To characterize the potential targets of some of these inhibitors, they undertake metabolomic analyses. The metabolic signatures from these analyses lead them to identify one compound (MMV1028806) that interferes with aspects of parasite mitochondrial metabolism. The authors claim that MV1028806 targets the bc1 complex of the mitochondrial electron transport chain of the parasite, although the evidence for this is indirect and speculative. Nevertheless, the study presents an exciting approach for identifying and characterizing much-needed inhibitors for targeting tissue cysts in these parasites.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study presents convincing proof-of-principle evidence that the myotube-based in vitro culture system for T. gondii bradyzoites can be used to screen compound libraries, enabling the identification of compounds that target the proliferation and/or survival of this stage of the parasite. The study also utilizes metabolomic approaches to characterize metabolic 'signatures' that provide clues to the potential targets of candidate inhibitors, although falls short of identifying the actual targets.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors claim to have identified a compound in their screen (MMV1028806) that targets the bc1 complex of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). The evidence they present for this claim is indirect (metabolomic signatures and changes in mitochondrial membrane potential) and could be explained by the compound targeting other components of the ETC or affecting mitochondrial biology or metabolism in other ways. In order to make the conclusion that MMV1028806 targets the bc1 complex, the authors should test specifically whether MMV1028806 inhibits bc1-complex activity (i.e. in a direct enzymatic assay for bc1 complex activity). Testing the activity of MMV1028806 against other mitochondrial dehydrogenases (e.g. dihydroorotate dehydrogenase) that feed electrons into the ETC might also provide valuable insights. The experiments the authors perform also do not directly measure whether MMV1028806 impairs ETC activity, and the authors could also test whether this compound inhibits mitochondrial O2 consumption (as would be expected for a bc1 inhibitor).</p>
<p>(2) The authors claim that compounds targeting bradyzoites have greater lipophilicity than other compounds in the library (and imply that these compounds also have greater gastrointestinal absorbability and permeability across the blood-brain barrier). While it is an attractive idea that lipophilicity influences drug targeting against bradyzoites, the effect seems pretty small and is complicated by the fact that the comparison is being made to compounds that are not active against parasites. If the authors are correct in their assertion that lipophilicity is a major determinant of bradyzoicidal compounds compared to compounds that target tachyzoites alone, you would expect that compounds that target tachyzoites alone would have lower lipophilicity than those that target bradyzoites. It would therefore make more sense to (statistically) compare the bradyzoicidal and dual-acting compounds to those that are only active in tachyzoites (visually the differences seem small in Figure S2B). This hypothesis would be better tested through a structure-activity relationship study of select compounds (which is beyond the scope of the study). Overall, the evidence the authors present that high lipophilicity is a determinant of bradyzoite targeting is not very convincing, and the authors should present their conclusions in a more cautious manner.</p>
<p>(3) Page 11 and Figure 7. The authors claim that their data indicate that ATP is produced by the mitochondria of bradyzoites &quot;independently of exogenous glucose and HDQ-target enzymes.&quot; The authors cite their previous study (Christiansen et al, 2022) as evidence that HDQ can enter bradyzoites, since HDQ causes a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. Membrane potential is linked to the synthesis of ATP via oxidative phosphorylation. If HDQ is really causing a depletion of membrane potential, is it surprising that the authors observe no decrease in ATP levels in these parasites? Testing the importance of HDQ-target enzymes using genetic approaches (e.g. gene knockout approaches) would provide better insights than the ATP measurements presented in the manuscript, although would require considerable extra work that may be beyond the scope of the study. Given that the authors' assay can't distinguish between ATP synthesized in the mitochondrion vs glycolysis, they may wish to interpret their data with greater caution.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors describe an exciting 400-drug screening using a MMV pathogen box to select compounds that effectively affect the medically important Toxoplasma parasite bradyzoite stage. This work utilises a bradyzoites culture technique that was published recently by the same group. They focused on compounds that affected directly the mitochondria electron transport chain (mETC) bc1-complex and compared them with other bc1 inhibitors described in the literature such as atovaquone and HDQs. They further provide metabolomics analysis of inhibited parasites which serves to provide support for the target and to characterise the outcome of the different inhibitors.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work is important as, until now, there are no effective drugs that clear cysts during T. gondii infection. So, the discovery of new inhibitors that are effective against this parasite stage in culture and thus have the potential to battle chronic infection is needed. The further metabolic characterization provides indirect target validation and highlights different metabolic outcomes for different inhibitors. The latter forms the basis for new studies in the field to understand the mode of inhibition and mechanism of bc1-complex function in detail.</p>
<p>The authors focused on the function of one compound, MMV1028806, that is demonstrated to have a similar metabolic outcome to burvaquone. Furthermore, the authors evaluated the importance of ATP production in tachyzoite and bradyzoites stages and under atovaquone/HDQs drugs.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although the authors did experiments to identify the metabolomic profile of the compounds and suggested bc-1 complex as the main target of MMV1028806, they did not provide experimental validation for that.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewers for taking the time to read and critically assess our manuscript.</p>
<p>We agree with the main points and they will be addressed in both writing and in additional experiments in a revised version of the paper.</p>
<p>The shared and major point of criticism are non-conclusive metabolomic data that indicate the bc1-complex in T. gondii as a MMV1028806 target tachyzoites and bradyzoites. Regarding the former, our conclusion was mainly based on both metabolite abundance changes that are observed after treatment with one bona-fide bc1-complex inhibitor atovaquone and also steady-state stable isotope incorporation patterns. While it is true that secondary effects of metabolic inhibition occur and are often dominant, isotope labelling equilibria take more time to establish and may reflect more accurately blocked metabolic reactions i.e. the primary target.</p>
<p>Regardless, we will follow the excellent suggestions to functionally assay particular mitochondrial electron transfer reactions to corroborate or revise our conclusions regarding the primary MMV1028806 target.</p>
