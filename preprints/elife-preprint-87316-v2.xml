<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Trained immunity is the long-term functional reprogramming of innate immune cells, which results in altered responses toward a secondary challenge. Despite indoxyl sulfate (IS) being a potent stimulus associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD)-related inflammation, its impact on trained immunity has not been explored. Here, we demonstrate that IS induces trained immunity in monocytes <italic>via</italic> epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming, resulting in augmented cytokine production. Mechanistically, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) contributes to IS-trained immunity by enhancing the expression of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism-related genes such as Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase (ALOX5) and ALOX5 Activating Protein (ALOX5AP). Inhibition of AhR during IS training suppresses the induction of IS-trained immunity. Monocytes from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients have increased ALOX5 expression and after 6-day training, they exhibit enhanced TNF-α and IL-6 production to LPS. Furthermore, healthy control-derived monocytes trained with uremic sera from ESRD patients exhibit increased production of TNF-α and IL-6. Consistently, IS-trained mice and their splenic myeloid cells had increased production of TNF-α after <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> LPS stimulation compared to that of control mice. These results provide insight into the role of IS in the induction of trained immunity, which is critical during inflammatory immune responses in CKD patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the last decade, a large body of evidence has demonstrated that innate cells can build up immunological memory resulting in enhanced responsiveness to subsequent stimulation, a phenomenon termed trained immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Compared with classical epitope-specific adaptive immunological memory based on an antigen-receptor, trained immunity of monocytes and macrophages is the long-term functional reprogramming elicited by an initial primary insult, mainly pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which leads to an altered response towards a subsequent, unrelated secondary insult after the return to a homeostatic state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). It has been well demonstrated that exposure of monocytes or macrophages to <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, fungal cell wall component β-glucan, or BCG (Bacille Calmette-Guérin) vaccine enhances their subsequent responses to unrelated pathogens or pathogen components such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). The induction of trained immunity is associated with the interaction of epigenetic modifications and metabolic rewiring, which can last for prolonged periods of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Mechanistically, certain metabolites derived from the upregulation of different metabolic pathways triggered by primary insult can influence enzymes involved in remodeling the epigenetic landscape of cells. This leads to specific changes in epigenetic histone markers, such as histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) or histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac), which regulate genes resulting in a more rapid and stronger response upon a subsequent, unrelated secondary insult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). In addition, it has been recently reported that long non-coding RNAs induce epigenetic reprogramming <italic>via</italic> the histone methyltransferase, MLL1. Subsequently, transcription factors such as Runx1 regulate the induction of proinflammatory cytokines following the secondary insult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>).</p>
<p>Many studies have provided evidence that trained immunity likely evolved as a beneficial process for non-specific protection from future secondary infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). However, it has also been suggested that augmented immune responses resulting from trained immunity is potentially relevant to deleterious outcomes in immune-mediated and chronic inflammatory diseases such as autoimmune diseases, allergy, and atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Thus, although most studies have focused on the ability of exogenous microbial insults to induce trained immunity, it is also conceivable that sterile inflammatory insults can evoke trained immunity. In support of this idea, oxLDL, lipoprotein a (Lpa), uric acid, hyperglycemia, and the Western diet have all been recently identified as endogenous sterile insults that induce trained immunity in human monocytes <italic>via</italic> epigenetic reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that many endogenous insults that cause chronic inflammatory conditions may be involved in the induction of trained immunity in human monocytes and macrophages.</p>
<p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is recognized as a major non-communicable disease with increasing worldwide prevalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Loss of renal function in CKD patients causes the accumulation of over 100 uremic toxins, which are closely associated with cardiovascular risk and mortality due to their ability to generate oxidative stress and a proinflammatory cytokine milieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Reflecting this, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Indoxyl sulfate (IS) is a major uremic toxin derived from dietary tryptophan <italic>via</italic> fermentation of gut microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Since it is poorly cleared by hemodialysis, IS is one of the uremic toxins present at higher than normal concentrations in the serum of CKD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>) and is associated with the progression of CKD and the development of CKD-related complications such as CVD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). We and others have shown that IS promotes the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β by monocytes and macrophages through aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling and organic anion transporting polypeptides 2B1 (OATP2B1)-Dll4-Notch Signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), suggesting a role of IS as an endogenous inflammatory insult in monocytes and macrophages. Moreover, pretreatment with IS greatly increases TNF-α production by human macrophages in response to a low dose of LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Despite the function of IS as an endogenous inflammatory insult in monocytes and macrophages, little is known with regard to whether IS induces trained immunity. Thus, we investigated whether exposure to IS triggers trained immunity in an <italic>in vitro</italic> human monocyte model and an <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse model, as well as the mechanisms involved in IS-induced trained immunity. Our data show that IS triggers trained immunity in human monocytes/macrophages <italic>via</italic> AhR-dependent alteration of the arachidonic acid (AA) pathway, epigenetic modifications, and metabolic rewiring. Thus, this suggests IS plays a critical role in the initiation of inflammatory immune responses in patients with CKD.</p>

<title>Indoxyl sulfate (IS) induces trained immunity in human monocytes</title>
<p>To explore whether exposure to IS is involved in the induction of trained immunity in human monocytes, an <italic>in vitro</italic> model of trained immunity was applied as previously reported by the Netea group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Freshly isolated human CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes were preincubated for 24 hrs with or without IS and, after a subsequent 5-day culture in human serum, restimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or Pam3cys for final 24 hrs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Preincubation of monocytes with IS led to enhanced production of TNF-α, a major monocyte/macrophage-derived inflammatory cytokine, upon LPS stimulation. Since 10 ng/ml of LPS significantly increased both TNF-α and IL-6 secretion in IS-trained macrophages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), we used this concentration of LPS in subsequent experiments. A clinically relevant concentration of IS in severe CKD has reported the range from 0.5 to 1.0 mmol/L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). The preincubation effect of IS on cytokine production was observed at a concentration as low as 250 μM, which is the average IS concentration in patients with ESRD in our cohort (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Unlike IS, preincubation with other protein-bound uremic toxins (PBUTs), such as <italic>p</italic>-cresyl sulfate (PCS), Hippuric acid (HA), Indole 3-acetic acid (IAA) and kynurenic acid (KA), did not cause increased secretion of TNF-α or IL-6 in response to LPS stimulation (Fig. S1A). In addition, there was no obvious effect on cell viability following pre-incubation of macrophages with 1,000 μM of IS after a subsequent 5-day culture in human serum or after LPS stimulation (Fig. S1B). We also found that the enhanced cytokine production of IS-trained macrophages was not attributable to potassium derived from IS potassium salt (Fig. S1C). Moreover, the increased TNF-α and IL-6 production in IS-trained macrophages was not limited to LPS stimulation, as similar phenomena were observed following stimulation with Pam3cys, a TLR1/2 agonist (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). β-glucan-pretreated macrophages exhibit a prototypic feature of trained immunity, characterized by enhanced production of inflammatory cytokines upon restimulation with heterologous stimuli, LPS or Pam3cys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). As seen in Figure S1D, the level of TNF-α secreted by IS-trained macrophages was comparable with that secreted by β-glucan-trained macrophages, although β-glucan had a more potent effect on IL-6 production than did IS, suggesting that IS plays a role in the induction of trained immunity of human monocytes. Furthermore, alongside elevated TNF-α and IL-6 expressions, there was a notable increase in the mRNA expression of <italic>IL-1β</italic> and <italic>MCP-1</italic> (<italic>CCL2</italic>) observed in IS-trained macrophages, concomitant with a significant reduction in <italic>IL-10</italic>, a cytokine known for its anti-inflammatory properties, within the same cellular context (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Correspondingly, alterations in their protein levels mirrored the observed mRNA expressions (Fig. S1E). Circulating monocytes have been identified as a major immune cell subset that responds to IS in the serum of ESRD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). To examine whether uremic serum induces trained immunity of monocytes/macrophages, pooled sera from ESRD patients (184 ± 44 μM of average IS level) or from HCs were used to treat monocytes isolated from HCs for 24 hr at 30% (v/v), followed by training for 5 days (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Training with pooled uremic serum of ESRD patients increased the production of TNF-α and IL-6 upon re-stimulation with LPS compared to monocytes treated with the pooled sera of HCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G-I</xref>). In addition, expression of <italic>IL-1β</italic> and <italic>MCP-1</italic> mRNA was also augmented by training with the pooled uremic sera of ESRD patients (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>). These results suggest that IS induces trained immunity in human monocytes, characterized by the increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 and reduced expression of anti-inflammatory IL-10 in response to secondary TLR stimulation.</p>

<title>IS-induced trained immunity is regulated by metabolic rewiring</title>
<p>Metabolic rewiring is one of the most crucial processes regulating the trained immunity of monocytes and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Assessment of the metabolic profile of IS-trained macrophages on day 6 (prior to re-stimulation with LPS) showed that training with IS led to an enhanced extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) as a measure of lactate production, indicating increased glycolysis and glycolysis capacity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A and B</xref>). Moreover, basal and maximal respiration and ATP production gauged by the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) were also increased compared to that of non-trained cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C and D</xref>). Enhanced glycolysis and glycolytic capacity in IS-trained cells remained higher even after re-stimulation with LPS (Fig. S2A-B), implying that the IS-training effect on metabolic rewiring is sustained regardless of the secondary stimulation. To further examine whether the metabolic rewiring by IS-trained cells is linked to the regulation of trained immunity, 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG), a general inhibitor of glycolysis, was added to monocytes before training with IS. 2-DG completely inhibited the augmented production of TNF-α and IL-6 in IS-trained macrophages in response to re-stimulation with LPS (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). These data demonstrate that IS-trained immunity is linked to metabolic rewiring characterized by both enhanced glycolysis and augmented oxidative respiration.</p>

<title>Epigenetic modifications control IS-induced trained immunity</title>
<p>The induction of trained immunity relies on two key, closely intertwined mechanisms, epigenetic modification and metabolic rewiring of innate immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). We next sought to determine whether increased expression of TNF-α and IL-6 is a result of epigenetic changes. To this end, chromatin modification of histone 3 trimethylation of lysine 4 (H3K4me3) at the promoter sites of <italic>TNFA</italic> and <italic>IL6</italic> was analyzed. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR data illustrate that IS-trained macrophages exhibit enhanced H3K4me3 of <italic>TNFA</italic> and <italic>IL6</italic> promoters by day 6 after treatment with 1,000 μM of IS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A and B</xref>). This reflects what was previously demonstrated in trained innate immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Moreover, IS-mediated enrichment of H3K4me3 was maintained even after secondary stimulation with LPS compared with non-trained cells (Fig. S3A-B). When IS-trained macrophages were pretreated with 5’- methylthioadenosine (MTA), a non-selective methyltransferase inhibitor, their production of TNF-α and IL-6 upon LPS stimulation was reversed to baseline (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>), implying that IS-induced trained immunity is associated with epigenetic modification. To explore the potential regulation of IS-induced epigenetic modification by metabolic rewiring, we examined the enrichment of H3K4me3 at the promoters of <italic>TNFA</italic> and <italic>IL6</italic> subsequent to treatment with 2DG (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Our findings suggest that metabolic rewiring influences epigenetic modification, implicating the participation of metabolites. Additionally, heightened enrichment of H3K4me3 at the promoter regions of <italic>HK2</italic> and <italic>PFKP</italic>, pivotal genes associated with glycolysis, was observed (Fig. S3C). To further elucidate epigenetic modifications in IS-induced trained immunity, we performed a whole-genome assessment of the histone marker H3K4me3 by ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-Seq) in IS-trained cells on day 6. Among 7,136 peaks, 59 differentially upregulated peaks and 316 downregulated peaks were detected in IS-trained cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref> and Table S1). To identify the biological processes affected in IS-mediated trained immunity, 59 upregulated peaks in IS-trained macrophages were analyzed through Gene Ontology (GO) analysis with Go biological process and the Reactome Gene Set. Activation of the innate immune response and positive regulation of the defense response were identified as major processes <italic>via</italic> Go biological process analysis. Further, genes involved in regulation of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and metabolism of polyamine were recognized as major gene sets <italic>via</italic> Reactome Gene Set analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). A genome browser snapshot showing H3K4me3 binding illustrates that H3K4me3 is elevated at the promoters of important target genes associated with activation of the innate immune response, such as <italic>IFI16</italic> (interferon-gamma inducible protein 16), <italic>XRCC5</italic> (X-ray repair cross-complementing 5), and <italic>PQBP1</italic> (polyglutamine binding protein 1) and genes linked to the regulation of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), such as <italic>PSMA1</italic> (proteasome 20S subunit alpha 1), <italic>PSMA3</italic> (proteasome 20S subunit alpha 3), and <italic>OAZ3</italic> (Ornithine Decarboxylase Antizyme 3, a protein that negatively regulates ODC activity) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Additionally, differences in H3K4me3 enrichment patterns between the IS-training group and the control group were observed in <italic>TNFA</italic> and <italic>IL6</italic> (Fig. S3D-E). Our results show that epigenetic modification of innate immune response-related genes contributes to the induction of IS-trained immunity in human monocytes.</p>

<title>AhR, a potent endogenous receptor for IS, contributes to the induction of IS-trained immunity</title>
<p>Our previous study demonstrated that IS-induced TNF-α production in macrophages is regulated through a complex mechanism involving the interaction of NF-κB and SOCS2 with AhR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). To explore the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of IS-trained immunity, we investigated the role of AhR, a potent endogenous receptor for IS. Ligand-bound activated AhR is known to be immediately translocated into the nucleus and rapidly degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Immunoblot analysis depicted in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> reveals persistent nuclear translocation of IS-mediated AhR even on day 6 (prior to re-stimulation with LPS), which was entirely inhibited by GNF351 treatment, an AhR antagonist, on day 6. Inhibition of AhR by GNF351 during IS training suppressed the increase in production of TNF-α and IL-6 following LPS restimulation on day 6 in IS-trained cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B and C</xref>), implying that IS-mediated AhR activation may be involved in trained immunity. In addition to TNF-α and IL-6, enhancement of <italic>IL-1β</italic> and <italic>MCP-1</italic> mRNA expression in IS-trained cells was also completely inhibited, whereas decreased <italic>IL-10</italic> expression was completely reversed by GNF351 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). To confirm the regulatory role of AhR in trained immunity, we tested whether 6-Formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ), a tryptophan-derived agonist of AhR, also induced trained immunity in human monocytes. FICZ-pretreated monocytes exhibited augmented expression of TNF-α and IL-6 in response to secondary stimulation with LPS compared to non-trained cells (Fig. S4A). Additionally, knockdown of AhR suppressed the expression of TNF-α and IL-6 in IS-trained cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>), underscoring the significant role of ligand-bound activated AhR in the trained immunity of human monocytes. We next examined whether inhibition of AhR with GNF351 influences epigenetic modification and metabolic rewiring. Our ChIP-qPCR assay showed that enrichment of H3K4m3 on <italic>TNFA</italic> and <italic>IL6</italic> promoters in IS-trained macrophages was inhibited by GNF351 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). Of note, assessment of the metabolic profile by measuring ECAR and OCR illustrates that GNF351 has no effect on metabolic rewiring, including enhanced glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration, in IS-trained cells on day 6 as depicted in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> (Fig. S4B-C). This finding was corroborated by the immunoblotting data, which showed GNF351 had no inhibitory effect on IS-mediated enhancement of S6K activity, which is critical for inducing the aerobic glycolysis in human monocytes/macrophages (Fig. S4D). Our findings suggest that IS-activated AhR is involved in regulating epigenetic modifications of IS-trained macrophages.</p>

<title>AhR-dependent induction of the arachidonic acid pathway is involved in IS-induced trained immunity</title>
<p>To explore which molecular mechanism is involved in the induction of IS-trained immunity, we performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) on day 6 (prior to restimulation with LPS) in IS-trained human macrophages. A total of 218 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), consisting of 71 upregulated and 147 downregulated genes, were identified in IS-trained macrophages compared to non-trained cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref> and S5A; FC ≥ ± 2, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Gene ontology (GO) analysis of these expression data using the Reactome Gene Set is displayed in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>. IS-trained macrophages had upregulated pathways including those involved in neutrophil degranulation, integrin cell surface interactions, extracellular matrix organization and arachidonic acid metabolism, whereas pathways associated with kinesins, cell cycle, and the Gα(i) signaling pathway were downregulated (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Considering the key role of the arachidonic acid (AA) pathway in many inflammatory disorders, we decided to focus on this pathway in the induction of trained immunity by IS. Our findings were supported by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using Molecular Signatures Database (MsigDB), in which genes related to AA metabolism were enriched in IS-trained macrophages compared to non-trained cells and more importantly, upregulated expression of these genes was inhibited by treatment with GNF351 as illustrated by heatmap analysis of major genes related to AA metabolism (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C and D</xref> and Fig. S5F). Among AA metabolism pathways, the leukotriene metabolic process, but not the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway, was primarily involved in the induction of IS-mediated trained immunity (Fig. S5B). Confirmatory RT-qPCR analysis on major AA metabolism-related genes was conducted using IS-trained macrophages obtained from independent, HCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). The mRNA expression of arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (<italic>ALOX5</italic>: also known as <italic>5-LOX</italic> or <italic>5-LO</italic>) and arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (<italic>ALOX5AP</italic>: also known as <italic>FLAP</italic>), the enzymes catalyzing AA into leukotrienes (a group of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>), was higher in IS-trained macrophages than non-trained cells. In addition, the mRNA expression of <italic>LTB4R1</italic> (also known as <italic>BLT1</italic>), a high-affinity receptor for leukotriene B4 (LTB4), was also upregulated. The augmented expression of these AA metabolism-related genes was repressed by GNF351 pretreatment as shown by changes in expression of <italic>CYP1B1</italic>, a typical AhR target gene. Thus, this suggests that the IS-activated AhR pathway is involved in enhanced AA-metabolism in IS-induced trained immunity. Immunoblot analysis validated the upregulation of ALOX5 and ALOX5AP expression in IS-trained immunity, which was subsequently inhibited by GNF351 at the protein level (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). Furthermore, knockdown of AhR suppressed the IS-induced mRNA expression of <italic>ALOX5, ALOX5AP,</italic> and <italic>LTB4R</italic> on day 6 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>). Treatment with FICZ, an AhR agonist known to induce trained immunity (Fig. S4A), elicited increased expression of <italic>ALOX5</italic> and <italic>ALOX5AP</italic>, while treatment with KA, a major protein-bound uremic toxin that does not induce trained immunity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), did not result in elevation of these genes, thereby implying the significant role of the AhR-AA pathway in IS-trained immunity (Fig. S5C).</p>

<p>We previously reported alterations in the transcriptome signature of <italic>ex vivo</italic> monocytes of ESRD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Comparison of the fold changes of RNA-Seq data in the present study and microarray data reported previously (GSE155326) revealed that the expression of <italic>ALOX5</italic> and <italic>LTB4R1</italic> is enhanced in IS-trained macrophages and <italic>ex vivo</italic> monocytes of ESRD patients (Fig. S5D). To further investigate the roles of the AA metabolism pathway in IS-trained immunity, zileuton, an ALOX5 inhibitor, and U75302, a BLT1 receptor inhibitor were used during the induction of trained immunity by IS (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>, S5E-F). We found that IS-induced TNF-α and IL-6 production were largely suppressed by both zileuton and U75302 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>, S5F). Additionally, knockdown of ALOX5 inhibited IS-induced expression of TNF-α and IL-6 (Fig. S5H). In further exploration of the effects on epigenetic or metabolic reprogramming <italic>via</italic> the AA pathway, we conducted ChIP-qPCR assays and Western blot analyses following treatment with zileuton. Our results demonstrated that the enrichment of H3K4me3 on <italic>TNFA</italic> and <italic>IL6</italic> promoters in IS-trained macrophages was inhibited by zileuton, although phosphorylation of S6K remained unaffected (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref> and S5I). Thus, these findings suggest that AA metabolism plays a pivotal role in the induction of IS-trained immunity by serving as a crucial mediator between AhR signaling and epigenetic modification. We next tested whether training with uremic serum leads to increased expression of AA pathway-related genes within 6 days (prior to restimulation with LPS) as found in IS-trained macrophages. The expression of <italic>ALOX5</italic>, <italic>ALOX5AP</italic>, and <italic>LTB4R1</italic> mRNA was augmented by training with pooled uremic sera of ESRD patients compared with HCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5J</xref>), and this augmented expression was maintained after re-stimulation with LPS (Fig. S5J).</p>
<p>Histone-modifying enzymes such as lysine demethylase (KDM) and lysine methyltransferase (KMT) are linked to the induction of trained immunity by remodeling the epigenetic status of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). However, RNA-Seq data of IS-trained macrophages showed no obvious change in the expression profile of major histone-modifying enzymes (Fig. S6A). In agreement with this, mRNA expression of major histone modifying enzymes including <italic>KDM5A</italic>, <italic>KDM5B</italic>, <italic>KDM5C</italic>, <italic>SETDB2</italic>, <italic>SETD7</italic>, and <italic>SETD3</italic> were not changed in IS-trained macrophages on day 6 (Fig. S6B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). Treatment with MTA, a non-selective methyltransferase inhibitor, partially inhibited expression of <italic>ALOX5</italic> and <italic>ALOX5AP</italic> mRNA (Fig. S6C), suggesting limited epigenetic regulation of the AA pathway (Fig. S6C). Ultimately, to validate the association between ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq data, we employed Spearman’s correlation for comparative analysis and conducted linear regression to ascertain the presence of a consistent global trend in RNA expression. Our findings unveiled a significant positive correlation, underscoring the consistent relationship between H3K4me3 enrichment and gene expression (Fig. S6D).</p>

<p>Subsequently, we examined the impact of IS-trained immunity on mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM). It was observed that BMDM from IS-trained mice did not exhibit heightened production of TNF-α and IL-6, and the expression level of ALOX5 in bone marrow progenitor cells remained unaltered when compared to non-trained cells, indicating that our acute IS-trained mice did not induce central trained immunity (Fig. S7D-E)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). Collectively, these findings offer compelling evidence for the involvement of IS and the induction of the AA pathway in the establishment of trained immunity in both monocytes and macrophages, both <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Together, these data provide evidence for the role of IS and the induction of the AA pathway in the establishment of trained immunity of monocytes and macrophages both <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Recent studies have reported that in addition to pathogenic stimuli, endogenous sterile inflammatory insults including ox-LDL, hyperglycemia and uric acid, also trigger trained immunity and contribute to chronic inflammation in cardiovascular diseases and gout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). In the present study, we provide evidence that IS, a major uremic toxin, provokes trained immunity in human monocytes/macrophage through epigenetic modification, metabolic rewiring, and AhR-dependent induction of the AA pathway, suggesting its important role in inflammatory immune responses in patients with CKD (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Proposed mechanism of IS-induced trained immunity.</title>
<p>IS-induced trained immunity in human monocytes is mediated by epigenetic reprogramming and metabolic rewiring <italic>via</italic> histone modification H3K4m3 and increased glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration, respectively. Direct interaction of uremic toxin IS with the AhR in human monocytes activates AhR signaling pathways that are involved in enhanced expression of the arachidonic acid metabolism-related genes ALOX5, ALOX5AP, and LTB4R1 and augmented production of TNF-α and IL-6 upon stimulation with LPS as secondary stimulus <italic>via</italic> epigenetic regulation. A pivotal role of each pathway or molecule was confirmed by <italic>in vitro</italic> assay with inhibitors including GNF351 (an AhR antagonist), zileuton (an ALOX5 inhibitor), U75302 (a BLT1 receptor inhibitor), 2DG (a glycolysis inhibitor), and MTA (a non-selective methyltransferase inhibitor). Meanwhile, the AhR-independent mechanism contributes to metabolic rewiring, such as increased glycolysis in IS-trained macrophages, which leads to enhanced proinflammatory responses upon secondary stimulation.</p></caption>

<p>CKD is associated with increased risk factors of cardiovascular disease (CVD) including traditional risk factors, such as hypertension, age and dyslipidemia, as well as non-traditional risk factors, such as oxidative stress and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Further, recent cohort studies have shown that CKD is an independent risk factor for CVD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Uremia accompanying renal failure causes immune dysfunction, which is closely linked to the pathogenesis of CKD-related CVD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). Among over 100 uremic toxins identified, IS is a prototypical protein-bound uremic toxin most likely to be participating in progressive pathophysiology of CVD including endothelial dysfunction, vascular calcification, and increased atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). Mounting evidence suggests that a prolonged hyperactivation of trained immunity is intimately related to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, the major contributor to cardiovascular diseases. Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), hyperglycemia, and the Western diet, all known to be associate with the progression of atherosclerosis, have been reported to induce trained immunity through epigenetic reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). These findings suggest that IS plays a role as a typical endogenous inflammatory insult in activating monocytes and macrophages and modulating their responses. Given that IS is difficult to clear by hemodialysis, this toxin has a chronic effect on the immune system of patients. Nonetheless, little is known about the effects of IS on trained immunity.</p>
<p>As observed using a common <italic>in vitro</italic> model of trained immunity established by Netea and other groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes, which are exposed for 24 h to the first insult with IS and rested for 5 days without IS, produced an augmented level of TNF-α and IL-6 and decreased level of IL-10 in response to an unrelated second insult with LPS or Pam3cys, which is a feature typical of trained immunity of monocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-E</xref>). In contrast to TNF-α and IL-6, major proinflammatory cytokines, IL-10 exerts potent deactivating effects on macrophages and T cells, influencing various cellular processes in inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). Additionally, it is noteworthy that IL-10-deficient macrophages exhibit an augmentation in the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Therefore, the reduced gene expression of IL-10 by IS-trained monocytes may contribute to the heightened expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Mechanistic studies have demonstrated that the induction of trained immunity is coordinated through the interplay of epigenetic modifications and metabolic rewiring, which is broadly characterized as prolonged changes in transcription programs and cell physiology that do not involve permanent genetic changes, such as the mutations and recombination events crucial for adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). In the present study, ChIP-Seq and real-time metabolic analysis show that the induction of IS-trained immunity in human monocytes is attributable to epigenetic modification and metabolic rewiring (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), trimethylation of histones at H3K4 on <italic>TNFA</italic> and <italic>IL6</italic> promoters was increased in IS-trained macrophages and maintained even after secondary stimulation with LPS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref> and Fig. S3B). Furthermore, the production of TNF-α and IL-6 upon LPS stimulation was completely inhibited by pretreatment with 5’-methylthioadenosine (MTA), a methyltransferase inhibitor (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>), demonstrating that IS-induced trained immunity is associated with epigenetic modification. Moreover, H3K4me3-ChIP-Seq data showed that IS-induced trained immunity accompanied by epigenetic reprogramming and H3K4me3 was enriched in genes related to activation of the innate immune responses as illustrated by gene ontology (GO) analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E-G</xref>).</p>
<p>We identified AhR as a critical mediator of IS-trained immunity in human monocytes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). AhR is a ligand-activated nuclear transcription factor (TF), which is activated by several exogenous compounds, such as benzo[a]pyrene environmental pollutants and 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-dibenzo-<italic>p</italic>-dioxin (TCDD), as well as by multiple endogenous ligands including tryptophan and indole metabolites(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). AhR plays a multifaceted role in modulating cellular mechanisms such as inflammation, cell growth, and antioxidant responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). AhR is expressed by various immune cells, and its signaling exerts integrative effects on the cellular environment and metabolism of the immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). However, little is known about the role of AhR in the induction of trained immunity.</p>
<p>In the present study, we show that IS-trained immune responses, characterized by the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, were attenuated by GNF351, an AhR antagonist, or through the knockdown of AhR using siRNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B-E</xref>). This inhibition was accompanied by repression of enriched H3K4me3 on <italic>TNFA</italic> and <italic>IL6</italic> promoters in IS-trained macrophages (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>), indicating an AhR-dependent mechanism. However, increased glycolysis and mitochondria respiration in IS-trained macrophages were not suppressed by the blockade of AhR activation with GNF351, suggesting the AhR activation is not directly involved in metabolic rewiring in IS-trained immunity (Fig. S4B-D).</p>
<p>Metabolic rewiring, especially upregulation of aerobic glycolysis, is known as a major mechanism underlying the induction of trained immunity <italic>via</italic> regulation of epigenetic modification by metabolites, such as mevalonate and fumarate generated from this metabolic rewiring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). Furthermore, in addition to establishing the bidirectional link between heightened glycolysis and activating histone modifications, as evidenced by the suppression of histone modification by 2DG, a glycolysis inhibitor, in IS-induced immunity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>), recent studies have demonstrated that immune priming long non-coding RNAs (IPLs) also induce epigenetic reprogramming by influencing 3D nuclear architecture(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>) and that RUNX1, a transcription factor, contributes to the induction of trained immunity by overexpression of RUNX1 target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), suggesting that a variety of mechanism is involved in epigenetic modification in trained immunity.</p>
<p>Although inducers of trained immunity, such as β-glucan, BCG, uric acid, and oxLDL, initiate intracellular signaling and metabolic pathways, each <italic>via</italic> different receptors, the most common pathway is the Akt/mTOR/HIF1α-dependent induction of aerobic glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). Our data also revealed that training with IS led to enhanced glycolysis, which is critical for the production of TNF-α and IL-6 upon LPS stimulation as confirmed by experiments with 2DG, a glycolysis inhibitor (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Recent studies have shown that IS activates mTORC1 in a variety of cells such as epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and THP-1 cells mainly <italic>via</italic> the Organic Anion Transporters (OAT)/NADPH oxidase/ROS pathway, but not the AhR pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). Our findings suggest that IS-trained macrophages acquire the characteristics of trained immunity by AhR-dependent and -independent mechanisms and enhances proinflammatory responses upon secondary stimulation. Thus, addressing the mechanism underlying AhR-independent metabolic rewiring in IS-trained macrophages will require further investigations.</p>
<p>A finding of particular interest in our study is that the induction of IS-induced trained immunity is dependent on the AhR-ALOX5/ALOX5AP axis, as depicted by RNA-Seq analysis and confirmatory <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis of mRNA and protein expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> and Fig. S5). ALOX5 and ALOX5AP are major rate-limiting enzymes associated with the arachidonic acid (AA) pathway, involved in the production of leukotrienes, proinflammatory lipid mediators derived from AA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Among leukotrienes, leukotriene B4 (LTB4), an extremely potent inflammatory mediator, binds to G protein-coupled protein, LTB4R, and enhances inflammatory responses by increased phagocytosis and activation of the signaling pathway for the production of cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Mechanistically, the LTB4-LTB4R signaling pathway induces the PI3K/Akt or NF-κB pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). AhR-dependent LTB4 production through enhanced ALOX5 expression in hepatocytes reportedly induces hepatotoxicity <italic>via</italic> neutrophil infiltration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). The increase in ALOX5 activity and LTB4 expression has been reported in patients with ESRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>) and ALOX5 mediates mitochondrial damage and apoptosis in mononuclear cells of ESRD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>). Thus, antagonists of ALOX5/ALOX5AP have been used for treatment in CKD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). Consistent with these findings, peripheral monocytes derived from ESRD patients in our cohort have increased expression of ALOX5 and this increase was maintained after differentiation into macrophages with M-CSF (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E-H</xref>). Considering that pretreatment with the uremic serum of ESRD patients elicits a change in gene expression and cytokine production as observed in IS-trained macrophages, it is likely that increased ALOX5 in monocytes and macrophages of ESRD patients is mediated by IS in uremic serum. Our previous studies have shown that IS is an important uremic toxin in the serum of ESRD patients that elicits proinflammatory responses of monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Furthermore, the AhR-ALOX5-LTB4R1 pathway is involved in IS-induced trained immunity of patients with ESRD.</p>
<p>Recent studies have demonstrated that trained immunity of macrophages is implicated in the pathogenesis of CVD, such as atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Considering a higher plasma level of IS in ESRD patients even after hemodialysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>), this is potentially difficult to reconcile with trained immunity in which there typically is a short exposure to the training stimulus followed by a period of rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). However, when ESRD monocytes exposed to the IS in the circulation enter atherosclerotic plaques and differentiate into macrophages, they are no longer exposed to IS, because this is protein-bound and hence not expected to the present in the plaque microenvironment.</p>
<p>Murine models have been widely used to investigate the specific contribution of inducers of trained immunity and the underlying mechanisms to a long-term functional modification of innate cells <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). Mice trained with β-glucan enhance the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β by monocytes and macrophages in response to secondary microbial stimuli and subsequently obtain increased protection against various microbial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). Our <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> mouse experiments for trained immunity demonstrate that IS-trained immunity has biological relevance (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6I</xref>). Previous studies have shown that intraperitoneal injection of exogenous IS into wild-type C57BL/6 mice leads to an increase of IS in the plasma until 3∼6 hr post-injection despite its rapid excretion by the kidney. In this period, the expression of pro-inflammatory, pro-oxidant, and pro-apoptotic genes in peritoneal macrophages was upregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>). Moreover, intraperitoneal injection of IS daily for 3 days elevates IS in the plasma of mice and activates the mTORC1 signaling pathway in the mouse kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). This suggests that the IS-injected mouse model is suitable for investigating the mechanisms underlying IS-mediated immune responses. Our data show increased TNF-α in serum after injection of LPS (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6J</xref>). Moreover, ALOX5 protein expression was increased in splenic myeloid cells derived from IS-trained mice and <italic>ex vivo</italic> stimulation with LPS for 24 hr induced TNF-α and IL-6 expression in these splenic myeloid cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6K-M</xref>). Thus, this suggests a systemic induction of IS-trained immunity in the mouse model.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the current study provides new insight into the role of IS as an inducer of trained immunity as well as the underlying mechanisms in human monocytes/macrophages by investigating the effect of IS <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> using experimental models of trained immunity. Here, we demonstrate that IS, a major uremic toxin, induces trained immunity characterized by the increased proinflammatory TNF-α and IL-6 in human monocytes following secondary stimulation through epigenetic modification and metabolic rewiring. IS-mediated activation of AhR is involved in the induction of trained immunity through enhanced expression of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism-related genes such as ALOX5 and ALOX5AP. Monocytes from patients with ESRD exhibit increased expression of ALOX5 and after 6-day resting, they exhibit enhanced TNF-α and IL-6 production to LPS. Furthermore, the uremic serum of ESDR patients causes HC-derived monocytes to increase the production of TNF-α and IL-6 upon LPS re-stimulation, implying IS-mediates trained immunity in patients. Supporting our <italic>in vitro</italic> findings, mice trained with IS and their splenic myeloid cells had increased production of TNF-α after <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> LPS stimulation. These results suggest that IS plays an important role in the induction of trained immunity, which is critical in inflammatory immune responses in patients with CKD and thus, it holds potential as a therapeutic target.</p>

<title>Metabolic analysis</title>
<p>To profile the metabolic state of the cells, CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes were seeded onto XFe24 cell culture plates (Seahorse Bioscience, Lexington, MA) with RPMI medium with 10% HS, followed by the induction of trained immunity for 6 days as described in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>. Metabolic analysis on IS-trained macrophages was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For the glycolysis stress test, culture media was replaced with Seahorse XF Base media supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine (pH7.4) and incubated for 1 hr in the non-CO2 incubator. Glucose (10 mM), oligomycin (2 μM), and 2-DG (50 mM, all from Sigma-Aldrich) were sequentially used to treat cells during real-time measurements of extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) using Seahorse XFe24 Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience). For the mito stress test, cells were incubated with Seahorse XF Base media supplemented with 1 mM pyruvate, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 10 mM glucose (pH7.4) for 1 hr in the non-CO2 incubator. Oligomycin (1.5 μM), FCCP (2 μM), and rotenone/antimycin A (0.5 μM, all from Sigma-Aldrich) were sequentially used to treat cells during real-time measurements of oxygen consumption rate (OCR) using the Seahorse XFe24 Analyzer. Parameters of glycolysis stress test and mito stress test were calculated using Seahorse XF glycolysis or the mito stress test report generator program that was provided by the manufacturer.</p>

<title>Immunoblot analysis</title>
<p>Total proteins were prepared using radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP-40) containing a protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Cell lysates were separated on an 8-12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), The membrane was incubated overnight at 4°C with primary Abs, such as anti-AhR, anti-ALOX5, and anti-ALOX5AP/FLAP, followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated secondary Abs for 1 h. The membranes were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system.</p>

<title>WST (Water Soluble Tetrazolium Salt) assay</title>
<p>To test cell viability, IS-trained macrophages were re-stimulated with LPS for 24 hr. Culture media was changed with serum-free RPMI medium and the WST reagent (EZ-CYTOX, DoGenBio, Seoul, Korea) followed by incubation for 1-2 h. Measurement of the optical density value (450 nm) was performed by Infinite M200 (Tecan).</p>

<title>Mouse <italic>in vivo</italic> studies</title>
    <p>For <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, C57BL/6 mice (7-8 weeks) were injected intraperitoneally with 200 mg/kg IS in 100 μl PBS daily for 5 days. Another five days after IS injection, 5 mg/kg LPS (Sigma-Aldrich) were injected intraperitoneally 75 min prior to sacrifice. Whole blood was incubated at RT for 30 min and centrifuged at 3,000 g for 10 min at 4°C to collect mouse serum. The amount of TNF-α and IL-6 in serum was quantified using commercial mouse ELISA kits (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For <italic>ex vivo</italic> experiments using splenic myeloid cells, IS-trained mice were sacrificed and their spleens were aseptically collected. Single-cell splenic suspensions were prepared in PBS after passage through a 40 mm cell strainer. Splenocytes were seeded at 1 x 10<sup>7</sup> cells/well in 12-well plates. After incubation for 1 h, adherent cells were harvested for immunoblot analysis or stimulated with 10 ng/ml LPS for 24 hr. The amount of TNF-α and IL-6 in culture supernatants was quantified using commercial mouse ELISA kits (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p>

Additional evidence proposing that IS plays a critical role in the initiation of inflammatory immune responses in patients with CKD is also interesting and a potential advance of the field. This study is in large part well done, but some components of the study are still incomplete and additional efforts are required to nail down the main conclusions.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your positive feedback.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Specific comments:</p>
<p>(1) Of greatest concern, there are concerns about the rigor of these experiments, whether the interpretation and conclusions are fully supported by the data. (1) Although many experiments have been sporadically conducted in many fields such as epigenetic, metabolic regulation, and AhR signaling, the causal relationship between each mechanism is not clear. (2) Throughout the manuscript, no distinction was made between the group treated with IS for 6 days and the group treated with the second LPS (addressed below). (3) Besides experiments using non-specific inhibitors, genetic experiments including siRNA or KO mice should be examined to strengthen and justify central suggestions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful for the invaluable constructive feedback provided.</p>
<p>(1) In response to the reviewer's feedback, we conducted additional experiments employing appropriate inhibitors to investigate the causal relationship among the AhR pathway, epigenetic modifications, and metabolic rewiring in IS-induced trained immunity. Notably, metabolic rewiring, particularly the upregulation of aerobic glycolysis via the mTORC1 signaling pathway, stands as a pivotal mechanism underlying the induction of trained immunity through the modulation of epigenetic modifications (Riksen NP et al. Figure 1). Initially, we assessed the enrichment of H3K4me3 at 6-day on promoters of TNFA and IL6 loci after treatment of zileuton, an inhibitor of ALOX5, and 2-DG, a glycolysis inhibitor. Additionally, we evaluated the alteration in the activity of S6K, a downstream molecule of mTORC1, following zileuton treatment. Our findings indicate that AhR-dependent arachidonic acid (AA) signaling induces epigenetic modifications, albeit without inducing metabolic rewiring, in IS-induced trained immunity (Author response image 1). However, IS stimulation promotes mTORC1-mediated glycolysis in an AhR-independent manner. Notably, inhibition of glycolysis with 2-DG impacts epigenetic modifications. We have updated Figure 7 of the revised manuscript to incorporate these additional experimental findings, elucidating the correlation between the diverse mechanisms implicated in IS-induced innate immune memory (Fig. 7 in the revised manuscript). These data have been integrated into the revised manuscript as Figure 3D and 5I, and supplementary Figure 5I.</p>
<p>(2) We apologize for any confusion arising from the unclear description regarding the distinction between the group treated with IS for 6 days and the group subjected to secondary lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. It is imperative to clarify that induction of trained immunity necessitates 1 day of IS stimulation followed by 5 days of rest, rendering the 6th day sample representative of a trained state. Subsequent to this, a 24-hour LPS stimulation is applied, designating the 7th day sample as a secondary LPS-stimulated cell. This clarification is now explicitly indicated throughout the entirety of Figure 1A and Figure 3A in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>(3) In accordance with your feedback, we performed siRNA knockdown of AhR and ALOX5 in primary human monocytes. AhR knockdown markedly attenuated the mRNA expression of TNF-α and IL-6, which are augmented in IS-trained macrophages. Similarly, knockdown of ALOX5 using ALOX5 siRNA abrogated the increase in TNF-α and IL-6 levels upon LPS stimulation in IS-trained macrophages (Author response image 2). Our experiments utilizing AhR siRNA corroborate the involvement of AhR in the expression of AA pathway-related molecules, such as ALOX5, ALOX5AP, and LTB4R1, in IS-induced trained immunity. These data have been incorporated into the revised manuscript as Figure 4E and 5G, and supplementary Figure 5H.</p>

<p>A-B. Monocytes were pre-treated with zileuton (ZLT), an inhibitor of ALOX5, or 2DG, a glycolysis inhibitor, followed by stimulation with IS for 24 hours. After a resting period of 5 days, the enrichment of H3K4me3 on the promoters of TNFA and IL6 loci was assessed. Normalization was performed using 2% input. C. Monocytes were pre-treated with zileuton (ZLT) and stimulated with IS for 24 hr. Cell lysates were immunoblotted for phosphorylated S6 Kinase, with β-actin serving as a normalization control.

<title>Inhibition of IS-trained immunity by knockdown of AhR or ALOX5 in human monocytes.</title>
<p>A-C. Human monocytes were transfected with siRNA targeting AhR (siAhR), ALOX5 (siALOX5), or negative control (siNC) for 1 day, followed by stimulation with IS for 24 hours. After a resting period of 5 days, cells were re-stimulated with LPS for 24 hours. mRNA expression levels of AhR and ALOX5 at 1 day after transfection, and TNF-α and IL-6 at 1 day after LPS treatment, were assessed using RT-qPCR. D. Human monocytes were transfected with AhR siRNA or negative control (NC) siRNA for 1 day, followed by stimulation with IS for 24 hours. After resting for 5 days, mRNA expression levels of ALOX5, ALOX5AP, and LTB4R1 were analyzed using RT-qPCR.

<p>(2) The authors showed that IS-trained monocytes showed no change in TNF or IL-6, but increased the expression levels of TNF and IL-6 in response to the second LPS (Fig. 1B). This suggests that the different LPS responsiveness in IS-trained monocytes caused altered gene expression of TNF and IL6. However, the authors also showed that IS-trained monocytes without LPS stimulation showed increased levels of H3K4me3 at the TNF and IL-6 loci, as well as highly elevated ECAR and OCR, leading to no changes in TNF and IL-6. Therefore, it is unclear why or how the epigenetic and metabolic states of IS-trained monocytes induce different LPS responses. For example, increased H3K4me3 in HK2 and PFKP is important for metabolic rewiring, but why increased H3K4me3 in TNF and IL6 does not affect gene expression needs to be explained.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the constructive critiques provided by the reviewer. While epigenetic modifications in the promoters of TNF-α, IL-6, HK2, and PFKP (Figure 3B and Supplementary Figure 3C in the revised manuscript), and metabolic rewiring (Figure 2A-D in the revised manuscript) were observed in IS-trained macrophages at 6 days prior to LPS stimulation, these macrophages do not exhibit an increase in TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA and protein levels before LPS stimulation. This lack of response is attributed to a 5-day resting period, allowing the macrophages to revert to a non-activated state, as depicted in Author response image 3 and 4. This phenomenon aligns with the concept of typical trained immunity.</p>
<p>Trained immunity is characterized by the long-term functional reprogramming of innate immune cells, which is evoked by various primary insults and which leads to an altered response towards a second challenge after the return to a non-activated state. Metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming events during the primary immune response persist partially even after the initial stimulus is removed. Upon a secondary challenge, trained innate immune cells exhibit a more robust and more prompt response than the initial response (Netea MG et al. Defining trained immunity and its role in health and disease. Nat Rev Immunol. 2020 Jun;20(6):375-388).</p>
<p>Numerous studies have demonstrated the observation of epigenetic modifications in the promoters of TNF-α and IL-6, and metabolic rewiring prior to LPS stimulation as a secondary challenge. However, cytokine production is contingent on LPS stimulation (Arts RJ et al. Glutaminolysis and Fumarate Accumulation Integrate Immunometabolic and Epigenetic Programs in Trained Immunity. Cell Metab. 2016 Dec 13;24(6):807-819; Arts RJW et al. Immunometabolic Pathways in BCG-Induced Trained Immunity. Cell Rep. 2016 Dec 6;17(10):2562-2571; Ochando J et al. Trained immunity - basic concepts and contributions to immunopathology. Nat Rev Nephrol. 2023 Jan;19(1):23-37). The prolonged presence of higher levels of H3K4me3 on immune gene promoters, even after returning to baseline, is associated with open chromatin and results in a more rapid and stronger response, such as cytokine production, upon a secondary insult (Netea MG et al. Defining trained immunity and its role in health and disease. Nat Rev Immunol. 2020 Jun;20(6):375-388).</p>
<p>The results in Figure 1B may be interpreted as indicating different LPS responsiveness in IStrained monocytes caused altered gene expression of TNF and IL-6. However, it is plausible that trained immune cells respond more robustly even to low concentrations of LPS. In fact, the aim of this experiment was to determine the appropriate LPS concentration.</p>

<p>(3) The authors used human monocytes cultured in human serum without growth factors such as MCSF for 5-6 days. When we consider the short lifespan of monocytes (1-3 days), the authors need to explain the validity of the experimental model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s constructive critiques. As pointed out by the reviewer, human circulating CD14+ monocytes exhibit a relatively short lifespan (1-3 days) when cultured in the absence of growth factors (Patel AA et al. The fate and lifespan of human monocyte subsets in steady state and systemic inflammation. J Exp Med. 2017 Jul 3;214(7):1913-1923). In this study, purified CD14+ monocytes were subjected to adherent culture for a duration of 7 days in RPMI1640 media supplemented with 10% human AB serum, a standard in vitro culture protocol widely employed in studies focusing on trained immunity (Domínguez-Andrés J et al. In vitro induction of trained immunity in adherent human monocytes. STAR Protoc. 2021 Feb 24;2(1):100365). In response to the reviewer's suggestions, we assessed cell viability on days 0, 1, 4, and 6, utilizing the WST assay. Despite a marginal reduction in cell viability observed at day 1, attributed to detachment from the culture plate, the cultured monocytes exhibited a notable enhancement in cell viability on days 4 and 6 when compared to days 0 or 1 (Author response image 5).</p>
<p>It has been demonstrated that the adhesion of human monocytes to a cell culture dish leads to their activation and induces the synthesis of substantial amounts of IL-1β mRNA as observed in monocytes adherent to extracellular matrix components such as fibronectin and collagen.</p>
<p>Morphologically, human adherent monocytes cultured with 10% human serum appear to undergo partial differentiation into macrophages by day 6, potentially explaining the observed lack of decrease in monocyte viability. Notably, Safi et al. have reported that adherent monocytes cultured with 10% human serum exhibit no significant difference in cell viability over a 7-day period when compared to cultures supplemented with growth factors such as M-CSF and IL-3 (Safi W et al. Differentiation of human CD14+ monocytes: an experimental investigation of the optimal culture medium and evidence of a lack of differentiation along the endothelial line.

<p>(4) The authors' ELISA results clearly showed increased levels of TNF and IL-6 proteins, but it is well established that LPS-induced gene expression of TNF and IL-6 in monocytes peaked within 1-4 hours and returned to baseline by 24 hours. Therefore, authors need to investigate gene expression at appropriate time points.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the valuable constructive feedback provided by the reviewer. As indicated by the reviewer, the LPS-induced gene expression of TNF-α and IL-6 in IS-trained monocytes exhibited a peak within the initial 1 to 4 hours, followed by a decrease by the 24-hour time point, as illustrated in Author response image 6. Nevertheless, the mRNA expression levels of TNFα and IL-6 were still elevated at the 24-hour mark. Furthermore, the protein levels of both TNFα and IL-6 apparently increased 24 hours after LPS stimulation. Due to technical constraints, sample collection had to be conducted at a single time point, and the 24-hour post-stimulation interval was deemed optimal for this purpose.</p>

<p>(5) It is a highly interesting finding that IS induces trained immunity via the AhR pathway. The authors also showed that the pretreatment of FICZ, an AhR agonist, was good enough to induce trained immunity in terms of the expression of TNF and IL-6. However, from this point of view, the authors need to discuss why trained immunity was not affected by kynurenic acid (KA), which is a well-known AhR ligand accumulated in CKD and has been reported to be involved in innate immune memory mechanisms (Fig. S1A).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the constructive criticism provided by the reviewer, and we comprehend the raised points. In our initial experiments, we hypothesized that kynurenic acid (KA), an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligand, might instigate trained immunity in monocytes, despite KA not being our primary target uremic toxin. However, our findings, as depicted in Fig. S1A, demonstrated that KA did not induce trained immunity. Notably, KA-treated monocytes exhibited induction of CYP1B1, an AhR-responsive gene, and elevated levels of TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA at 24 hours post-treatment, comparable to FICZ-treated monocytes. This observation underscores KA's role as an AhR ligand in human monocytes, as emphasized by the reviewer.</p>
<p>Of particular interest, proteins associated with the arachidonic acid pathway, such as ALOX5 and ALOX5AP - integral to the mechanisms underlying IS-induced trained immunity - did not exhibit an increase at day 6 following KA treatment, in contrast to the significant elevation observed with IS and FICZ treatments (Author response image 7). The rationale behind this disparity remains unknown, necessitating further investigation to elucidate the underlying factors. These data have been incorporated into the revised manuscript as Supplementary Figure 5C.</p>

<p>Indeed, it has been demonstrated that FICZ and TCDD, two high-affinity AhR ligands, exert opposite effects on T-cell differentiation, with TCDD inducing regulatory T cells and FICZ inducing Th17 cells. This dichotomy has been attributed to ligand-intrinsic differences in AhR activation (Ho PP et al. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor: a regulator of Th17 and Treg cell development in disease. Cell Res. 2008 Jun;18(6):605-8; Ehrlich AK et al. TCDD, FICZ, and Other High Affinity AhR Ligands Dose-Dependently Determine the Fate of CD4+ T Cell Differentiation. Toxicol Sci. 2018 Feb 1;161(2):310-320). These outcomes imply the involvement of an intricate interplay involving metabolic rewiring, epigenetic reprogramming, and the AhR-ALOX5 pathway in IS-induced trained immunity within monocytes.</p>

<p>(6) The authors need to clarify the role of IL-10 in IS-trained monocytes. IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine that can be modulated by AhR, whose expression (Fig. 1E, Fig. 4D) may explain the inflammatory cytokine expression of IS-trained monocytes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s valuable comment, recognizing its significant importance. IL-10, characterized by potent anti-inflammatory attributes, assumes a pivotal role in constraining the host immune response against pathogens. This function serves to mitigate potential harm to the host and uphold normal tissue homeostasis. In the context of atherosclerosis (Mallat Z et al. Protective role of interleukin-10 in atherosclerosis. Circ Res. 1999 Oct 15;85(8):e17-24.) and kidney disease (Wei W et al. The role of IL-10 in kidney disease. Int Immunopharmacol. 2022 Jul;108:108917), IL-10 exerts potent deactivating effects on macrophages and T cells, influencing various cellular processes that could impact the development and stability of atherosclerotic plaques. Additionally, it is noteworthy that IL-10-deficient macrophages exhibit an augmentation in the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α (Smallie T et al. IL-10 inhibits transcription elongation of the human TNF gene in primary macrophages. J Exp Med. 2010 Sep 27;207(10):2081-8; Couper KN et al. IL-10: the master regulator of immunity to infection. J Immunol. 2008 May 1;180(9):5771-7). As emphasized by the reviewer, the reduced gene expression of IL-10 by IS-trained monocytes may contribute to the heightened expression of proinflammatory cytokines. We have thoroughly addressed and discussed this specific point in response to the reviewer's comment (Line 394-399 of page 18 in the revised manuscript).</p>

<p>(9) Interpretation of ChIP-seq results is not entirely convincing due to doubts about the quality of sequencing results. First, authors need to provide information on the quality of ChIP-seq data in reliable criteria such as Encode Pipeline. It should also provide representative tracks of H3K4me3 in the TNF and IL-6 genes (Fig. 2F). And in Fig. 2F, the author showed the H3K4me3 track of replicates, but the results between replicates were very different, so there are concerns about reproducibility. Finally, the authors need to show the correlation between ChIP-seq (Fig. 2) and RNA-seq (Fig. 5).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the constructive criticism provided by the reviewer.</p>
<p>As indicated by the reviewer, for evaluation of sample read quality, analysis was performed using the histone ChIP-seq standard from the ENCODE project, focusing on metrics such as read depth, PCR bottleneck coefficient (PBC)1, PBC2, and non-redundant fraction (NRF). Five of the total samples were displayed moderate bottleneck levels (0.5 ≤ PBC1 &lt; 0.8, 1 ≤ PBC2 &lt; 3) with acceptable (0.5 ≤ NRF &lt; 0.8) complexity. One sample showed mild bottlenecks (0.8 ≤ PBC1 &lt; 0.9, 3 ≤ PBC2 &lt; 10) with compliance (0.8 ≤ NRF &lt; 0.9) complexity. This quality metrics indicated ChIP-seq data quality meets at least the standards required for downstream analysis according to ENCODE project criteria (Author response image 10A).</p>
<p>To examine the differences in H3K4me3 enrichment patterns between two groups, we normalized the read counts around the TSS ±2 kb of human genes to CPM. Sequentially, we compared the average values of IS-treated macrophage compare to control and displayed in waterfall plots. In addition, we marked genes of interest in red including the phenotypes of IStrained macrophages (TNF and IL6), the activation of the innate immune responses (XRCC5, IFI16, PQBP1), and the regulation of ornithine decarboxylase (OAZ3, PSMA3, PSMA1) (Author response image 10B and C). Also, H3K4me3 peak tracks of TNF and IL6 loci and H3K4me3 enrichment pattern were added in supplementary Figure 3D and 3F in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Next, to evaluate the consistency among replicates within a group, we analyzed enrichment values, expressed as Counts per Million (CPM) using edgeR R-package, by applying Spearman's correlation coefficients. we analyzed two sets included total 7,136 H3K4me3 peak sets, as described in Figure 3E in the revised manuscript and 2 kbp around transcription start sites (TSS) from hg19 human genomes. The resulting Spearman's correlation coefficients and associated P-values demonstrated a concordance between replicates, confirming reproducibility and consistent performance (Author response image 10D).</p>
<p>Finally, the correlation between gene expression and H3K4me3 enrichment around transcription start sites (TSS) has been reported in previous research (Reshetnikov VV et al. Data of correlation analysis between the density of H3K4me3 in promoters of genes and gene expression: Data from RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analyses of the murine prefrontal cortex. Data Brief. 2020 Oct 2;33:106365). To verify this association in our study, we applied Spearman's correlation for comparative analysis and conducted linear regression to determine if a consistent global trend in RNA expression existed. In our analysis, count values from regions extending 2 kbp around the TSSs in H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data were converted to Counts per Million (CPM) using edgeR R-package. These were then contrasted with the Transcripts Per Million (TPM) values of genes. Our results revealed a significant positive correlation, reinforcing the consistent relationship between H3K4me3 enrichment and gene expression (Author response image 10E and Supplementary Fig. 6D in revised manuscripts).</p>

<p>We appreciate the constructive feedback from the reviewer. In response to the reviewer's suggestions, we investigated the nuclear translocation of AhR on 6 days after the induction of ISmediated trained immunity, as illustrated in Author response image 11. For this purpose, the lysate from IS-trained monocytes was fractionated into the nucleus and cytosol, and AhR protein was subsequently immunoblotted. The results depicted in Figure X demonstrate that IS-trained monocytes exhibited a higher level of AhR protein in the nucleus compared to non-trained monocytes. Notably, the nuclear translocation of AhR was significantly attenuated in IS-trained monocytes treated with GNF351. These findings imply that the activation of AhR, facilitated by the binding of IS, persisted partially up to 6 days, indicating that IS-mediated degradation of AhR was not fully recovered even on day 6 after the induction of IS training. Consequently, we have replaced Figure 4A in the revised manuscript.</p>

Despite the limited number of samples, our analysis revealed a nonsignificant correlation between IS concentration and ALOX5 expression; however, it demonstrated a positive trend (Author response image 13A). Subsequently, we examined the potential inhibitory effects of zileuton, an ALOX5 inhibitor, on the production of TNF-α and IL-6 in LPSstimulated splenic myeloid cells derived from IS-trained mice. Our findings indicate that zileuton significantly inhibits the production of TNF-α and IL-6 induced by LPS in splenic myeloid cells from IS-trained mice (Author response image 13B).

<p>However, the manuscript needs to be improved by fixing the following concerns.</p>
<p>There are concerns:</p>
<p>(1) The experiments in Figs. 1G, 1H and 1I need to have AhR siRNA, and siRNA control to demonstrate that the results in uremic toxins-containing serum-treated experiments were related to IS;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We extend our gratitude to the reviewer for their invaluable comment, acknowledging its significant relevance to our study. In accordance with the reviewer's suggestion, we endeavored to conduct additional experiments utilizing AhR siRNA to elucidate the direct impact of IS present in the serum of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on the induction of IS-mediated trained immunity.</p>
<p>Regrettably, owing to limitations in the availability of monocytes post-siRNA transfection, we were unable to establish a direct relationship between the observed outcomes in experiments utilizing uremic toxins-containing serum and IS in AhR siRNA knockdown monocytes. However, treatment with GNF351, an AhR antagonist, resulted in the inhibition of TNF-α production in trained monocytes exposed to uremic toxins-containing serum (Author response image 14).</p>
<p>In our previous studies, we have already reported that uremic serum-induced TNF-α production in human monocytes is dependent on the AhR pathway, using GNF351 (Kim HY et al. Indoxyl sulfate (IS)-mediated immune dysfunction provokes endothelial damage in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Sci Rep. 2017 Jun 8;7(1):3057). Additionally, we have provided evidence demonstrating an augmentation in the activity of the AhR pathway within monocytes derived from ESRD patients, indicative of a significant reduction in AhR protein levels (Kim HY et al. Indoxyl sulfate-induced TNF-α is regulated by crosstalk between the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, NF-κB, and SOCS2 in human macrophages. FASEB J. 2019 Oct;33(10):10844-10858). It is noteworthy that other major protein-bound uremic toxins (PBUTs), such as PCS, HA, IAA, and KA, failed to induce trained immunity in human monocytes (Supplementary Figure 1A in the revised manuscript). Nevertheless, knockdown of AhR via siRNA effectively impeded the induction of IS-mediated trained immunity in human monocytes (Figure 4E in the revised manuscript).</p>
<p>Taken collectively, our findings suggest a critical role for IS present in the serum of ESRD patients in the induction of trained immunity in human monocytes.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s constructive criticism and fully understood the reviewer's points. In response to the reviewer's feedback, we conducted additional experiments employing appropriate inhibitors to elucidate the interrelation between bioenergetic metabolism and H3K4me3 and between bioenergetic metabolism and ALOX5. Initially, we assessed the enrichment of H3K4me3 at 6-day on promoters of TNFA and IL6 loci after treatment of 2-DG, a glycolysis inhibitor. Additionally, we evaluated the alteration in the activity of S6K, a downstream molecule of mTORC1, following treatment with zileuton, an inhibitor of ALOX5. Our findings indicate that AhR-dependent arachidonic acid (AA) signaling induces epigenetic modifications, albeit without inducing metabolic rewiring, in IS-induced trained immunity (Author response image 15). However, IS stimulation promotes mTORC1-mediated glycolysis in an AhR-independent manner. Notably, inhibition of glycolysis with 2-DG impacts epigenetic modifications. We have updated Figure 7 of the revised manuscript to incorporate these additional experimental findings, elucidating the correlation between the diverse mechanisms implicated in IS-induced innate immune memory (Fig. 7 in the revised manuscript).</p>

<p>(5) It was unclear whether histone acetylations such as H3K27acetylation and H3K14 acetylation are involved in IS-induced epigenetic reprogramming or IS-induced trained immunity is highly histone methylation-specific.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the constructive comment provided by the reviewer. As highlighted by the reviewer, alterations in epigenetic histone markers, specifically H3K4me3 or H3K27ac, have been recognized as the underlying molecular mechanism in trained immunity. Due to limitations in the availability of trained cells, this study primarily focused on histone methylation. In response to the reviewer's inquiry, we briefly investigated the impact of histone acetylation using C646, a histone acetyltransferase inhibitor, on IS-induced trained immunity (Author response image 16). Our experiments revealed that C646 treatment effectively hinders the production of TNF-α and IL-6 by IS-trained monocytes in response to LPS stimulation, comparable to the effects observed with MTA (5’methylthioadenosine), a non-selective methyltransferase inhibitor. This suggests that histone acetylation also contributes to the epigenetic modifications associated with IS-induced trained immunity. We sincerely appreciate the valuable input from the reviewer.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The manuscript entitled, &quot;Uremic toxin indoxyl sulfate induces trained immunity via the AhRdependent arachidonic acid pathway in ESRD&quot; demonstrates that indoxyl sulfate (IS) induces trained immunity in monocytes via epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming, resulting in augmented cytokine production. The authors conducted well-designed experiments to show that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) contributes to IS-trained immunity by enhancing the expression of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism-related genes such as arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5) and ALOX5 activating protein (ALOX5AP). Overall, this is a very interesting study that highlights that IS mediated trained immunity may have deleterious outcomes in augmented immune responses to the secondary insult in ESRD. Key findings would help to understand accelerated inflammation in CKD or RSRD.</p>

<p>This reviewer, however, has the following concerns.</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>(1) Figure 1B: IS is known to induce the expression of TNF-a and IL-6. This reviewer wonders why these molecules were not detected in the IS (+) LPS (-) condition.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the constructive comment provided by the reviewer. In our prior investigation, it was observed that the expression of TNF-α and IL-6 was induced 24 hours after IS treatment in human monocytes and macrophages (Couper KN et al. IL-10: the master regulator of immunity to infection. J Immunol. 2008 May 1;180(9):5771-7). In adherence to the trained immunity protocol, the medium was replaced at the 24 hours post-IS treatment to eliminate IS, with a subsequent change after a 5-day resting period. Probably, TNF-α and IL-6 are accumulated and detected in the IS (+) LPS (-) culture supernatant if the media was not changed at these specific time points. Our primary objective, however, was to ascertain the role of IS in the induction of trained immunity, prompting an investigation into whether IS contributes to an increase in the production of TNF-α and IL-6 in response to LPS stimulation as a secondary insult.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) 1' stimulus is IS followed by 2' stimulus LPS/Pam3. It would be interesting to know what the immune profile is when other uremic toxin is used for secondary insult, this would be more relevant in clinical context of ESRD.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer's insightful comment is greatly appreciated. To address their feedback, IStrained macrophages were subjected to additional stimulation using protein-bound uremic toxins (PBUTs) as a secondary challenge. As illustrated in Letter figure 17, the examined uremic toxins, namely p-cresyl sulfate (PCS), Hippuric acid (HA), Indole 3-acetic acid (IAA), and kynurenic acid (KA), failed to elicit the production of proinflammatory cytokines, specifically TNF-α and IL-6, by IS-trained monocytes.</p>

<p>(3) The authors need to explain a rationale why RNA and protein data used different markers.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the constructive input provided by the reviewer. Given that TNF-α and IL6 represent prototypical cytokines synthesized by trained monocytes in humans, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of their mRNA and protein levels. In human macrophages, the release of active IL-1β necessitates a second priming event, such as the presence of ATP. Consequently, we posited that assessing the mRNA levels of IL-1β would suffice to demonstrate the induction of trained immunity in our experimental protocol. Nevertheless, in response to the reviewer's comment, we proceeded to assess the protein levels of IL-1β, IL-10, and MCP-1 as illustrated in Author response image 189. These data have been incorporated into the revised manuscript as supplementary Figure 1E.</p>

<p>(4) Epigenetic modification primarily involves histone modification and DNA methylation. The authors presented convincing data on histone modification (Figure 2), but did not provide any insights in the promoter DNA methylation status.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We express our gratitude to the reviewer for providing valuable comments, which highlight a crucial aspect of our study. Despite the well-established primary role of DNA methylation in epigenetic modifications, recent suggestions propose that histone modifications, particularly H3K4me3 or H3K27ac, play a predominant role in the induction of trained immunity. In this context, our primary inquiry was focused on determining whether IS, as an endogenous insult, induces trained immunity in monocytes, and if so, whether IS-trained immunity is mediated through metabolic and epigenetic modifications - recognized as the major mechanisms underlying the generation of trained immunity. It is imperative to note that our study's primary objective did not encompass the identification of various epigenetic changes. In response to the reviewer's inquiry, we conducted a brief examination of the impact of DNA methylation using ZdCyd (5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine), a DNA methylation inhibitor, on IS-induced trained immunity. Our experimental findings indicate that ZdCyd treatment exerts no discernible effect on the production of TNF-α and IL-6 by IS-trained monocytes upon stimulation with LPS, as illustrated in Author response image 19. However, a recent study has shed light on the role of DNA methylation in BCG vaccine-induced trained immunity in human monocytes (Bannister S et al. Neonatal BCG vaccination is associated with a long-term DNA methylation signature in circulating monocytes. Sci Adv. 2022 Aug 5;8(31):eabn4002). Consequently, further investigations utilizing DNA methylation sequencing are warranted to elucidate whether DNA methylation is implicated in the induction of IS-trained immunity.</p>

<p>We express our gratitude to the reviewer for providing valuable comments, which underscore a noteworthy observation. In the current investigation, our primary emphasis has been on glycolytic reprogramming, recognized as a principal mechanism for inducing trained immunity in monocytes. This focus stems from preliminary experiments wherein Fluvastatin, a cholesterol synthesis inhibitor, demonstrated no discernible impact on TNF-α production by IS-trained monocytes, as illustrated in Author response image 20. Intriguingly, Fluvastatin treatment exhibited a partial inhibitory effect on the production of IL-6 by IS-trained monocytes.

<p>(6) Trained immunity involves neutrophils in addition to monocyte/macrophages. It is evident from the RNAseq data that neutrophil degranulation (Figure 5B) is the top enriched pathway. This reviewer wonders why the authors did not perform any assays on neutrophils.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for valuable comment. IS represents a major uremic toxin that accumulates in the serum of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), correlating with CKD progression and the onset of CKD-related complications, including cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Our prior investigations have demonstrated that IS promotes the production of TNF-α and IL-1β by human monocytes and macrophages. Additionally, macrophages pre-treated with IS exhibit a significant augmentation in TNF-α production when exposed to a low dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Considering the pivotal role of proinflammatory macrophages and TNF-α, a principal cardiotoxic cytokine, in CVD pathogenesis, our focus in this study has primarily focused on elucidating the trained immunity of monocytes/macrophages. Consequently, all experiments were meticulously conducted using highly purified monocytes and monocytederived macrophages derived from both healthy controls and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. The reviewer's observation regarding the potential involvement of neutrophils in trained immunity has been duly noted. Subsequent investigations will be imperative to explore the conceivable role of IS-trained neutrophils in the pathogenesis of CVD. Once again, we appreciate the reviewer for their valuable comment.</p>

<p>(8) In vivo data (Figure 6 I-M): Instead of serum profile and whole set of spleen myeloid cells, it would be interesting to see changes of markers on peritoneal macrophages or bone marrow-derived macrophages since the in vitro findings are on monocyte-derived macrophages.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate comment and the insightful suggestion provided by the reviewer. In response to the reviewer's feedback, we conducted additional in vivo experiments to examine the production of TNF-α and IL-6 in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) derived from IStrained mice. Upon LPS stimulation, we observed an increase in the production of TNF-α and IL-6 in spleen myeloid cells from IS-trained mice. However, no such increase in these cytokines was noted in BMDMs derived from the same mice (Author response image 22, A and B). In fact, we already observed that that the expression of ALOX5 was not elevated in BM cells derived from IS-trained mice presented in Figure 6L and M of the original manuscript (Author response image 22C).</p>
<p>Recent studies have indicated that trained immunity can be induced in circulating immune cells, such as monocytes or resident macrophages (peripheral trained immunity), as well as in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) within the bone marrow (central trained immunity) (Kaufmann E et al. BCG Educates Hematopoietic Stem Cells to Generate Protective Innate Immunity against Tuberculosis. Cell. 2018 Jan 11;172(1-2):176-190.e19; Riksen NP et al. Trained immunity in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Nat Rev Cardiol. 2023 Dec;20(12):799-811). It is plausible that central trained immunity in BM progenitor cells may not be elicited in our mouse model, which is relatively acute in nature. Further investigations are warranted to explore the role of IS in inducing central trained immunity, utilizing appropriate chronic disease models.</p>
<p>We have included this additional data as supplementary figures in the revised manuscript (Suppl. Fig. 7, D and E, and line 355-362 of page 16 in the revised manuscript).</p>
