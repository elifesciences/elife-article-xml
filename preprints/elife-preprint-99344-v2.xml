<title>Abstract</title><p>Dihydroceramide desaturases convert dihydroceramides to ceramides, the precursors of all complex sphingolipids. Reduction of DEGS1 dihydroceramide desaturase function causes pediatric neurodegenerative disorder hypomyelinating leukodystrophy-18 (HLD-18). We discovered that <italic>infertile crescent (ifc)</italic>, the <italic>Drosophila DEGS1</italic> homolog, is expressed primarily in glial cells to promote CNS development by guarding against neurodegeneration. Loss of <italic>ifc</italic> causes massive dihydroceramide accumulation and severe morphological defects in cortex glia, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) expansion, failure of neuronal ensheathment, and lipid droplet depletion. RNAi knockdown of the upstream ceramide synthase <italic>schlank</italic> in glia of <italic>ifc</italic> mutants rescues ER expansion, suggesting dihydroceramide accumulation in the ER drives this phenotype. RNAi knockdown of <italic>ifc</italic> in glia but not neurons drives neuronal cell death, suggesting that <italic>ifc</italic> function in glia promotes neuronal survival. Our work identifies glia as the primary site of disease progression in HLD-18 and may inform on juvenile forms of ALS, which also feature elevated dihydroceramide levels.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sphingolipids are key structural and functional components of the cell membrane in all eukaryotic cells and are enriched in glial cells, such as oligodendrocytes, where they comprise up to 30% of all membrane lipids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> All complex sphingolipids, like glycosylsphingolipids and sphingomyelin, derive from ceramide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> In the <italic>de novo</italic> ceramide biosynthesis pathway, dihydroceramide desaturases, such as DEGS1, produce ceramide from dihydroceramide by catalyzing the formation of a <italic>trans</italic> double bond between carbons 4 and 5 of the sphingoid backbone, which enhances conformational plasticity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> In humans, bi-allelic mutations in <italic>DEGS1</italic> cause hypomyelinating leukodystrophy-18 (HLD-18), a progressive, often fatal pediatric neurodegenerative disease marked by cerebral atrophy, white matter reduction, and hypomyelination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> The primary neural cell type impacted by loss of <italic>DEGS1</italic> function and the cell biology of how disruption of ceramide synthesis leads to neurodegeneration remain unknown.</p>
<p>The <italic>de novo</italic> ceramide biosynthetic pathway is well conserved among higher metazoans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> <italic>De novo</italic> ceramide synthesis occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and starts with the rate-limiting activity of the serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) complex, which condenses serine and palmitoyl-CoA (lauoryl-CoA in flies) to form 3-Ketosphinganine, which is converted to sphinganine by 3-Ketosphinganine reductase. Ceramide synthases condense sphinganine with acyl-CoA to generate dihydroceramide, which is converted to ceramide by dihydroceramide desaturases. Ceramide is then efficiently transported by the specific ceramide transporter CERT from the ER to the Golgi,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> where it undergoes headgroup modifications to produce complex sphingolipids that eventually translocate to the plasma membrane.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> Mutations in most members of the SPT complex, ceramide synthases, and DEGS1 lead to neurodegeneration,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> identifying the <italic>de novo</italic> ceramide biosynthesis pathway as a hotspot for neurodegenerative disease mutations.</p>
<p>Consistent with its central role in ceramide biogenesis, reduction or loss of <italic>DEGS1</italic> function in human patients or cell lines, mice, zebrafish, and flies drive dihydroceramide accumulation and ceramide depletion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> HLD-18 patients display reduced myelin sheath thickness in peripheral nerves, and knockdown of <italic>DEGS1</italic> function in zebrafish reduces the number of myelin basic protein-positive oligodendrocytes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> suggesting <italic>DEGS1</italic> regulates Schwann cell and oligodendrocyte development. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, genetic ablation of <italic>infertile crescent</italic> (<italic>ifc</italic>), the fly <italic>DEGS1</italic> ortholog, drives activity-dependent photoreceptor degeneration,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> suggesting that <italic>ifc</italic> function is crucial for neuronal homeostasis. In addition, forced expression of a wildtype <italic>ifc</italic> transgene in neurons, glia, or muscles was shown to rescue the <italic>ifc</italic> mutant phenotype.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> Whether <italic>ifc/DEGS1</italic> acts primarily in glia, neurons, or other cells to regulate nervous system development then remains to be determined.</p>
<p>Research on <italic>DEGS1</italic> points to dihydroceramide accumulation as the driver of nervous system defects caused by <italic>DEGS1</italic> deficiency. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of ceramide synthase function, which should reduce dihydroceramide levels, suppresses the observed reduction of MBP-positive oligodendrocytes in zebrafish and the activity-dependent photoreceptor degeneration in flies triggered by reduction of <italic>DEGS1/ifc</italic> function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> Dihydroceramide accumulation may also contribute to other neurodegenerative diseases, as gain of function mutations in components of the SPT complex cause juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis due to elevated sphingolipid biosynthesis, with dihydroceramides showing the greatest relative increase of all sphingolipids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> How dihydroceramide accumulation alters the cell biology of neurons, glia, or both to trigger myelination defects and neurodegeneration is unclear.</p>
<p>With its vast genetic toolkit, <italic>Drosophila</italic> is a powerful system in which to dissect the genes and pathways that regulate glial development and function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> In flies, six morphologically and functionally distinct glial subtypes regulate nervous system development and homeostasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> The surface perineurial and subperineurial glia act as physiochemical barriers to protect the nervous system and control metabolite exchange with the hemolymph, carrying out a similar function as the human blood-brain-barrier.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> Residing between the surface glia and the neuropil, cortex glia ensheathe the cell bodies of neuroblasts and neurons in the CNS in protective, nutritive, honeycomb-like membrane sheaths. Ensheathing glia define the boundary of the neuropil and insulate axons, dendrites, and synapses from neuronal cell bodies in the CNS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> Astrocyte-like glia extend fine membrane protrusions that infiltrate the neuropil and form a meshwork of cellular processes that ensheathe synapses and regulate synaptic homeostasis in the CNS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> In the PNS, wrapping glia reside internally to the surface glia and insulate axons in the PNS to enhance neuronal signaling and provide energy support.</p>
<p>Using the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model, we found that <italic>ifc</italic> acts primarily in glia to regulate CNS development with its loss disrupting glial morphology. Our work supports a model in which inappropriate accumulation and retention of dihydroceramide in the ER drives ER expansion, glial swelling, and the failure of glia to enwrap neurons, ultimately leading to neuronal degeneration as a secondary consequence of glial dysfunction. Given the conserved nature of <italic>de novo</italic> ceramide biosynthesis, our findings likely illuminate the exact mechanism through which elevated dihydroceramide levels drive neuronal degeneration and cell death in flies and humans.</p>

<title><italic>ifc</italic> contributes to the regulation developmental timing and CNS structure</title>
<p>In an EMS-based genetic screen, we uncovered three non-complementing mutations that when homozygous or trans-heterozygous to each other resulted in identical phenotypes, including a 3-day or greater delay in reaching the late-third larval instar stage, reduced brain size, progressive ventral nerve cord elongation, axonal swelling, and lethality at the late larval or early pupal stage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>; data not shown).

Sanger sequencing also uncovered a missense mutation, E241K, in the molecularly uncharacterized <italic>ifc<sup>1</sup></italic> allele (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). All four mutations reside in the fatty acid desaturase domain, the hotspot for mutations in human <italic>DEGS1</italic> that cause HLD-18 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B-Bâ</xref>).</p>

<p>As a prior study reported that a CRISPR-generated, gene-specific deletion of <italic>ifc, ifc-KO,</italic> resulted in early larval lethality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, we first confirmed the genetic nature of our <italic>ifc</italic> alleles because they caused late larval-early pupal lethality. Complementation crosses of each <italic>ifc</italic> allele against a deficiency of the region (Df(2L)BSC184) and <italic>ifc-KO</italic> revealed that all combinations, including larvae trans-heterozygous for <italic>ifc-KO</italic> over Df(2L)BSC184, survived to the late larval-early pupal stage and yielded phenotypes identical to those detailed above for the newly uncovered <italic>ifc</italic> alleles. Flies homozygous for <italic>ifc-KO</italic>, however, died as early larvae. Further analysis uncovered second site mutation(s) in the 21E2 chromosomal region responsible for the early lethal phenotype of the <italic>ifc-KO</italic> chromosome (see Methods). When uncoupled from these mutation(s), larvae homozygous for the âcleanâ <italic>ifc-KO</italic> chromosome developed to the late larval-early pupal stage and manifested phenotypes identical to the other <italic>ifc</italic> alleles. This analysis defined the correct lethal phase for <italic>ifc</italic> and identified our <italic>ifc</italic> alleles as strong loss of function mutations.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Loss of <italic>ifc</italic> function drives ceramide depletion and dihydroceramide accumulation</title>
<p>As <italic>ifc/DEGS1</italic> converts dihydroceramide to ceramide, we used untargeted lipidomics on whole larvae and the isolated CNS from wild-type and <italic>ifc-KO/ifc<sup>JS3</sup></italic> larvae (hereafter termed <italic>ifc<sup>-/-</sup></italic> larvae) to assess the effect of loss of <italic>ifc</italic> function on metabolites in the ceramide pathway (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Loss of <italic>ifc</italic> function resulted in a near complete loss of ceramides and a commensurate increase in dihydroceramides in the CNS and whole larvae (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1E</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1</xref>). Sphinganine, the metabolite directly upstream of dihydroceramide, also exhibited a significant increase in its levels in the absence of <italic>ifc</italic> function, while metabolites further upstream were unchanged in abundance or undetectable (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1E</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1</xref>). Ceramide derivatives like sphingosine, CPE, and Glucosyl-Ceramide (Glc-Cer), were reduced in levels and replaced by their cognate dihydroceramide forms (e.g., Glc-DiCer) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1E</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1</xref>). Loss of the enzymatic function of Ifc then drives dihydroceramide accumulation and ceramide loss.</p>

<title><italic>ifc</italic> governs glial morphology and survival</title>
<p>To connect this metabolic profile to a cellular phenotype, we assayed <italic>ifc</italic> function in the CNS. We leveraged the expression of fatty acid binding protein (FABP) as a marker of cortex glia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> and that of the <italic>M{3xP3-RFP.attP}</italic> phi-C31 âlanding padâ transgene, which resided in the isogenic target chromosome of our screen, as a marker of most glia (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figures S2</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3</xref>). In addition, we labeled neuroblasts with Deadpan (Dpn), neurons with ELAV, and axons with N-Cadherin (NCad). In <italic>ifc</italic><sup>-/-</sup> larvae, we observed a clear reduction in Dpn-positive neuroblasts in the optic lobe, swelling of glia in peripheral nerves, enhanced RFP expression in the CNS, and the presence of large swollen, cortex glia identified by RFP labeling and fatty acid binding protein (FABP) expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1F</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4</xref>, and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5</xref>). In wild-type larvae, cortex glia display compact cell bodies and fully enwrap individual neuronal cell bodies with their membrane sheaths (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1F</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> In <italic>ifc</italic><sup>-/-</sup> larvae, cortex glia display swollen cell bodies, fail to fully enwrap neuronal cell bodies, displace neurons from their regular arrangement, and appear to contain brightly fluorescent RFP-positive aggregates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1F</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6</xref>). <italic>ifc</italic> is then necessary for glial development and function in the larval nervous system. We observed identical CNS phenotypes in larvae homozygous mutant for the <italic>ifc<sup>js1</sup></italic>and <italic>ifc<sup>js2</sup></italic> alleles (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7</xref>).</p>
<p>To track the impact of <italic>ifc</italic> on glial morphology, we combined GAL4 lines specific for each glial subtype with a UAS-linked membrane-tagged GFP transgene (Myr-GFP) and the MultiColor FlpOut system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> Using this approach, we determined that loss of <italic>ifc</italic> function affects all CNS glial subtypes except perineurial glia (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2E-Eâ</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2J-Jâ</xref>). Cortex glia appeared swollen, failed to enwrap neurons, and accumulated large amounts of Myr-GFP<sup>+</sup> internal membranes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A-Aâ</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2F-Fâ</xref>). Ensheathing glia (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B-Bâ</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2G-Gâ</xref>) and subperineurial glia (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2D-Dâ</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2I-Iâ</xref>) also displayed swollen, disorganized cell bodies and accumulated Myr-GFP<sup>+</sup> internal membranes. Astrocyte-like glia displayed smaller cell bodies, reduced membrane extensions, and disrupted organization along the dorsal ventral nerve cord (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C-Câ</xref>). We conclude that <italic>ifc</italic> regulates the morphology of most glial subtypes in the larval CNS.</p>

<p>Next, we asked if loss of <italic>ifc</italic> function alters the number of each glial subtype. Using the same glial subtype-specific GAL4 lines to drive a nuclear-localized GFP transgene, we counted the total number of all CNS glial subtypes, except perineurial glia, in wild type and <italic>ifc<sup>-/-</sup></italic> larvae. To remove the small size of the brain in <italic>ifc<sup>-/-</sup></italic> larvae as a confounding factor, we focused our analysis on the ventral nerve cord. The number of subperineurial glia was unchanged between the two genotypes, but we observed a 12%, 40%, and 72% reduction in the number of astrocyte-like, ensheathing, and cortex glia, respectively, in <italic>ifc</italic><sup>-/-</sup> larvae relative to wild-type (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2K-N</xref>). Our data reveal a broad role for <italic>ifc</italic> in regulating glial cell morphology and number in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval CNS.

<p>To complement our RNAi approach, we asked if GAL4-driven expression of a wild-type <italic>Drosophila ifc</italic> or human <italic>DEGS1</italic> transgene rescued the <italic>ifc<sup>-/-</sup></italic> CNS phenotype. In the absence of a GAL4 driver, the <italic>ifc</italic> transgene drove weak rescue of the cortex glia phenotype (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3E</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3K</xref>), consistent with modest GAL4-independent transgene expression reported for UAS-linked transgenes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> Pan-neuronal expression of <italic>ifc</italic> drove modest rescue of the <italic>ifc</italic> CNS phenotype beyond that observed for the <italic>ifc</italic> transgene alone (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3F</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3K</xref>), but pan-glial expression of <italic>ifc</italic> fully rescued the <italic>ifc</italic> mutant cortex glia phenotype and other CNS phenotypes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3H, 3K</xref>, and <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">S9</xref>). Identical experiments using the human <italic>DEGS1</italic> transgene revealed that only pan-glial <italic>DEGS1</italic> expression provided rescuing activity, albeit at much weaker levels than the <italic>Drosophila ifc</italic> transgene (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3G, 3I</xref>, and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3K</xref>). Pan-glial expression of the <italic>Drosophila ifc</italic> transgene was, in fact, â¼15-fold more potent than the human <italic>DEGS1</italic> transgene at rescuing the <italic>ifc</italic> lethal phenotype to adulthood: When <italic>ifc</italic> was expressed in all glia, 57.9% of otherwise <italic>ifc</italic> mutant flies survived to adulthood (n=2452), but when <italic>ifc</italic> was replaced by <italic>DEGS1</italic> only 3.9% of otherwise <italic>ifc</italic> mutant flies reached adulthood (n=1303). No <italic>ifc</italic> mutant larvae reached adulthood in the absence of either transgene (n=1030). We infer that <italic>ifc</italic> acts primarily in glia to govern CNS development and that human <italic>DEGS1</italic> can partially substitute for <italic>ifc</italic> function in flies despite a difference in the preferred length of the sphingoid backbone in flies versus mammals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Results of our gene rescue experiments conflict with a prior study on <italic>ifc</italic> in which expression of <italic>ifc</italic> in neurons was found to rescue the <italic>ifc</italic> phenotype.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> In this context, we note that <italic>elav-GAL4</italic> drives UAS-linked transgene expression not just in neurons, but also in glia at appreciable levels,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> and thus needs to be paired with <italic>repo-GAL80</italic> to restrict GAL4-mediated gene expression to neurons. Thus, âoff-targetâ expression in glial cells may account for the discrepant results. It is, however, more difficult to reconcile how neuronal or glial expression of <italic>ifc</italic> would rescue the observed lethality of the <italic>ifc-KO</italic> chromosome given the presence additional lethal mutations in the 21E2 region of the second chromosome.</p>

<title>Reduction of dihydroceramide synthesis suppresses the <italic>ifc</italic> CNS phenotype</title>
<p>Following its synthesis, ceramide is transported by CERT from the ER to the Golgi, but CERT is less efficient at transporting dihydroceramide than ceramide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> The expanded nature of the ER in <italic>ifc</italic> mutant larvae supports a model in which loss of <italic>ifc</italic> triggers excessive accumulation and retention of dihydroceramide in the ER due to CERTâs inefficiency of transporting dihydroceramide to the Golgi, driving ER expansion and glial swelling.

<title>Glial-specific depletion of <italic>ifc</italic> function triggers neuronal cell death</title>
<p>Loss of <italic>DEGS1/ifc</italic> in human and flies has been shown to promote neurodegeneration and neuronal cell death,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> but whether neuronal death results from an intrinsic defect in neurons or is induced by glial dysfunction remains unclear. By using Cleaved caspase-3 as a marker of dying cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> and ELAV to track neurons, we tracked neuronal cell death in the brain and ventral nerve cord of wild-type and <italic>ifc<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mutant late-third instar larvae. In wildtype, little to no cell death was evident in the brain or nerve cord and neurons appear smoothly packed next to each other; in contrast, in <italic>ifc<sup>-/-</sup></italic> larvae, significant cell death was apparent in the brain and to a lesser degree in the nerve cord, with Caspase-3 staining often highlighting small perforations in the neuronal cell layer (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7G-H, 7P</xref>, and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">S7</xref>). This perforated pattern was associated with and more expansive than Caspase-3 staining, indicating the perforations mark Caspase-positive dying neurons and Caspase-negative dead neurons. Glial-specific depletion of <italic>schlank</italic> function in otherwise <italic>ifc<sup>-/-</sup></italic> larvae suppressed the neuronal cell death phenotype (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7I</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7P</xref>), supporting the model that loss of <italic>ifc</italic> function specifically in glia, rather than a specific requirement for <italic>ifc</italic> function in neurons, drives neuronal cell death. To directly test whether <italic>ifc</italic> function in glia is required to guard against neuronal cell death, we used the GAL4-UAS system and RNAi mediated gene interference to deplete <italic>ifc</italic> function specifically in glia (<italic>repo-GAL4</italic>) or in neurons (<italic>elav-GAL4; repo-GAL80</italic>) and found that glial-specific, but not neuronal-specific, depletion of <italic>ifc</italic> function drove significant neuronal cell death in the brain and to a greater extent the nerve cord, a phenotype that was enhanced upon removal of one copy of <italic>ifc</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7J-L, 7Q</xref>, and <xref rid="figs13" ref-type="fig">S13</xref>). Loss of <italic>ifc</italic> function then triggers glial dysfunction, which in turn drives neuronal cell death.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our work on <italic>ifc</italic> supports a model in which loss of <italic>ifc/DEGS1</italic> function drives glial dysfunction through the accumulation and inappropriate retention of dihydroceramide in the ER of glia with this proximal defect driving ER expansion, glial swelling, and subsequent neuronal cell death and neurodegeneration. A large increase in dihydroceramide would also impact ER membrane structure: ER membranes are typically loosely packed, thin, semi-fluid structures, with sphingolipids comprising just 3% of ER phospholipids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> Sphingolipids in general and dihydroceramide in specific are highly saturated lipids, promote lipid order, tighter lipid packing, membrane rigidity, and thicker membranes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> Our observation of thick ER membranes in cortex glia in <italic>ifc</italic><sup>-/-</sup> larvae (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>) aligns with increased dihydroceramide levels in the ER. In this context, we note that of many clinical observations made on an HLD-18 patient, one was widening of the ER in Schwann cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> a finding that when combined with our work suggests that dihydroceramide accumulation in the ER is the proximal cause of HLD-18.</p>
<p>Although ER expansion represents the most proximal effect of loss of <italic>ifc/DEGS1</italic> function and dihydroceramide accumulation on cortex glia, other organelles and their functions are likely also disrupted, minimally as a consequence of ER disruption. For example, the apparent reduction of the lysosome marker, LAMP, in cortex glia of <italic>ifc</italic> mutant larvae correlates with increased RFP levels and the presence of bright RFP puncta or aggregates in this cell type, suggesting impaired lysosome function contributes to increased RFP perdurance and aggregation. Defects in the activity of multiple organelles may collaborate to elicit the full phenotype manifested by loss of <italic>ifc/DEGS1</italic> function, resulting in glial dysfunction and subsequent neuronal cell death.</p>
<p>Increased dihydroceramide levels may contribute to a broader spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases than simply HLD-18. Recent work reveals that gain of function mutations in <italic>SPTLC1</italic> and <italic>SPTLC2</italic>, which encode components of the SPT complex that catalyzes the initial, rate limiting step of <italic>de novo</italic> ceramide and sphingolipid biosynthesis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> cause juvenile ALS via increased sphingolipid biosynthesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> Of all sphingolipids, the relative levels of dihydroceramide were increased the most in patient plasma samples, suggesting that DEGS1 activity becomes limiting in the presence of enhanced SPT activity and that dihydroceramide accumulation contributes to juvenile ALS. Any mutations that increase metabolite flux through the ceramide pathway upstream of DEGS1 may then increase dihydroceramide levels, drive ER expansion and cell swelling, and lead to neurodegeneration, with disease severity predicated on the extent of excessive dihydroceramide accumulation. Model systems, like flies, can harness the power of genetic modifier screens to identify genes and pathways (potential therapeutic targets), that can be tweaked to ameliorate the effect of elevated dihydroceramide levels on neurodegeneration.</p>
<p>Our work appears to pinpoint glia as the cell type impacted by loss of <italic>ifc/DEGS1</italic> function, specifically glia that exhibit great demand for membrane biogenesis like cortex glia in the fly and oligodendrocytes or Schwann cells in mammals. In larvae, <italic>ifc</italic> is expressed at higher levels in glial cells than in neurons, and its genetic function is required at a greater level in glia than neurons to govern CNS development. Our unpublished work on other genes in the ceramide metabolic pathway reveals similar glial-centric expression patterns in the larval CNS to that observed for <italic>ifc</italic>, suggesting they too function primarily in glia rather than neurons at this stage. In support of this model, a study on CPES, which converts ceramide into CPE, the fly analog of sphingomyelin, revealed that CPES is required in cortex glia to promote their morphology and homeostasis and to protect flies from photosensitive epilepsy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> Similarly, ORMDL, a dedicated negative regulator of the SPT complex, is required in oligodendrocytes to maintain proper myelination in mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> Given that many glial cell types are enriched in sphingolipids and exhibit a great demand for new membrane biogenesis during phases of rapid neurogenesis and axonogenesis, we believe that glial cells, such as cortex glia, oligodendrocytes, and Schwann cells, rather than neurons manifest a greater need for <italic>ifc/DEGS1</italic> function and ceramide synthesis during developmental stages marked by significant nervous system growth.</p>
<p>Will this glial-centric model for <italic>ifc/DEGS1</italic> function, and more generally ceramide synthesis, hold true in the adult when neurogenesis is largely complete and the demand for new membrane synthesis in glia dissipates? Recent work in the adult fly eye suggests it may not. Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup> argued that the GlcT enzyme, which converts ceramide to glucosylceramide, is expressed at much higher levels in neurons than glia, and that glucosylceramide is then transported from neurons to glial cells for its degradation, suggesting cell-type specific compartmentalization of sphingolipid synthesis in neurons and its degradation in glia in the adult. In the future, it will be exciting to uncover whether genes of the sphingolipid metabolic pathway alter their cell-type specific requirements as a function of developmental stage.</p>
<p>We note that cortex glia are the major phagocytic cell of the CNS and phagocytose neurons targeted for apoptosis as part of the normal developmental process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> Thus, while we favor the model that <italic>ifc</italic> triggers neuronal cell death due to glial dysfunction, it is also possible that increased detection of dying neurons arises due at least in part to a decreased ability of cortex glia to clear dying neurons from the CNS. At present, the large number of neurons that undergo developmentally programmed cell death combined with the significant disruption to brain and ventral nerve cord morphology caused by loss of <italic>ifc</italic> function render this question difficult to address. Additional evidence does, however, support the idea that loss of <italic>ifc</italic> function drives excess neuronal cell death: Clonal analysis in the fly eye reveals that loss of <italic>ifc</italic> drives photoreceptor neuron degeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, indicating that loss of <italic>ifc</italic> function drives neuronal cell death; cortex-glia specific depletion of <italic>CPES</italic>, which acts downstream of <italic>ifc</italic>, disrupts neuronal function and induces photosensitive epilepsy in flies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>, indicating that genes in the ceramide pathway can act non-autonomously in glia to regulate neuronal function; recent genetic studies reveal that other glial cells can compensate for impaired cortex glial cell function by phagocytosing dying neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>, and we observe that the cell membranes of subperineurial glia enwrap dying neurons in <italic>ifc</italic> mutant larvae (Fig. S14), consistent with similar compensation occurring in this background, and in humans, loss of function mutations in <italic>DEGS1</italic> cause neurodegeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> Clearly, future work is required to address this question for <italic>ifc/DEGS1</italic> and perhaps other members of the ceramide biogenesis pathway.</p>
<p>Altered glial function may not only derive from dihydroceramide buildup in the ER, but also from altered cell membrane structure due to the replacement of ceramide and its derivates, such as GlcCer and CPE, with the cognate forms of dihydroceramide. Relative to dihydroceramide species, the 4-5 <italic>trans</italic> carbon-carbon double bond in the sphingoid backbone of ceramide-containing sphingolipids enables them to form more stable hydrogen bonds with water molecules and facilitates their ability to associate with lipids of different saturation levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> A high dihydroceramide to ceramide ratio has been shown to form rigid gel-like domains within model membranes and to destabilize biological membranes by promoting their permeabilization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup> As even minor alterations to membrane properties can disrupt glial morphology,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup> such alterations in membrane rigidity and stability may underlie the failure of cortex glia to enwrap adjacent neurons. The observed increase in saturation of PE, PC, and PS in the CNS of <italic>ifc</italic> mutant larvae may reflect a compensatory response employed by cells to stabilize cell membranes and guard cell integrity when challenged with elevated levels of dihydroceramide.</p>
<p>The expansion of ER membranes coupled with loss of lipid droplets in <italic>ifc</italic> mutant larvae suggests that the apparent demand for increased membrane phospholipid synthesis may drive lipid droplet depletion, as lipid droplet catabolism can release free fatty acids to serve as substrates for lipid synthesis. At some point, the depletion of lipid droplets, and perhaps free fatty acids as well, would be expected to exhaust the ability of cortex glia to produce additional membrane phospholipids required for fully enwrapping neuronal cell bodies. Under wild-type conditions, many lipid droplets are present in cortex glia during the rapid phase of neurogenesis that occurs in larvae. During this phase, lipid droplets likely support the ability of cortex glia to generate large quantities of membrane lipids to drive membrane growth needed to ensheath newly born neurons. Supporting this idea, lipid droplets disappear in the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> CNS when neurogenesis is complete and cortex glia remodeling stops.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> We speculate that lipid droplet loss in <italic>ifc</italic> mutant larvae contributes to the inability of cortex glia to enwrap neuronal cell bodies. Prior work on lipid droplets in flies has focused on stress-induced lipid droplets generated in glia and their protective or deleterious roles in the nervous system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup> Work in mice and humans has found that more lipid droplets are often associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup> but our work correlates lipid droplet loss with CNS defects. In the future, it will be important to determine how lipid droplets impact nervous system development and disease.</p>

<p>Gene expression analysis was performed essentially as described in Patel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup> Briefly, the larval CNS was dissected in PBS, fixed in 2.5% paraformaldehyde for 55 minutes, and washed in PTx (1xPBS, 0.1% TritonX-100. The fixed CNS was incubated in primary antibody with gentle rocking overnight at 4Â°C. Secondary antibody staining was conducted for at least two hours to overnight at room temperature. All samples were washed in PTx at least five times and rocked for an hour before and after secondary antibody staining. A detailed list of the primary and secondary antibodies is available in Supplemental Table 2. Dissected CNS were mounted either in PTx or dehydrated through an ethanol series and cleared in xylenes prior to mounting in DPX mountant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup> All imaging was performed on a Zeiss LSM-700 Confocal Microscope, using Zen software.</p>
<p>For lipid droplet staining, the fixed CNS was incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature at 1:200 dilution of 1mg/mL BODIPYâ¢ 493/503 (Invitrogen: D3922). It was then rinsed thoroughly in PBS and immediately mounted for imaging on a Zeiss LSM-700 Confocal Microscope, using Zen software.</p>

<title>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging</title>
<p>For transmission electron microscopy (TEM), samples were immersion fixed overnight at 4Â°C in a solution containing 2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.15 M cacodylate buffer with 2 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4. Samples were then rinsed in cacodylate buffer 3 times for 10 minutes each and subjected to a secondary fixation for one hour in 2% osmium tetroxide/1.5% potassium ferrocyanide in cacodylate buffer. Following this, samples were rinsed in ultrapure water 3 times for 10 minutes each and stained overnight in an aqueous solution of 1% uranyl acetate at 4Â°C. After staining was complete, samples were washed in ultrapure water 3 times for 10 minutes each, dehydrated in a graded acetone series (50%, 70%, 90%, 100% x4) for 15 minutes in each step, and infiltrated with microwave assistance (Pelco BioWave Pro, Redding, CA) into Spurrâs resin. Samples were then cured in an oven at 60Â°C for 72 hours and post-curing, 70 nm thin sections were cut from the resin block, post-stained with uranyl acetate and Satoâs lead and imaged on a Transmission Electron Microscope (JEOL JEM-1400 Plus, Tokyo, Japan) operating at 120 KeV.</p>

<title>Lipidomics</title>
<p>Untargeted lipidomics analysis was conducted on whole larva and dissected CNS of wild type and <italic>ifc<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants at the late-third instar stage. Five replicates were prepared for each set of experiments. For whole larvae, at least 15 larvae of each genotype were used for each replicate. For the dissected CNS, at least 50 wild type and 60 <italic>ifc</italic><sup>-/-</sup> CNS were used per replicate. Immediately following collection or dissection, larvae and the dissected CNS were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and placed at â80Â°C.</p>
<p>Lipids were extracted from frozen whole larvae and dissected larval CNS samples by using an Omni Bead Ruptor Elite Homogenizer using acetonitrile:methanol:water (2:2:1; 40 Î¼L/mg tissue). Two Ultrahigh performance LC-(UHPLC)/MS systems were used in this work: a Thermo Vanquish Flex UHPLC system with a Thermo Scientific Orbitrap ID-X and an Agilent 1290 Infinity II UPLC system with an Agilent 6545 QTOF as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup> Lipids were separated on a Waters Acquity HSS T3 column (150 x 2.1 mm, 1.8 mm). The mobile-phase solvents were composed of A: 0.1% formic acid, 10 mM ammonium formate, 2.5 Î¼M medronic acid in 60:40 acetonitrile:water; and B = 0.1% formic acid, 10 mM ammonium formate in 90:10 2-propanol:acetonitrile. The column compartment was maintained at 60 Â°C. The following linear gradient was applied at a flow rate of 0.25 mL min-1: 0 â 2 min, 30% B; 17 min, 75% B; 20 min, 85% B; 23 â 26 min, 100% B.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Zhu et al., investigate the cellular defects in glia as a result of loss in DEGS1/ifc encoding the dihydroceramide desaturase. Using the strength of Drosophila and its vast genetic toolkit, they find that DEGS1/ifc is mainly expressed in glia and it's loss leads to profound neurodegeneration. This supports a role for DEGS1 in the developing larval brain as it safeguards proper CNS development. Loss of DEGS1/ifc leads to dihydroceramide accumulation in the CNS and induces alteration in the morphology of glial subtypes and a reduction in glial number. Cortex and ensheathing glia appeared swollen and accumulated internal membranes. Astrocyte-glia on the other hand displayed small cell bodies, reduced membrane extension and disrupted organization in the dorsal ventral nerve cord. They also found that DEGS1/ifc localizes primarily to the ER. Interestingly, the authors observed that loss of DEGS1/ifc drives ER expansion and reduced TGs and lipid droplet numbers. No effect on PC and PE and a slight increase in PS.</p>
<p>The conclusions of this paper are well supported by the data.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is an interesting study that provides new insight into the role of ceramide metabolism in neurodegeneration.</p>
<p>The strength of the paper is the generation of LOF lines, the insertion of transgenes and the use of the UAS-GAL4/GAL80 system to assess the cell-autonomous effect of DEGS1/ifc loss in neurons and different glial subtypes during CNS development.</p>
<p>The imaging, immunofluorescence staining and EM of the larval brain and the use of the optical lobe and the nerve cord as a readout are very robust and nicely done.</p>
<p>Drosophila is a difficult model to perform core biochemistry and lipidomics, but the authors used the whole larvae and CNS to uncover global changes in mRNA levels related to lipogenesis and the unfolded protein responses, as well as specific lipid alterations upon DEGS1/ifc loss.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>No major weaknesses identified.</p>
<p>Minor point: The authors performed lipidomics and RTqPCR on whole larvae and larval CNS which does not inform of any cell type-specific effects. Performing single-cell RNAseq on larval brains to tease apart the cell-type specific effect of DEGS1/ifc loss would be interesting to explore the future, but beyond the scope of the current study.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Zhu et al. describes phenotypes associated with the loss of the gene ifc using a Drosophila model. The authors suggest their findings are relevant to understanding the molecular underpinnings of a neurodegenerative disorder, HLD-18, which is caused by mutations in the human ortholog of ifc, DEGS1.</p>
<p>The work begins with the authors describing the role for ifc during fly larval brain development, demonstrating its function in regulating developmental timing, brain size, and ventral nerve cord elongation. Further mechanistic examination revealed that loss of ifc leads to depleted cellular ceramide levels as well as dihydroceramide accumulation, eventually causing defects in ER morphology and function. Importantly, the authors showed that ifc is predominantly expressed in glia and is critical for maintaining appropriate glial cell numbers and morphology. Many of the key phenotypes caused by the loss of fly ifc can be rescued by overexpression of human DEGS1 in glia, demonstrating the conserved nature of these proteins as well as the pathways they regulate. Interestingly, the authors discovered that the loss of lipid droplet formation in ifc mutant larvae within the cortex glia, presumably driving the deficits in glial wrapping around axons and subsequent neurodegeneration, potentially shedding light on mechanisms of HLD-18 and related disorders.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, the manuscript is thorough in its analysis of ifc function and mechanism. The data images are high quality, the experiments are well controlled, and the writing is clear. There are, however, some concerns that need to be addressed prior to publication.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors adequately addressed the previously indicated weaknesses, and no new weaknesses have been identified.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors report three novel ifc alleles: ifc[js1], ifc[js2], and ifc[js3]. ifc[js1] and ifc[js2] encode missense mutations, V276D and G257S, respectively. ifc[js3] encodes a nonsense mutation, W162*. These alleles exhibit multiple phenotypes, including delayed progression to the late-third larval instar stage, reduced brain size, elongation of the ventral nerve cord, axonal swelling, and lethality during late larval or early pupal stages.</p>
<p>Further characterization of these alleles the authors reveals that ifc is predominantly expressed in glia and localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The expression of ifc gene governs glial morphology and survival. Expression of fly ifc cDNA or human DEGS1 cDNA specifically in glia, but not neurons, rescues the CNS phenotypes of ifc mutants, indicating a crucial role for ifc in glial cells and its evolutionary conservation. Loss of ifc results in ER expansion and loss of lipid droplets in cortex glia. Additionally, loss of ifc leads to ceramide depletion and accumulation of dihydroceramide. Moreover, it increases the saturation levels of triacylglycerols and membrane phospholipids. Finally, the reduction of dihydroceramide synthesis suppresses the CNS phenotypes associated with ifc mutations, indicating the key role of dihydroceramide in causing ifc LOF defects.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This manuscript unveils several intriguing and novel phenotypes of ifc loss-of-function in glia. The experiments are meticulously planned and executed, with the data strongly supporting their conclusions.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p><bold>Summary</bold>: Zhu et al., investigate the cellular defects in glia as a result of loss in DEGS1/ifc encoding the dihydroceramide desaturase. Using the strength of Drosophila and its vast genetic toolkit, they find that DEGS1/ifc is mainly expressed in glia and its loss leads to profound neurodegeneration. This supports a role for DEGS1 in the developing larval brain as it safeguards proper CNS development. Loss of DEGS1/ifc leads to dihydroceramide accumulation in the CNS and induces alteration in the morphology of glial subtypes and a reduction in glial number.

They also found that DEGS1/ifc localizes primarily to the ER. Interestingly, the authors observed that loss of DEGS1/ifc drives ER expansion and reduced TGs and lipid droplet numbers. No effect on PC and PE and a slight increase in PS.</p>
<p>The conclusions of this paper are well supported by the data. The study could be further strengthened by a few additional controls and/or analyses.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is an interesting study that provides new insight into the role of ceramide metabolism in neurodegeneration.</p>
<p>The strength of the paper is the generation of LOF lines, the insertion of transgenes and the use of the UAS-GAL4/GAL80 system to assess the cell-autonomous effect of DEGS1/ifc loss in neurons and different glial subtypes during CNS development.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors performed lipidomics and RTqPCR on whole larvae and larval CNS from which it is impossible to define the cell type-specific effects. Ideally, this could be further supported by performing single cell RNAseq on larval brains to tease apart the cell-type specific effect of DEGS1/ifc loss.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that using scRNAseq or pairing FACS-sorting of individual glial subtypes with bulk RNAseq would help tease apart the cell-type specific effects of DEGS1/ifc loss on glial cells. At this time, however, this approach extends beyond the scope of the current paper and means of the lab.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) It's clear from the data that the accumulation of dihydroceramide in the ER triggers ER expansion but it remains unclear how or why this happens. Additionally, the authors assume that, because of the reduction in LD numbers, that the source of fatty acids comes from the LDs. But there is no data testing this directly.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As CERT, the protein that transports ceramide from the ER to the Golgi, is far more efficient at transporting ceramide than dihydroceramide, we speculate that dihydroceramide accumulates in the ER due to inefficient transport from the ER to the Golgi by CERT. We state this model more explicitly in the results under the subheading âReduction of dihydroceramide synthesis suppresses the ifc CNS phenotypeâ.</p>
<p>We agree with the point on lipid droplet. We observe a correlation, not a causation, between reduction of lipid droplets and a large expansion of ER membrane. We have tried to clarify the text in the last paragraph of the discussion to make this point more clearly. See also response to reviewer 2 point 3.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors performed a beautiful EMS screen identifying several LOF alleles in <italic>ifc</italic>. However, the authors decided to only use KO/ifcJS3. The paper could be strengthened if the authors could replicate some of the key findings in additional fly lines.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree. We replicated the observed cortex glia swelling, ER expansion in cortex glia, and observed increase in neuronal cell death markers in late-third instar larvae mutant for either the ifcjs1 or ifcjs2 allele. These data are now provided as Supplementary Figure 7.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors use M{3xP3-RFP.attP}ZH-51D transgene as a general glial marker. However, it would be advised to show the % overlap between the glial marker and the RFP since a lot of cells are green positive but not per se RFP positive and vice versa.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We visually reexamined the expression of the 3xP3 RFP transgene relative to FABP labeling for cortex glia, Ebony for astrocyte-like glia, and the Myr-GFP transgene driven by glial-subtype specific GAL4 driver lines for perineurial, subperineurial, and ensheathing glia. We note that RFP localizes to the nucleus cytoplasm while FABP and Ebony localize to the cytoplasm and Myr-GFP to the cell membrane. Thus, an observed lack of overlap of expression between RFP and the other markers can arise to differential localization of the two markers in the same cells (see, for example, Fig. S2D where Myr-GFP expression in the nuclear envelope encircles that of RFP in the nucleus. Through visual inspection of five larval-brain complexes for each glial subtype marker, we found that essentially all cortex, SPG, and ensheathing glia expressed RFP. Similarly, nearly all astrocyte-like glia also expressed RFP, but they expressed RFP at significantly lower levels than that observed for cortex, SPG, or ensheathing glia. This analysis also confirmed that most perineurial glia do not express RFP. The 3xP3 M{3xP3-RFP.attP}ZH-51D transgene then labels most glia in the Drosophila CNS. We have added text to Supplementary Figure 2 noting the above observations as to which glial cells express RFP.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The authors indicate that other 3xP3 RFP and GFP transgenes at other genomic locations also label most glia in the CNS. Do they have a preferential overlap with the different glial subtypes?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We assessed three different types of 3xP3 RFP and GFP transgenes: M{3xP3RFP.attp} transgenes (n=4), Mi{GFP[E.3xP3]=ET1} transgenes (n=3), and</p>
<p>Tl{GFP[3xP3.cLa]=CRIMIC.TG4} transgenes (n&gt;6). All labeled cortex glia, but different lines exhibited differential labeling of astrocyte and ensheathing glia. These data are now included as Supplementary Figure 3_._</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Zhu et al. describes phenotypes associated with the loss of the gene ifc using a Drosophila model. The authors suggest their findings are relevant to understanding the molecular underpinnings of a neurodegenerative disorder, HLD-18, which is caused by mutations in the human ortholog of ifc, DEGS1.</p>
<p>The work begins with the authors describing the role for ifc during fly larval brain development, demonstrating its function in regulating developmental timing, brain size, and ventral nerve cord elongation. Further mechanistic examination revealed that loss of ifc leads to depleted cellular ceramide levels as well as dihydroceramide accumulation, eventually causing defects in ER morphology and function. Importantly, the authors showed that ifc is predominantly expressed in glia and is critical for maintaining appropriate glial cell numbers and morphology. Many of the key phenotypes caused by the loss of fly ifc can be rescued by overexpression of human DEGS1 in glia, demonstrating the conserved nature of these proteins as well as the pathways they regulate. Interestingly, the authors discovered that the loss of lipid droplet formation in ifc mutant larvae within the cortex glia, presumably driving the deficits in glial wrapping around axons and subsequent neurodegeneration, potentially shedding light on mechanisms of HLD-18 and related disorders.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, the manuscript is thorough in its analysis of ifc function and mechanism. The data images are high quality, the experiments are well controlled, and the writing is clear.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors clearly demonstrated a reduction in number of glia in the larval brains of ifc mutant flies. What remains unclear is whether ifc loss leads to glial apoptosis or a failure for glia to proliferate during development. The authors should distinguish between these two hypotheses using apoptotic markers and cell proliferation markers in glia.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To address this point, we used phospho-histone H3 to assess mitotic index in the thoracic CNS of wild-type versus ifc mutant late third instar larvae and found a mild, but significant reduction in mitotic index in ifc mutant relative to wild-type nerve cords. We also assessed the ability of glial-specific expression of the potent anti-apoptotic gene p35 to rescue the observed loss of cortex glia phenotype in the thoracic region of the CNS of otherwise ifc mutant larvae and observed a clear increase in cortex glia in the presence versus the absence of glial-specific p35 expression (p&lt;3 x 10-4). These data are now provided as Supplementary Figure S8 in the paper and referred to on page 8.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) It is surprising that human DEGS1 expression in glia rescues the noted phenotypes despite the different preference for sphingoid backbone between flies and mammals. Though human DEGS1 rescued the glial phenotypes described, can animal lethality be rescued by glial expression of human DEGS1? Are there longer-term effects of loss of ifc that cannot be compensated by the overexpression of human DEGS1 in glia (age-dependent neurodegeneration, etc.)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We note explicitly that while glial expression of human DEGS1 does provide rescuing activity, it only partially rescues the ifc mutant CNS phenotype in contrast to glial expression of Drosophila ifc, which fully rescues this phenotype. Thus, the relative activity of human DEGS1 is far below that of Drosophila ifc when assayed in flies. To quantify the functional difference between the two transgenes, we assessed the ability of glial expression of fly ifc or of human DEGS1 to rescue the lethality of otherwise ifc mutant larvae: Glial expression of ifc was sufficient to rescue the adult viability of 57.9% of ifc mutant flies based on expected Mendelian ratios (n=2452), whereas glial expression of DEGS1 was sufficient to rescue just 3.9% of ifc mutant flies (n=1303), uncovering a ~15-fold difference in the ability of the two transgenes to rescue the lethality of otherwise ifc mutant flies. In the absence of either transgene, no ifc mutant larvae reached adulthood (n=1030). These data are now provided in the text on page 9 of the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The mechanistic link between the loss of ifc and lipid droplet defects is missing. How do defects in ceramide metabolism alter triglyceride utilization and storage? While the author's argument that the loss of lipid droplets in larval glia will lead to defects in neuronal ensheathment, a discussion of how this is linked to ceramides needs to be added.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have revised the text to address this point. We speculate that the apparent increased demand for membrane phospholipid synthesis may drive the depletion of lipid droplets, providing a link to ifc function and ceramides. Below we provide the rewritten last paragraph; the underlined section is the new text.</p>
<p>âThe expansion of ER membranes coupled with loss of lipid droplets in ifc mutant larvae suggests that the apparent demand for increased membrane phospholipid synthesis may drive lipid droplet depletion, as lipid droplet catabolism can release free fatty acids to serve as substrates for lipid synthesis. At some point, the depletion of lipid droplets, and perhaps free fatty acids as well, would be expected to exhaust the ability of cortex glia to produce additional membrane phospholipids required for fully enwrapping neuronal cell bodies. Under wild-type conditions, many lipid droplets are present in cortex glia during the rapid phase of neurogenesis that occurs in larvae. During this phase, lipid droplets likely support the ability of cortex glia to generate large quantities of membrane lipids to drive membrane growth needed to ensheathe newly born neurons. Supporting this idea, lipid droplets disappear in the adult Drosophila CNS when neurogenesis is complete and cortex glia remodeling stops. We speculate that lipid droplet loss in ifc mutant larvae contributes to the inability of cortex glia to enwrap neuronal cell bodies. Prior work on lipid droplets in flies has focused on stress-induced lipid droplets generated in glia and their protective or deleterious roles in the nervous system. Work in mice and humans has found that more lipid droplets are often associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, but our work correlates lipid droplet loss with CNS defects. In the future, it will be important to determine how lipid droplets impact nervous system development and disease.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) On page 10, the authors use the words &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;weak&quot; to describe where ifc is expressed. Since the use of T2A-GAL4 alleles in examining gene expression is unable to delineate the amount of gene expression from a locus, the terms &quot;broad&quot; and &quot;sparse&quot; labeling (or similar terms) should be used instead.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The ifc T2A-GAL4 insert in the ifc locus reports on the transcription of the gene. We agree that GAL4 system will not reflect amount of gene expression differences when the expression levels are not dramatically different. However, when the expression levels differ dramatically, as in our case, GAL4 system can reflect this difference in the expression of a reporter gene.  We reworded this section to suggest that ifc is transcribed at higher levels in glia as compared to neurons. We canât use sparse or broad, as ifc is expressed in all, or at least in most, glia and neurons. The new text is as follows:â Using this approach, we observed strong nRFP expression in all glial cells (Figures 4D and S10A) and modest nRFP expression in all neurons (Figures 4E and S10B), suggesting ifc is transcribed at higher levels in glial cells than neurons in the larval CNS.â</p>

<p>This manuscript unveils several intriguing and novel phenotypes of ifc loss-of-function in glia. The experiments are meticulously planned and executed, with the data strongly supporting their conclusions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I didn't find any obvious weakness.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Additional minor comments below:</p>
<p>(1) The authors state that TGs are the building blocks of membrane phospholipids. This is not exactly true. The breakdown of TGs can result in free FAs which can be used for membrane phospholipid synthesis. Also, membrane phospholipids can also be generated from free FAs that were never in TGs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To address this point, we have reworked a number of sentences in the text. On page 12 we reworded two small sections to the following:</p>
<p>âIn the CNS, lipid droplets form primarily in cortex glia29 and are thought to contribute to membrane lipid synthesis through their catabolism into free fatty acids versus acting as an energy source in the brain.41 Consistent with the possibility that increased membrane lipid synthesis drives lipid droplet reduction, RNA-seq assays of dissected nerve cords revealed that loss of ifc drove transcriptional upregulation of genes that promote membrane lipid biogenesisâ</p>
<p>As TG breakdown results in free fatty acids that can be used for membrane phospholipid synthesis, we asked if changes in TG levels and saturation were reflected in the levels or saturation of the membrane phospholipids phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylserine (PS).</p>

<p>(2) Figure 5J what does the dotted line indicate? Please specify in the figure legend or remove it.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added the following text in the figure legend: Dotted line indicates a log2 fold change of 0.5 in the treatment group compared to the control group.</p>

<p>We have increased font size to enhance the readability of the figures.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors mentioned that driving <italic>ifc</italic> expression in neurons rescues the phenotypes (ref 17). While the glial-specific role presented in this study is robust. I think some readers would appreciate some discussion of this study in light of the data presented here.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added the below text on page 10 to address this point.</p>
<p>âResults of our gene rescue experiments conflict with a prior study on ifc in which expression of ifc in neurons was found to rescue the ifc phenotype. In this context, we note that elav-GAL4 drives UASlinked transgene expression not just in neurons, but also in glia at appreciable levels, and thus needs to be paired with repo-GAL80 to restrict GAL4-mediated gene expression to neurons. Thus, âoff-targetâ expression in glial cells may account for the discrepant results. It is, however, more difficult to reconcile how neuronal or glial expression of ifc would rescue the observed lethality of the ifc-KO chromosome given the presence additional lethal mutations in the 21E2 region of the second chromosome.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) While the analysis of fatty acid saturation is experimentally well done. I'm not really sure what the significance of this data is.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We included this information as a reference for future analysis of additional genes in the ceramide biogenesis pathway, as we expect that alteration of the levels and saturation levels of PE, PC, and PS in cell membranes may underlie key changes in the biophysical properties of glial cell membranes and their ability to enwrap or infiltrate their targets. Thus, we expect the significance of these data to grow as more work is done on additional members of the ceramide pathway in the nervous system in flies and other systems.</p>

Finally, the reduction of dihydroceramide synthesis suppresses the CNS phenotypes associated with ifc mutations, indicating the key role of dihydroceramide in causing ifc LOF defects.</p>
<p>In summary, this manuscript unveils several intriguing and novel phenotypes of ifc loss-of-function in glia. The experiments are meticulously planned and executed, with the data strongly supporting their conclusions. I have no additional comments and fully support the publication of this manuscript in eLife.</p>

<p>The authors also note that they added one paragraph to the discussion that addresses the possibility that the increased detection of cell death markers could arise due to the inability of glial cells to remove cellular debris. The text of this paragraph is provided below:</p>
<p>We note that cortex glia are the major phagocytic cell of the CNS and phagocytose neurons targeted for apoptosis as part of the normal developmental process.23-26  Thus, while we favor the model that ifc triggers neuronal cell death due to glial dysfunction, it is also possible that increased detection of dying neurons arises due at least in part to a decreased ability of cortex glia to clear dying neurons from the CNS. At present, the large number of neurons that undergo developmentally programmed cell death combined with the significant disruption to brain and ventral nerve cord morphology caused by loss of ifc function render this question difficult to address.Additional evidence does, however, support the idea that loss of ifc function drives excess neuronal cell death: Clonal analysis in the fly eye reveals that loss of ifc drives photoreceptor neuron degeneration17, indicating that loss of ifc function drives neuronal cell death; cortex-glia specific depletion of CPES, which acts downstream of ifc, disrupts neuronal function and induces photosensitive epilepsy in flies59, indicating that genes in the ceramide pathway can act nonautonomously in glia to regulate neuronal function; recent genetic studies reveal that other glial cells can compensate for impaired cortex glial cell function by phagocytosing dying neurons62, and we observe that the cell membranes of subperineurial glia enwrap dying neurons in ifc mutant larvae (Fig. S14), consistent with similar compensation occurring in this background, and in humans, loss of function mutations in DEGS1 cause neurodegeneration.7-9 Clearly, future work is required to address this question for ifc/DEGS1 and perhaps other members of the ceramide biogenesis pathway</p>
