<title>Summary</title>
<p>The completion of mating acutely suppresses sexual motivation in male mice. In contrast, relatively little is known about how the completion of mating affects sexual motivation and sexual behavior in female mice. How the brain responds to completion of mating is also unclear. Here, by using self-paced mating assay, we first demonstrate that female mice show decreased sexual motivation after the completion of mating. By using brain-wide analysis of activity-dependent labeling, we next pin-pointed the medial preoptic area as a brain region strongly responding to mating completion. Furthermore, using freely moving <italic>in vivo</italic> calcium imaging to compare neural activity of inhibitory and excitatory neurons in the medial preoptic area, we revealed that a subset of neurons responds significantly and specifically to mating completion but not to appetitive or consummatory behaviors. While there were excitatory and inhibitory neurons that showed positive response to the completion of mating, the response magnitude as well as the proportion of neurons responding to the event was significantly larger in the inhibitory neuron population. Next, by unbiased classification of their responses, we also found a subpopulation of neurons that increase their activity late after the onset of the completion of mating. These neurons were all inhibitory indicating that the completion of mating induces a prolonged inhibitory activity in the medial preoptic area. Lastly, we found that chemogenetic activation of medial preoptic area neurons that respond to mating completion, but not to appetitive behaviors, was sufficient to suppress female sexual motivation. Together, our data illuminate the importance of medial preoptic area as a brain node which encodes a negative signal that sustains low sexual motivation state after the completion of mating in female mice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sexual behavior is a fundamental and universal component of the observable behavioral spectrum in all mammalian species. This behavior results in reproduction, the vital process for species propagation. However, reproduction carries significant burdens, particularly for females, spanning pregnancy, birth, nursing, offspring rearing, and heightened vulnerability to environmental threats. Consequently, the female ability to strictly control sexual drive is adaptive and confers individual survivability. This can involve both increasing and decreasing motivation to engage in sexual behavior, dependent on anticipated beneficial outcome. Rodents provide a powerful resource for studying female sexual behavior and the underlying neural basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agrati, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Micevych and Meisel, 2017</xref>). Typically, rodent sexual behavior is divided into three periods: an appetitive, consummatory, and post-copulatory phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hashikawa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ishii and Touhara, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lenschow and Lima, 2020</xref>). The transition from the consummatory to the post-copulatory phase is triggered by the completion of mating, which is often associated with ejaculation from the male animal. Importantly, in males, sexual motivation acutely reduces after the completion of mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hull et al., 2005</xref>). However, less is known about how mating completion impacts female sexual behavior and motivation. Furthermore, how the transient experience of mating completion is represented in the brain to change the behavioral outcome is not well understood.</p>
<p>The medial preoptic area (MPOA), a molecularly and functionally heterogenous brain region, has classically been known to regulate wide variety of social behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hashikawa et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Karigo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kohl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Moffitt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Tsuneoka and Funato, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wei et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, the MPOA has also been described to be an important brain area for the regulation of, including female sexual behavior. Studies in female rats using electrophysiological recording or histological approaches have reported that the MPOA contains neurons with various response specificity to sexual appetitive behaviors, consummatory behaviors and completion of mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kato and Sakuma, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Pfaus et al., 1993</xref>). Similarly, MPOA lesions increased sexual receptivity, suggesting that the MPOA negatively regulates female sexual behavior when intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Powers and Valenstein, 1972</xref>). Interestingly, the MPOA has also been found to positively regulate female sexual appetitive behavior through their projection to the mesolimbic reward system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">McHenry et al., 2017</xref>). How the MPOA both positively and negatively regulate female sexual behavior, furthermore, sexual motivation, has been a long-lasting question in the field.</p>
<p>Here, we first assess sexual motivation in female mice by quantifying measurable approach or avoidance of a male conspecific. Next, by combining cellular-resolution whole-brain mapping of activity-dependent labeling, <italic>in vivo</italic> calcium imaging, and chemogenetic neural manipulation, we find that a subset of neurons in the MPOA, which are largely inhibitory, respond to mating completion but not to sexual appetitive behavior. This population is sufficient to suppress female sexual motivation. Our findings illuminate the importance of the MPOA as a brain region that encodes a negative signal that sustains low sexual motivation following the completion of mating in female mice.</p>

<title>Female sexual motivation is suppressed after mating completion</title>
<p>Experimentally, sexual motivation can be quantified by the frequency of a subject displaying appetitive behavior, such as approach and sniffing behavior, toward an opposite sex conspecific. However, in a traditional rodent mating assay, where the female and male both freely interact with each other, it is difficult to isolate female-initiated appetitive behavior, and thus their sexual motivation. To directly address aspects of female sexual motivation independent from the maleâs behavior, we used a female self-paced mating assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Erskine, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Peirce and Nuttall, 1961</xref>). In this procedure, a female subject and a sexually experienced male are placed in a behavior apparatus divided by a wall with a hole small enough for a female to move through, but not the male. The female subject may move into the room where the male animal was placed (âInteraction zoneâ) or move out to the other room (âIsolation zoneâ) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>). Thus, in this assay the female has direct control of when interaction happens and provides a more ethologically valid measure of female appetitive sexual behavior. Specifically, the amount of time the female subject spends in the interaction zone and the number of transitions they make serve as metrics to quantify female appetitive behavior. On the experiment day, the female subject was placed in the apparatus with the male intruder (âSexual interactionâ trial) or alone (âControlâ trial). Each animal went through both trials on different experiment days. The position of the animal was tracked to quantify the time spent in each zone. First, we found that the virgin female mice stayed in the isolation zone significantly longer than sexually experienced females, suggesting that previous sexual experience increased sexual motivation in the female mice (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref></bold>). Next, in the sexually experienced animals, we observed robust behavioral changes after the completion of mating (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>). First, we observed that female subjects tended to spend more time in the isolation zone after mating completion compared to post-sniffing, mounting and intromission (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1CâF</xref></bold>). To quantify the changes in animal behavior, we divided the sexual interaction trial into pre- and post-mating completion epochs (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1GâI</xref></bold>). As result, we found that there was a significant decrease in the number of zone transitions as well as a significant increase in the time spent in the isolation zone after the completion of mating. In addition, while there was no change in the amount of female-to-male sniffing, there was a significant decrease in the number of mounting and intromission episodes (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1JâL</xref></bold>). There was also a significant increase in the number of self-grooming behavioral episodes (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1M</xref></bold>). Collectively, these results suggest that the completion of mating decreases sexual motivation.</p>

<title>Brain-wide mapping of neural response to mating completion using activity-dependent labeling in the female brain</title>
<p>We next questioned how mating completion suppresses female sexual motivation. To investigate this question, we first determined which brain regions were associated with neural activity following the completion of mating in an unbiased manner. We conducted a cellular-resolution brain wide activity mapping analysis using targeted recombination in active populations method (TRAP), which allows genetic labeling and access to neurons that are active during a specific time window determined by tamoxifen administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">DeNardo et al., 2019</xref>). To capture the activity pattern associated with mating completion, Fos-2A-iCreER<sup>T2</sup>::RCL-tdTomato (TRAP2::Ai14) female mice were administered 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) immediately after the completion of mating (âCompletionâ group) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). In this method, cells that show behaviorally induced Fos activity were labeled with tdTomato. In addition to these animals, we also prepared a group of animals that were administrated with 4-OHT while the animals were in the appetitive phase. Female subjects interacted with male mice but did not experience any mount or intromission behavior, nor did it complete mating (âAppetitiveâ group). After 2 weeks, the tissue was collected, cleared, imaged, and processed for registration on a template brain atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Park et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Renier et al., 2016</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). The tdTomato+ cells were segmented using a trained classifier and normalized by the area of each brain region (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>). As result, we found mating completion increased tdTomato expression a brain wide manner (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2CâD</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>). We further noticed that regions well known to be related to social behavior had significantly higher tdTomato density in the Completion group compared to the Appetitive group (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2EâI</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref></bold>). This includes paraventricular hypothalamic areas (PVHd, PVH, PaV) which are important for endocrinological regulations, medial amygdala (MeA) which is critical for olfactory sensory information processing, and the BNST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Flanigan and Kash, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Marsh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Raam and Hong, 2021</xref>). The medial preoptic area nucleus (MPN), a subregion of the MPOA, had significantly higher tdTomato density in the Completion group compared to the Appetitive group. The MPN also had the 4<sup>th</sup> largest difference of density between Completion group and Appetitive group among all the brain regions. From this result, we decided to further investigate the role of MPOA and how it is related to the regulation of female sexual motivation after the completion of mating.</p>

<title>Mating completion is represented by both inhibitory and excitatory cell types in the MPOA</title>
<p>MPOA is a molecularly heterogenous brain region. The area is a mixture of 80% inhibitory neurons and 20% of excitatory neurons which can be further classified into neuronal subtypes by marker gene expressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hashikawa et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Moffitt et al., 2018</xref>). These subtypes are often associated with a biological function. One example are the <italic>Nts</italic> expressing cells, which also tend to co-express <italic>Esr1</italic> and <italic>Vgat</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">McHenry et al., 2017</xref>). In female mice, these neurons were shown to respond to male odor when the subject was sexually receptive, and the activation of these neurons were sufficient to increase sexual appetitive behaviors. Therefore, identifying the specific cell types which respond to mating completion but not to appetitive behavior is critical to understand how the MPOA complex regulates female sexual motivation. Here, we utilized multiplexed <italic>in situ</italic> RNA hybridization chain reaction (HCR) to identify previously characterized cell type markers of MPOA and an immediate early gene <italic>Fos</italic> (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure S3A</xref></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Choi et al., 2014</xref>). Brain samples were collected after the completion of mating (âCompletionâ group) or during the appetitive phase; while the subject was interacting with the male mice without any consummatory behavior (âAppetitiveâ group) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure S3B</xref></bold>). First, to understand which subregion of the preoptic area was activated, we quantified the number of <italic>Fos+</italic> cells. As result, we found that the number of <italic>Fos</italic>+ cells in the Completion group were significantly higher than the Appetitive group in the MPN but not in the nearby regions (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure S3CâD</xref></bold>). In the MPN, the amount of <italic>Vglut2+</italic> and <italic>Vgat+</italic> cells expressing <italic>Fos</italic> were significantly higher in the Completion group than in the Appetitive group, suggesting that the completion of mating activates both excitatory and inhibitory neurons (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure S3EâI</xref></bold>). The proportion of <italic>Fos+</italic> cells was higher in <italic>Vgat+</italic> population. To further investigate the cell types in the MPN that were activated by mating completion, we analyzed the co-expression of <italic>Fos</italic> and the MPOA cell type markers (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure S3J</xref></bold>). As result, in the <italic>Vglut2</italic>+ expressing cells, we found that <italic>Fos</italic> induction was only observed in the cells that co-expressed <italic>Calcr</italic>. In contrast, in the <italic>Vgat</italic>+ expressing cells, <italic>Fos</italic> induction was observed in <italic>Calcr, Gal</italic> and <italic>Prlr</italic> co-expressing cells. Next, we conducted clustering on the gene expression matrix to classify cells and analyzed the distribution of <italic>Fos</italic> among the clusters (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure S3KâM</xref></bold>). As result, we were able to identify 6 potential cell types which we labeled as type 1: <italic>Vglut2+</italic>, type 2: <italic>Vgat</italic>+, type 3: <italic>Gal</italic>+, type 4: <italic>Nts</italic>+, type 5: <italic>Calcr</italic>+ and type 6: NA, or a cell group that could not be categorized by a specific gene expression pattern. Type 1: <italic>Vglut2+,</italic> type 2: <italic>Vgat</italic>+ and type 3: <italic>Gal+</italic> had significantly more <italic>Fos+</italic> cells from the Completion group compared to the Appetitive group (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure S3M</xref></bold>). In contrast, <italic>Fos+</italic> cells were not induced in type 4: <italic>Nts</italic>+ indicating that MPOA neurons which regulate appetitive sexual behavior was not activated by mating completion. Collectively, these results indicate that mating completion induces more neural activity in the MPN when compared to appetitive behavior, both in excitatory and inhibitory cell types.</p>

<title>A subpopulation of MPOA Vgat cells respond to mating completion in the female brain</title>
<p>While mapping neural activity based on Fos activity provided critical insight in how the brain responds to mating completion, the low temporal resolution of the method makes it difficult to identify cells that specifically respond to the onset to each behavior. For this reason, we next conducted single-cell resolution <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging in a freely moving animal (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3AâB</xref></bold>). We virally labeled MPOA inhibitory and excitatory cells with a calcium indicator GCaMP6s by using a Cre-dependent virus and female Vgat-Cre or Vglut2-Cre respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4</xref></bold>) (Vgat-Cre: n = 6, 87 Â± 27 cells. Vglut2-Cre: n = 4, 68 Â± 42 cells). We recorded the calcium activity of MPOA Vgat and Vglut2 cells in female mice during mating in a home cage mating assay (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref></bold>). First, we analyzed the magnitude of calcium activity for 15-seconds after behavior onset. From peri-event analysis, we found that as a population, Vgat cells showed significant changes in calcium activity after the onset of all behaviors observed, with the highest increase after mating completion (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3FâG</xref></bold>). Vglut2 cells showed increased activity after sniffing and mounting, intromission, and mating completion. Furthermore, when we compared the response of Vgat and Vglut2 cells, Vgat cells showed significantly higher average response magnitude after sniffing, self-grooming, anogenital sniffing and mating completion than the Vglut2 cells (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref></bold>). Vgat cells also contained a significantly higher proportion of cells that positively respond (&gt; 2Î´) to sniff and mating completion onset (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref></bold>). These results suggest that mating completion signal is more dominantly represented in the MPOA inhibitory cells than in the excitatory cells. On the other hand, the response magnitude and the proportion of cells that respond after mounting and intromission had no significant difference between the two cell types. This indicates that the excitatory/inhibitory balance in the MPOA fluctuates during mating. The MPOA has high inhibitory activity during appetitive phase, with more Vgat cells responding to sniffing, similar activity during the consummatory phase, and higher inhibitory activity after mating completion.</p>

<p>To further investigate the heterogeneity of MPOA during mating, we subset the cells into those which positively responded to any of sniff, mount or mating completion, and then classified the cells based on their specificity (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A,B</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref></bold>). Consistent with <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref></bold>, the number of cells that specifically responded was largest to mating completion with 177 cells, next to mount with 46 cells and to sniff with 12 cells. When compared to other cell populations, sniff cells and completion cells only showed significantly stronger responses than the other cells to sniff and mating completion respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold>). Mount responsive cells showed significantly stronger response than the other cells to mount, intromission and anogenital sniffing, but not to sniffing and mating completion (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold>). We also found that the cells that respond to these 3 behaviors partially overlap but were mostly distinct (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref></bold>). The proportion of cells that respond specifically to a behavior was highest for mating completion (Vgat: 80%, Vglut2: 82%), and lower in mounting (Vgat: 55%, Vglut2: 68%) and sniffing (Vgat: 36%, Vglut2: 0%). There was no notable bias in the anatomical distribution of these cells within the field of view (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref></bold>). Overall, these results suggest that the MPOA contains highly heterogenous functional population which contains a large proportion of cells specifically responding to mating completion in female mice.</p>

<title>MPOA Vgat cells display prolonged activity after the onset of mating completion</title>
<p>Female mice avoid sexual interaction with a male animal after mating completion for hours and even days, suggesting a persistent changes in the animalâs behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">McGill and Coughlin, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zhou et al., 2023</xref>). How the MPOA regulate this persistent change in female sexual motivation is unclear. To analyze the response of MPOA cells on a longer time scale, we focused on the cells that positively responded to mating completion and characterized the calcium response pattern for 120-seconds after the onset (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref></bold>). First, we observed that Vgat cells showed more diverse response patterns during this time-window (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A,B</xref></bold>). To quantify this difference, we calculated the decay length of calcium signal, the time for the increased calcium signal to return to baseline (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref></bold>). As result, we found that Vgat cells had significantly longer decay length compared to the Vglut2 cells, suggesting increased activity late after the onset of the completion of mating. To further classify the temporal dynamics of responses to mating completion, we first concatenated calcium activity that occurred within this time-window from both Vgat and Vglut2 cells and conducted spectral clustering in an unbiased fashion. As result, we were able to classify the responses into 5 types that could be characterized as: 1) fast response, 2) slow response, 3) late response, 4) weak response and 5) negative response (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref></bold>). Type 3 contained cells that show increased calcium dynamics late after the onset of mating completion and had significantly larger decay length than the other cell types (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref></bold>). Then we separated the Vgat and Vglut2 cells to compare their proportions within each cluster. Interestingly, all the cells in type 3 were Vgat cells, suggesting that the increased activity in the MPOA late after the onset of mating completion is mediated by inhibitory neurons (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5HâK</xref></bold>). In contrast, Vglut2 cells were more likely to show fast responses than Vgat cells (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5K</xref></bold>). Collectively, these results suggest that the MPOA contains a subpopulation of inhibitory neurons which increase their activity late after the onset of mating completion, which may contribute to persistent suppression of the female animalsâ sexual motivation.</p>

<title>An activity defined subset of neurons in the MPOA is sufficient to suppress female sexual behavior</title>
<p>Next, we examined whether the increased activity of neurons in the MPOA is sufficient to suppress female sexual motivation after mating completion. We injected an AAV to express the chemogenetic neural activator hM3Dq or eYFP as control into the MPOA of TRAP2 female mice (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref></bold>). To capture the neural activity, each mouse was administrated 4-OHT immediately after the after the completion of mating (âCompletion-hM3Dqâ or âCompletion-eYFPâ group). In addition to these animals, we also prepared a group of animals in which we injected an AAV expressing hM3Dq and then administrated 4-OHT during the appetitive phase (âAppetitive-hM3Dqâ group) (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref></bold>). We found that while the overall number of TRAP-labeled cells had no difference between the Completion groups and the Appetitive group, the proportion of cells located in the MPN was significantly higher in the Completion groups (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Figure S7AâD</xref></bold>). From <italic>in situ</italic> RNA hybridization, we found that most TRAP-labeled cells in the MPN were <italic>Vgat</italic>+ (<italic>Vgat+</italic>: 0.76 Â± 0.16. <italic>Vglut2</italic>+: 0.15 Â± 0.13.). The proportion of <italic>Vgat</italic>+ cells was significantly higher than the <italic>Vglut2+</italic> cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Figure S7EâH</xref></bold>). Together these results suggest that the Completion group labels more inhibitory neurons in the MPN than in the Appetitive group. Furthermore, we analyzed the accuracy and efficiency of TRAP labeling by exposing the animal to mating completion before perfusing the animal. By labeling c-Fos protein signal, we analyzed how well the TRAP ensemble overlaps with the c-Fos positive-ensemble in the MPN. As result, we first found that the number of TRAP-labeled cells as well as c-Fos+ and TRAP-labeled cells in the Completion group was higher than the Appetitive group, consistent with the previous results (<bold><xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6K</xref></bold>). Next, we found that the accuracy of TRAP labeling (the proportion of TRAP-labeled cells that were also c-Fos positive) was similar between the groups (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Figure S7J</xref></bold>, Completion group 0.44 Â± 0.08, Appetitive group 0.51 Â± 0.31). The efficiency of TRAP labeling (the proportion of c-Fos+ cells that were also TRAP labeled) tended to be higher in the Completion group (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Figure S7J</xref></bold>; 0.12 Â± 0.10) than in the Appetitive group (0.03 Â± 0.02). This also suggests that the Appetitive group labels a different set of neurons than the Completion group. These results indicate that by using the TRAP2 method, we were able to specifically label a proportion of MPOA neurons, which are primarily inhibitory, that respond specifically to mating completion. To test the causality of these neurons, we first investigated how the activation affects female sexual behavior in a home cage mating assay (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">Figure S8AâF</xref></bold>). The subjects were intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) injected with CNO 30-minutes before the assay. As result, first we found that Completion-hM3Dq groups showed significantly fewer sniffing events compared to Completion-eYFP and Appetitive-hM3Dq groups (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">Figure S8C</xref></bold>). For consummatory behaviors, while Completion-hM3Dq group showed no difference in mounting episodes compared to Completion-eYFP and Appetitive-hM3Dq groups, there were significantly less intromission episodes, resulting in lower receptive scores (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">Figure S8DâF</xref></bold>). Thus, from these results, activation of MPOA neurons that respond to mating completion suppresses both appetitive and consummatory sexual behavior in female mice.</p>

Interestingly, activation of these neurons did not induce conditional place preference or aversion (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">Figure S8GâJ</xref></bold>), implying that the suppression of sexual behavior is not associated with negative valence.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>How sexual motivation is represented in the brain has been a long-lasting question in the field. Here we found that MPOA plays a critical role in regulating female sexual motivation. We found that MPOA neurons, especially the inhibitory neurons, respond significantly and specifically to the completion of mating. These neurons show persistent activity after the onset of mating completion. Reactivation of these neurons result in suppression of female sexual motivation. We propose that MPOA together with other neural substrates such as the BNST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zhou et al., 2023</xref>), encode a negative feedback signal that sustains low sexual motivation state after the completion of mating in female mice. Here, we will further discuss how sensory inputs contribute to the mating completion response in the MPOA, how MPOA represents appetitive behavior and mating completion signal and how these neurons work in concert with other sexual behavior related hypothalamic regions.</p>

<p>Suppression of female sexual behavior and motivation after the completion of mating is not a unique phenomenon found in mice and can be observed in various insect species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gillott, 2003</xref>). Studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has demonstrated that the primary trigger of this behavioral switch is the sex peptide (SP), a peptide released in the male seminal fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chapman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Liu and Kubli, 2003</xref>). Studies in flies have further identified the receptor for SP as well as the neural circuitry which conveys the sensory information to the mating regulating neurons in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Feng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">RezÃ¡val et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Yapici et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast to the well-studied system in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, little is known about how the mammalian brain senses the completion of mating. Histological studies in rats have shown that mating completion induces c-Fos expression widely in the brain, including the MPOA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Pfaus et al., 1993</xref>). Indeed, anesthesia to the female genitalia has been shown to disrupt pacing of mating, indicating that sensory input from the genitalia can impact female sexual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Parada et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, artificial stimulation of the vagina or the clitoris of the female rat was further shown to induce c-Fos expression in the MPOA in a similar fashion as mating completion, indicating that at least tactile sensory input can be conveyed to this brain area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Parada et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Pfaus et al., 1996</xref>). Ejaculation from vasectomized male animals were sufficient to suppress sexual behavior suggesting that at least chemical components from the testis is not necessary for this effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zhou et al., 2023</xref>). A recent study has shown that mechanical stretch induces serotonergic activity in the dorsal raphe, which resembles changes after mating completion, suggesting that stretch sensation is mediating mating completion signal to the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Troconis et al., 2023</xref>). However, it is unclear how stretch sensation in the genitalia is conveyed to the brain, and equally unclear how this information is ultimately transmitted to the MPOA. Our findings on how the mating completion signal is represented in the MPOA will be an ideal entry point to study the neural basis of genital-brain communication.</p>

<title>Appetitive behavior and mating completion ensembles in MPOA</title>
<p>The MPOA is a molecularly and functionally heterogenous brain region. One function MPOA has heavily been related to is parenting behavior. MPOA neurons which express <italic>Gal</italic> and/or <italic>Calcr</italic> has been demonstrated to regulate parenting behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kohl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yoshihara et al., 2021</xref>). From our data, neurons that respond to mating completion tended to co-express <italic>Gal</italic> and <italic>Calcr</italic> more than neurons that responded to appetitive behavior (<bold><xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref></bold>). However, we also found that chemogenetic activation of mating completion responsive MPOA neurons did not induce parenting behavior (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">Figure S8</xref></bold>). While it is necessary to conduct extensive analysis of how MPOA neurons respond to other behaviors, these results suggest that mating completion responding MPOA neurons may specifically regulate sexual behavior and motivation but not parenting behavior. A previous study also found that MPOA contains a subset of neurons which regulate female appetitive sexual behavior. MPOA neurons which express <italic>Vgat, Esr1</italic> and <italic>Nts</italic>, and projects to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) has been shown to respond to olfactory signals from the male mouse and to enhance female-to-male sniffing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">McHenry et al., 2017</xref>). There is also a significant release of dopamine after the first female to male sniffing interaction as well as after mating completion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dai et al., 2022</xref>). How the brain, especially the MPOA, increases sexual motivation before and during the appetitive phase, and how it suppresses motivation after the completion of mating, has been a long-lasting question in the field that is addressed throughout this work. The whole brain activity-dependent labeling experiment identified the MPOA as one of the brain regions which strongly increases Fos activity (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>However, there were many other brain regions showing increased activity associated with mating completion, including ones that are not canonically involved in the regulation of social behavior. While it is possible that all these brain regions work in concert to suppress sexual motivation after the completion of mating, our results demonstrate that a specific brain region, MPOA, is sufficient to evoke behavioral response. This suggests that all brain regions showing higher Fos activity are not necessarily causal to behavioral changes. It is also possible that these widespread brain regions may be a consequence of noise due to the long time-window in this method, which may be resolved by further development of genetic methods for neural ensemble labeling. In the MPOA, our <italic>in vivo</italic> calcium imaging data shows nearly half of the inhibitory neurons that positively respond to appetitive behavior also respond to mating completion (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></bold>). Our data also identified that there was no difference between the number of <italic>Nts+</italic> cells activated by appetitive behavior and mating completion (<bold><xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref></bold>). These results suggest that there is a small but significant number of neurons which respond both to appetitive behavior and mating completion in the MPOA, and potentially regulate release of dopamine.</p>
<p>Although a large amount of appetitive behavior responding neurons also respond to mating completion, the opposite is not true. Most of the mating completion responding neurons did not respond to female-to-male sniffing (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></bold>). Importantly, the chemogenetic activation of this population suppressed the amount of sexual interaction in the self-paced mating assay, which suggest that it reduces sexual motivation, opposite to what was described when activating <italic>Nts</italic>+ MPOA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">McHenry et al., 2017</xref>). This suggests that there are at least two-distinct populations in the MPOA which regulate appetitive sexual behavior in opposing directions.</p>

<title>Neural circuitry for female sexual behavior regulation</title>
<p>The neural circuitry that regulates female sexual behavior has been extensively studied in rodent models. From early lesion and electrical stimulation studies, it has been proposed that the rodent brain has a positive and negative regulatory system for female sexual behavior. The positive system has been proposed in rats, where Pfaff and Sakuma demonstrated that the lesion of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) abolished sexual receptivity while electrical stimulation of the same region induces receptivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Pfaff and Sakuma, 1979a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">1979b</xref>). Mouse genetics further showed that a subset of neurons in the ventrolateral part of the VMH is crucial for the regulation of female sexual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Inoue et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). More specifically, <italic>Esr1+ Cckar+</italic> (<italic>Nts-</italic>) cells in the VMHvl were found to be necessary and sufficient for female sexual receptivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yin et al., 2022</xref>). These results suggest that the VMHvl is the âcommand centerâ which positively regulate female sexual behavior.</p>
<p>The MPOA together with other brain regions has been proposed to form the negative regulating system. Lesion of the MPOA was shown to increase the sexual receptivity of the female rat and electrical stimulation was shown to reduce receptivity, suggesting that MPOA negatively regulates female sexual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Pfaff and Sakuma, 1979b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Powers and Valenstein, 1972</xref>). In the current study, we demonstrate that chemogenetic activation of neurons in the MPOA which respond to mating completion is sufficient to suppress female sexual behavior and sexual motivation. This result suggests that these neurons in the MPOA constitute the negative regulating system. Importantly, both our single-cell calcium imaging results and histological analysis of the chemogenetic activation cohort suggest that the majority of these neurons are inhibitory (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Figure S7H</xref></bold>). We further demonstrate that the inhibitory population contains neurons that show prolonged responses to mating completion which resemble the persistent change of sexual motivation. Other studies have also supported the idea that the inhibitory cell population is more related to the regulation of social behavior than the excitatory population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hashikawa et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Moffitt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Tsuneoka and Funato, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">G.-W. Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Our results are also in line with this idea and suggest that the inhibitory neuronal population is the main regulator of the change in sexual motivation. The role of excitatory neurons that respond to mating completion will be a future topic to examine.</p>
<p>Recently, BNST was also found to play a role in negatively controlling female sexual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zhou et al., 2023</xref>). There, they use a behavioral assay which introduces 2 different males to the female subject before and after the completion of mating. They demonstrate that after the completion of mating, the female will be less receptive toward the second male. Importantly, this assay clearly demonstrate that the reduction of female sexual behavior is due to the female herself, not due to the change in their male conspecific. This result together with the result from our self-paced mating assay (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>) strongly indicates that the behavioral change after mating completion reflects change in internal motivational states.</p>
<p>The study further used single-cell resolution <italic>in vivo</italic> calcium imaging techniques to demonstrate that BNST<sup>Esr<italic>2</italic></sup> neurons show specific and robust responses after mating completion, like what we observed in the MPOA. While inhibition of BNST<sup>Esr2</sup> neurons rescued female receptivity after mating completion, activation of these neurons did not affect sexual behavior in female mice, suggesting that BNST<sup>Esr2</sup> neurons are necessary but not sufficient to suppress female sexual behavior or potentially sexual motivation. This result may suggest that BNST<sup>Esr2</sup> neurons require activation of other neural populations to affect female sexual behavior, such as the populations we identify in the MPOA. Still, the overall role of BNST and MPOA seems to be similar suggesting that the two regions work in concert to suppress female sexual behavior. This is contrary to the finding from Mei et al. showing that the BNST<sup>Esr1</sup> neurons and MPOA<sup>Esr1</sup> neurons forms a bidirectional inhibitory circuit to antagonistically regulate infanticidal behavior and maternal behavior respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mei et al., 2023</xref>). A mechanism which is yet to be revealed that can override the negative feedback loop between MPOA and BNST neurons is necessary for these neurons to regulate the same behavior change. Interestingly, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yin et al., 2022</xref>) showed that VMHvl<sup>Cckar</sup> neurons show strong inhibition of spontaneous bulk calcium events after mating completion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yin et al., 2022</xref>). This is opposite to the persistent increase of activity in the MPOA and BNST, suggesting that the activity in these regions is reflected onto the VMHvl. Indeed, MPOA and BNST both send dense projection to the VMHvl, and VMHvl<sup>Esr1</sup> neurons project to the MPOA and to the BNST, making the MPOA-BNST-VMHvl network highly interconnected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">DimÃ©n et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Osakada et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Long-lasting change in neural activity within this network, potentially through monoamine or steroid molecules such as dopamine or opioids may be the neural basis of suppressed sexual motivation after mating completion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Micevych and Meisel, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">S. X. Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Another candidate is serotonin, which is known to be an important mediator for sexual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Uphouse, 2014</xref>). Recent study has revealed release of serotonin in response to mating completion in female mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Troconis et al., 2023</xref>). Our whole brain activity mapping data also indicates increased Fos activity in the dorsal raphe (<bold><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref></bold>). Whether serotonin mediates the changes in persistent activity across the entire network and whether there is a difference in how it impacts MPOA and BNST will be an important topic of future studies.</p>
<p>Taken together, our study identifies a subset of neurons in the MPOA which is dedicated to negatively sustain female sexual motivation. This finding fills the missing hole in how the brain neurons regulate female sexual motivation and proposes that the basal forebrain complex of MPOA and BNST work in concert as the negative regulating system of female sexual behavior.</p>

<title>Surgery</title>
<p>For targeting AAV into a certain brain region, stereotactic coordinates were defined for each brain region based on the brain atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Franklin and Paxinos, 2007</xref>). Mice were anesthetized isoflurane and head-fixed to stereotactic equipment (Kopf). For <italic>in vivo</italic> calcium imaging experiments, 500 nL of AAVDj EF1a-DIO-GCaMP6s (2.8*e12, UNC viral core, lot#av78310) was injected into two coordinates in the target brain region at a speed of 60 nl/min using Nanoject 3 pump (Drummond Scientific). The following coordinates were used [Distance in millimeters from the Bregma for the anterior (A)-posterior (P) and lateral (L) positions, and from the brain surface for ventral (V) direction]: MPOA, A 0.2, L 0.15, V 5.2. and A 0.4, L 0.35, V 5.2. Immediately following viral injection, 5 screws were placed into the skull and a GRIN lens (Inscopix, 0.6 mm x 7.3 mm) was slowly lowered to position above the injection site: MPOA, A 0.3, L 0.3, V 4.95. GRIN lens was glued to the skull with C&amp;B Metabond Kit (Parkell, # S380) and dental cement (Lang Dental, #1304CL). After placement of GRIN lens, a custom-made head ring was glued to the skull and screws. For bare GRIN lenses, more than 3 weeks after the virus injection and GRIN lens placement surgery, a baseplate (Inscopix) was positioned to while visualizing GCaMP6s expression with a microscope. Once a field of view with GCaMP6s expression was found, the baseplate was glued to the head ring and skull. For pharmacogenetic experiments, 300-400 nL of AAV5 hSyn-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry (2.0*e13, Addgene, #44361-AAV5, lot#v141469) or AAV5 EF1a-DIO-eYFP (4.4*e12, UNC viral core, lot#av4802B) was bilaterally injected into the target brain region at a speed of 60 nl/min using Nanoject 3 pump. The following coordinates were used: MPOA, A 0.3, L 0.25, V 5.2. All female mice that experienced a mating assay was ovariectomized. Animals that were used in <italic>in vivo</italic> calcium imaging experiments or pharmacogenetic experiments were ovariectomized during the virus injection or GRIN lens placement surgery. After surgery, the incision was sutured, and the animal was warmed using a heat pad to facilitate recovery from anesthesia.</p>

<title>Behavior experiments and analysis</title>
<p>For all mating assays, female mice older than 6 weeks were ovariectomized (OVX) under isoflurane anesthesia. If necessary, mice underwent surgeries for AAV injections, GRIN lens implantation on the same day. After more than 2 weeks of recovery, the OVX female subjects were subcutaneously (s.c.) injected with 0.1 mL and 0.05 mL Estradiol (E8515, Sigma-Aldrich, 0.1 mg/ml) dissolved in sesame oil (Sigma-Aldrich) at 24 and 48h before assay, and 0.05 mL Progesterone (P0130, Sigma-Aldrich, 10 mg/ml in sesame oil) at 4h before assay. If necessary, mice underwent I.P. injection of CNO/saline. C57BL/6 or Swiss-Webster mice were used as a stud male. A 4 â 6 cm to head bar was placed onto the male mice under isoflurane anesthesia, which was used for the female self-paced mating assay described below. The male animals were kept isolated until the assay and had been trained prior to the assay to show mounting and ejaculation.</p>
<p>The home cage mating assay was conducted as previously described with modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ishii et al., 2017</xref>). Each assay was conducted 5-10 hrs after the onset of dark period, under an IR light and recorded (30 Hz) for subsequent 30 to 120 min for analysis of sexual behavior from a dorsal view. For neural activation experiments using hM3Dq (<bold><xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6</xref></bold>), 0.1 mL of 1 mg/kg clozapine-N-oxide dissolved in saline (CNO, RTI International, NIMH Code C-929) or 0.1 mL of saline was I.P. injected into the animal 30 minutes prior to the male entry.</p>
<p>The female self-paced mating assay was conducted using a behavior apparatus modified from an apparatus used in rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Nyuyki et al., 2011</xref>). A 1-cm thick black wall with a 20 mm x 20 mm hole 3D-printed with PFA filament was placed in a 25 cm x 35 cm cage to divide the room in a 1:2 ratio along the longer edge. The smaller room was defined as the isolation zone and the larger room was defined as the interaction zone. Female subjects were habituated to the room for 30 minutes before the assay. The female subjects that were not able to pass through the hole during the habituation was eliminated from the cohort. On the experiment day, the female subjects were placed into the behavior apparatus for 30 minutes for analysis of movement tracking from a dorsal view, which was used as control (Control trial). After the habituation, the male intruder (Swiss-Webster) was placed in the interaction zone. Each assay was conducted 5-10 hrs after the onset of dark period, under an IR light and recorded (15 Hz) for subsequent 30 to 120 min for analysis of movement tracking and sexual behavior from a dorsal view (Sexual interaction trial). For <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref></bold>, females underwent two mating assays at &gt; 1 week interval, with different treatment (e.g., saline or CNO). Different males were used for each assay. For neural activation experiments using hM3Dq (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6</xref></bold>), 0.1 mL of 1 mg/kg clozapine-N-oxide dissolved in saline (CNO, RTI International, NIMH Code C-929) or 0.1 mL of saline was I.P. injected into the animal 30 minutes prior to the male entry.</p>
<p>Sexual behavior was annotated from the recorded video using Behavioral Observation Research Interactive Software (BORIS) in a frame-by-frame fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Friard and Gamba, 2016</xref>). Male mounts, intromission, male to female anogenital sniffing, female to male sniffing, female self-grooming and mating completion were annotated based on characteristic postures described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ishii et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, mount was defined as a stud male using both forepaws to climb onto a female from behind for copulation. Intromission was defined by stable thrusting from the male animal during mount. The completion of mating was identified by increase and then termination of thrusting and more than 10 seconds of immobility from the male, which are postures frequently associated with male ejaculation. Male to female anogenital sniffing was identified by the male animal following the female subjects anogenital area. Female to male sniffing was identified by female subject nose approaching male subject. When analyzing sniff-evoked GCaMP activity, to restrict the analysis to appetitive sniffing behaviors, sniffing behaviors which happened after the first mounting was excluded from the analysis. Female self-grooming was identified by the female subject moving their head close to their genital region. The receptive ratio was calculated by dividing the total number of intromissions with the total number of mountings. Behavior annotation was conducted by volunteers who were blind for the stimulation or AAV condition. For the female self-paced mating assay, the position of the female subject was tracked from the recorded video using DeepLabCut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Nath et al., 2019</xref>). The amount of time spent in the interaction zone was quantified using SimBA region of interest (ROI) interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Nilson et al., 2020</xref>). Behavior data from <italic>in vivo</italic> calcium imaging experiments were down-sampled to 10-Hz to match the imaging data.</p>
<p>For conditional place preference (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">Figure S8GâJ</xref></bold>), a two chambered apparatus was used with visual (horizontal and vertical stripes) cues. The floor was backlit and an overhead video camera recorded position (Basler, 3.75 Hz frame rate with Ethovision software, Noldus). The apparatus was in a sound isolation chamber. <italic>Ad libitum</italic> fed Fos-CreER mice with hM3Dq and eYFP controls were acclimatized (60 min). The following day, the mouseâs position was recorded (1,800 s) and tracked offline using Ethovision (pre-test). Daily conditioning consisted of two 1,800 s sessions: (1) one side of the chamber paired with saline injection; (2) the other side paired with CNO (1 mg/kg) injection. Saline or CNO was administrated 10 min prior to the entry to the chamber. The side on which saline or CNO was administered was counterbalanced. After three conditioning days, mice were given free access to the entire apparatus and their position was tracked (post-test). The difference of time spent in the CNO zone, the number of entries into the CNO zone and the velocity between the post- and pre-test.</p>
<p>For pup retrieval test (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">Figure S8KâO</xref></bold>), a home cage of the female subject was used. Female subject was i.p. injected with saline as control or CNO in their home cage. 30-minutes after administration, three 7-day-old pups were placed in the corners of the home cage. Animal behavior was recorded from the dorsal view for 10 minutes. Parenting behavior was annotated from the recorded video using Behavioral Observation Research Interactive Software (BORIS) in a frame-by-frame fashion. Pup retrievals, nest building, pup grooming and pup sniffing were annotated based on characteristic postures. Briefly, pup retrieval was defined as a female subject carrying pup. Nest building was defined by female subject digging their bedding or carrying nesting material. Pup grooming was identified by grooming pups without carrying. Female to pup sniffing was identified by female subject nose approaching pup. For neural activation experiments using hM3Dq (<bold><xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6</xref></bold>), 0.1 mL of 1 mg/kg clozapine-N-oxide dissolved in saline (CNO, RTI International, NIMH Code C-929) or 0.1 mL of saline was I.P. injected into the animal 30 minutes prior to the pup introduction.</p>

<title><italic>In vivo</italic> calcium imaging experiments and analysis</title>
<p>Miniature microscope nVoke 2.0 or nVue (Inscopix) was used to obtain GCaMP6s signal (20 Hz). The microscope was connected above the behavior apparatus using a commutator (Inscopix) to support the weight of the microscope. On the experiment day, the subject was habituated to the microscope for 10 minutes. After the habituation, the LED power and gain was adjusted to 0.2-0.5 and 6.0-8.0 respectively depending on the intensity of GCaMP6s expression. Data acquisition started after the adjustment of imaging parameters. The animal was kept habituated to the microscope for additional &gt; 5 minutes to obtain background signal, and then the intruder male animal was introduced to the subjectâs home cage. Calcium activity as well as animal behavior was recorded until 2-10 minutes after the completion of mating. Imaging data were spatially down-sampled by factor of 4 and temporally down-sampled to 10 Hz using the Inscopix Data Processing software (1.8.0). The data was further filtered by a spatial band-pass filter and motion corrected using the same software. Masks were manually drawn to extract data from single cell. The data frame containing GCaMP6s signal intensity traces were exported from the Inscopix Data Processing software and further processed in Python. Signal intensity array was z-scored using the background signal. For peri event activity analysis in <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></bold>, z-scored signal was collected from â5 to + 15 seconds around the behavior onset. Peri event activity from multiple behavior events were concatenated and averaged. Finally, the mean value of pre-behavior background (â5 to 0 seconds from onset) was subtracted. The magnitude of z-scored signal was quantified by averaging 0 to +5 seconds from onset. Cells that had larger than 2 d z-scored signal were classified as ârespondingâ cells. For persistent activity analysis in <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref></bold>, z-scored signal was collected from â5 to + 120 seconds around the onset of mating completion. The mean value of pre-behavior background (â5 to 0 seconds from onset) was subtracted. The decay length was quantified by calculating the time the z-scored signal was smaller than 0. The magnitude of z-scored signal was quantified by averaging 0 to +5 seconds from onset. Spectral clustering was conducted using scikit-learn package and previously used custom script (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Namboodiri et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, first dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis was conducted for z-scored signal from â5 to +120 seconds around the onset of mating completion. Next, n = 4 principal components were used to project the data. This was further used as the input into the clustering algorithm while systematically testing nearest neighbor and number of cluster variables. The best variable that resulted in maximizing the silhouette score was determined (number of clusters = 5, number of nearest neighbors = 55, average silhouette score = 0.405). All clusters contained cells from multiple animal subjects, indicating the variability of the dataset can be explained by heterogenous cell population, rather than subject variability.</p>

TRAP2::Ai14 or TRAP2 mice were OVX during isoflurane anesthesia and AAV injected if necessary. After 2 â 3 weeks from OVX surgery, animals were prepared for the activity labeling assay.

On the day for the assay, female subjects were isolated in their home cage and introduced with a male intruder to either experience appetitive behaviors or mating completion. For the appetitive group, the male intruder was removed after 10â20 minutes. To ensure that the female subject did not experience any consummatory behavior from the male, the male intruder was removed whenever an attempt to mount was observed. For the completion group, the male intruder was removed just after the completion of mating. Immediately after the removal of the male animal, the female subject was I.P. injected with 0.125 mL of 50 mg/kg of 4-Hydroxytamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich, cat#H6278) dissolved in sesame oil. After the injection, the female subject was isolated in their home cage and kept in the behavior room for overnight to avoid background stimulation. On the following day, the mice were returned to the regular housing.</p>

<title>HCR experiments and analysis</title>
<p>Hybridization chain reaction (HCR) was performed based on the protocol provided by Molecular Instruments with some modifications (<bold><xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Figure S7EâH</xref></bold>). For <italic>Fos</italic> activity analysis (<bold><xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref></bold>), the female subject was first singly housed in the home cage for 1 hour. The male intruder was introduced into the home cage and animal behavior was recorded. For the appetitive group, the male intruder was removed after 10â20 minutes until they first attempt mounting to the female subject. For the completion group, the male intruder was removed just after the completion of mating. Twenty-minutes after the removal of the male intruder, the female subject was immediately sacrificed to collect brain tissue. The brain tissue was then snap-frozen using dry ice. Every fifth 20-micron coronal sections containing the MPOA (3 sections from Bregma +0.10 mm to â 0.10 mm) were collected on a slide glass and fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 30 min and rinsed with PBS, followed by dehydration with a series of 50%, 70%, 100%, 100% of ethanol. After final dehydration the slides were dried. The tissue was treated with Protease4 (ACDBiosystem) for 5â 7 minutes. The slides were then rinsed with PBS and were applied with hybridization buffer (Molecular Instruments) for 10 minutes at 37Â°C for pre-hybridization. RNA probes for <italic>Fos, Vgat, Vglut2, Calcr, Esr1, Gal, Nts, Prlr</italic> (1 mM, Molecular Instruments) were diluted in a ratio of 1:100â 1:250 into the hybridization buffer. After pre-hybridization, hybridization buffer (70 Î¼l) containing the probes was applied to each slide on which the parafilm cover was placed. After 12hâ18h of incubation at 37Â°C in the moisture chamber, the sections were washed, with a series of probe wash buffer and SSC-T buffer (5x SSC, 0.1% Tween 20) mixture. After the final wash, the sections were incubated in amplification buffer (Molecular Instruments) for 30 minutes at room temperature for pre-amplification. Amplification hairpin probes (3 mM, Molecular Instruments) were diluted in a ratio of 1:50 into the hybridization and then snap cooled for 1.5 minutes in 95Â°C. After pre-amplification, amplification buffer containing hairpin probes (70 Î¼l) was applied to each slide on which the parafilm cover was placed. After 12hâ18h of incubation at room temperature in the moisture chamber, the sections were washed in 5xSSC-T buffer for 30 minutes x2. The sections were quenched for autofluorescence using Vector TrueView reagent (Vector, cat# SP-8400). After washed in 2xSSC, the sections were stained with DAPI in PBS (5 Î¼g/ml, Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat#D1306) for 8 minutes. The slide was then mounted using Vibrance Antifade Mounting Medium (VECTASHIELD, cat#H-1800). Images were obtained using a conventional microscope (Zeiss, Apotome Imager.M2) with a 20x objective. After image acquisition, the coverslip was removed and washed in 2x SSC for 10 minutes, then incubated with DNase1 (0.25 U/Î¼l, Roche, cat#4716728001) for 1.5 h at room temperature. The section was then washed in 2x SSC for 5 minutes x6. The sections then proceeded to the pre-hybridization step for the next round of HCR. A total of 3 rounds of HCR were conducted. Images from multiple rounds were aligned using HiPlex image registration software (ACDBiosystem) or manually aligned using ImageJ package TrackEM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Cardona et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>For anatomical characterization for TRAP2 animals used in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Figure S7EâH</xref></bold>, subjects were perfused with PBS and 4% PFA-PBS, then brain was harvested and post-fixed with PFA overnight. Every fourth 40-Î¼m coronal sections containing the MPOA were collected on a slide glass. The sections went through 1 round of HCR and were stained for <italic>Vgat</italic> and <italic>Vglut2</italic> following the procedures described above.</p>
<p>The images with each probe signal were aligned to the DAPI channel to identify MPOA subregions and adjacent regions. The image was processed in HALO v3.2 software (Indica Labs) to segment each cell based on the DAPI signal and to quantify RNA transcript signal in each cell. Parameters for detecting puncta and intensity of each gene were manually adjusted for each tissue section of each animal by a volunteer blind to the experimental condition. The cutoff value to determine a gene âexpressing cellâ was defined as the mean fluorescent intensity of 3 to 5 transcripts depending on the background fluorescent signal. For supervised clustering of the MPN cell gene expression matrix (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure S3KâM</xref></bold>) was conducted using Seurat3.1.1 in R. Cells that had no mRNA signal were excluded from the dataset. This expression matrix contained single cells detected across all 10 animals and the spot counts for every gene; we also included signal intensity measurements as metadata. Once loaded, the HCR digital expression matrix was scaled but not normalized. During scaling, we regressed out gene intensity measurements on the basis that signal intensity may indicate staining quality. Next, cells were clustered using the same pipeline. The cells were UMAP plotted using nearest_neighbors = 100, minimum_distance = 0.05 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure S3K</xref></bold>). The cluster ID for each cell was exported and used for statistical analysis using custom Python scripts.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry experiments</title>
<p>To evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of TRAP labeling, we utilized subjects used in pharmacogenetic experiments (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Figure S7</xref></bold>) and labeled neurons that respond to mating completion using immunohistochemistry against immediate early gene c-Fos. The TRAP2 female subjects were labeled with eYFP or hM3Dq-mCherry in the appetitive or mating completion responding neurons in the MPOA (Appetitive-hM3Dq group, Completion-hM3Dq or Completion-eYFP group). Ninety-minutes before perfusion, the female subjects experienced mating completion during a home cage mating assay (described in â<bold>Behavior experiments and analysis</bold>.â) to activate the mating completion responding neurons in the MPOA. The subjects were then perfused with PBS and 4% PFA-PBS, and the brain was harvested and post-fixed with PFA overnight. Every fourth 40-Î¼m coronal sections containing the MPOA were collected. were washed three times with PBS-T (1x PBS, 0.3% Triton-X, Sigma-Aldrich, cat# 11332481001) for 10 min x3, and treated with 5% normal donkey serum (NDS, Sigma-Aldrich, cat# 566460) in PBST for 1 hr at room temperature for blocking. Sections were then incubated with rabbit anti-cFos antibody (Abcam, cat#190289-Rb, 1:500), diluted into 5% BSA in PBST for overnight at 4Â°C. Antibody signals were detected by goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 or Alexa 594 (Invitrogen, cat#A21206 or cat#A21209, 1:500) for 2h at room temperature. Sections were washed once with PBST for 10 min, treated with PBS containing DAPI for 20 min, rinsed with PBS, and mounted with cover glass using Vibrance Antifade Mounting Medium (VECTASHIELD, cat#H-1800).</p>
<p>Sections were imaged by FV-3000 confocal microscope (Olympus) with a 20x objective. Images were processed in cellpose to segment DAPI positive cells in the MPOA and their subregions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Stringer et al., 2021</xref>). DAPI positive cell masks were used to quantify intensity of c-Fos protein or YFP/mCherry signal. The intensity value was used to determine the negative and positive cell.</p>

<title>Brain-wide analysis of activity-dependent labeling experiments</title>
<p>TRAP2::Ai14 females were used to label neurons responding to appetitive behavior or mating completion. Two-weeks after activity labeling (described in â<bold>TRAP experiments.</bold>â), the animals were perfused with PBS and 4% PFA-PBS, the brain was harvested and post-fixed with PFA overnight. After post-fixation, the brains were processed for tissue clearing. For tissue clearing, we utilized stabilization under harsh conditions via intramolecular epoxide linkages to prevent degradation method (SHIELD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Park et al., 2019</xref>). The procedures followed the SHIELD tissue clearing protocol (Full Active Pipeline Protocol v5.05, LifeCanvas). Briefly, the brain was incubated in SHIELD OFF solution [2.5 mL DI water, 2.5 mL SHIELD-Buffer Solution, 5 mL SHIELD-Epoxy Solution] at 4oC for 4 days. Then transferred to SHIELD ON buffer and incubated at 37Â°C for 24 hrs. Following, SHIELD ON buffer incubation, the brain was pre-incubated in Delipidization buffer for overnight at room temperature. The tissue was then placed into SmartClear II Pro (LifeCanvas) to conduct active tissue clearing for 24 hours. To match the refraction index, the tissue was incubated in 50% of EASYINDEX solution (RI = 1.52, LifeCanvas) at 37Â°C shaking for 24 hrs and then 100% of EASYINDEX solution at 37Â°C shaking for 24 hrs. The tissue was then embedded in EASYINDEX with 2% agar and mounted onto SmartSPIM light sheet microscope (LifeCanvas). The tissue was mounted ventral side facing toward the objective, imaged from the horizontal view using a 3.6x objective with 4-Î¼m zstep. 594 nm channel was collected as the signal channel, 488 or 647 nm channel was collected as the background channel. Background channel was used for the alignment to the brain atlas. The images were first destriped and then stitched using a custom written script (LifeCanvas). The images were pre-processed and down sampled by 2 times (final resolution (x,y,z) = (3.6 Î¼m, 3.6 Î¼m, 4 Î¼m)). Images were registered to a standard brain atlas Unified Anatomical Atlas (Yongsoo Kim Lab) (resolution (x,y,z) = (20 Î¼m, 20 Î¼m, 50 Î¼m)) using ClearMap pipeline on a cloud-based cluster computer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Madangopal et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Renier et al., 2016</xref>). tdTomato expressing cells were segmented through the same pipeline using a classifier created using Ilastik (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Berg et al., 2019</xref>). To train the classifier, 10 chunks of images from the 4 of the subjects were randomly sampled and used as the training dataset (Image size, (x,y,z) = 1.8 mm x 1.8 mm x 100 Î¼m). One chunk image of the same size from each subject was used as the test dataset. The quality of the classifier was visually examined. The total number of tdTomato positive cells per brain region was quantified and normalized by the size of each brain region (density, mm<sup>3</sup>). In the standard brain atlas, brain regions were hierarchically sorted from broader regions to finer regions (level 1 to level 8). Level 4 was selected for broader analysis of brain regions (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>). Level 6 was selected for finer analysis of brain regions (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref></bold>). To compare the means of density of tdTomato cell in each brain area between the Appetitive group and Completion group, we conducted Studentâs t-test and further corrected for multiple comparisons with Benjamini/Hochberg correction. False discovery rate (FDR) = 0.05 was used for the broader analysis while a loose discovery rate (FDR = 0.10) was used for finer analysis due to the large number of comparisons.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This manuscript by Ishii et al utilizes a classical, but extremely understudied, female self-paced assay to directly address aspects of female sexual motivation independent from the male's behavior. This allowed for a clear separation of appetitive and consummatory events, of which whole brain unbiased activity was mapped. Mating completion in females was then focused on the medial preoptic nucleus where the authors performed a rigorous set of single-cell GCaMP recordings in populations marked by Vglut2 and Vgat, finding the latter display stronger and prolonged activity after the onset of mating completion. Finally, they demonstrate function to these Fos-TRAPPED completion cells demonstrating their capacity to suppress female sexual behavior.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This manuscript sought to explicitly explore the female mating drive as dictated by the female, a very rare angle for those studying mating behavior which almost always is controlled by the male's behavior. To achieve this, the authors went back to old literature and modified a classical paradigm in which a measurable approach and avoidance of male conspecifics can be measured in female mice using a self-paced mating assay. Strengths include a detailed quantification of female behaviors demonstrating a robust attenuated sexual motivation in females after mating completion. To determine the neural basis behind this, a brain-wide analysis of cells responding to mating completion in the female brain was conducted which revealed numerous anatomical regions displaying increased Fos activity, including the MPOA, of which the authors concentrated the remaining of their study. Employing microendoscopic imaging, the authors discovered that this mating completion signal was strongly represented in the MPOA. The single cell data analyses are of very high quality as is the number of individual cells resolved. While they identified both excitatory and inhibitory cell types that were activated by mating completion, they found the latter exhibited stronger and more persistent activity. Segmentation into individual mating behaviors reinforced the importance of GABAergic completion cells, which display prolonged activity late after the onset of mating completion. This information provides a potential mechanism for how female mice suppress further mating activity following completion. The authors then definitively demonstrate this function by TRAP'ping completion cells with chemogenetic actuators and show that CNO-induced activation of these cells specifically and strongly suppresses female sexual behavior. All experiments were extremely well-designed and performed carefully and expertly with the necessary controls solidifying the conclusions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
While there are no glaring weaknesses in this study, it should be noted that a great deal of literature has pinpointed the MPOA (and specifically inhibitory cells in this area) as being critical to sexual behavior, including female mating. However, no study to my knowledge has explored self-paced female mating with such fine control over manipulating and monitoring cellular activity in this region. In addition, this study may act to inspire others to further explore the additional brain regions found to show upregulation of neural activity (Fos) during mating completion in the female using the data sets generated here.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this set of studies, the authors identify cFos activation in neurons in female mice that mated with males, and after experiencing male sexual behavior that is either restricted to appetitive behavior or including ejaculation. The medial preoptic nucleus was identified as an area with high cFos induction following ejaculation. Characterization of neurochemical phenotypes of cfos-expressing neurons showed a heterogenous distribution of activated neurons in the MPOA, including both inhibitory and excitatory cell types. Next, in vivo calcium imaging was used to show activation of Vgat and Vglut neurons in female mice MPOA after displaying sniffing of the male, experiencing male appetitive, or male consummatory sexual behavior, demonstrating significantly higher activation and of a greater subpopulation of Vgat neurons than Vglut neurons. Moreover, the greatest activation of Vgat neurons was detected following experiencing ejaculation, and ejaculation activated different subpopulations of MPOA cells than consummatory or appetitive sexual behaviors experienced by the female. Finally, pharmaco-genetic activation of the subpopulation of MPOA neurons that were previously activated following ejaculation resulted in a significant reduction of approach behavior by the female mice towards the male, interpreted as suppression of female sexual motivation. In conclusion, a subpopulation of inhibitory cells in the MPOA is activated in female mice after experiencing ejaculation, in turn contributing to the suppression of sexual approach behavior.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The current set of studies replicates previous findings that ejaculation causes longer latencies to initiate interactions with a male after receiving an ejaculation in a paced mating paradigm, which is widely validated and extensively used to investigate sexual behavior in female rodents. Studies also confirm that ejaculation increases cFos expression in the MPOA while extending prior findings with a careful analysis of the neurochemical phenotype of activated neurons. A major strength of the studies is the use of cell-specific in vivo imaging and pharmaco-genetic activation to reveal a functional role of specific neuronal ensemble within the MPOA for post-ejaculatory female sexual behavior.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The authors include an elegant manipulation of ejaculation-activated neurons in the MPOA using DREADD. However, this study was limited to show that activation of previously activated cells was sufficient to reduce approach behavior in a paced mating paradigm and receiving intromissions in a home cage mating paradigm. An inhibition approach using DREADD would have been a great complement to this study as it would have examined if activation of the cells was required. Moreover, additional tests for sexual motivation would have greatly strengthened the overall conclusions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Ishii et al used molecular genetics and behavioral analyses in mice to study the functional role of a subset of MPOA neurons in the regulation of female sexual drive. They first employed a self-paced mating assay during which a female could control the amount of interaction time with a male to assess female sexual drive after completion of mating. The authors observed that after mating completion females spent significantly less time interacting with the mated males, indicating that their sexual drive was reduced. Next, the authors performed a brain-wide analysis of neurons activated during the completion of mating and identified the MPOA as a strong candidate region. However, their activity labeling was not exclusive to neurons activated during mating completion but included all neurons activated before, during, and after the mating encounter. This makes it difficult to interpret these data. Importantly, the authors do provide in vivo calcium imaging data showing that a subset of MPOA neurons responds significantly and specifically to mating completion and not other behaviors during the social encounter. The authors performed these studies in both excitatory and inhibitory populations of the MPOA. Their analysis identified a subpopulation of inhibitory neurons that exhibit sustained increased activity for 90 sec following mating completion. Finally, the authors used chemogenetics to activate MPOA neurons during home cage mating, condition place preference, pup retrieval, and the self-paced mating assay. They found that activation of these neurons significantly reduced mating behaviors and time spent interacting with a male during the self-paced mating assay. The authors suggest that their chemogenetic activation is restricted to neurons activated during mating completion, but their activity-dependent labeling strategy resulted in chemogenetic activation of all MPOA neurons activated either before, during, or after mating.</p>
<p>The authors' experimental execution is rigorous and well-performed. Their data identify inhibitory neurons in the female MPOA as a neural locus that is activated following the completion of mating and potentially a key neural population in the regulation of female sexual motivation. However, the conclusions and interpretation of the data extend beyond what is reasonable given the limitations of the activity-dependent labeling strategy employed.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>1. The use of the self-paced mating assay in combination with neural imaging and manipulation to assess female sexual drive is innovative. The authors correctly assert that relatively little is known about how mating completion affects sexual motivation in females as compared to males. Therefore, the data collected from these studies is important and valuable.</p>
<p>2. The authors provide convincing histological data and analyses to verify and validate their brain-wide activity labeling, neural imaging, and chemogenetic studies.</p>
<p>3. The single-cell in vivo calcium imaging data are well performed and analyzed. They provide key insights into the activity profiles of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the female MPOA during mating encounters. The authors' identification of an inhibitory subpopulation of female MPOA neurons that are selectively activated following the completion of mating is fundamental for future experiments which could potentially find a molecular marker for this population and specifically manipulate these neurons to understand their role in female sexual motivation in greater detail.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. Their activity-dependent labeling strategy is not exclusive to mating completion but instead includes all neurons active before, during, and after the social encounter. In the manuscript, the authors did not discuss the time course of Fos activation or the timeframe of the FosTRAP labeling strategy. Fos continues to be expressed and is detectable for hours following neural activation. Therefore, the FosTRAP strategy also labels neurons that were activated 3 hours before the injection of 4-OHT. The original FosTRAP2 paper which is cited in this manuscript (DeNardo et al, 2019) performed a detailed analysis of the labeling window in Supplementary Figure 2 of that paper. Here is quoted text from that paper: &quot;Resultant patterns of tdTomato expression revealed that the majority of TRAPing occurred within a 6-hour window centered around the 4-OHT injection.&quot; Thus, the FosTRAP &quot;mating completion&quot; groups throughout this manuscript also include neurons activated 3 hours before mating completion, which includes neurons activated during appetitive and consummatory mating behaviors.</p>
<p>This makes all of the FosTRAP data very difficult to interpret. Compounding this is the issue that the two groups the authors compare in their experiments are females administered 4-OHT following appetitive investigation behaviors (with the male removed before mating behaviors occurred) and females administered 4-OHT following mating completion. The &quot;appetitive&quot; group labeled neurons activated only during appetitive investigation, but the &quot;completion&quot; group labeled neurons activated during appetitive investigations, consummatory mating bouts, and mating completion. Therefore, in the brain-wide analysis of Figure 2, it is impossible to identify brain regions that were activated exclusively by mating completion and not by consummatory mating behaviors. This could have been achieved if the &quot;completion&quot; group was compared to a group of females that had commenced consummatory mating behaviors but were separated from the male before mating was completed. Then, any neurons labeled by the &quot;completion&quot; FosTRAP but not the &quot;consummatory&quot; FosTRAP would be neurons specifically activated by mating completion. In the current brain-wide analysis experiments, neurons activated by consummatory behaviors and mating completion can not be disassociated.</p>
<p>This same issue is present in the interpretation of the chemogenetic activation data in Figure 6. In the experiments of Figure 6, the authors are activating neurons naturally activated during consummatory mating behaviors as well as those activated during mating completion.</p>
<p>1. This study does not definitively show that the female mice used in this study display decreased sexual motivation after the completion of mating. The females exhibit reduced interaction with males that had also just completed mating, but it is unclear if the females would continue to show reduced interaction time if given the choice to interact with a male that was not in the post-ejaculatory refractory period. Perhaps, these females have a natural preference to interact more with sexually motivated males compared to recently mated (not sexually motivated) males. To definitively show that these females exhibit decreased sexual motivation the authors should perform two control experiments: 1) provide the females with access to a fully sexually motivated male after the females have completed mating with a different male to see if interaction time changes, and 2) compare interaction time toward mated and non-mated males using the self-paced mating assay. These controls would show that the reduction in the interaction time is because the females have reduced sexual motivation and not because these females just naturally interact with sexually motivated males more than males in the post-ejaculatory refractory period.</p>
<p>2. It is unclear how the transient 90-second response of these MPOA neurons following the completion of mating causes the prolonged reduction in female sexual motivation that is at the minutes to hours timeframe. No molecular or cellular mechanism is discussed.</p>
<p>3. The authors discuss potential cell types and neural population markers within the MPOA and go into some detail in Figure S3. However, their experiments are performed with only the larger excitatory and inhibitory MPOA neural populations.</p>
