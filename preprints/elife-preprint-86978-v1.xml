<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The blood-brain barrier (BBB) controls the movement of molecules into and out of the central nervous system (CNS). Since a functional BBB forms by mouse embryonic day E15.5, we reasoned that gene cohorts expressed in CNS endothelial cells (EC) at E13.5 contribute to BBB formation, whereas adult gene signatures reflect BBB maintenance mechanisms. Supporting this hypothesis, transcriptomic analysis revealed distinct cohorts of EC genes during BBB formation and maintenance. Here we demonstrate that epigenetic regulator’s histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) control EC gene expression for BBB development and prevented Wnt/β-catenin (Wnt) target genes from being expressed in adult CNS ECs. Low Wnt activity during development modifies BBB genes epigenetically for the formation of functional BBB. As a Class-I HDAC inhibitor induces adult CNS ECs to regain Wnt activity and BBB genetic signatures that support BBB formation, our results inform strategies to promote BBB repair.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Central nervous system vessels possess a blood-brain barrier (BBB) that prevents toxins and pathogens from entering the brain. A leaky BBB can lead to deleterious consequences for CNS disorders including stroke, traumatic brain injury, and brain tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Currently, no treatment options are available to sustain and/or regenerate BBB integrity. The identification and targeting of the mechanism that forms and maintains the BBB is an attractive strategy to regain BBB integrity.</p>
<p>By comparing the EC transcriptome of peripheral and brain vessels, the genomic profile that contributes to BBB was described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Further, extensive gene expression changes in CNS ECs during development were also reported <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. However, molecular mechanisms governing BBB gene transcription and how such mechanisms contribute to BBB establishment and maintenance are unresolved.</p>
<p>Epigenetic modifications of histones and chromatin-modifying enzyme activities are critical determinants of gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) associate with specific transcription factors and participate in gene repression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. HDAC inhibitors are important experimental tools for elucidating HDAC functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, and four HDAC inhibitors are FDA-approved drugs for cancer treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. More than thirty HDAC inhibitors are being investigated in clinical trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Similarly, polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), a complex of polycomb-group proteins (such as EZH2, EED, and SUZ12), represses transcription via its methyltransferase activity that catalyzes tri-methylation of H3K27<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. An EZH2 inhibitor is FDA-approved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> for Follicular lymphoma.</p>
<p>Wnt/β-catenin (Wnt) signaling is essential for establishing the BBB <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, but the activity of this pathway declines gradually thereafter and is reported to be minimal in adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Evidence linking Wnt to the regulation of BBB genes includes an EC-specific knockout (KO) of β-catenin that affects BBB gene expression and integrity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. In CNS ECs, Wnt signaling requires the binding of Wnt ligands Wnt7a/7b to Frizzled receptors. This interaction stabilizes the intracellular signaling molecule β-catenin, by suppressing a cytoplasmic destruction complex, which would otherwise degrade β-catenin. Stabilized β-catenin translocates to the nucleus and regulates Wnt target gene transcription by interacting with DNA binding transcription factors TCF/LEF (T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancing factor). The mechanisms underlying the reduced Wnt signaling and how Wnt regulates the BBB gene transcription are not established.</p>
<p>We describe the discovery of epigenetic mechanisms responsible for regulating BBB gene expression during development, how Wnt signaling is reduced, and the significance of these mechanisms for BBB development. Furthermore, we demonstrated that HDAC inhibitors activate BBB gene cohorts expressed during BBB formation, suggesting a potential therapeutic intervention.</p>

<title>Transcriptional downregulation of key BBB genes in adult cortical ECs: evidence that distinct EC gene cohorts regulate BBB establishment versus maintenance</title>
<p>An intact, non-leaky BBB forms at E15.5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that the EC gene cohorts involved in BBB formation are expressed on E13.5, and 3-4 month-old adult CNS EC will express gene cohorts required for BBB maintenance. To test this, we defined transcriptomes of primary cortical ECs isolated from E13.5 and 3-4-month-old adults. mRNA-seq analysis revealed strong expression of EC genes including <italic>PECAM1, CDH5</italic>, and <italic>CLDN5</italic> in comparison to perivascular cell types such as pericytes, neuronal and glial genes (S.Fig-1A). To define the gene cohorts responsible for BBB formation vs. BBB maintenance, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) expressed in natural log (fold change) in E-13.5 relative to adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig-1A,B</xref>). DEGs with a P-value &lt; 0.05) were considered significant. In comparison to E13.5, 50% of genes were upregulated, 35% were downregulated in adults and 15% of genes were unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig-1C</xref>).</p>

<p>GO enrichment analysis of the DEGs identified five functional categories: angiogenesis, cell-to-cell junction, transporters, extracellular matrix, and DNA binding transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig-1D</xref>). Except for transporters, the other categories were characterized by a greater number of downregulated vs. upregulated genes. The DEGs included important BBB genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig-1E</xref>). For example, tight junction (TJ) gene <italic>CLDN1, CLDN5</italic>, BBB transporters <italic>MFSD2A, CAV1</italic>, and BBB-related transcription factors <italic>ZIC3, FOXF2</italic>, and <italic>SOX17</italic> were differentially expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig-1E</xref>). The complete dataset is available on Geo under accession number: GSE214923 and presented in supplementary table-1. Overall the transcriptomic analysis identified EC gene cohorts that expressed during the formation or maintenance of the BBB.</p>
<p>We validated the differential expression of important BBB and related genes (<italic>e.g., CLDN1, CLDN5, MFSD2A, ZIC3</italic>, and <italic>SOX17</italic>) at E-13.5, E-17.5, P0, P7, and in the adult. This analysis revealed that <italic>CLDN1, MFSD2A</italic>, and <italic>ZIC3</italic> expressions were significantly downregulated by E-17.5 and subsequent developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig-1F</xref>). Thus, the expression of these genes might be required for the establishment, but not maintenance, of the BBB. By contrast, adult expression of <italic>CLDN5</italic> was significantly upregulated compared to other developmental stages and <italic>SOX17</italic> was significant to other developmental stages except for P7(Fig-1F). Additionally, we validated the mRNA expression of CLDN11 and FOXF2 as well as the protein expression of <italic>CLDN1, CLDN5</italic>, and <italic>ZIC3</italic> (S.Fig-B&amp;C).</p>

<title>HDAC2 and PRC2 mediated transcriptional regulation of BBB genes</title>
<p>Histone deacetylases (HDACs) have critical roles in development and tissue homeostasis, and HDAC inhibitors are instructive experimental tools <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. To assess whether the transcriptional downregulation of BBB genes involves HDAC-dependent epigenetic repression, we treated adult ECs with a pan HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) for 48 hours. TSA increased <italic>CLDN1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig-2A</xref>) and <italic>ZIC3</italic> (S.Fig-2A) expression relative to the control. Since there are four major HDAC classes, class-I (HDAC 1, 2, 3, and 8), class II (HDAC 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10), class III (SIRTs 1–7), and class IV (HDAC 11), we tested whether specific HDACs mediate the repression. The class-I HDAC inhibitor MS-275 significantly upregulated <italic>CLDN1</italic>, MFSD2A and ZIC3 while downregulated <italic>CLDN5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig-2A</xref>, S.Fig-2A). No significant difference in CLDN1 mRNA expression was observed with class-II HDAC inhibitor (S.Fig-2A). In adult ECs, HDAC2 exhibited greater expression than other class I HDACs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig-2B</xref>). To analyze the HDAC2 function, we utilized siRNAs to downregulate HDAC1, HDAC2, or HDAC3 in adult ECs. Knockdown (KD) of HDAC2 significantly upregulated the repressed <italic>CLDN1, MFSD2A</italic>, and <italic>ZIC3</italic> genes and reduced <italic>CLDN5</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig-2C</xref>). By contrast, HDAC1 and HDAC3 downregulation did not affect these genes (not shown). BBB genes analyzed above were selected based on their expression patterns and to represent important functional attributes of BBBs, such as tight junctions (<italic>CLDN1</italic> and <italic>CLDN5</italic>), transporters (<italic>MFSD2A</italic>), and transcription factors (<italic>ZIC3</italic>). We used ChIP-qPCR to test whether HDAC2 directly regulates BBB gene expression in E13.5 and adult cortical EC contexts. Three primers were designed ((−)500, TSS &amp; (+)500) spanning the 1 kb region on each side of the promoter. HDAC2 occupancy was detected in the (−)and(+) 500 regions of <italic>CLDN1</italic> in adults with no significant enrichment in E13.5. <italic>ZIC3</italic> showed occupancy at all three regions (1kb) in the adult stage with E13.5 showing enrichment in TSS only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig-2D,G</xref> &amp;S.Fig2B). Conversely, HDAC2 occupied <italic>MFSD2A</italic> only at E13.5((−)500 &amp; TSS), and in <italic>CLDN5</italic> occupancy was detected at both E13.5 (1kb) and in adults ((−) &amp; (+) 500). These results link HDAC2 to the developmental control of BBB genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig-2D,G</xref> &amp; S.Fig2B).</p>
<p>In our initial screening, we found that the PRC2 inhibitor DZNEP significantly increased <italic>CLDN1</italic> expression in adult ECs (S.Fig-2A). To analyze the PRC2 function in this context, we downregulated the PRC2 subunit EZH2 from adult ECs. Compared to the control, EZH2 downregulation significantly increased <italic>CLDN1, ZIC3</italic>, and <italic>MFSD2A</italic> expression and decreased <italic>CLDN5</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>). ChiP-qPCR of PRC2 subunit EED revealed EED occupancy at various regions of <italic>CLDN1, MFSD2A</italic>, and <italic>ZIC3</italic> at E13.5 and in the adult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig2F,G</xref> &amp; S.Fig-2). EED occupied <italic>CLDN5</italic> at E13.5, but not in adult ECs. Together our data support a model in which HDAC2 and PRC2 are important determinants of EC BBB transcriptomes during BBB development.</p>

<title>Distinct histone modifications delineate the transcription program of BBB genes</title>
<p>Since HDAC2 and PRC2 are regulating multiple BBB genes we sought whether they share similar post-translational histone modifications. To examine this, we performed ChIP-qPCR of potentially involved histone marks, including the repressive marks H3K27me3, and H3K9me3 as well as the activating marks H3K4me3 and H3K9ac. We have scanned approximately 1kb genomic region surrounding the TSS of <italic>CLDN1, CLDN5, MFSD2A, ZIC3</italic>, and <italic>SOX17</italic> in E13.5 and adults.

<p>It was observed that <italic>HDAC2</italic> and <italic>EZH2</italic> KO embryos grew normally and were alive on the day of sacrifice E17.5. Significantly decreased mRNA expression of <italic>HDAC2</italic> in the whole brain analysis confirmed the loss of <italic>HDAC2</italic> (S.Fig-4). Compared to WT, <italic>HDAC2</italic> ECKO pial vessels were dilated and showed increased angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig-4B</xref>). BBB permeability was assessed in <italic>HDAC2</italic> ECKO mice using a 70KD FITC-conjugated dextran tracer. The tracer remained confined inside the vessels of E17.5 WT embryos, supporting previous findings that the BBB matures by E-15.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig-4C</xref>). Conversely in <italic>HDAC2</italic> ECKO, dextran leaked into the cortical parenchyma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig-4C</xref>).

A vascular analysis using angiotool determined that <italic>HDAC2</italic> ECKO had a significantly higher vascularized brain area than W.T., indicating that <italic>HDAC2</italic> plays a key role in angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig-4D</xref>). While the pharmacological inhibition of class I HDAC using MS-275 in timed pregnant WT mice at E-13.5 showed significant leakage of tracer into the brain parenchyma at E-15.5 compared to vehicle-treated control (S.Fig-4A). The MS-275 treated embryos also showed a thin cortex compared to the control possibly due to the leakage of the drug into the brain which affects brain development (S.Fig-4A). These findings should be taken into account when considering the clinical use of MS-275 in a developing brain. In the whole brain mRNA analysis between the <italic>HDAC2</italic> ECKO and WT showed significantly upregulated <italic>CLDN1</italic> in <italic>HDAC2</italic> ECKO (S.Fig-4B).

<title>Despite Wnt pathway activity in the adult, Wnt target genes are epigenetically repressed</title>
<p>Wnt pathway has been shown to influence BBB gene expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. However, this pathway activity is reported to be minimum in adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. In our transcriptomic analysis, 67% of Wnt signaling-related genes were downregulated in adults, while 33% were upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig-5A</xref>). Interestingly, downstream Wnt targets genes including <italic>AXIN2, LEF1</italic>, and <italic>VEGFA</italic> have downregulated in adult ECs, while the upstream Wnt pathway components like <italic>FZD4/6, LRP5</italic>, and <italic>CTNNB1</italic> were upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig-5a</xref>). Since Wnt-regulated BBB genes such as <italic>CLDN1</italic>, and <italic>ZIC3</italic> expression was also minimum in adults, we hypothesize that the Wnt pathway is still active in adult CNS ECs while Wnt target genes are epigenetically repressed.</p>
<p>To test this, we activated the Wnt pathway in E13.5 and adult ECs using identical concentrations of Wnt3a ligand or GSK3B inhibitor CHIR99021. mRNA analysis revealed that Wnt target genes <italic>AXIN2</italic> and <italic>LEF1</italic> can be significantly activated in E13.5 ECs when treated with Wnt3a or CHIR99021 while no significant activation was observed in adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig-5B</xref>). Further, validating this finding, transcriptome analysis on adult ECs after Wnt3a treatment showed only activation of one Wnt target gene CD44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig-5C</xref>). Intriguingly, the Wnt3a treatment downregulated 16 Wnt-related genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig-5C</xref>). Next using, immunohistochemistry of β-catenin in adult control and CHIR 99021 treated ECs we demonstrated that Wnt pathway activation could translocate or stabilize the Wnt transducer β-catenin into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig-5D</xref>). These results indicate that the Wnt pathway is active in adult CNS ECs.</p>
<p>Next, we investigated whether Wnt target genes are epigenetically repressed. Wnt target genes <italic>AXIN2</italic> and <italic>LEF1</italic> were significantly upregulated in adult CNS ECs when treated with <italic>HDAC2</italic> or <italic>EZH2</italic> siRNA, MS-275, and in <italic>HDAC2</italic> ECKO mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig-5E</xref> &amp; S.F-5A,B). Furthermore, the <italic>AXIN2</italic> promoter in adults showed significantly increased occupancy of HDAC2, repressive histone mark H3K27me3 in adults while active histone marks H3K4me3 and H3K9ac were significantly reduced compared to E-13.5 as analyzed by ChIP-qPCR (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref>). <italic>LEF1</italic> also showed a similar repressive histone modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig-5C</xref>). Further MS-275 and LiCl (Wnt agonist) treatment increase the AXIN2 protein expression in adult cortical vessels but not by just LiCl (S.Fig-5D). Combined, our data explain the mechanism behind the low Wnt pathway in adult CNS ECs.</p>

No significant difference was observed in <italic>CLDN5</italic> expression. E) Schematic diagram illustrating the mechanisms underlying BBB formation and maintenance led by epigenetic regulators HDAC2 and PRC2. EC gene cohorts that support BBB formation are epigenetically repressed by HDAC2 and PRC2 during development. Active Wnt signaling supports the expression of gene cohorts required for the BBB formation, while a reduction in Wnt signaling recruits HDAC2 to these gene cohorts to support the formation of a functional or intact BBB. Inhibiting HDAC2 in adult ECs induce the reacquisition of gene cohorts that support BBB formation and thus represents a potential therapeutic opportunity to repair damaged BBB.</p></caption>

<p>We next assessed whether the gene expression changes acquired by adult ECs following MS-275 treatment were reversible. To this end, we treated adult ECs with MS-275 for 48 hours and collected ECs at 48 hours of treatment and 7 days after treatment. As previously shown, <italic>CLDN1</italic> was significantly upregulated and <italic>CLDN5</italic> was significantly downregulated after 48 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig-7C</xref>). While the expression of <italic>CLDN1</italic> and <italic>CLDN5</italic> in adult ECs returned to normal in ECs collected 7 days after the treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig-7C</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we examined if human vessels show similar reactivation when treated with MS-275. To this end, the human brain vessels collected from epilepsy surgery irrespective of age and gender. We tested three genes with MS-275 treatment: <italic>CLDN1, CLDN5</italic>, and <italic>AXIN2</italic>. We found that MS-275 treatment significantly activates the expression of <italic>CLDN1</italic> and <italic>AXIN2</italic> compared to the control, with no difference in <italic>CLDN5</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig-7D</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The mechanisms that create and maintain the BBB are vitally important, but they are poorly understood. We identified EC gene cohorts that differentially support BBB formation and maintenance, describe the genetic and signaling mechanisms that establish the BBB, and present an attractive strategy to activate gene cohorts involved in BBB formation that may promote BBB repair.</p>
<p><italic>MFSD2A</italic> is required for BBB formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, and the transcription factors <italic>ZIC3</italic> and <italic>FOXF2</italic> can induce BBB markers even in peripheral ECs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Our transcriptomic analysis revealed that <italic>CLDN1, MFSD2A, ZIC3</italic>, and <italic>FOXF2</italic> were significantly expressed in E13.5 compared to adults, validating their requirement in BBB formation. Increased levels of <italic>CLDN5, PECAM, BCG1</italic>, and <italic>SOX17</italic> in adult CNS ECs point to its significance in BBB maintenance. The results of our study agree with those of prior gene expression studies, but provide new concepts regarding downstream mechanisms governing BBB gene expression. Although a high level of purity is achieved in primary EC culture, we cannot exclude the fact that transcripts from other cell populations may be identified.</p>
<p>It is not known how BBB gene transcription is regulated. In CNS ECs, HDAC2 and PRC2 directly regulate the transcription of important BBB genes including <italic>CLDN1, CLDN5, MFSD2A</italic>, and <italic>ZIC3</italic>. While HDAC2 and PRC2 commonly occupy repressed genes, we detected them at BBB genes in both active and repressive states. This result is consistent with the established dual transcriptional role of this epigenetic regulators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Furthermore, we present evidence that <italic>HDAC2</italic> is required for the formation of a functional BBB and induction of anti-angiogenic signals. Even though the loss of vascular integrity and lethality at E-13.5 was reported in non-inducible conditional <italic>EZH2</italic> KO using Tie2 Cre-mouse <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, loss of <italic>EZH2</italic> from E-13.5 did not significantly affect BBB permeability. These results indicate that, during the differentiation phase, HDAC2 initiates the transcriptional control, and PRC2 functions in a supporting mechanism. However, the KD of these regulators from adult CNS ECs induces a similar gene expression pattern indicating the possibility that PRC2 facilitates the epigenetic modification during later BBB development and maintenance.</p>
<p>Since we did not detect H3K9me3, the repression of genes involved in BBB formation is mainly mediated through H3K27me3. On varying abundance repressive histone mark H3K27me3 and active histone mark, H3K4me3 was detected in our selected BBB genes, suggesting that the promoter is modified by repressive and activating histone methylation marks. Bivalent histone states can correlate with genes transcribed at low levels, suggesting that these genes are poised for activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. In addition, we detected H3K9ac at the active and repressed BBB genes. Bivalent promoters can harbor H3K9ac. Thus, among the five BBB genes analyzed, each gene exhibits a different epigenetic signature, defined by histone acetylation and methylation. These results systematically demonstrate the complexity of epigenetic regulation in BBB genes and the evidence of unique epigenetic signatures. The data presented here is not completely representing all the histone modifications on BBB genes, as other important histone modifications such as H3K27ac and H3K14ac have not been examined.</p>
<p>It is still unknown what mechanism confers low Wnt signaling in adult CNS ECs. Our results demonstrate that Wnt pathway components are still active in adult CNS ECs, yet the Wnt target genes are epigenetically inactive. Thus, in the adult CNS ECs, Wnt pathway activation permits stabilized β-catenin to enter the nucleus. Whether this nuclear β-catenin binds to Wnt target genes is unknown. Nevertheless, we demonstrated that <italic>HDAC2</italic> and PRC2 repress Wnt target genes. Other studies have revealed that the basal or minimal Wnt pathway maintains adult BBB integrity, but also its activation prevents stroke-induced BBB damage. This also suggests the possibility of switching Wnt-regulated genes during development. Our transcriptomic analysis revealed the Wnt-regulated adult CNS EC genes associated with BBB (Table S2).</p>
<p>It is unknown how Wnt regulates BBB genes. We demonstrated that inhibiting the active Wnt pathway at E13.5 can induce the BBB gene expression pattern associated with BBB maintenance. We demonstrate that the low Wnt pathway in E13.5 causes epigenetic modifications on BBB genes mediated by <italic>HDAC2</italic>. However, the link between Wnt and epigenetic mechanisms is unclear. Since inhibiting β-catenin induce the aforementioned results, in principle, it may be mediated through β-catenin. In support of this model, β-catenin GOF during BBB development prevents the maturation of BBB and inhibits the differentiation of angiogenic vessels which results in increased brain vascularization. Similar morphological characteristics between <italic>HDAC2</italic> ECKO and β-catenin GOF point to its close association.</p>
<p>Wnt signaling in CNS ECs is believed to require Wnt7a and Wnt7b produced by neural progenitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Our transcriptomic data revealed significant expression of Wnt7a in E13.5 ECs with null expression in adults. Interestingly, adult CNS ECs showed significant activation of Wnt7a mRNA with MS-275 treatment (S.Fig7A). Moreover, β-catenin KD and GOF affect the expression of Wnt7a, and β -catenin staining after MS-275 treatment showed localization of β-catenin to the nucleus. These data indicate an innate mechanism of ECs to regulate the Wnt pathway.</p>
<p>A natural consequence of targeting epigenetic regulators or the Wnt pathway is that these mechanisms regulate numerous genes. Our mRNA sequencing results revealed that class-1 HDAC inhibitor treatment regulates EC genes associated with key functions including angiogenesis, barriergenesis, and Wnt signaling. Epidrugs are attractive therapeutics since epigenetic changes are reversible, with the potential to reestablish function after treatment. Our results support this, as the expression of <italic>CLDN1</italic> and <italic>CLDN5</italic> returns to the normal level after 7 days of treatment. Furthermore, our results illustrate the potential of MS-275 to reinstate the developmental characteristics in mice and partially in human adult CNS ECs.</p>

<p>The specific questions taken up for study by the authors – in mice of HDAC and Polycomb function in the context of vascular endothelial cell (EC) gene expression relevant to the blood-brain barrier, (BBB) – are potentially <bold>useful</bold> in the context of vascular diversification in understanding and remedying situations where BBB function is compromised. The strength of the evidence presented is <bold>incomplete</bold>, and to elaborate, it is known that the culturing of endothelial cells can have a strong effect on gene expression. This is a significant issue as we are not given how long the cells were cultured and how the above point was addressed.</p>

<p>The blood-brain barrier separates neural tissue from blood-borne factors and is important for maintaining central nervous system health and function. Endothelial cells are the site of the barrier. These cells exhibit unique features relative to peripheral endothelium and a unique pattern of gene expression. There remains much to be learned about how the transcriptome of brain endothelial cells is established in development and maintained throughout life.</p>
<p>The manuscript by Sadanandan, Thomas et al. investigates this question by examining transcriptional and epigenetic changes in brain endothelial cells in embryonic and adult mice. Changes in transcript levels and histone marks for various BBB-relevant transcripts, including Cldn5, Mfsd2a and Zic3 were observed between E13.5 and adult mice. To perform these experiments, endothelial cells were isolated from E13.5 and adult mice, then cultured in vitro, then sequenced. This approach is problematic. It is well-established that brain endothelial cells rapidly lose their organotypic features in culture (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/51276">https://elifesciences.org/articles/51276</ext-link>). Indeed, one of the primary genes investigated in this study, Cldn1, exhibits very low expression at the transcript level in vivo but is strongly upregulated in cultured ECs.</p>
<p>(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36187">https://elifesciences.org/articles/36187</ext-link> ; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://markfsabbagh.shinyapps.io/vectrdb/">https://markfsabbagh.shinyapps.io/vectrdb/</ext-link>)</p>
<p>This undermines the conclusions of the study.</p>
<p>An additional concern is that for many experiments, siRNA knockdowns are performed without validation of the efficacy of the knockdown.</p>
<p>Some experiments in the paper are promising, however. For example, the knockout of HDAC2 in endothelial cells resulting in BBB leakage was striking. Investigating the mechanisms underlying this phenotype in vivo could yield important insights.</p>

<p>Sadanandan et al describe their studies in mice of HDAC and Polycomb function in the context of vascular endothelial cell (EC) gene expression relevant to the blood-brain barrier, (BBB). This topic is of interest because the BBB gene expression program represents an interesting and important vascular diversification mechanism. From an applied point of view, modifying this program could have therapeutic benefits in situations where BBB function is compromised.</p>
<p>The study involves comparing the transcriptomes of cultured CNS ECs at E13 and adult stages and then perturbing EC gene expression pharmacologically in cell culture (with HDAC and Polycomb inhibitors) and genetically in vivo by EC-specific conditional KO of HDAC2 and Polycomb component EZH2.</p>
<p>This reviewer has several critiques of the study.</p>
<p>First, based on published data, the effect of culturing CNS ECs is likely to have profound effects on their differentiation, especially as related to their CNS-specific phenotypes. Related to this, the authors do not state how long the cells were cultured.</p>
<p>Second, the use of qPCR assays for quantifying ChIP and transcript levels is inferior to ChIPseq and RNAseq. Whole genome methods, such as ChIPseq, permit a level of quality assessment that is not possible with qPCR methods. The authors should use whole genome NextGen sequencing approaches, show the alignment of reads to the genome from replicate experiments, and quantitatively analyze the technical quality of the data.</p>
<p>Third, the observation that pharmacologic inhibitor experiments and conditional KO experiments targeting HDAC2 and the Polycomb complex perturb EC gene expression or BBB integrity, respectively, is not particularly surprising as these proteins have broad roles in epigenetic regulation in a wide variety of cell types.</p>

<p>We believe that these findings make a significant contribution to the field of CNS endothelial cell biology and blood-brain barrier. We thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Reviewers' 1 and 2 concern on endothelial cells (ECs) transcription changes on culture.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to express our gratitude to the reviewers for their critical comments. We are pleased to address the concerns raised by performing FACS sorting of the CNS ECs from E-13.5 and adult brain. However, it is important to note that both E-13.5 ECs and adult ECs were cultured in the same media. It is worth mentioning that this work was initiated in 2017, whereas the article mentioned by Reviewer 1 was published in 2020. We went through a series of standardization steps before identifying the Corning endothelial cell culture media (Cat#355054) with 2% FCS as the optimal medium for preserving EC identity in culture. Conversely, if PromoCell media (C-22110) is used, a decrease in the Wnt pathway can be observed, and the use of 5% FCS enhances the Wnt pathway in E-13.5 ECs. The article mentioned by Reviewer 1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/51276">https://elifesciences.org/articles/51276</ext-link>) did not take these differences in culture media into account. Additionally, we did not employ puromycin for obtaining pure ECs, and the ECs were cultured for a maximum of 8 days. Our in vitro study serves as a model for identifying the epigenetic regulators HDAC2 and PRC2 as controllers of BBB gene transcription, which is subsequently validated in an in vivo model.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Reviewer-1 Comment 2- An additional concern is that for many experiments, siRNA knockdowns are performed without validation of the efficacy of the knockdown</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the revised version of this manuscript, we will include validation results to demonstrate the effectiveness of siRNA knockdown experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Reviewer-1 Comment 3- Some experiments in the paper are promising, however. For example, the knockout of HDAC2 in endothelial cells resulting in BBB leakage was striking. Investigating the mechanisms underlying this phenotype in vivo could yield important insights.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your positive comment. The in vivo HDAC2 knockout experiment will serve as a validation of our in vitro findings, indicating that the epigenetic regulator HDAC2 can control the expression of endothelial cell (EC) genes involved in angiogenesis, blood-brain barrier (BBB) formation, and maturation. We are actively working on this model, and we plan to publish additional molecular data on epigenetically regulated CNS vascular development and maintenance in our future publications.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Reviewer 2 Comment-2 The use of qPCR assays for quantifying ChIP and transcript levels is inferior to ChIPseq and RNAseq. Whole genome methods, such as ChIPseq, permit a level of quality assessment that is not possible with qPCR methods. The authors should use whole genome NextGen sequencing approaches, show the alignment of reads to the genome from replicate experiments, and quantitatively analyze the technical quality of the data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's comment. While it is true that whole-genome methods such as ChIP-seq and RNA-seq provide comprehensive and high-throughput analysis compared to qPCR assays, it would be incorrect to consider qPCR as inferior. qPCR assays offer advantages in terms of sensitivity, specificity, validation, confirmation, and targeted analysis. We agree that performing a comprehensive analysis of HDAC2 and PRC2 targeted endothelial cell (EC) genes is important. We are currently in the process of generating this data, and as soon as it is complete, we will publish it accordingly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Reviewer 2 Comment-3 Third, the observation that pharmacologic inhibitor experiments and conditional KO experiments targeting HDAC2 and the Polycomb complex perturb EC gene expression or BBB integrity, respectively, is not particularly surprising as these proteins have broad roles in epigenetic regulation in a wide variety of cell types.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the comments from the reviewers. Our results provide valuable insights into the specific epigenetic mechanisms that regulate BBB genes It is important to recognize that different cell types possess stage-specific distinct epigenetic landscapes and regulatory mechanisms. Rather than having broad roles across diverse cell types, it is more likely that HDAC2 (eventhough there are several other class and subtypes of HDACs) and the Polycomb complex exhibit specific functions within the context of EC gene expression or BBB integrity.</p>
<p>Moreover, the significance of our findings is enhanced by the fact that epigenetic modifications are often reversible with the assistance of epigenetic regulators. This makes them promising targets for BBB modulation. Targeting epigenetic regulators can have a widespread impact, as these mechanisms regulate numerous genes that collectively have the potential to promote the vascular repair.</p>
<p>A practical advantage is that FDA-approved HDAC2 inhibitors, as well as PRC2 inhibitors (such as those mentioned in clinical trials NCT03211988 and NCT02601950, are already available. This facilitates the repurposing of drugs and expedites their potential for clinical translation.</p>
