<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Breakdown of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) is an early pathological hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) that blocks neuromuscular transmission, leading to muscle weakness, paralysis and, ultimately, premature death. Currently, no therapies exist that can prevent progressive motor neuron degeneration, muscle denervation or paralysis in ALS. Here, we report important advances in the development of an optogenetic, neural replacement strategy that can effectively restore innervation of severely affected skeletal muscles in the aggressive SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse model of ALS, thus providing an interface to selectively control the function of targeted muscles using optical stimulation. We also identify a specific approach to confer complete survival of allogeneic replacement motor neurons. Furthermore, we demonstrate that an optical stimulation training paradigm can prevent atrophy of reinnervated muscle fibers and results in a 10-fold increase in optically-evoked contractile force. Together, these advances pave the way for an assistive therapy that could benefit all ALS patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The progressive degeneration of motor neurons that occurs in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the most common adult motor neuron disease (MND), affects almost all cellular components of the neuromuscular system, including cortical and spinal motor neurons, interneurons <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Crabé et al. (2020)</xref></bold></italic>, glial cells <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Van Harten et al. (2021)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Vahsen et al. (2021)</xref></bold></italic>, as well as muscle <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Loeffer et al. (2016)</xref></bold></italic>. Motor axons, contained within peripheral nerves, serve as the final common relay for transmission of motor signals that control all voluntary muscle contraction and movement. However, one of the earliest characteristic pathological features of ALS involves “die-back” of motor axon terminals <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fischer et al. (2004)</xref></bold></italic> and breakdown of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), the specialized synapses between motor axon terminals and muscle fibres. Effectively, this represents a single point of failure that permanently blocks motor signal transmission, irrespective of the condition of central motor circuits involved in coordination of movement signals. This results in an inexorable progression of muscle weakness, atrophy and, ultimately, complete paralysis, eventually leading to premature death. The median survival time in ALS, from initial onset of symptoms to death, typically as a result of respiratory complications, is only 20-48 months <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chiò et al. (2009)</xref></bold></italic>.</p>
<p>To date, over 20 monogenic mutations that cause ALS have been identified, although these still only account for 10% of total cases, with the remaining 90% being classified as sporadic ALS <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Mathis et al. (2019)</xref></bold></italic>. The downstream cellular and molecular pathomechanisms underlying neurodegeneration in ALS are extremely complex and include dysregulation of proteostasis, autophagy, RNA metabolism and axon transport, as well as excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mejzini et al. (2019)</xref></bold></italic>. Given the disparate causes and complex disease mechanisms, development of an effective therapy has proven extremely challenging and there are currently no effective treatments capable of arresting the progressive paralysis that occurs in ALS <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brown and Al-Chalabi (2017)</xref></bold></italic>. Even emergent gene therapy approaches, such as antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that have shown early promise in clinical trials <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Miller et al. (2013)</xref></bold></italic>, are unlikely to benefit the majority of patients with sporadic ALS and will not replace degenerated motor neurons or restore motor function once it has been lost.</p>
<p>Similarly, efforts to develop cell therapy approaches for ALS have, so far, primarily been aimed at slowing the degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord by providing neurotrophic factor (NTF) support through intraspinal engraftment of foetally-derived neural stem cells (NSCs) <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Feldman et al. (2014)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Goutman et al. (2018)</xref></bold></italic> or intrathecal delivery of autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that are modified to overexpress NTFs <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cudkowicz et al. (2022)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Berry et al. (2019)</xref></bold></italic>. Whilst these approaches were shown to significantly slow disease progression in transgenic animal models of ALS <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Xu et al. (2006)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Yan et al. (2006)</xref></bold></italic>, clinical trials in ALS patients have shown only a modest therapeutic effect in the case of intraspinal NSC grafts <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Glass et al. (2012)</xref></bold></italic> and no overall benefit of intrathecal MSC delivery <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cudkowicz et al. (2022)</xref></bold></italic> Given the highly invasive surgical laminectomy required to engraft NSCs into the ventral horn of the spinal cord, only localized populations of motor neurons in the lumbar and/or cervical region were targeted, however, the surgical procedure was generally well tolerated and the approach was proven to be safe in clinical trials <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Feldman et al. (2014)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Glass et al. (2016)</xref></bold></italic>. Moreover, these clinical trials have provided evidence that specific muscle functions can be preserved for longer in some ALS patients <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mazzini et al. (2019)</xref></bold></italic>. Importantly, this pioneering approach provides a precedent for implementation of an allogeneic stem cell-based therapy and also shows that ALS patients can tolerate a 6 month period of immuno-suppression <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mazzini et al. (2015)</xref></bold></italic>, which appears to be sufficient to confer long term survival of engrafted cells <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tadesse et al. (2014)</xref></bold></italic>. Nonetheless, it appears unlikely that this approach will be able to restore motor function once it has been lost, since the NSCs do not replace lost motor neurons, and any therapeutic effect has so far been shown to be transient <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Goutman et al. (2018)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mazzini et al. (2019)</xref></bold></italic>. Therefore, there remains an urgent unmet need to develop novel therapies that can rescue muscle innervation and maintain muscle function in ALS patients.</p>
<p>We have previously demonstrated a novel proof-of-concept strategy to overcome muscle denervation and restore control of muscle contraction in a nerve injury model of muscle paralysis that could have major therapeutic value for restoring function of any targeted muscle or group of muscles in ALS patients <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bryson et al. (2014)</xref></bold></italic>. Briefly, optogenetically-modified replacement motor neurons, derived from murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs), were engrafted into distal branches of peripheral nerves supplying specific lower hindlimb flexor and extensor target muscles in wild-type mice that had undergone a nerve ligation injury. Our results showed that the engrafted motor neurons were able to project axons from the graft site to the target muscles where they formed de novo NMJs. Due to the ectopic location of the engrafted motor neurons, outside the central nervous system (CNS), they do not receive endogenous motor signals, and must therefore be exogenously activated. Expression of the blue-light sensitive channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) protein <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Nagel et al. (2003)</xref></bold></italic> in the engrafted motor neurons conferred the ability to selectively activate these engrafted neurons and thereby control the contractile function of the target muscle using acute optical stimulation <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bryson et al. (2014)</xref></bold></italic>. The aim of this neural replacement strategy is therefore to provide a biological interface capable of rendering any target muscle receptive to control signals transmitted by optical stimulation to engrafted motor neurons <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bryson et al. (2016)</xref></bold></italic>. Importantly, we have recently developed a prototype 64-channel stimulation and recording device capable of controlling multiple independent intraneural graft sites that could be used to elicit coordinated function of large numbers of muscles, in order to restore useful motor functions <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Liu et al. (2022)</xref></bold></italic>.</p>
<p>This novel approach to restore control of paralyzed muscles in ALS patients, using a combination of cell replacement and optical stimulation, has several key advantages over existing cell replacement and electrical stimulation strategies, including: i) the ability to engraft motor neurons peripherally, in close proximity to targeted muscles, which greatly accelerates the rate of reinnervation and reduces the period of denervation, consequently ameliorating denervation-induced muscle atrophy; ii) avoidance of engrafting replacement cells into the neurotoxic environment that exists within the CNS of ALS patients and the necessity for reinnervating axons of CNS-engrafted motor neurons to overcome the inhibitory CNS:PNS barrier in order to exit the CNS and grow the often long distances to target muscles; iii) specificity of optical stimulation to the engrafted ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons avoids painful off-target activation of sensory afferents or aberrant activation of endogenous motor axons associated with electrical nerve stimulation (ENS); and critically, iv) the ability to recruit motor units in correct physiological order using optical nerve stimulation (ONS) <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Llewellyn et al. (2010)</xref></bold></italic>, avoids the problem of rapid muscle fatigue associated with ENS and incorrect, non-physiological motor unit recruitment. Furthermore, ENS-mediated control of muscle function depends on the presence of surviving motor axons and, since these are progressively lost during the course of disease progression in ALS, the ability of ENS to induce muscle contraction is steadily eroded. More importantly, it has recently been shown that ENS, applied to the phrenic nerve to assist respiratory function in two separate clinical trials in ALS patients <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">McDermott et al. (2016)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gonzalez-Bermejo et al. (2016)</xref></bold></italic> accelerated diaphragm muscle denervation, which likely contributed to a significant reduction in patient life-span <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Guimarães-Costa et al. (2019)</xref></bold></italic>. Therefore, it is unlikely that ENS will ever be suitable for artificial control of critical muscle function in ALS patients. In contrast, optogenetic stimulation <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Henderson et al. (2009)</xref></bold></italic>, in combination with neural replacement, represents a safe alternative approach to artificially restore innervation and function of paralyzed muscles in ALS.</p>
<p>In the current study, we sought to optimize critical elements of this novel therapeutic strategy and to determine whether ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons can be used to successfully restore innervation, induce muscle contraction and prevent atrophy of targeted muscles in a model of ALS using the highly aggressive SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse model of ALS.</p>

<title>Host-vs-graft rejection causes loss of most intraneural ESC-MNs allografts</title>
<p>ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons were derived from our previously characterized mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) line <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bryson et al. (2014)</xref></bold></italic> and differentiated using a well-established protocol <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wichterle et al. (2002)</xref></bold></italic>. Since these donor ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons were generated from an mESC line originating from the 129S1SvImJ mouse strain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) and recipient mice SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice were on a congenic C57BL/6J genetic background, they constitute an allogeneic source of donor cells. Importantly, allogeneic cells are likely to provide a more cost-effective, off-the-shelf cell therapy platform, compared to generating individual, patient-specific batches of cells suitable for autologous engraftment. Therefore, an important initial objective of this study was to identify an immunosuppression regimen capable of preventing host-vs-graft rejection of allogeneic ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons to enable their innervation of target muscles in recipient SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice.</p>
<p>In the absence of any immunosuppression, the survival rate of ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neuron grafts at 35 d post engraftment, was extremely low (<italic>&lt;</italic>5%) in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice. However, in the rare cases where the engrafted ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons did survive, we observed robust intramuscular axon growth and partial reinnervation of NMJs, even at very late-stage disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="vid1">Video 1</xref>). Furthermore, acute optical stimulation of the engrafted ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons was able to induce tetanic contraction of the target muscle in these SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), although these were weak in magnitude. Interestingly, assessment of shorter timepoints revealed that engrafted ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons were capable of surviving for up to 14 days (data not shown). It is therefore likely that the poor long-term survival was due to host-vs-graft rejection of the engrafted cells, rather than disease-related toxicity. These findings suggest that if the engrafted motor neurons can evade the host immune response, they can functionally reinnervate target muscles for a therapeutically relevant timescale in this highly aggressive model of ALS.</p>

<title>Tacrolimus (FK506) overcomes ESC-MN allograft rejection but inhibits muscle innervation</title>
<p>In an effort to enhance graft survival, we first tested the calcineurin inhibitor, tacrolimus (FK506), which is not only routinely used to facilitate solid organ allograft survival in humans but has also been reported to promote axon regeneration after nerve injury in rats <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gold et al. (1995)</xref></bold></italic>. Cohorts of wild-type and SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) were treated with FK506 (5mg, kg<sup>-1</sup>, d<sup>-1</sup>; dose selected based on evidence of axon regeneration studies) from the time of intraneural ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neuron engraftment; graft survival and muscle reinnervation were then assessed 30-35d post-engraftment. Although FK506 did enable robust ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neuron allograft survival, at the graft site, in all animals examined (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), we identified three major problems with this immunosuppressant agent. Firstly, although the engrafted motor neurons were able to survive and project axons along peripheral nerve branches and within the targeted lower hindlimb muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), FK506 completely prevented muscle fibre reinnervation, evidenced by lack of response to acute ONS (data not shown) and complete absence of ChR2<sup>+</sup>/YFP<sup>+</sup> NMJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) in both SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> (n = 8) and nerve-ligated wild-type mice (n = 4). Secondly, exuberant growth of carry-over pluripotent stem cells led to intraneural tumour formation in most mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), which resulted in overt hindlimb motor deficits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="vid2">Video 2</xref>). Thirdly, in partial agreement with previous reports in rats <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aydin et al. (2004)</xref></bold></italic>, FK506 prevented body mass increase and/or induced body mass decline in a subset (44.4%; n = 8/18) of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2-figure supplement 1A</xref>); this effect was less evident in wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2-figure supplement 1B</xref>). Onset of body mass decline in B6.SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice is highly consistent and typically occurs at 115 days in <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hayworth and Gonzalez-Lima (2009)</xref></bold></italic>, indicating that, at this relatively high dose, FK506 may be preferentially toxic or may exacerbate disease phenotype in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice.</p>

</fig>
<p>Since peripheral neuropathy is a known adverse event associated with calcineurin inhibitors <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arnold et al. (2013)</xref></bold></italic>, it is possible that FK506 treatment alone may adversely affect endogenous or engrafted motor axons. Indeed, examination of the cross-sectional area distribution of total (ie. sensory and motor) and motor neuron axons in branches of the sciatic nerve in FK506-treated SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> and WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) revealed a significant loss of axons that affected most axonal calibres in the tibial nerve in wild-type and SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">C</xref>). A more pronounced loss of total and motor axons, spanning medium to large sized axonal calibres, was observed in the common peroneal nerve branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">E</xref>), which indicates that FK506 can not only exacerbate ongoing motor axon loss in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice but can also induce motor axon loss even in wild-type mice. Importantly, these neuropathy-like effects appear to be specific to FK-506, since an alternative immunosuppressant, H57-597 mAb (discussed in detail below), did not significantly alter total or motor axon size distribution or total axon counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3-figure supplement 2</xref>), compared to untreated SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice.</p>

<p>Since FK506 is known to suppress myoblast proliferation and differentiation <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hong et al. (2002)</xref></bold></italic> and can cause rare cases of myopathy in humans <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Breil and Chariot (1999)</xref></bold></italic>, it is also possible that the FK506-dependent prevention of muscle reinnervation by engrafted ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons is due to a muscle specific effect. In any case, these findings clearly show that FK506 is unsuitable as an immunosuppressant to support ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neuron allograft survival and, indeed, suggest that long-term administration at this relatively high dose should be avoided in ALS patients. Importantly, however, the complete protection of engrafted ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons by FK506 did confirm that host-vs-graft rejection was responsible for the poor long-term graft survival observed in the absence of immunosuppression, rather than disease related neurotoxicity.</p>

<title>T-cell modulatory immunosuppression confers graft survival and target muscle innervation</title>
<p>In light of the deleterious effects of FK506, and given our aim of conferring compatibility of allogeneic ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons as a universal cell therapy for ALS, we sought to identify a more specific form of immunosuppression that avoids the negative effects of FK506 yet supports long term graft survival. Therefore, we investigated the T-cell receptor-beta (TC-beta) targeting monoclonal antibody, mAb H57-597, which has previously been shown to effectively promote long-term heart allograft survival in mice <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Miyahara et al. (2012)</xref></bold></italic> In addition, since our findings indicated that immunosuppression results in a greater risk of tumour formation from carry-over pluripotent stem cells, differentiated ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons were also pre-treated with mitomycin-C (MMC; 2 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml for 2 hrs) prior to engraftment, to eliminate tumorigenic cells <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Magown et al. (2016)</xref></bold></italic>, to further enhance the translational potential. MMC-treated ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons were unilaterally engrafted into the tibial nerve of symptomatic SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice (aged 95.7 ±4.6 days) in conjunction with transient H57-597 mAb delivery (1mg, kg-1; i.p. injection at 0, 1-, 3-, 7- and 14-days post-engraftment). The extent of reinnervation and the ability to optically control the function of the triceps surae (TS) muscle group in the lower hindlimb of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice was then assessed at late-stage disease (133 ±6.9 d; n = 12) by determining the physiological response of the reinnervated muscles to acute ONS of the engrafted motor neurons followed by histological analysis of muscle and nerve. Histological analysis confirmed that in mAb H57-597 treated animals, engrafted ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons were present in all recipient SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice (n &gt; 84 to date). Importantly, there was significant axonal projection within intramuscular nerve branches and robust reinnervation of muscle fibres in the targeted TS muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="vid3">Video 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="vid4">4</xref>).

Since the peripherally-engrafted reinnervating motor neurons are inactive during the post-engraftment period and progressive muscle atrophy is ongoing, only 10.5% of endplates are innervated by engrafted ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Importantly, these reinnervated end-plates are functional, since acute in vivo ONS of the engrafted ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons in the exposed sciatic nerve of late-stage disease SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice at 133 ±7.2 days of age (37.7 ±5.1 days post-engraftment; n = 12), induced positive contractile responses in all animals, although the amplitude of the maximal contractile force was still weak (0.8 ± 0.2 g; n = 11).</p>

<title>Motor neuron subtype identity does not affect response to optical stimulation</title>
<p>In an effort to increase the amplitude of the contractile response of the target muscle to optical stimulation we next tested whether engraftment of motor neurons with a fast-firing subtype identity may be more suitable than engraftment of predominantly slow-firing motor neurons by using alternative differentiation protocols.32 The stronger, predominantly fast-twitch, gastrocnemius component of the TS muscle group is usually innervated by fast-firing/fast-fatigable (FF) motor neurons, which are known to have the capacity to innervate many more individual muscle fibres per motor unit than slow-firing motor neurons, which normally innervate a much smaller number of weaker, slow-twitch muscle fibres, predominantly within the soleus and plantaris regions of the triceps surae. MMC-treated ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons, differentiated to yield FF subtype identity motor neurons, were engrafted into the tibial nerve of (106 ±7.2 days) SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice, in combination with transient H57-597 mAb treatment. Maximum isometric muscle contraction of the TS muscle in response to acute optical stimuli was then determined at the same age (133.9 ±7.2 days, n = 13) as previous grafts of predominantly slow-firing motor neurons (133 ±6.9 days, n = 11). This physiological analysis revealed that the motor neuron subtype identity did not significantly affect amplitude of the muscle response to acute optical stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4-figure supplement 1A</xref>) and that the maximum contractile force elicited by ONS remained extremely weak compared to supra-maximal ENS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4-figure supplement 1B</xref>). This result implies that, unlike during normal neuromuscular development, motor neuron subtype identity is not an important determinant of muscle fibre innervation in the mixed fibre type triceps surae muscle. This finding has significance for future clinical translation, since only a single subtype of motor neuron may be required to innervate a variety of different muscles. Only MMC-treated motor neurons with a slow-firing medial motor column identity were used in the subsequent experiments reported here. Since modification of motor neuron subtype identity did not enhance contractile response, our next challenge was to identify an effective method to enhance reinnervation and force generating capacity of the targeted muscle in response to optical stimulation.</p>

<title>Optical stimulation training significantly enhances target muscle force generation</title>
<p>Spinal motor circuit development <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Milner and Landmesser (1999)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Li et al. (2005)</xref></bold></italic> and NMJ formation/maintenance <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sanes and Lichtman (1999)</xref></bold></italic> are known to be activity-dependent processes, thus, without regular stimulation, although peripherally engrafted ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons may survive, they are unlikely to form mature NMJs and will therefore have little effect on declining muscle function and atrophy in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice. Moreover, paralysis and atrophy of affected muscles proceed unchecked in the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse model of ALS. We therefore investigated whether regular activation of the engrafted ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons, in conjunction with H57-597 mAb treatment, could enhance NMJ maturation and maximize the ability of target muscles to generate contractile force in response to acute optical stimulation in late-stage SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice. To do this, we adapted a wireless, fully implantable optical stimulation system,33 in order to implement a daily optical stimulation training regimen for engrafted mice. First, we modified the PCB design to simplify assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5-figure supplement 2A</xref>, implemented a new encapsulation method to ensure long term survival of the devices after implantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5-figure supplement 2B</xref>) and incorporated an RF signal switch and pulse controller to deliver precisely timed RF pulses to power a 470nm light emitting diode (LED) connected to the implantable device (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5-figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>The modified optical stimulation devices were then surgically implanted in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice concomitantly with intraneural engraftment of ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons, with the trailing LED positioned in close apposition to the graft site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Commencing at 14 d post-engraftment, to allow growing ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor axons sufficient time to reach the target muscle, the mice were transferred to a custom built chamber located above a resonance-frequency induction cavity for 1 hr per day, in order to undertake optical stimulation training (OST; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="vid5">Video 5</xref>), using a bespoke pulse pattern that was empirically determined to elicit maximum contraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5-figure supplements 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">5</xref>), followed by a 2 s rest interval. Following daily OST in engrafted SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice for 21 days, isometric muscle tension physiology was performed at late-stage disease to determine the maximal contractile force of the TS muscle elicited by acute ONS of the exposed sciatic nerve graft site. In confirmation of our hypothesis, there was a highly significant, 9.4-fold, increase in the maximal tetanic force (7.5 ±0.94 g versus 0.8 ±0.2 g; p = ≤0.000001) elicited by ONS in the engrafted OST group of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice at late-stage disease, compared to age-matched untrained SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice (132.4 ±6.8 days versus 133 ±6.9 days; n = 7 and 11, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C-G</xref>), although OST did not alter contractile rate characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5-figure supplement 6A-C</xref>). Moreover, quantitative comparison of the maximum force elicited by ONS compared to ENS of TS muscles in late-stage SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>), showed that in mice that underwent OST, acute ONS elicits up to 22.7% (± 4.5) of total residual muscle force produced by supra-maximal ENS, which activates both endogenous and engrafted motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>), in contrast to only 1.46% (± 0.18) in untrained SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5-figure supplement 7A and 7B</xref>). This represents a remarkable &gt;13-fold improvement in force generation. In engrafted SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice that did not undergo OST, the extremely weak twitch contractions in response to ONS precluded interrogation of individual motor unit force values and determination of motor units number estimates (MUNE) in most mice. In contrast, in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice that underwent OST, the significantly increased contractile response to ONS enabled clear separation of individual motor unit values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>), enabling MUNE values to be determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5-figure supplement 6D</xref>). Furthermore, as we previously reported in nerve-ligated WT mice,22 delivery of repetitive ONS pulses (250 ms bursts of 20 Hz illumination, every 1 s, for 180 s duration) to induce rhythmic, submaximal contraction of the TS muscle did not induce rapid muscle fatigue, whereas equivalent pulses of ENS stimulation of the contralateral TS muscle did result in rapid muscle fatigue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). This observation has significant implications for the ability to control repetitive motor functions in ALS patients.</p>

<title>Optical stimulation training prevents atrophy of reinnervated muscle fibres</title>
<p>Finally, having established that optical stimulation training significantly enhances the maximal force elicited by optical stimulation of engrafted ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons in late-stage SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice, we examined whether long-term optical stimulation training could also prevent atrophy of reinnervated muscle fibres. Since NMJs comprise an extremely small volume of the entire muscle, high-resolution 3D imaging of the entire muscle to determine muscle fibre innervation status and fibre diameter information is not feasible. Therefore, we developed a novel technique, termed digital Cross-sectional area Analysis from Longitudinal Muscle Sections (dCALMS), in order to assess these properties. This involved 3D reconstruction and analysis of regions of interest, obtained from 30<italic>μ</italic>m thick longitudinal TS muscle sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) from ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neuron engrafted, late-stage SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice that had undergone OST.

The dCALMS analysis revealed that the average CSA of muscle fibres innervated by engrafted ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons were similar in size to fibres still innervated by residual endogenous motor neurons (922.3 versus 1018.3 <italic>μ</italic>m<sup>2</sup>; p = ≤0.85; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Importantly, the CSA of muscle fibres innervated by ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons was significantly greater than fibres with completely denervated endplates (average CSA = 525.4 <italic>μ</italic>m2; p = ≤0.00001) or fibres whose innervation status could not be determined (average CSA = 668.8 <italic>μ</italic>m2; p ≤0.0003), since the endplate was outside the scanned region of interest.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study shows for the first time that replacement stem cell-derived motor neurons can robustly and reliably reinnervate target muscles in the highly aggressive SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse model of ALS, even when engrafted after onset of overt symptoms; moreover, the restored innervation can be maintained even until extremely late-stage disease. Furthermore, our findings suggest that engrafted ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons can not only provide an interface to safely and selectively control the function of targeted muscle but, also, that regular optical stimulation training (OST) can be used to: i) reinforce connectivity between engrafted motor neurons and muscle fibres; ii) significantly enhance the maximal force elicited by optical stimulation of the targeted muscle; and iii) prevent atrophy of muscle fibres that are reinnervated by engrafted motor neurons. The highly significant improvements in muscle innervation, atrophy prevention and maximum contractile force, as a result of the daily OST regimen, confirms that stimulation-induced activity is necessary to maximize connectivity between engrafted motor neurons and their target muscles.</p>
<p>The prevailing view in the ALS field is that spinal motor neuron pathology first manifests at the nerve terminal and that muscle fibres are likely to actively contribute to degeneration of endogenous motor neurons in ALS <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Scaricamazza et al. (2021)</xref></bold></italic>. Our findings clearly demonstrate that affected muscles, even in the highly aggressive SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> ALS model, remain receptive to reinnervation by healthy engrafted motor neurons, even until late-stage disease. Moreover, once target muscles have been reinnervated, this approach enables implementation of a safe muscle training/exercise regimen that can be used to preserve muscle integrity and prevent irreversible muscle wasting that otherwise occurs as a result of progressive neurodegeneration in ALS <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Mora (1989)</xref></bold></italic>. Since skeletal muscles are not simply biomechanical actuators, but have complex functions in overall metabolic homeostasis, thermoregulation, venous return and maintenance of blood volume, the ability to prevent muscle atrophy using OST, is likely, by itself, to have major health benefits for ALS patients. In contrast, the use of electrical nerve stimulation (ENS) to control muscle function or, indeed, exercise programs is likely to accelerate degeneration of remaining motor axon terminals <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Guimarães-Costa et al. (2019)</xref></bold></italic>, and is therefore unlikely to be safe. Unlike ENS, the highly selective nature of ONS does not activate or interfere with endogenous motor neuron function and due to its ability to recruit motor units in physiological order, ONS has the added significant benefit of avoiding rapid muscle fatigue <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Llewellyn et al. (2010)</xref></bold></italic>. The ability to combat muscle atrophy, using OST, could extend the ability of targeted to execute functionally useful movements, potentially indefinitely in ALS patients.</p>
<p>Since differentiation methods that yield either fast-firing or slow-firing motor neurons did not appear to affect the ability of engrafted motor neurons to innervate the mixed fibre type TS muscle group in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice, motor neuron subtype identity appears to be redundant in this case. Therefore, a single type of motor neuron, produced at scale, could potentially be used to target a large number of different muscles in each patient. This has advantages in terms of simplifying the regulatory approval process, since the donor motor neurons would be produced in exactly the same way, irrespective of the graft site or recipient.</p>
<p>Indeed, another key finding of this study that could streamline future translation of this therapeutic strategy, is the identification of a TCR-<italic>β</italic> targeting antibody, H57-597 mAb, as an effective mediator of allograft survival. Existing T-cell targeting monoclonal antibodies, such as OKT-3, have been clinically approved <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Page et al. (2013)</xref></bold></italic> and, importantly, this form of immunosuppression overcomes severe adverse effects that we observed with the commonly used CNI-based immunosuppressant, tacrolimus (FK506). Our data shows that H57-597 mAb treatment was well tolerated during transient administration from symptom-onset up until late-stage disease in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice, however, the aggressive disease progression in this model precludes investigation of longer-term effects and it remains to be seen how long-term TCR-<italic>β</italic>-based immunosuppression may be tolerated in ALS patients. A similar immunosuppression regimen involving a CD25 (IL2) targeting monoclonal antibody, Basiliximab, along with glucocorticoid and tacrolimus maintenance therapy, has been shown to be safe but poorly tolerated in ALS patients, as an independent investigative approach <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fournier et al. (2018)</xref></bold></italic>, as well as part of a separate clinical trial assessing intraspinal grafts of neural precursor cells in ALS patients <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mazzini et al. (2019)</xref></bold></italic>. Therefore, immunosuppression per se, is not an impediment to this strategy.</p>
<p>The use of allogeneic donor cells, with a safe and effective immunosuppression regimen, means that a future cell therapy could potentially be universally compatible with all ALS patients, which would significantly reduce costs and simplify the regulatory approval process, compared to individually tailored autologous cell grafts. Of course, further studies will be required to ensure that human-compatible, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived donor motor neurons are able to function in the same manner as allogeneic mouse ESC-derived motor neurons. The generation of HLA-matched super donor hiPSC lines may further mitigate the need for immunosuppression <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Turner et al. (2013)</xref></bold></italic>, however, immunogenicity of the ChR2 protein could mean that some form of immunosuppression may be necessary for any optogenetic therapy in the peripheral nervous system, including viral delivery <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Maimon et al. (2018)</xref></bold></italic>.</p>
<p>The anatomical separation of specific nerve branches in humans means that this approach could be used to target and independently control large numbers of muscles in each individual ALS patient. However, it will be first necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy in a relatively low risk muscle to restore a simple motor function. For example, the common peroneal nerve is highly accessible from a neurosurgical perspective and existing ENS devices, developed to correct foot drop for other neurological disorders <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hausmann et al. (2015)</xref></bold></italic>, could be readily adapted to assist ambulatory function in early-stage ALS patients. In the longer term, existing multichannel ENS devices, which have been developed to control more complex ADLs in high-level spinal cord injury (SCI) patients <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Memberg et al. (2014)</xref></bold></italic>, could also be adapted into a minimally invasive, transcutaneous optical stimulation device <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Maimon et al. (2017)</xref></bold></italic>. This combinatorial therapeutic strategy, comprising allogeneic donor cells, an effective immunosuppression regimen and optical stimulation device, is highly compatible with the rapidly evolving field of brain computer interface (BCI) technology. BCI could be used to decode a paralyzed patient’s intention to perform a given movement in order to control the activity of the engrafted motor neurons, which provide the necessary interface to execute the intended movement via a wearable optical stimulation device. This novel approach would entirely bypass the severe damage that occurs throughout the entire CNS in ALS patients and enable autologous control of movement. Moreover, this strategy also has broad utility for a wide range of other neurogenic causes of paralysis, such as spinal cord injury and stroke.</p>
<p>Although the findings of this study clearly demonstrate that our combinatorial cell therapy approach is effective in a highly aggressive mouse model of ALS, further investigation is required in order to confirm that the strategy can be applied to alternate model of ALS, with a longer lifespan, in order to fully explore the long-term efficacy of the approach, particularly in terms of chronic allograft survival using a transient immunosuppression approach. It is possible that some form of maintenance therapy may also be required to confer long term graft survival. Of course, the biggest challenge will be to demonstrate that human optogenetically-modified motor neurons, derived from either induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) or human ESCs, are capable of reinnervating target muscles in the same manner as we have demonstrated for mESC-derived motor neurons. It will also be necessary to scale this cell therapy strategy up, using larger animal models that more accurately recapitulate human-scale anatomy.</p>
<p>Despite these remaining challenges, the findings of this study provide strong support for this novel cell therapy, which, if successful, could finally begin to deliver major health benefits for ALS patients.</p>

<title>mESC motor neuron differentiation</title>
<p>The Channelrhodopsin2-YFP expressing mESCs (Clone C9G) used in this study were generated as previously described<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bryson et al. (2014)</xref></bold></italic>. Motor neuron differentiation was performed according to a standard protocol developed by Wichterle et al <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wichterle et al. (2002)</xref></bold></italic> for production of predominantly slow-firing medial motor column (MMC) identity motor neurons and an updated “caudalized-ventralized” (CV) protocol, also developed by the Wichterle group <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Peljto et al. (2010)</xref></bold></italic>, that produces a higher proportion of motor neurons with fast-firing properties. Following differentiation on Day 5 (or Day 7 for the C-V protocol), embryoid bodies (EBs) containing differentiated motor neurons were dissociated and total cells were resuspended in PBS at a concentration of 50,000 cell/<italic>μ</italic>l. Where indicated, mitomycin-C (1<italic>μ</italic>g/<italic>μ</italic>l) was added to the EBs for 2 hrs prior to dissociation. Nile Blue A (0.0002% final concentration) was added to the cell suspension and the cells were kept on ice until engraftment. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of mESC lines (Clone C9G, HBG3 and a C57BL/6J mESC line for reference) was carried out by Charles River Laboratories. See the Supplementary materials for full details 1.</p>

<title>Mice</title>
<p>All procedures and experiments involving animals were carried out under License from the UK Home Office in accordance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (Amended Regulations 2012), following ethical approval from the UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology Animal Welfare Ethical Review Body (AWERB), and in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines. B6.Cg-Tg(SOD1*G93A)1Gur/J mice (The Jackson Laboratory, stock number 004435) were bred specifically for this study by mating presymptomatic male transgene carriers with congenic C57BL/6J females (Charles River Laboratories)1.</p>

<title>Intraneural engraftment of mESC-derived ChR2+ motor neurons</title>
<p>Surgical engraftment of ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons was performed under aseptic conditions, as previously described <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bryson et al. (2014)</xref></bold></italic>. Briefly, 1<italic>μ</italic>l of dissociated EB cell suspension (50,000 cells) was injected into the tibial nerve close to the trifurcation point of the sciatic nerve, using a 5<italic>μ</italic>l Hamilton syringe equipped with a customized 33G needle. Where indicated, an implantable optical stimulation device was inserted through the same surgical incision and positioned subcutaneously under the skin on the back; the trailing LED was fixed with sutures to the overlying muscles at the graft site during wound closure. Immunosuppression, as indicated, was initiated at the time of surgical engraftment. See supplementary materials for full details1.</p>

<sec id="s4d">
<title>Implantable optical stimulation devices and power transmission system</title>
<p>Optical stimulation devices were largely produced as described by Montgomery et al. <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Montgomery et al. (2015)</xref></bold></italic>, with minor, but essential, modifications to the PCB design and encapsulation method. Similarly, the power transmission system used to activate the implanted LED devices was also largely as described by Montgomery et al. <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Montgomery et al. (2015)</xref></bold></italic>, however, a Solid State Switch (MiniCircuits; ZX80-DR230-S+), controlled by a USB-TTL Interface (Prizmatix), was used to generate specific optical stimulation patterns. Engrafted SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice that underwent daily optical stimulation training were placed in the stimulation chamber for 1 hr/day from post-engraftment day 14 until termination of the experiment at late-stage disease (132.4 ±6.8 days). See the Supplementary materials for full details1.</p>

<sec id="s4e">
<title>Isometric muscle tension physiological analysis</title>
<p>At the experimental end-point, engrafted SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice underwent isometric muscle tension physiology, in order to accurately determine the contractile properties of the triceps surae muscle in response to acute optical stimulation, as previously described <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bryson et al. (2014)</xref></bold></italic>, with the following modifications: a PowerLab 4/30 stimulation and recording system (AD Instruments) was used to deliver bespoke electrical stimulation signals, either as direct constant voltage pulses applied to the nerve via bipolar electrodes for electrical nerve stimulation (ENS), or used as a 5V TTL signal to activate a 470nm LED light-source (CoolLED; pe100), delivered to the exposed sciatic nerve via a liquid lightguide for optical nerve stimulation (ONS); stimulation program available on request. LabChart software (AD Instruments) was used for automated data analysis of contractile parameters. See the Supplementary materials for full details1.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All data are presented as mean ± SEM unless otherwise indicated. GraphPad Prism 9 (Prism) was used for statistical analyses. No out-liners or data points were eliminated. Differences between two groups were assessed using multiple two-tailed unpaired t tests. Differences between more than two groups were assessed by using one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with multiple comparison correction, or mixed model effects analysis, as stated in the figure legends. Significance was defined as *P ≤0.05, **P ≤0.01, ***P ≤0.001, or ****P ≤0.0001. See supplementary Methods for further details 1.</p>

<p>The mESCs used in this study were generated as previously described <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bryson et al. (2014)</xref></bold></italic>. Briefly, mESC underwent successive rounds of gene-targeting to insert a Hb9::GFP-IRES-CD14 reporter construct to enable motor neuron purification, insertion of a CAG::Channelrhodopsin2-YFP (ChR2-YFP) construct using Tol2 transposition to enable optogenetic control of neural activity <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Nagel et al.

(2005)</xref></bold></italic> and insertion of a CAG::Glial derived neurotrophic factor (Gdnf) construct using PiggyBac targeting to promote motor neuron survival; this resulted in generation of clone C9G. Undifferentiated mESCs, from clone C9G, were expanded on irradiated C57BL/6 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (iMEFs) (Gibco) according to standard cell culture protocols. For maintenance, briefly, freshly thawed mESC aliquots were plated on iMEF feeder layers, grown on gelatinized 24-well or 6-well plastic tissue culture treated dishes (approx. 2.5 x 105 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>), in mESC media, consisting of Knockout-DMEM (Gibco), supplemented with 15% ES-qualified FBS, 1x nucleosides, 1x non-essential amino acids, 1x L-glutamine + penicillin/streptomycin, 0.1mM 2-mercaptoethanol (all supplied by Gibco) and 100U/ml ESGRO® Recombinant Mouse LIF Protein (Merck Millipore); cells were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2, cells were fed daily and passaged or differentiated prior to colonies reaching 70% confluence.</p>

<title>Motor neuron differentiation</title>
<p>Motor neuron differentiation was carried out as previously described <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wichterle et al. (2002)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Peljto et al.

Briefly, mESC colonies were dissociated using TryplE solution (Gibco), 7 mins at 37°C, and transferred to non-tissue culture treated 10cm plates in differentiation medium, consisting of a 1:1 mix of advanced-DMEM/F12 and neurobasal media, 10% knockout serum replacement (KO-SR), 1x L-glutamine/Penicillin/Streptomycin and 0.1mM 2-mercaptoethanol (hereafter, termed ADNFK media; all components source from Gibco). For generation of medial motor column (MMC) identity motor neurons, mESCs (20,000 cell/ml) were incubated for 2 days at 37°C, 5% CO2 as floating embryoid bodies (EBs) in ADFNK, before being split 1:2 in ADFNK media supplemented with 1<italic>μ</italic>M retinoic acid (RA; Sigma) and 0.5<italic>μ</italic>M smoothened agonist (Sag; Sigma) between day 3-5 of differentiation.

<title>Production of implantable optical stimulation devices</title>
<p>Optical stimulation devices were largely produced as described by <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Montgomery et al. (2015)</xref></bold></italic>, with the following modifications: the design of individual printed circuit boards (PCBs) was modified to enlarge the central pads and the PCB was then fabricated on 0.2-mm thick FR4 board, which greatly facilitated assembly and mounting of individual components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5-figure supplement 1</xref>) and Supplementary CAD files); an alternative 470nm (145mcd) LED (Wurth Elektronik, Manufacturer Part No: 150120BS75000) was attached to 1.5cm paired trailing wire connected to the power-receiving rectifier circuit, again to facilitate assembly; a 3-turn power-receiving coil with an internal diameter of 1.7mm was used. Following positioning of Schottky diodes and capacitors on the PCB, and after coating with lead-free solder paste (Chip Quick), brief exposure to a flame from a gas soldering iron was used in lieu of reflow soldering. Fully assembled devices were cleaned in an ultrasonic water bath, rinsed in 100% ethanol, dried and then encapsulated by insertion into a silicone-grease coated 0.2ml PCR tube that was then partially filled with optically clear epoxy (Opti-tec 5001) to cover the device. The epoxy was cured for 1hr at 65°C and remaining uncured epoxy was then applied to the inverted trailing LED to form a droplet, before additional curing at 65°C. After encapsulation, devices were removed from 0.2ml PCR tubes, cleaned again in an ultrasonic water bath (to remove residual silicone grease), before being immersed in 100% ethanol for sterilization. Modification of the encapsulation method was necessary to ensure longevity of the device following in vivo implantation. Prior to implantation, devices were transferred to sterile PBS and tested in the RF-resonance chamber (see below) to ensure they were fully functional.</p>

<title>Radio Frequency (RF) resonance cavity power transmission system</title>
<p>As above, the power transmission system used to activate the implanted LED devices was largely as described by <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Montgomery et al. (2015)</xref></bold></italic>, with the following modifications: a SynthNV RF Signal Generator (WindFreak) was used to generate a constant 1497MHz RF output (1-2bBm), that was fed into an absorptive SPDT, Solid State Switch (MiniCircuits; ZX80-DR230-S+), powered by a 1.5V CR2032 coin battery, which was controlled by a USB-TTL Interface (Prizmatix), to generate specific optical stimulation patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5-figure supplement 2</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">4</xref>).</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>B6.Cg-Tg(SOD1*G93A)1Gur/J mice (JAX) were bred specifically for this study by mating presymptomatic male transgene carriers with congenic C57BL/6J females (Charles River Laboratories); progeny were genotyped by standard PCR analysis and heterozygous transgenic mice were housed under a 12 hr dark/light cycle in IVC cages with behavioural enrichment and ad libitum access to food and water, until they reached the appropriate age. A total of 73 SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice and 17 non-transgenic wild-type littermates were directly used in this study; an additional 129 SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice were used to develop the methodology.</p>
<p>All procedures and experiments involving animals were carried out under License from the UK Home Office in accordance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (Amended Regulations 2012) and following ethical approval from the UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology Animal Welfare Ethical Review Body (AWERB). We used the ARRIVE checklist when writing our report <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Percie du Sert et al. (2020)</xref></bold></italic>; see below:</p>

<title>Study design parameters</title>
<sec id="s5g.1">
<title>Group size calculation</title>
<p>As this was a success/failure study, sample sizes were not predetermined for in vivo engraftment studies, rather we aimed for a repeated success rate (ie. target muscle innervation by engrafted motor neurons). However, in order to enable us to undertake robust statistical analysis of our findings, we therefore aimed minimum group size of 6-8, and we performed retrospective power calculations to confirm that this was an appropriate sample size.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5g.2">
<title>Inclusion/exclusion criteria</title>
<p>No data were excluded from the analyses. In rare cases, failure of the implantable LED device (used to deliver optical stimulation training; OST) before the start of the training period resulted in some mice being reassigned from the OST group to the &quot;untrained&quot; group; a detailed record of visual confirmation of LED device functionality was maintained for all stimulated mice to ensure the device was fully functional throughout the training period.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5g.3">
<title>Replication</title>
<p>In vivo engraftment studies, physiological analysis and histological analysis were replicated in n = 32 SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice for the major findings of this study, over a 2-year period, using multiple batches of ESC-derived motor neurons that were specifically prepared for each cohort (typically 4-8 mice per cohort); experimental outcomes were highly consistent and reproducible. Antibody-based immunosuppression conferred 100 percent graft survival in over 84 SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice to date, with positive responses to optical stimulation (determined by physiological analysis).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5g.4">
<title>Randomization</title>
<p>At the start of the study, animals in each litter (of appropriate genotype) were randomly assigned to each experimental cohort. All mice received grafts of the same ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons that were differentiated to coincide with each cohort of mice reaching the appropriate age for enrollment in the study. Rather SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice were custom bred for each phase of the project, which naturally evolved as specific experimental obstacles arose and were overcome (eg. toxicity of first choice immunosuppressant); these mice were assigned to specific groups following genotype confirmation (to reduce the number of experimental mice, since wild-type littermates were not the primary focus of this study) and upon reaching the appropriate age; isometric muscle tension physiological analysis in response to optical (and electrical) stimulation was used as the primary outcome measure, in order to determine the absolute maximum stimulus-evoked muscle force; this outcome measure was selected for its accuracy, reproducibility and reliability based on our past experience in pre-clinical therapeutic development.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5g.5">
<title>Blinding</title>
<p>In vivo engraftment and physiological analysis were blinded where possible. Since all mice were the same genotype and received the same cell grafts the experimenter was therefore aware of this, however, the experimenter was blinded to stimulation conditions (ie. untrained versus OST groups) for physiological analysis. Importantly, physiological recordings of maximal muscle force provides a highly reliable functional readout, moreover, automated software was used to extract muscle contractile characteristics data to eliminate bias. Histological analysis was performed blind for nerve and muscle analyses, with the exception of dCALMS analysis, since only SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice that had undergone optical stimulation training were used for this analysis. As reported in the methods, automated or semi-automated analysis was used for all histological analysis to eliminate bias.</p>

<title>In vivo intraneural engraftment of mESC-derived ChR2+ motor neurons</title>
<p>Mice received prophylactic analgesia (buprenorphine, 0.1mg/kg), during induction of anaesthesia and preparation of the surgical site. The immunosuppressant monoclonal antibody (H57-597 mAb) was also administered at the start of the surgical procedure (day 0) by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection (1mg/kg, diluted in 100<italic>μ</italic>l of sterile saline), which was repeated on days 1, 3, 7 and 14 post-engraftment. Alternatively, in a subset of mice (n = 15), immunosuppression was achieved by daily i.p. administration of FK506 (tacrolimus; 5mg/kg/d, note: due to insolubility in aqueous solution, FK506 (16.67mg/ml) was dissolved in DMSO and stored as frozen 100<italic>μ</italic>l aliquots that were freshly thawed and prepared immediately prior to injection by dilution in 30<italic>μ</italic>l of 100% ethanol (15% final concentration) and 70<italic>μ</italic>l sterile PBS containing 2% Tween-20 (8.33mg/ml final concentration of FK506; 0.6<italic>μ</italic>l/g of body mass, mixed with saline to a final volume of 125<italic>μ</italic>l immediately prior to i.p. injection). Mice were closely monitored and weighed at the time of immunosuppressant administration. As previously reported, H57-597 induced acute loss of body mass, which fully recovered in all cases within 7days from the initial dose; this adverse effect can be blocked by pre-treatment with cyclosporin A <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Murakami et al. (1995)</xref></bold></italic>.</p>
<p>Intraneural engraftment of ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons was performed under deep anaesthesia, using aseptic surgical techniques and body temperature was maintained throughout the surgical procedure using a 37°C heat mat, as previously described <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bryson et al. (2014)</xref></bold></italic>. Briefly, under a stereoscopic operating microscope (Zeiss), a 3mm skin incision was made in the lower posterior thigh and superficial muscles were separated and retracted to expose the sciatic nerve, immediately proximal to the trifurcation point in the popliteal fossa. The sciatic nerve was elevated from underlying muscles using a curved non-cutting suture needle, placing it under slight tension, and a 27G needle was used to make a small incision in the epineurium of the tibial and common peroneal nerve branches. Immediately prior to intraneural engraftment ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons (50,000 cells/<italic>μ</italic>l in PBS containing 0.0004% Nile Blue dye, maintained on ice) were carefully resuspended by pipetting and loaded into a 5<italic>μ</italic>l Hamilton syringe, equipped with a customized 33G needle. The needle was then carefully inserted through the incision made in the epineurium and guided along the length of the nerve (approximately 3-4mm), to the trifurcation point of the sciatic nerve, in order to prevent back-pressure induced leakage of cells; 1<italic>μ</italic>l of cell suspension was slowly injected into the tibial nerve and 0.5<italic>μ</italic>l into the common peroneal nerve. Visualization of Nile Blue labelled cells was used to verify intraneural cell delivery. In procedures during later stages of this study, a fine-tipped (approximately 100<italic>μ</italic>m outer diameter) pulled glass microinjection needle, with a beveled tip and customized positive displacement plunger (Alpha laboratories) was used for intraneural injection of cells, to minimize damage to the nerve. After injection, the needle was carefully withdrawn and the sciatic nerve was returned to its normal position. A subset of mice (n = 7; excluding animals in which the device failed during the stimulation period) underwent implantation of an optical stimulation device (described above). Briefly, fine round-tipped tissue forceps were inserted through the same skin incision, along the length of the thigh bone and rostrally along the back, to create a subcutaneous cavity. The main body of the sterilized device was inserted into the cavity and positioned close to, and parallel with, the lower thoracic spine (to assist alignment of the power receiving coils with the RF-resonance frequency power transmitter). The trailing wire and encapsulated LED was secured in place immediately superficial to the graft site in the sciatic nerve by 8-0 non-absorbable sutures that were also used to return the overlying muscles to their normal position. Finally, the skin incision was closed using 8-0 absorbable sutures and post-operative mice were transferred to a heated chamber and allowed to fully recover before being returned to their home-cage. Mice were closely observed for 10 days following surgery.</p>

<sec id="s5i">
<title>Daily optical stimulation training</title>
<p>After 14d post-engraftment (to allow sufficient time for engrafted motor neurons to extend axons far enough to reach target muscles), mice with implanted stimulation devices were transferred to a round acrylic chamber, containing clean bedding and nesting material, positioned on top of the RF-resonance cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5-figure supplement 1C</xref>). Where possible, multiply-housed littermates were transferred to the chamber at the same time. A red acrylic dome was placed in the centre of the chamber to encourage mice to spend time in that location, since resonance power transmission is less efficient at the periphery of the chamber. Engrafted SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice underwent daily optical stimulation (pulse pattern described below; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5-figure supplement 2</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">4</xref>) for 1hr/d from post-engraftment day 14 until termination of the experiment at late-stage disease (132.4 ±6.8 days).</p>

<title>Isometric muscle tension physiological analysis</title>
<p>At the experimental end-point, engrafted SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice underwent isometric muscle tension physiology, in order to accurately determine the contractile properties of target muscles in response to acute optical stimulation, largely as previously described <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bryson et al. (2014)</xref></bold></italic>, with the following modifications: a PowerLab 4/30 stimulation and recording system (AD Instruments) was used to deliver bespoke electrical stimulation signals, either as direct constant voltage pulses applied to the nerve via bipolar electrodes for electrical nerve stimulation, or used as a 5V TTL signal to activate a 470nm LED light-source (CoolLED; pe100), delivered to the exposed sciatic nerve via a liquid lightguide for optical stimulation; stimulation program available on request. As previously reported, percentage light power intensity can be controlled over a range of 0-80 mW/mm2; 50% (40 mW/mm2) supramaximal stimulation was used for most optically-evoked muscle force recordings, however, maximum motor unit activation was achieved using light intensities ≤2.5 mW/mm2. For electrical stimulation, 0.2ms supramaximal constant-voltage (5V) pulses were directly applied to the exposed sciatic nerve via a bipolar stimulating electrode, as individual pulses (for twitch contractions) or at 20, 40, 80 and 100 Hz burst (0.5s duration) with a 5 second rest interval to interrogate the full range of maximal tetanic contractile force values.</p>
<p>Distal tendons of individual target muscles were attached to 25g or 55g UF-1 force transducers coupled to a bridge amp (AD Instruments). LabChart software (AD Instruments) was used for automated data analysis of parameters including maximum twitch and tetanic contractile force, time-to-rise, time-to-peak and ½ relaxation time (during twitch contractions). Motor unit number estimation (MUNE) was performed using a bespoke pattern of rising and falling amplitude electrical stimuli (0-5V, 0.2ms pulse width), repeated every 1s (LabChart programme available upon request), or by 1 s interval 5V TTL trigger pulses in combination with manual cycling of the percentage power output from the pe-100 (470nm) light source (Cool LED) between 1-10%.</p>

<title>Nerve and muscle histology</title>
<p>Immediately after physiological analysis, animals were euthanized and the ipsilateral (engrafted) sciatic nerve (SN), attached to the triceps surae (TS) muscle group, along with the contralateral SN and tibialis anterior (TA) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles, were dissected, rinsed in TBS and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in TBS for a minimum of 2hrs, followed by cryoprotection in TBS containing 20% sucrose for &gt;12 hrs. Tissue was mounted in aluminium-foil moulds containing OCT (Tissue-Tek) and rapidly frozen on dryice, then stored at -20°C prior to cryosectioning. Serial longitudinal sections from the ipsilateral SN and TS muscle, and TA/EDL muscles were cut at 30<italic>μ</italic>m thickness, encompassing the entire tissue block to enable 3D reconstruction of the extent of reinnervation throughout the whole muscle (only performed in selected cases due to time- and resource-intensive nature of imaging data acquisition and processing). Transverse 10<italic>μ</italic>m-thick sections were cut from the contralateral SN for axonal analysis. For immunostaining, muscle/nerve sections were washed 3 x 5 mins with TBS, blocked for 1hr in TBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 5% donkey serum and sections were double-labelled with the following primary antibodies, raised in either rabbit or goat, applied in combination overnight in TBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 2% donkey serum: goat anti-choline acetyltransferase, 1:100 (Chemicon); goat anti-green fluorescent protein, 1:500 (Abcam); rabbit anti-green fluorescent protein, 1:500 (Invitrogen); rabbit anti-choline acetyltransferase, 1:200 (Abcam); rabbit anti-<italic>β</italic>III tubulin; 1:500 (Biolegend). Secondary antibodies, raised in donkey were diluted 1:500, along with <italic>α</italic>-bungarotoxin-Alexa568/647 (1:500; Invitrogen) and DAPI (1:1000; Sigma) in TBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 2% donkey serum and applied for 2hrs, before washing 3 x 5 mins with TBS and coverslips were then mounted using fluorescent mounting medium (Invitrogen).</p>

<title>Image processing</title>
<p>Image acquisition was performed using a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope, to acquire tile-scan images of entire SN/TS sections using a 20x objective (pinhole set to 30<italic>μ</italic>m to obtain fluorescent signal from entire thickness of the section); high-resolution z-stacks from specific regions of interest were acquired using either 40x or 63x oil-immersion objectives. Images reported here were either prepared directly, using Zeiss Zen Blue/Black image processing software or processed and analysed using Fiji (ImageJ) and MetaMorph (Molecular Devices) software for 3D reconstruction, as follows: serial tile-scan images encompassing the whole SN/TS tissue block were converted into compressed tiff-format files, assembled into an image stack and individual planes were aligned using the StackReg plugin <italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Thévenaz et al. (1998)</xref></bold></italic>, aligned stacks were then converted into rendered 3D reconstructions using MetaMorph software and saved as compressed AVI video files for visualization purposes (note: automated NMJ analysis, described below, was performed on individual image planes from each stack). Tile-scans were also acquired from contralateral SN sections, using a 40x or 63x oil-immersion objective, for automated axon cross-sectional area analysis.</p>

<title>Automated endplate and innervation analysis</title>
<p>Serial tile-scan images, in RGB Color format, from the whole TS muscle from SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice at the experimental end-point, 135 days, were analysed as follows, using Fiji (ImageJ) software: endplates, labelled with <italic>α</italic>-bungartoxin conjugated to Alexa-568 or Alexa-647 were assigned to the red color channel and color thresholding, using consistent parameters (Hue = 0-17 [pass], Saturation = 0-255 [pass], Brightness = 75-255 [pass]) was performed to specifically identify endplates; the number of endplates in each plane was then quantified using the “Analyze Particles” feature of ImageJ (key parameters include: Area = 50-500<italic>μ</italic>m, Circularity 0-1, Show “Overlay masks”). Quantification of innervated endplates was performed in a similar manner, using colour thresholding parameters to identify double-labelled endplates that stained positive for both <italic>α</italic>-bungarotoxin (assigned to red channel) and GFP/YFP+ motor axons (assigned to the green channel), using the following parameters: Hue = 23-44; Saturation = 0-255; Brightness = 90-255. This automated analysis method is intended to quantify the total number of endplates and provide an indication of their innervation status; determination of full versus partial innervation would require much higher resolution imaging which is not feasible for the whole TS muscle. Additionally, severe muscle atrophy at late-stage disease decreases the TS muscle volume, thus the number and size of tile-scan images would be approximately 3-fold greater for wild-type mice.</p>

<title>Motor and sensory axon nerve analysis</title>
<p>Individual channels, representing total axons (stained for <italic>β</italic>-III tubulin) and motor axons (stained for choline-acetyltransferase), from tile-scans of contralateral SNs were used to determine number and cross-sectional area (CSA) of each axonal type, to determine the effect of different immunosuppression regimens. Briefly, images were thresholded in ImageJ, using identical settings to delineate individual axons, individual branches were then manually circled, using the freehand selection tool, and axonal counts and CSA were automatically quantified using the “Analyze Particles” tool.</p>

<sec id="s5o">
<title>Digital CSA analysis of longitudinal muscle sections (dCALMS)</title>
<p>Briefly, z-stacks from regions of interest incorporating at least 1 GFP/YFP+ motor axon terminal were acquired from the whole 30<italic>μ</italic>m thickness of individual TS muscle sections; the “reslice” feature of ImageJ was then used to obtain digital transverse orientation images from each ROI to interrogate muscle fibre CSA throughout the y-plane of the image stack and correlation with the innervation status; triple labelling with GFP/YFP, <italic>α</italic>-bungarotoxin and choline-acetyltransferase labelling enabled the innervation status of adjacent fibres within the ROI to be assigned to the following categories: denervated (<italic>α</italic>-bungarotoxin only), innervated by endogenous motor neurons (<italic>α</italic>-bungarotoxin and choline-acetyltransferase), innervated by engrafted ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neurons (<italic>α</italic>-bungarotoxin, choline-acetyltransferase and GFP/YFP) or unknown (when no endplate was visible within the ROI. Overexposure of the channel used to acquire choline-acetyltransferase staining enabled visualization of the muscle CSA, which underwent gaussian blurring to aid definition of the sarcolemma (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, colorized images versus non-blurred images shown in black and white). The edge of each muscle fibre at the level of the endplate (where present) in the y-plane (or the maximum diameter, where no endplate was evident), was manually circled using the freehand selection tool and analysed using the “measure” function of ImageJ. ROIs were analysed from n = 3 mice that underwent ChR2<sup>+</sup> motor neuron engraftment and optical stimulation training. Only fibres that were entirely within the z-plane were measured at their widest point along the y-plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="vid6">Video 6</xref>); partial fibres, were excluded.</p>

<body>
<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder leading to the loss of innervation of skeletal muscles, caused by the dysfunction and eventual death of lower motor neurons. A variety of approaches have been taken to treat this disease. With the exception of three drugs that modestly slow progression, most therapeutics have failed to provide benefit. Replacing lost motor neurons in the spinal cord with healthy cells is plagued by a number of challenges, including the toxic environment, inhibitory cues that prevent axon outgrowth to the periphery, and proper targeting of the axons to the correct muscle groups. These challenges seem to be well beyond our current technological approaches. Avoiding these challenges altogether, Bryson et al. seek to transplant the replacement motor neurons into the peripheral nerves, closer to their targets. The current manuscript addresses some of the challenges that will need to be overcome, such as immune rejection of the allograft and optimizing maturation of the neuromuscular junction.</p>
<p>Bryson et al. begin by examining the survival of mESC-derived motor neurons allografted into SOD1 mice. The motor neurons, made on a 129S1/SvImJ, were transplanted into the tibial nerve of SOD1 mice on a C57BL/6J background. Without immunosuppression, most cells were lost between 14 and 35 days, suggesting an immune response had eliminated them. Tacrolimus prevented cell loss, but it also inhibited innervation of the muscle. It also uncovered the tumorigenic potential of contaminating pluripotent cells. In contrast, immunosuppression using H57-597, an antibody targeting T-cell receptor beta, prevented graft rejection while permitting some innervation of muscle. Pretreatment of the cells with mitomycin-C eliminated pluripotent cells, preventing tumor formation. The authors noted that this combination only innervated ~10% of endplates, likely due to the fact that the implanted motor neurons are not active.</p>
<p>The authors then began the process of optimizing the cells themselves, using measurements taken in late-stage SOD1 mice. Fast-firing and slow-firing populations of neurons were first compared. Using optical stimulation, these two cell types appeared to be similar. The authors opted to use slow-firing neurons in the subsequent experiments. Recognizing that neuromuscular junction (NMJ) innervation and maintenance are dependent on motor neuron activity, implantable optical stimulators were also evaluated. 14 days after transplanting the cells, optical stimulation training was initiated for one hour each day. This training led to a nearly 13-fold increase in force generation, although this still remained well below the force generated by electrical stimulation. The enhanced innervation also prevented the atrophy of muscle fibers caused by denervation.</p>
<p>Overall, the data for the function of the implanted cells are convincing. The dCALMS technique that the authors have developed is quite interesting and will likely be applicable to analyze muscles for other therapeutics. The identification of calcineurin inhibitors as inhibitors of reinnervation will also be important for the development of other cell-based therapeutics for ALS.</p>
<p>However, there are some issues that should be addressed. These include some common misconceptions about ALS. While ALS is split into familial and sporadic forms based on the presence or absence of a family history of the disease, mutations in the known ALS-associated genes are found in both forms. The authors also state that exercise programs are likely to accelerate degeneration in ALS. This is incorrect. Moderate exercise is part of the current guidelines for treating ALS, and mouse studies have demonstrated a therapeutic effect of moderate exercise. Regarding the experimental design, there are some important details missing. The animals do not appear to have been operated on at the same age, and the criteria for when to perform the operation were not described. A similar problem exists for when the animals were determined to reach endpoint. The authors also do not seem to address a potential pitfall of this approach: acceleration of the disease process. Indeed, some of the data comparing the ipsilateral side to the contralateral side suggest that the implantation of the cells and/or the light source increase the denervation of the muscle. Finally, there is a fairly large difference between the motor output provided by optical stimulation relative to electrical stimulation. It is currently unclear what level needs to be reached to provide an effective response in the intact animal. Thus, it is difficult to determine if the level of reinnervation that this study has achieved will be sufficient to improve a patient's quality of life.</p>

<p>The authors provide convincing evidence that optogenetic stimulation of ChR2-expressing motor neurons implanted in muscles effectively restores innervation of severely affected skeletal muscles in the aggressive SOD1 mouse model of ALS, and conclude that this method can be applied to selectively control the function of implicated muscles. This was supported by convincing data presented in the paper.</p>
<p>This is an interesting paper providing new/improved optogenetic methods to restore or improve muscle strength in ALS. In general, it is of high significance in both the techniques and concept, and the paper was well written. The evidence supporting the conclusions is convincing, with rigorous muscle tension physiological analysis, and nerve and muscle histology and image analysis. The work will be of broad interest to medical biologists on muscle disorders.</p>
<p>One weak point is that proper control experiments were not clearly presented - these could be shown in the paper. For example, one control experiment with only YFP but no ChR2 expression with optogenetic stimulation should be performed, following similar procedures and analysis applied to the ChR2-transduced animals.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder leading to the loss of innervation of skeletal muscles, caused by the dysfunction and eventual death of lower motor neurons. A variety of approaches have been taken to treat this disease. With the exception of three drugs that modestly slow progression, most therapeutics have failed to provide benefit. Replacing lost motor neurons in the spinal cord with healthy cells is plagued by a number of challenges, including the toxic environment, inhibitory cues that prevent axon outgrowth to the periphery, and proper targeting of the axons to the correct muscle groups. These challenges seem to be well beyond our current technological approaches. Avoiding these challenges altogether, Bryson et al. seek to transplant the replacement motor neurons into the peripheral nerves, closer to their targets. The current manuscript addresses some of the challenges that will need to be overcome, such as immune rejection of the allograft and optimizing maturation of the neuromuscular junction.</p>
<p>Bryson et al. begin by examining the survival of mESC-derived motor neurons allografted into SOD1 mice. The motor neurons, made on a 129S1/SvImJ, were transplanted into the tibial nerve of SOD1 mice on a C57BL/6J background. Without immunosuppression, most cells were lost between 14 and 35 days, suggesting an immune response had eliminated them. Tacrolimus prevented cell loss, but it also inhibited innervation of the muscle. It also uncovered the tumorigenic potential of contaminating pluripotent cells. In contrast, immunosuppression using H57-597, an antibody targeting T-cell receptor beta, prevented graft rejection while permitting some innervation of muscle. Pretreatment of the cells with mitomycin-C eliminated pluripotent cells, preventing tumor formation. The authors noted that this combination only innervated ~10% of endplates, likely due to the fact that the implanted motor neurons are not active.</p>
<p>The authors then began the process of optimizing the cells themselves, using measurements taken in late-stage SOD1 mice. Fast-firing and slow-firing populations of neurons were first compared. Using optical stimulation, these two cell types appeared to be similar. The authors opted to use slow-firing neurons in the subsequent experiments. Recognizing that neuromuscular junction (NMJ) innervation and maintenance are dependent on motor neuron activity, implantable optical stimulators were also evaluated. 14 days after transplanting the cells, optical stimulation training was initiated for one hour each day. This training led to a nearly 13-fold increase in force generation, although this still remained well below the force generated by electrical stimulation. The enhanced innervation also prevented the atrophy of muscle fibers caused by denervation.</p>
<p>Overall, the data for the function of the implanted cells are convincing. The dCALMS technique that the authors have developed is quite interesting and will likely be applicable to analyze muscles for other therapeutics. The identification of calcineurin inhibitors as inhibitors of reinnervation will also be important for the development of other cell-based therapeutics for ALS.</p>

<p>This is an excellent summary of the state of the field of ALS therapy development and provides a clear rationale for our novel therapeutic strategy, in the near-complete vacuum of conventional treatment options for patients suffering from this devastating disorder. We are delighted that the Reviewer clearly appreciated the value of our alternative therapeutic strategy and found our supporting data to be convincing, as well as drawing attention to the dCALMS technique, which we agree could be of significant value in the investigation of other therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring muscle innervation. We are extremely grateful for the Reviewer’s diligence in assessing our manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>However, there are some issues that should be addressed. These include some common misconceptions about ALS. While ALS is split into familial and sporadic forms based on the presence or absence of a family history of the disease, mutations in the known ALS-associated genes are found in both forms [1]. The authors also state that exercise programs are likely to accelerate degeneration in ALS. This is incorrect. Moderate exercise is part of the current guidelines for treating ALS, and mouse studies have demonstrated a therapeutic effect of moderate exercise [2]. Regarding the experimental design, there are some important details missing. The animals do not appear to have been operated on at the same age, and the criteria for when to perform the operation were not described. A similar problem exists for when the animals were determined to reach endpoint [3]. The authors also do not seem to address a potential pitfall of this approach: acceleration of the disease process. Indeed, some of the data comparing the ipsilateral side to the contralateral side suggest that the implantation of the cells and/or the light source increase the denervation of the muscle [4]. Finally, there is a fairly large difference between the motor output provided by optical stimulation relative to electrical stimulation. It is currently unclear what level needs to be reached to provide an effective response in the intact animal. Thus, it is difficult to determine if the level of reinnervation that this study has achieved will be sufficient to improve a patient's quality of life [5].</p>

<p>The Reviewer raises some extremely important points and highlights some additional constructive issues where more clarity is required (numbered 1-5 above). We have attempted to address each of these points in order to strengthen the key message of our study and the integrity of our manuscript:</p>
<p>1. The Reviewer is absolutely correct in highlighting that causative mutations in identified genes occur in both sporadic and familial forms of ALS and that this classification simply reflects whether or not there is a known family history of the disease (which can also encompass a spectrum of disorders including frontotemporal degeneration). We will revise our manuscript in order to be more accurate and provide clarity on this important point.</p>
<p>2. Regarding the potential acceleration of muscle denervation, we specifically state that the use of electrical nerve stimulation (ENS) to artificially evoke muscle contraction has been shown to accelerate denervation of the diaphragm muscle in clinical trials aimed at maintaining respiratory function in ALS patients, which significantly shortened life-expectancy. It was not our intention to imply that moderate voluntary exercise, as opposed to artificial “ENS-based” muscle stimulation programmes, could accelerate muscle denervation. Indeed, the negative side-effects of ENS that we highlighted provide a clear rationale for developing a safer alternative to artificially control muscle function once innervation by endogenous motor neurons progressively deteriorates in ALS patients; specifically, our selection of optogenetic nerve stimulation (ONS), which is highly selective to the engrafted light-sensitive motor neurons, recruits motor units in correct physiological order and avoids rapid muscle fatigue potentially overcomes the safety concerns associated with ENS.</p>
<p>Importantly, unchecked disease progression means that complete paralysis of almost all muscles will eventually occur, due to loss of upper or lower motor neurons and accompanying muscle denervation, which would eventually preclude the ability of ALS patients to undertake voluntary exercise programmes, or even activities of daily life. Our approach is aimed at overcoming this inevitable loss of voluntary muscle control and onset of complete paralysis by providing a safe and effective method of artificially maintaining control of targeted muscles that would otherwise become completely paralyzed, as well as preventing their irreversible atrophy.</p>
<p>To avoid the possibility that readers may infer that we are suggesting voluntary exercise programs accelerate degeneration in ALS and to  provide additional clarity, we will revise the manuscript to stress that we specifically refer to “ENS-based” exercise programmes in relation to acceleration of muscle denervation.</p>
<p>1. Regarding our experimental design, the congenic B6.SOD1G93A mouse model of ALS is an extremely well-characterized model, with a highly consistent timeframe of disease phenotype manifestation and progression. In order to maximize the translational value of our study, we selected an early post-symptom onset timepoint (95d +/- 4.6 days) that mirrors a time at which human ALS patients would be likely to benefit from the therapeutic strategy: in the vast majority of cases, it is not possible to treat humans until a diagnosis of ALS has been confirmed, which can often take up to 12 months from first presentation. Importantly, ALS patients in the final stages of disease progression would be unlikely to be suitable for this therapy, due to irreversible muscle atrophy, which would preclude the ability of the engrafted motor neurons to form functionally useful connections. Indeed, our strategy is to engraft the replacement motor neurons prior to severe muscle atrophy occurs, so that they are in place to compensate and take over the function of endogenous lower motor neurons as they progressively degenerate and paralysis ensues. In so doing, the replacement motor neurons could prevent the irreversible atrophy of targeted muscles through ONS-based exercise programmes and thereby indefinitely extend the ability of targeted muscles to perform functionally useful movements.</p>
<p>Although the initial graft optimization component of this study, including the tacrolimus trial, was performed across a variety of disease stages (commencing between 57-101 days of age), once we identified the H57-596 monoclonal antibody as an effective means to promote graft survival (without interfering with target muscle innervation), all subsequent grafts were initiated at an early symptom onset timepoint: 95.7 ± 4.6 days for slow-firing motor neuron grafts and 106.8 ± 7.2 days for fast-firing motor neuron grafts. Transgenic SOD1G93A mice were specifically bred for this study and due to complexities of coordinating stem cell differentiation and motor neuron production, optical stimulation device production and access to surgical facilities, with timed matings set up 3-4 months in advance, we feel that this age range was acceptable and doesn’t detract from the findings of our study.</p>
<p>Similarly, we made every effort to ensure that experimental end-point was consistent, at 133 ±8 days for all grafts involving H57-597 administration, which reflects translationally-relevant late-stage disease progression. Since the physiological experiments performed as part of this study are extremely time-consuming, it was necessary to stagger the experimental end-point over several days. Again, we feel that this range is acceptable and still reflects a consistent, translationally-relevant timepoint. Importantly, since the experimental paradigm tested in this study was aimed at individually targeted muscles, which would have been unlikely to have an effect on disease duration or survival, we did not feel that it was ethically justifiable to allow the B6.SOD1G93A mice to approach end-stage disease (which occurs at an average age of 150 days of age in this model).</p>
<p>In the interests of full transparency, the age at which treatment commenced and the experimental end-point for every animal used in this study is reported in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3.</p>
<p>1. The Reviewer raises an extremely pertinent question, regarding whether the engrafted motor neurons themselves, or the implanted stimulation device, may accelerate the progressive loss of innervation of targeted muscles by endogenous motor neurons, in light of our data that shows decreased force evoked by electrical stimulation of ipsilateral (engrafted) versus contralateral (control) muscles. It is worth noting that supramaximal electrical nerve stimulation, used to evoke maximal muscle force, should activate both endogenous and engrafted motor neurons, therefore the combined activation of both populations would be expected to result in a summative (greater) contractile response. The fact that we see the converse is unlikely to be due to an accelerated loss of endogenous motor innervation as a result of the engrafted cells, but is much more likely to be caused by physical nerve damage during the surgical engraftment process: we used a customized Hamilton syringe with a 29G needle to manually inject the cells into the targeted nerve branches, which has an outer diameter of 330μm whilst the diameter of the tibial nerve in an adult mouse is approximately 400μm. This is likely to have led to damage of the endogenous motor (and potentially sensory) axons that may have diminished regenerative capacity due to ongoing disease mechanisms. Fortunately, there is significant scope to refine the engraftment procedure by using smaller gauge needles (potentially made of more flexible materials), bespoke injection systems that can deliver the cells at a controlled rate and micromanipulators that avoid can avoid nerve damage caused by excessive movement of the needle within the nerve. Importantly, the significantly greater scale of human nerves, compared to murine nerves targeted in this study, would also be a significant advantage in terms of physically delivering the cells in ALS patients.</p>
<p>2. The Reviewer’s final comment is entirely justified given that, even in the best cases following optical stimulation training of engrafted SOD1G93A mice, optical stimulation still evoked less contractile force than supramaximal electrical stimulation. The likely reasons for this are complex: there is almost certainly scope to further optimize the optical stimulation training paradigm, which could result in reinforcement of the de novo neuromuscular junctions formed between the engrafted motor neurons and targeted muscle fibres; it is possible that the expression level of the channelrhodopsin-2 protein at the cell surface may require optimization in order to reliably initiate action potentials in the engrafted motor neurons – development of newer channelrhodopsin variants may resolve this potential issue, whilst providing additional advantages (such as enabling transcutaneous stimulation) at the same time. Finally, the maximum contractile response of the triceps surae muscle elicited by optical stimulation that we observed was approximately 13g, which equates to approximately 50% of the body mass of an adult SOD1G93A mouse. Although this is only approximately 10% of the maximal contractile force of a wild-type triceps surae muscle, this would almost certainly provide the ability to perform functionally useful motor tasks if it could be reproduced in ALS patients, particularly if large numbers of targeted muscles could be controlled in a coordinated manner, something that we are actively working on.</p>

<p>We are extremely grateful for the Reviewer’s expert appraisal of our manuscript and we are delighted to hear that they found our study to be highly significant, of broad interest and that our supporting evidence for this novel therapeutic approach was convincing and rigorous.</p>
<p>Regarding the inclusion of suggested control experiments, we have extensive negative results data from physiological recordings of muscles in response to optical stimulation in animals where the engrafted motor neurons were rejected (prior to our identification of a 100% effective immunosuppression regimen). This clearly revealed that, in the absence of ChR2-expressing motor neurons, optical stimulation does not elicit any response from the target muscle. However, we do not feel that inclusion of this negative data, which is entirely predictable, would have strengthened the findings of our study. Similarly, if we had engrafted motor neurons that only express YFP, we would have been unable to elicit any muscle contractile activity in response to optical stimulation. As a control, this may have some value in determining the ability of motor neurons derived from other cell lines that do not express ChR2 to survive and innervate target muscles but we don’t feel that the additional work would get us closer to achieving our ultimate goal of using motor neuron replacement in combination with optogenetic stimulation to restore/maintain muscle function in ALS patients. Moreover, the complex and iterative process of developing the cell line used in this study (reported in detail in our previous study) would make it extremely difficult to produce a suitable control stem cell line expressing only YFP. Having said that, we are actively in the process of developing new, more sophisticated human and mouse stem cell lines, using more translationally-relevant gene targeting methods to stably knock-in a variety of updated channelrhodopsin variants that may have superior properties for our approach. This will be reported in follow up study/studies as we feel that it goes well beyond the scope of the current study.</p>
