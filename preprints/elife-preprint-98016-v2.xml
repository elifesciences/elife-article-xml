<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The structural integrity of the sperm is crucial for male fertility, defects in sperm head-tail linkage and flagellar axoneme are associated with acephalic spermatozoa syndrome (ASS) and the multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF). Notably, impaired head-tail coupling apparatus (HTCA) often accompanies defects in the flagellum structure, however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain elusive. Here, we identified an evolutionarily conserved coiled-coil domain-containing (CCDC) protein, CCDC113, and found the disruption of CCDC113 produced spermatozoa with disorganized sperm flagella and HTCA, which caused male infertility. Further analysis revealed that CCDC113 could bind to CFAP57 and CFAP91, and function as an adaptor protein for the connection of radial spokes, nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC) and doublet microtubules (DMTs) in the sperm axoneme. Moreover, CCDC113 was identified as a structural component of HTCA, collaborating with SUN5 and CENTLEIN to connect sperm head to tail during spermiogenesis. Together, our studies reveal that CCDC113 serve as a critical hub for sperm axoneme and HTCA stabilization, providing insights into the potential pathogenesis of infertility associated with human <italic>CCDC113</italic> mutations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Male fertility relies on the continuous production of spermatozoa through a complex developmental process known as spermatogenesis. Spermatogenesis involves three primary stages: spermatogonia mitosis, spermatocyte meiosis, and spermiogenesis. During spermiogenesis, spermatids undergo complex differentiation processes to develop into spermatozoa, which includes nuclear elongation, chromatin remodeling, acrosome formation, cytoplasm elimination, and flagellum development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hermo et al., 2010</xref>). The integrity of spermatozoa is essential for their migration through the female reproductive tract and subsequent successful fertilization. An intact spermatozoon contains properly formed sperm head, head-tail coupling apparatus (HTCA), and flagellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Parker, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Roldan, 2019</xref>). Numerous components have been identified in the sperm HTCA and flagellum that are essential for the sperm integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lehti &amp; Sironen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). Defects in sperm flagellum and HTCA can lead to reduced sperm motility or abnormal sperm morphology, termed as multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF) or acephalic spermatozoa syndrome (ASS), which, in turn, causes male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Sudhakar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Tu et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>The sperm flagellum possesses an evolutionarily conserved axonemal structure composed of “9+2” microtubules, specifically, nine peripheral doublet microtubules (DMTs) surrounding two central microtubules known as the central pair (CP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Inaba &amp; Mizuno, 2016</xref>). Axonemal dyneins, radial spokes (RS), and the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC) are arranged on DMTs with a 96-nm repeating unit structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kumar &amp; Singh, 2021</xref>). Within the axoneme, the N-DRC and RS are crucial for maintaining axonemal integrity, forming crossbridges between adjacent DMTs and linking the DMTs to the central apparatus, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Canty et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ishikawa, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kumar &amp; Singh, 2021</xref>). Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, biochemical techniques, and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) facilitated the analysis of the axonemal structures, revealing numerous components among RS, N-DRC and DMTs that may serve as hubs for axoneme stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bazan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Leung et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Walton et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zhou et al., 2023</xref>). For example, CFAP91 has been identified as a protein that extends from the base of RS2 through the N-DRC base plate to RS3, thus stabilizing RS2 and RS3 on the DMTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bicka et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dymek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gui et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, CFAP57 extends through the N-DRC and interacts with RS3 via its C-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Ghanaeian et al., 2023</xref>). Recent analyses suggest that CCDC96 and CCDC113 may form a complex that extends parallel to the N-DRC, connecting the base of RS3 to the tail of dynein g (IDA g) and the N-DRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bazan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Ghanaeian et al., 2023</xref>). However, the functions of these proteins in stabilizing the sperm flagellum remain unknown.</p>
<p>The sperm flagellum is tightly anchored to the sperm head through the HTCA, a complex structure based on the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). This structure consists of two cylindrical microtubule-based centrioles and associated components, including well-organized segmented columns, capitulum plate and basal plate. The segmented columns and capitulum plate, located below the basal plate, are thought to originate from the dense material emanating from the proximal centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Fawcett &amp; Phillips, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Zamboni &amp; Stefanini, 1971</xref>). Many proteins have been identified in the sperm HTCA, with mouse models exhibiting phenotypes characteristic of acephalic spermatozoa syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). SPATA6 is the first protein identified as a component of the HTCA using the knockout mouse model, and is crucial for its formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Yuan et al., 2015</xref>). Deficiencies in SUN5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Elkhatib et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Fang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Sha et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Shang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Shang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Xiang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>) and PMFBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Deng et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Nie et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Sha et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>) have been associated with ASS in both humans and mice. The centriole-related protein CENTLEIN acts as a bona fide linker between SUN5 and PMFBP1, participating in the HTCA assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Notably, impaired HTCA often coincides with defects in the sperm flagellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hall et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Shang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Yuan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that the stabilization of the HTCA may be closely associated with the integrity of sperm flagellum. However, the mechanism that maintains the stabilization of both the sperm flagellum and the HTCA remains to be clarified.</p>
<p>Here, we identified an evolutionarily conserved coiled-coil domain-containing (CCDC) protein, CCDC113, and found that it forms a complex with CFAP57 and CFAP91, thereby facilitating the connection of RS, N-DRC and DMTs in the axoneme. Knockout of <italic>Ccdc113</italic> resulted in spermatozoa with flagellar defects and head-tail linkage detachment, leading to male infertility. Ultrastructural analysis showed that the loss of CCDC113 disrupted both the sperm axoneme and HTCA. CCDC113 localizes on the manchette, HTCA and flagellum in elongating and elongated spermatids. Further analysis revealed that CCDC113 is indispensable for the connection of CFAP91 and DRC2 with DMTs in the sperm axoneme, and it interacts with SUN5 and CENTLEIN to stabilize the sperm HTCA. These results suggest that CCDC113 serves as a critical hub in maintaining the structural integrity of both the sperm flagellum and HTCA.</p>

<title>CCDC113 complexes with CFAP57 and CFAP91</title>
<p>CCDC113 is an evolutionarily conserved coiled-coil domain-containing (CCDC) protein identified in the ciliated species. Comparative analysis of CCDC113 structures from <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic> to <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> showed structural similarity among CCDC113 orthologs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Recent cryo-EM analysis in the structure of the 96-nm modular repeats of axonemes from the <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic> cilia and human respiratory cilia revealed that CCDC113 localizes to the linker region among RS, N-DRC and DMTs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting it may serve as a structural component connecting RS, N-DRC and DMTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bazan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Ghanaeian et al., 2023</xref>). To further investigate, we examined the interactions between CCDC113 and its neighboring axoneme-associated proteins, CFAP57 and CFAP91 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). We transfected HEK293T cells with a GFP-tagged CCDC113 and FLAG-tagged CFAP57 or CFAP91, then performed anti-FLAG-immunoprecipitations. CCDC113 was present in both FLAG-CFAP57 and FLAG-CFAP91 immunoprecipitates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C and D</xref>), indicating CCDC113 interacts with both CFAP57 and CFAP91. Given that CFAP91 has been reported to stabilize RS on the DMTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bicka et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dymek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gui et al., 2021</xref>) and cryo-EM analysis shows that CCDC113 is closed to DMTs, we speculated that CCDC113 may connect RS to DMTs by binding to CFAP91 and microtubules. To test this, we detected the interaction between CCDC113 and β-tubulin (TUBB5) and found that CCDC113 was present in MYC-TUBB5 immunoprecipitate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Additionally, since CFAP57 extends through the N-DRC and CCDC113 is closed to the N-DRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Ghanaeian et al., 2023</xref>), we further examined the interaction between CCDC113 and N-DRC components adjacent to DMTs. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) analysis showed that CCDC113 could bind to DRC1, DRC2, and DRC3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F-H</xref>). We also included two sperm outer dense fiber proteins, ODF1 and ODF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Zhu et al., 2022</xref>), which are located far from the sperm axoneme, as negative controls in the co-IP experiments. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-figure supplement 1A and 1B, neither ODF1 nor ODF2 bound to CCDC113. Therefore, CCDC113 may function as an adaptor protein connecting RS, N-DRC, and DMTs, serving as a critical hub for axoneme stabilization.</p>

The <italic>Ccdc113<sup>−/−</sup></italic>mice were genotyped by genomic DNA sequencing and further confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Genotypes were distinguished by a 539 bp band for <italic>Ccdc113<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice, a 461 bp band for <italic>Ccdc113<sup>−/−</sup></italic>mice, and two bands of 539 bp and 461 bp for <italic>Ccdc113<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Further immunoblotting analysis confirmed the elimination of CCDC113 in total protein extracts from <italic>Ccdc113<sup>−/−</sup></italic> testes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 1A). Mice lacking <italic>Ccdc113</italic> showed no gross abnormalities in their appearance or behavior, and no obvious differences in body weight (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). Additionally, no hydrocephalus or left-right asymmetry defects were observed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 1B). Additionally, the deficiency of CCDC113 did not affect ciliogenesis in the lung and trachea (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 1C-E). We then assessed the fertility of 2-month-old male and female <italic>Ccdc113<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice. <italic>Ccdc113<sup>−/−</sup></italic> female mice were able to produce offspring after mating with wild-type (WT) adult males, similar to <italic>Ccdc113<sup>+/+</sup></italic> female mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). However, <italic>Ccdc113<sup>−/−</sup></italic> male mice exhibited normal mating behavior, as indicated by the presence of copulatory plugs, they failed to produce offspring when mating with WT adult female mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Thus, the knockout of <italic>Ccdc113</italic> results in male infertility.</p>

<title><italic>Ccdc113</italic> knockout mice produce spermatozoa with flagellar defects and head-tail linkage detachment</title>
<p>To further investigate the cause of male infertility, we initially examined <italic>Ccdc113<sup>-/-</sup></italic> testis at both macroscopic and histological levels. <italic>Ccdc113</italic> knockout did not affect testis size (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F and G</xref>) or the ratio of testis weight to body weight (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H and I</xref>). Histological sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E) revealed that seminiferous tubules of <italic>Ccdc113<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice exhibited a tubular lumen with flagella emerging from the developing spermatids. In contrast, flagellar staining appeared reduced in <italic>Ccdc113<sup>−/−</sup></italic> seminiferous tubules (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>, red asterisks). Immunofluorescence staining for acetylated tubulin (ac-tubulin), a marker for sperm flagellum (Martinez et al., 2020), further confirmed the flagellar defects in <italic>Ccdc113<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K and L</xref>).</p>
<p>Subsequently, we examined spermatids at different stages in <italic>Ccdc113<sup>−/−</sup></italic> testes using periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining. Pioneering work in the mid-1950s used the PAS stain in histologic sections of mouse testis to visualize glycoproteins of the acrosome and Golgi in seminiferous tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Oakberg, 1956</xref>). The pioneers discovered in cross-sectioned seminiferous tubules the association of differentiating germ cells with successive layers to define different stages that in mice are twelve, indicated as Roman numerals (XII). For each stage, different associations of maturing germ cells were always the same with early cells in differentiation at the periphery and more mature cells near the lumen. In this way, progressive differentiation from stem cells to mitotic, meiotic, acrosome-forming, and post-acrosome maturing spermatocytes was mapped to define spermatogenesis with the XII stages in mice representing the seminiferous cycle. The maturation process from acrosome-forming cells to mature spermatocytes is defined as spermiogenesis with 16 different steps that are morphologically distinct spermatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">O’Donnell L, 2015</xref>). While acrosome biogenesis and nuclear morphology in <italic>Ccdc113<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spermatids from steps 1 to 10 were comparable to those in <italic>Ccdc113<sup>+/+</sup></italic> spermatids, abnormal club-shaped heads were observed in spermatids from steps 11 to 16 in <italic>Ccdc113<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-figure supplement 1A, black asterisk). In addition, the manchette of <italic>Ccdc113<sup>−/−</sup></italic>spermatids was more elongated compared to that of <italic>Ccdc113<sup>+/+</sup></italic> spermatids (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-figure supplement 1B). Therefore, the disruption of CCDC113 impaired spermiogenesis.</p>

<p>Next, we examined the spermatozoa in the cauda epididymis and found that the sperm count in the <italic>Ccdc113<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cauda epididymis was significantly decreased compared to the control group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A and B</xref>). The motility of the released spermatozoa from <italic>Ccdc113<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Ccdc113<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cauda epididymis showed that <italic>Ccdc113<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spermatozoa were completely immotile (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). H&amp;E staining of the cauda epididymis showed fewer hematoxylin-stained sperm heads in the <italic>Ccdc113<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cauda epididymis compared to the <italic>Ccdc113<sup>+/+</sup></italic> cauda epididymis. Notably, unlike the control group, which exhibited linear eosin staining in the epididymal lumen, the <italic>Ccdc113<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice showed numerous coiled eosin-stained structures without sperm heads in the epididymal lumen (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, red circles). To determine the morphological characteristics of the spermatozoa, we conducted single-sperm immunofluorescence using an anti-α/β-tubulin antibody to label the sperm flagellum and lectin peanut agglutinin (PNA) to visualize the sperm acrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Nakata et al., 2015</xref>). We noticed that <italic>Ccdc113<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spermatozoa showed severe morphological malformations, including sperm head-tail detachment (type 1), abnormal sperm head with curly tail (type 2), normal sperm head with curly tail (type 3) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D and E</xref>). To determine the role of CCDC113 in flagellum assembly, we analyzed flagellum formation during spermiogenesis. We found that in <italic>Ccdc113<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, diffuse and curly axonemal signals were observed in testicular germ cells starting from the round spermatid stage (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Overall, these findings suggest that the deletion of CCDC113 leads to sperm flagellum deformities and detachment of the sperm head-to-tail linkage, resulting in a unique type of acephalic spermatozoa, which may be responsible for the <italic>Ccdc113<sup>−/−</sup></italic> male infertility.</p>

<title>CCDC113 localizes on the sperm neck and flagellum regions</title>
<p>To gain further insights into the functional role of CCDC113 during spermiogenesis, we examined its expression in different tissues and found that CCDC113 was predominantly expressed in mouse testis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>-figure supplement 1A and B). CCDC113 was first detected in testis at postnatal day 7 (P7), with expression levels increasing continuously from P21 onward, peaking in adult testes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), suggesting that CCDC113 is highly expressed throughout spermiogenesis. We then conducted immunofluorescence analysis of CCDC113 in <italic>Ccdc113<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Ccdc113<sup>−/−</sup></italic> germ cells to determine its precise localization during spermatogenesis. CCDC113 appeared as punctate signals near the nuclei of spermatocyte and round spermatids, and localized to the manchette, sperm neck and flagellum regions in elongating and elongated spermatids (Figure 4-figure supplement 1C).</p>

</fig>
<p>To further validate these findings, we co-stained CCDC113 with α/β-tubulin, which marks the manchette and flagellum in spermatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lehti &amp; Sironen, 2016</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). The immunofluorescence analysis showed that CCDC113 localized to the manchette surrounding the spermatid head from step 9 to step 14, as well as to the sperm neck and flagellum in the testes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Given that CCDC113 was initially identified as a component of centriolar satellites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Firat-Karalar et al., 2014</xref>), the punctate signals of CCDC113 in spermatocyte and spermatids may be localized around the centrosome. To test this, we performed the immunofluorescent staining of CCDC113 and centrosomal protein CENTRIN1/2 in spermatocytes and spermatids, and found that the signal of CCDC113 partially colocalized with CENTRIN1/2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus, CCDC113 is localized to the centrosome, manchette, sperm neck and flagellum regions in the developing germ cells.</p>
<p>Next, we examined the localization of CCDC113 in mature spermatozoa, and found that CCDC113 was localized in the sperm neck and flagellum regions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Similar localization of CCDC113 was also observed in human mature spermatozoa (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). The consistent localization of CCDC113 at the sperm neck and flagellum in mature spermatozoa suggests its importance for maintaining the integrity of the sperm flagellum and head-to-tail connection.</p>

<p>To delineate the sperm flagellar defects in <italic>Ccdc113<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, we conducted transmission electron microscopy (TEM) examination of longitudinal sections of <italic>Ccdc113<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spermatozoa.

<p>CCDC113 has been shown to localize at the base of the RS3 and interact with adjacent axoneme-associated proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-H</xref>). Given the disorganized “9+2” axonemal structure was detected in cross-sectioned <italic>Ccdc113<sup>−/−</sup></italic> flagellar specimen (Figure5A and B), we speculated that CCDC113 likely served as an adaptor to connect the neighboring axoneme-associated proteins to DMTs. To test this, we examined the flagellar localization of CFAP91 in <italic>Ccdc113<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spermatozoa, which is positioned in close proximity to CCDC113 at the root region of RS3 and is critical for the localizations of calmodulin-associated and spoke-associated complex (CSC) proteins CFAP61 and CFAP251 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bicka et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Meng et al., 2024</xref>).

<title><italic>Ccdc113</italic> knockout impairs head-to-tail anchorage of the spermatids</title>
<p>To explore the mechanism behind acephalic spermatozoa in <italic>Ccdc113</italic> knockout mice, we first examined where the flagellum detached from sperm head in <italic>Ccdc113<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice. The proportion of decapitated tails in the caput, corpus and cauda of <italic>Ccdc113<sup>−/−</sup></italic> epididymis was similar (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), suggesting the separation of the sperm head and tail in <italic>Ccdc113<sup>−/−</sup></italic>mice may occur either within the seminiferous tubules or upon entering the caput of the epididymis. To confirm this, we performed PAS staining to examine spermiogenesis stages in <italic>Ccdc113<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Ccdc113<sup>−/−</sup></italic> testes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>).

<p>To elucidate the molecular function of CCDC113 in sperm head-tail linkage, we examined its interaction with known HTCA-associated proteins, including SUN5, CENTLEIN, PMFBP1, and SPATA6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Shang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Yuan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). GFP-tagged CCDC113 and FLAG-tagged HTCA-associated proteins were co-transfected into HEK293T cells, followed by the immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP antibody. We found that CCDC113 interacted with SUN5 and CENTLEIN, but not with PMFBP1 and SPATA6 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A-C</xref> and F). We further conducted co-IP assays in the reverse direction and verified that both SUN5 and CENTLEIN could bind to CCDC113 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D and E</xref>). To investigate the localization of CCDC113 within the HTCA, we co-stained mature spermatozoa with antibodies against CCDC113 and SUN5, which has been reported to be localized at the root connecting the HTCA to the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Shang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). CCDC113 was found positioned below SUN5, showed partial overlap with it (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>). The centriolar protein CENTLEIN was localized to the HTCA and served as the critical linker protein between SUN5 and PMFBP1 in the elongating and elongated spermatid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>)). Given that CENTLEIN disappears in mature spermatozoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>), we performed the immunofluorescent staining of CCDC113 and CENTLEIN in elongated spermatids and found that CCDC113 partially colocalized with CENTLEIN at the HTCA (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref>). Thus, CCDC113 interacts with both SUN5 and CENTLEIN and localizes at the sperm HTCA.</p>

<p>The HTCA localization of CCDC113 may be responsible for maintaining HTCA integrity. To test this hypothesis, we examined the localization of classical HTCA component SPATA6 in <italic>Ccdc113<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Ccdc113<sup>+/+</sup></italic> spermatozoa using immunofluorescent staining. We found that SPATA6 was not attached to the implantation fossa of the sperm nucleus in <italic>Ccdc113<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spermatozoa (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7I and J</xref>), indicating that CCDC113 is essential for the integrity of the sperm HTCA. To further elucidate the functional relationships among CCDC113, SUN5, CENTLEIN, and PMFBP1 at the sperm HTCA, we examined the localization of CCDC113 in <italic>Sun5<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, <italic>Centlein<sup>−/−</sup></italic>, and <italic>Pmfbp1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spermatozoa. Compared to the control group, CCDC113 was predominantly localized on the decapitated flagellum in <italic>Sun5<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, <italic>Centlein<sup>−/−</sup></italic>, and <italic>Pmfnp1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spermatozoa (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7K and L</xref>), indicating SUN5, CENTLEIN, and PMFBP1 are crucial for the proper docking of CCDC113 to the implantation site on the sperm head. Taken together, these data demonstrate that CCDC113 cooperates with SUN5 and CENTLEIN to stabilize the sperm HTCA and anchor the sperm head to the tail.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>CCDC113 is a highly evolutionarily conserved component of motile cilia/flagella. Studies in the model organism, <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic>, have revealed that CCDC113 connects RS3 to dynein g and the N-DRC, which plays essential role in cilia motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bazan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Ghanaeian et al., 2023</xref>). Recent studies have also identified the localization of CCDC113 within the 96-nm repeat structure of the human respiratory epithelial axoneme, and localizes to the linker region among RS, N-DRC and DMTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Walton et al., 2023</xref>). In this study, we reveal that CCDC113 is indispensable for male fertility, as <italic>Ccdc113</italic> knockout mice produce spermatozoa with flagellar defects and head-tail linkage detachment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). CCDC113 is localized to the sperm neck and flagellum regions in the elongating and elongated spermatids. In the sperm flagellum, CCDC113 interacts with both CFAP57 and CFAP91, serving as an adaptor protein to connect RS, N-DRC, and DMTs, thereby stabilizing sperm flagellum. At the sperm head to tail connecting piece, CCDC113 binds to SUN5 and CENTLEIN to stabilize sperm HTCA and anchor the sperm head to the tail. Thus, CCDC113 is essential for maintaining the integrity of both the sperm axoneme and the sperm HTCA. Moreover, TEM analysis detected excess residual cytoplasm in spermatozoa, including disrupted mitochondria, damaged axonemes, and large vacuoles, indicating defects in cytoplasmic removal in <italic>Ccdc113<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent cryo-EM analysis of the axonemes from <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic> cilia and human respiratory cilia revealed that CCDC113 is localized at the linker region between RS3, N-DRC and DMTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bazan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Ghanaeian et al., 2023</xref>). We also found that CCDC113 interacts with adjacent axoneme-associated proteins, CFAP57 and CFAP91 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C and D</xref>). CFAP57 has been identified as the adaptor protein responsible for assembling dynein g and d, and it can interact with both N-DRC and RS3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Ghanaeian et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ma et al., 2023</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that CFAP91 extends from the base of RS2 through the N-DRC base plate to RS3, playing a crucial role in stabilizing and localizing RS2 and RS3 on the DMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bicka et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dymek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gui et al., 2021</xref>). The CFAP91 ortholog, FAP91, interacts with three N-DRC subunits (DRC1, DRC2, and DRC4), facilitating the docking of the N-DRC in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gui et al., 2021</xref>). In humans, pathogenic mutations in CFAP91 and DRC2 disrupt sperm flagellum structure and result in MMAF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jreijiri et al., 2023</xref>; Martinez et al., 2020). TEM and immunostaining experiments in spermatozoa showed severe CP and radial spokes defects in <italic>CFAP91</italic> mutant patients (Martinez et al., 2020). In this study, we found that the absence of CCDC113 results in severe axonemal disorganization characterized by defective RSs, scattered DMTs, and misplaced CP. Further analysis demonstrated that the CCDC113 deficiency disrupts the localization of CFAP91 and DRC2 on DMTs. Thus, CCDC113 may function as an adaptor protein to stabilize CFAP91 and DRC2 on DMTs, facilitating the docking of RS and N-DRC to DMTs and thereby maintaining the integrity of sperm axoneme.</p>
<p>Recent analyses have revealed that certain centrosomal proteins play crucial roles in the assembly and maintenance of sperm HTCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Avasthi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Liska et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). In early round spermatids, the centriole pair initially localizes to the caudal nuclear pole and expands the electron-dense material, some of which exhibits striation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). As spermatids develop, the dense material around the centrioles gradually transforms into a well-organized structure, clearly identified as the basal plate, capitulum plate and segmented columns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Dooher &amp; Bennett, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). CCDC113 was initially identified through the isolation of centriolar proteins from bovine sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Firat-Karalar et al., 2014</xref>). During spermiogenesis, CCDC113 colocalizes with CENTRIN1/2 at the centrosome in developing spermatids and continues to localize to the sperm neck region in elongating and elongated spermatids (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B and C</xref>). Additionally, CCDC113 can bind to HTCA associated centrosomal protein, CENTLEIN, and the disruption of <italic>Centlein</italic> impairs the attachment of CCDC113 to the sperm head. In <italic>Ccdc113<sup>−/−</sup></italic>spermatids, the capitulum plate and segmented columns are absent, and the basal plate is detached from the implantation site on the nucleus of <italic>Ccdc113<sup>−/−</sup></italic> elongating and elongated spermatids during spermiogenesis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). These observations raise the possibility that CCDC113 is an HTCA associated centrosomal protein crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the HTCA.</p>
<p>SUN5 is a transmembrane protein located in the nuclear envelope, and acts as the root connecting the HTCA to the sperm nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Shang et al., 2017</xref>). CENTLEIN can directly bind to both SUN5 and PMFBP1, serving as a linker between SUN5 and PMFBP1 to maintain the integrity of HTCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). CCDC113 can interact with SUN5 and CENTLEIN, but not PMFBP1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A-C</xref>), and left on the tip of the decapitated tail in <italic>Sun5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Centlein<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spermatozoa (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7K and L</xref>). Furthermore, CCDC113 colocalizes with SUN5 in the HTCA region, and immunofluorescence staining in spermatozoa shows that SUN5 is positioned closer to the sperm nucleus than CCDC113 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G and H</xref>). Therefore, SUN5 and CENTLEIN may be closer to the sperm nucleus than CCDC113. PAS staining revealed that <italic>Ccdc113<sup>−/−</sup></italic> sperm heads are abnormally oriented in stages V–VIII seminiferous epithelia (Figure6 C and D), and TEM analysis further demonstrated that the disruption of CCDC113 causes the detachment of the destroyed coupling apparatus from the sperm head in step 9–11 spermatids (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). All these results suggest that the detachment of sperm head and tail in <italic>Ccdc113<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice may not be a secondary effect of sperm flagellum defects.</p>
<p>Overall, we identified CCDC113 as a structural component of both the flagellar axoneme and the HTCA, where it performs dual roles in stabilizing the sperm axonemal structure and maintaining the structural integrity of HTCA. Given that the cryo-EM of sperm axoneme and HTCA could powerfully strengthen the role of CCDC113 in stabilizing sperm axoneme and head-tail coupling apparatus, it a valuable direction for future research. <italic>Ccdc113<sup>−/−</sup></italic>mice did not exhibit other ciliopathies, such as situs inversus, hydrocephalus, or abnormal ciliogenesis of tracheal cilia (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 1B-E), which suggests that CCDC113 may specifically function in spermiogenesis.</p>

<p>In this paper, Wu et al. investigated the physiological roles of CCDC113 in sperm flagellum and HTCA stabilization by using CRISPR/Cas knockouts mouse models, co-IP and single sperm imaging. They find that CCDC113 localizes in the linker region among radial spokes, the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC), and doublet microtubules (DMTs) RS, N-DRC and DMTs and interacts with axoneme-associated proteins CFAP57 and CFAP91, acting as an adaptor protein that facilitates the linkage between RS, N-DRC and DMTs within the sperm axoneme. They show the disruption of CCDC113 produced spermatozoa with disorganized sperm flagella and CFAP91, DRC2 could not colocalize with DMTs in Ccdc113-/- spermatozoa. Interestingly, the data also indicate that CCDC113 could localize on the HTCA region, and interact with HTCA-associated proteins. The knockout of Ccdc113 could also produce acephalic spermatozoa. By using Sun5 and Centlein knockout mouse models, the authors further find SUN5 and CENTLEIN are indispensable for the docking of CCDC113 to the implantation site on the sperm head. Overall, the experiments were designed properly and performed well to support the authors' observation in each part. Furthermore, the study's findings offer valuable insights into the physiological and developmental roles of CCDC113 in the male germ line, which can provide insight into impaired sperm development and male infertility. The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by data, but some points need to be clarified and discussed.</p>
<p>(1) In Fig. 1, a sperm flagellum protein, which is far way from CCDC113, should be selected as a negative control to exclude artificial effects in co-IP experiments.</p>
<p>
(2) Whether the detachment of sperm head and tail in Ccdc113-/- mice is a secondary effect of the sperm flagellum defects? The author should discuss this point.</p>
<p>
(3) Given that some cytoplasm materials could be observed in Ccdc113-/- spermatozoa (Fig. 5A), whether CCDC113 is also essential for cytoplasmic removal?</p>
<p>
(4) Although CCDC113 could not bind to PMFBP1, the localization of CCDC113 in Pmfbp1-/- spermatozoa should be also detected to clarify the relationship between CCDC113 and SUN5-CENTLEIN-PMFBP1.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The authors addressed all my concerns. The manuscript was greatly improved.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the present study, the authors select the coiled-coil protein CCDC113 and revealed its expression in the stages of spermatogenesis in the testis as well as in the different steps of spermiogenesis with expression also mapped in the different parts of the epididymis. Gene deletion led to male infertility in CRISPR-Cas9 KO mice and PAS staining showed defects mapped in the different stages of the seminiferous cycle and through the different steps of spermiogenesis. EM and IF with several markers of testis germ cells and spermatozoa in the epididymis indicated defects in flagella and head-to-tail coupling for flagella as well as acephaly. The authors' co-IP experiments of expressed CCDC113 in HEK293T cells indicated an association with CFAP91 and DRC2 as well as SUN5 and CENTLEIN.</p>
<p>The authors propose that CCDC113 connects CFAP91 and DRC2 to doublet microtubules of the axoneme and CCDC113's association with SUN5 and CENTLEIN to stabilize the sperm flagellum head-to-tail coupling apparatus. Extensive experiments mapping CCDC13 during postnatal development are reported as well as negative co-IP experiments and studies with SUN5 KO mice as well as CENTLEIN KO mice.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors provide compelling observations to indicate the relevance of CCDC113 to flagellum formation with potential protein partners. The data are relevant to sperm flagella formation and its coupling to the sperm head.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors' observations are consistent with the model proposed but the authors' conclusions for the mechanism may require direct demonstration in sperm flagella. The Walton et al paper shows human CCDC96/113 in cilia of human respiratory epithelia. An application of such methodology to the proteins indicated by Wu et al for the sperm axoneme and head-tail coupling apparatus is eagerly awaited as a follow-up study.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>In this paper, Wu et al. investigated the physiological roles of CCDC113 in sperm flagellum and HTCA stabilization by using CRISPR/Cas knockouts mouse models, co-IP, and single sperm imaging. They find that CCDC113 localizes in the linker region among radial spokes, the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC), and doublet microtubules (DMTs) RS, N-DRC, and DMTs and interacts with axoneme-associated proteins CFAP57 and CFAP91, acting as an adaptor protein that facilitates the linkage between RS, N-DRC, and DMTs within the sperm axoneme. They show the disruption of CCDC113 produced spermatozoa with disorganized sperm flagella and CFAP91, DRC2 could not colocalize with DMTs in Ccdc113-/- spermatozoa. Interestingly, the data also indicate that CCDC113 could localize on the HTCA region, and interact with HTCA-associated proteins. The knockout of Ccdc113 could also produce acephalic spermatozoa. By using Sun5 and Centlein knockout mouse models, the authors further find SUN5 and CENTLEIN are indispensable for the docking of CCDC113 to the implantation site on the sperm head. Overall, the experiments were designed properly and performed well to support the authors' observation in each part. Furthermore, the study's findings offer valuable insights into the physiological and developmental roles of CCDC113 in the male germ line, which can provide insight into impaired sperm development and male infertility. The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by data, but some points need to be clarified and discussed.</p>

<p>We thank Reviewer #1 for his or her critical reading and the positive assessment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) In Figure 1, a sperm flagellum protein, which is far away from CCDC113, should be selected as a negative control to exclude artificial effects in co-IP experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate Reviewer #1’s insightful suggestion. In response, we selected two sperm outer dense fiber proteins, ODF1 and ODF2, which are located distant from the sperm axoneme, as negative controls in the co-IP experiments. As shown in Figure 1- figure supplement 1A and B, neither ODF1 nor ODF2 bound to CCDC113, indicating the interaction observed in Figure 1 is not an artifact.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Whether the detachment of sperm head and tail in <italic>Ccdc113-/-</italic> mice is a secondary effect of the sperm flagellum defects? The author should discuss this point.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Good question. Considering that CCDC113 is localized in the sperm neck region and interacts with SUN5 and CENTLEIN, it may play a direct role in connecting the sperm head and tail. Indeed, PAS staining revealed that <italic>Ccdc113–/–</italic> sperm heads exhibit abnormal orientation in stages V–VIII of the seminiferous epithelia (Figure 6C-D). Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis indicated that the absence of CCDC113 caused detachment of the damaged coupling apparatus from the sperm head in step 9–11 spermatids (Figure 6E). These results suggest that the detachment of the sperm head and tail in <italic>Ccdc113–/–</italic> mice may not be a secondary effect of sperm flagellum defects. We have discussed this point further below:</p>
<p>“CCDC113 can interact with SUN5 and CENTLEIN, but not PMFBP1 (Figure 7A-C), and left on the tip of the decapitated tail in Sun5–/– and Centlein–/– spermatozoa (Figure 7K and L). Furthermore, CCDC113 colocalizes with SUN5 in the HTCA region, and immunofluorescence staining in spermatozoa shows that SUN5 is positioned closer to the sperm nucleus than CCDC113 (Figure 7G and H). Therefore, SUN5 and CENTLEIN may be closer to the sperm nucleus than CCDC113. PAS staining revealed that Ccdc113–/– sperm heads are abnormally oriented in stages V–VIII seminiferous epithelia (Figure6 C and D), and TEM analysis further demonstrated that the disruption of CCDC113 causes the detachment of the destroyed coupling apparatus from the sperm head in step 9–11 spermatids (Figure 6E). All these results suggest that the detachment of sperm head and tail in Ccdc113–/– mice may not be a secondary effect of sperm flagellum defects.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Given that some cytoplasm materials could be observed in <italic>Ccdc113-/-</italic> spermatozoa (Fig. 5A), whether CCDC113 is also essential for cytoplasmic removal?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Good question. Unremoved cytoplasm could be detected in spermatozoa by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, including disrupted mitochondria, damaged axonemes, and large vacuoles. These observations indicate defects in cytoplasmic removal in <italic>Ccdc113–/–</italic> mice. We have discussed this point as below:</p>
<p>“Moreover, TEM analysis detected excess residual cytoplasm in spermatozoa, including disrupted mitochondria, damaged axonemes, and large vacuoles, indicating defects in cytoplasmic removal in Ccdc113–/– mice (Figure 5A).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Although CCDC113 could not bind to PMFBP1, the localization of CCDC113 in <italic>Pmfbp1-/-</italic> spermatozoa should be also detected to clarify the relationship between CCDC113 and SUN5-CENTLEIN-PMFBP1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate Reviewer #1’s suggestion. We have analyzed the localization of CCDC113 in <italic>Pmfbp1-/-</italic> spermatozoa and found that CCDC113 was located at the tip of the decapitated tail in <italic>Pmfbp1-/-</italic> spermatozoa (Figure 7K and L). This finding has been incorporated into the revised manuscript as below:</p>
<p>“To further elucidate the functional relationships among CCDC113, SUN5, CENTLEIN, and PMFBP1 at the sperm HTCA, we examined the localization of CCDC113 in Sun5-/-, Centlein–/–, and Pmfbp1–/– spermatozoa. Compared to the control group, CCDC113 was predominantly localized on the decapitated flagellum in Sun5-/-, Centlein–/–, and Pmfnp1–/– spermatozoa (Figure 7K and L), indicating SUN5, CENTLEIN, and PMFBP1 are crucial for the proper docking of CCDC113 to the implantation site on the sperm head. Taken together, these data demonstrate that CCDC113 cooperates with SUN5 and CENTLEIN to stabilize the sperm HTCA and anchor the sperm head to the tail.”</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the present study, the authors select the coiled-coil protein CCDC113 and revealed its expression in the stages of spermatogenesis in the testis as well as in the different steps of spermiogenesis with expression also mapped in the different parts of the epididymis. Gene deletion led to male infertility in CRISPR-Cas9 KO mice and PAS staining showed defects mapped in the different stages of the seminiferous cycle and through the different steps of spermiogenesis. EM and IF with several markers of testis germ cells and spermatozoa in the epididymis indicated defects in flagella and head-to-tail coupling for flagella as well as acephaly. The authors' co-IP experiments of expressed CCDC113 in HEK293T cells indicated an association with CFAP91 and DRC2 as well as SUN5 and CENTLEIN.</p>
<p>The authors propose that CCDC113 connects CFAP91 and DRC2 to doublet microtubules of the axoneme and CCDC113's association with SUN5 and CENTLEIN to stabilize the sperm flagellum head-to-tail coupling apparatus. Extensive experiments mapping CCDC13 during postnatal development are reported as well as negative co-IP experiments and studies with SUN5 KO mice as well as CENTLEIN KO mice.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors provide compelling observations to indicate the relevance of CCDC113 to flagellum formation with potential protein partners. The data are relevant to sperm flagella formation and its coupling to the sperm head.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful to Reviewer #2 for his or her recognition of the strength of this study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors' observations are consistent with the model proposed but the authors' conclusions for the mechanism may require direct demonstration in sperm flagella. The Walton et al paper shows human CCDC96/113 in cilia of human respiratory epithelia. An application of such methodology to the proteins indicated by Wu et al for the sperm axoneme and head-tail coupling apparatus is eagerly awaited as a follow-up study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank Reviewer 2 for his/her kindly help in improving the manuscript.  We now understand that directly detection of CCDC113 precise localization in sperm axoneme and head-tail coupling apparatus (HTCA) using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) could powerfully strengthen our model. Recent advances in cryo-EM have indeed advanced our understanding of axonemal structures analysis of axonemal structures and determined the structures of native axonemal DMTs from mouse, bovine, and human sperm (Leung et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023). However, high-resolution structures of sperm axoneme and HTCA regions, including those involving CCDC113, have yet to be fully characterized. Thus, we would like to discuss this point and consider it a valuable direction for future research.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Can the authors indicate in the Materials and Methods if n=3 biological replicates were done for all co-IP, EM, LM, and IF studies? The statistical analysis section indicates this but quantification is missing for most figures including co-IP, most IF, PAS staining, EM, etc.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank Reviewer 2 for the insightful comments and guidance to improve our data quality. All the experiments in this study were repeated at least three times to ensure reproducibility. We have quantified the co-IP experiments in Figures 1C-H and 7A-F, the IF data in Figures 2K, 5C, and 5D, as well as the PAS staining in Figure 6C. Since electron microscopy samples require very little testicular tissue and the sections obtained are very thin, the likelihood of capturing sections specifically at the sperm head-tail junction is considerably low. This challenge makes it difficult to perform quantitative analysis and statistical evaluation in the TEM experiment. To address this limitation, we have quantified the percentage of _Ccdc113-/-_sperm heads with abnormal orientation in stages V–VIII of the seminiferous epithelium to indicate impaired head-to-tail anchorage.</p>

<p>The Introduction and Discussion parts of the paper may need some clarification for the general reader. The material in the &quot;Additional Context &quot; section of the critique below may be a helpful place to introduce what a stage is, and the steps in germ cell development in the testis with the latter of course where and when the flagellum develops.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your valuable suggestions. We have referred to the material in the “Additional Context” section to introduce the stages of spermatogenesis and the steps in germ cell development in the testis in the introduction and results.</p>
<p>“Male fertility relies on the continuous production of spermatozoa through a complex developmental process known as spermatogenesis. Spermatogenesis involves three primary stages: spermatogonia mitosis, spermatocyte meiosis, and spermiogenesis. During spermiogenesis, spermatids undergo complex differentiation processes to develop into spermatozoa, which includes nuclear elongation, chromatin remodeling, acrosome formation, cytoplasm elimination, and flagellum development (Hermo et al., 2010).”</p>

<p>“Pioneering work in the mid-1950s used the PAS stain in histologic sections of mouse testis to visualize glycoproteins of the acrosome and Golgi in seminiferous tubules (Oakberg, 1956). The pioneers discovered in cross-sectioned seminiferous tubules the association of differentiating germ cells with successive layers to define different stages that in mice are twelve, indicated as Roman numerals (XII). For each stage, different associations of maturing germ cells were always the same with early cells in differentiation at the periphery and more mature cells near the lumen. In this way, progressive differentiation from stem cells to mitotic, meiotic, acrosome-forming, and post-acrosome maturing spermatocytes was mapped to define spermatogenesis with the XII stages in mice representing the seminiferous cycle. The maturation process from acrosome-forming cells to mature spermatocytes is defined as spermiogenesis with 16 different steps that are morphologically distinct spermatids (O'Donnell L, 2015).”</p>

<p>For the Discussion, the authors indicate that the function of CCDC113 in mammals is unknown yet the authors point to the work of Walton et al on human respiratory epithelia that points to a function for CCDC96/113. The work in the manuscript here does indicate a role in sperm flagella and the head-to-tail coupling apparatus but remains descriptive until the methodology of Walton et al is applied. Hopefully, the authors will consider it for a follow-up study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing out this problem. We have revised this part and highlighted the Walton et al’s work in the Discussion.</p>
<p>“CCDC113 is a highly evolutionarily conserved component of motile cilia/ﬂagella. Studies in the model organism, Tetrahymena thermophila, have revealed that CCDC113 connects RS3 to dynein g and the N-DRC, which plays essential role in cilia motility (Bazan et al., 2021; Ghanaeian et al., 2023). Recent studies have also identified the localization of CCDC113 within the 96-nm repeat structure of the human respiratory epithelial axoneme, and localizes to the linker region among RS, N-DRC and DMTs (Walton et al., 2023). In this study, we reveal that CCDC113 is indispensable for male fertility, as Ccdc113 knockout mice produce spermatozoa with flagellar defects and head-tail linkage detachment (Figure 3D).”</p>
<p>“Overall, we identified CCDC113 as a structural component of both the flagellar axoneme and the HTCA, where it performs dual roles in stabilizing the sperm axonemal structure and maintaining the structural integrity of HTCA. Given that the cryo-EM of sperm axoneme and HTCA could powerfully strengthen the role of CCDC113 in stabilizing sperm axoneme and head-tail coupling apparatus, it a valuable direction for future research.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The Discussion may be focused on the key aspects of CCDC113 related to sperm flagella and the head-to-tail coupling apparatus that represent a genuine advance. The more speculative parts of the Discussion that have not been addressed by experimentation in the Results section may be considered for removal in the Discussion section.</p>

<p>Additional Context to help readers understand the significance of the work:</p>
<p>Pioneering work in the mid-1950s used the periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain in histologic sections of rodent testis to visualize glycoproteins of the acrosome and Golgi in seminiferous tubules. The pioneers discovered in cross-sectioned seminiferous tubules the association of differentiating germ cells with successive layers to define different stages that in mice are twelve, indicated as Roman numerals (XII). For each stage, different associations of maturing germ cells were always the same with early cells in differentiation at the periphery and more mature cells near the lumen. In this way, progressive differentiation from stem cells to mitotic, meiotic, acrosome-forming, and post-acrosome maturing spermatocytes was mapped to define spermatogenesis with the XII stages in mice representing the seminiferous cycle. The maturation process from acrosome-forming cells to mature spermatocytes is defined as spermiogenesis with 19 different steps that are morphologically distinct spermatids. It is from steps 8-19 of spermiogenesis that the formation of the flagellum takes place. Final maturation occurs in the epididymis as sperm move through the caput, corpus, and cauda of the organ with motile spermatozoa generated.</p>
