<title>Abstract</title><p>Gremlin-1 has been implicated in liver fibrosis in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) via inhibition of bone-morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling and has thereby been identified as a potential therapeutic target. Using rat <italic>in vivo</italic> and human <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> model systems of MASH fibrosis, we show that neutralisation of Gremlin-1 activity with monoclonal therapeutic antibodies does not reduce liver inflammation or liver fibrosis. Still, Gremlin-1 was upregulated in human and rat MASH fibrosis, but expression was restricted to a small subpopulation of COL3A1/THY1<sup>+</sup> myofibroblasts. Lentiviral overexpression of Gremlin-1 in LX-2 cells and primary hepatic stellate cells led to changes in BMP-related gene expression, which did not translate to increased fibrogenesis. Furthermore, we show that Gremlin-1 binds to heparin with high affinity, which prevents Gremlin-1 from entering systemic circulation, prohibiting Gremlin-1-mediated organ crosstalk. Overall, our findings suggest a redundant role for Gremlin-1 in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis, which is unamenable to therapeutic targeting.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is aetiologically closely linked to insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome, and in parallel with the rise in obesity is becoming the most common chronic liver disease worldwide, affecting about twenty to thirty percent of the population in western countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). It is characterised by hepatocellular lipid accumulation and, through multiple mechanisms, can progress to inflammation of the liver (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, MASH) and subsequent fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Liver fibrosis has been identified as the predominant factor determining patient prognosis, and higher stages are associated with liver-related events such as liver failure or the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as extrahepatic events such as cardiovascular disease, extrahepatic cancer or endocrinological complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>).</p>
<p>Gremlin-1 is a protein that is mainly expressed in fibroblasts and stem cells, and has been linked to fibrosis in a number of organs, including the kidney, lung, pancreas and skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). It acts mainly via inhibition of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling by direct binding and inactivation of BMPs 2, 4, and 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), whilst some reported actions on vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and monocyte migration inhibitory factor (MIF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Gremlin-1 forms dimers and avidly binds to glycosaminoglycans such as heparin and heparan sulphate, although the latter is not necessary for its interaction with BMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). In the liver, expression generally is low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) and restricted to activated hepatic stellate cells, which are the main fibrogenic cell population in the liver along with fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Hepatic Gremlin-1 has been linked to hepatocellular insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) and recent literature described a role in driving hepatocellular senescence, which in turn is linked to hepatic fibrogenesis and carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Previous evidence suggests that Gremlin-1 plays an active role in liver fibrosis by inhibiting the anti-fibrotic action of BMPs 4 and 7 on activated hepatic stellate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Systemic siRNA-mediated knockdown of Gremlin-1 downregulated hepatic TGFβ signalling and reduced fibrosis in a rat CCl<sub>4</sub> model of liver fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Furthermore, adipose tissue dysfunction and inflammation are both important factors in the pathogenesis of MASLD and MASH fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>), and Gremlin-1 has been described to drive adipogenesis and adipocyte dysfunction in hypertrophic adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>).</p>
<p>However, to date the effects of therapeutic inhibition of Gremlin-1 in human liver fibrosis, and MASH in particular, have not been studied. In this study, we aimed to further characterize the expression of Gremlin-1 in human and rodent MASH and evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of an anti-Gremlin-1-directed antibody treatment in rodent and human <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> models of MASH fibrosis.</p>

<title>Hepatic gremlin-1 is increased in human and rat MASH liver, localised to portal myofibroblasts</title>
<p>We wanted to determine Gremlin-1 expression in MASH and establish which, if any, cell types in the liver expressed Gremlin-1. Gremlin-1 was undetectable in healthy human liver by RNAscope <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (ISH) but staining increased in fibrotic NMSH liver, localising to fibrotic septa (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and B). Therefore, we hypothesized that Gremlin-1 is involved in hepatic fibrogenesis and that its expression might correlate with advancing stages of fibrosis in MASH. By RTqPCR of human explant livers of different aetiologies (all fibrosis stage F4), we found 4.8 to 9.8-fold increased GREM1 mRNA expression in MASH, ALD, PBC and PSC liver tissues when compared to donor livers (n=13-15 each, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Notably though, when analyzing publicly available bulk RNA sequencing from a total of 352 patients with MASLD (n=58 E-MTAB-9815, n=78 GSE130970, n=216 GSE135251), capturing the whole spectrum of MASLD and MASH, we found no correlation of GREM1 expression with the histological stage of fibrosis (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>GREM1 mRNA positive cells also stained positive for THY1 and COL3A1 in RNAscope ISH (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), indicating that myofibroblasts in the fibrotic area were the major cell type expressing Gremlin-1 in human MASH. This was corroborated by findings from RTqPCR on cultured hepatic cells where GREM1 mRNA expression was highest in primary human hepatic stellate cells and myofibroblasts as compared to absent or low expression in biliary epithelial and sinusoidal endothelial cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). However, only a small proportion of THY1/COL3A1<sup>+</sup> cells expressed GREM1, with expression being highly variable across and within each specimen. In agreement, integrated analyses of two publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data sets overall showed very low expression levels of Gremlin-1 across cell types (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 2A-C</xref>), but slightly higher expression in THY1 and COL3A1-expressing myofibroblast populations and smooth muscle cells (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 2D-F</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to find a suitable animal model for studying therapeutic effects of neutralizing Gremlin-1, we sought to establish whether rodent MASH models adequately reflect the changes in hepatic GREM1 expression we observed in human MASH. We found no evidence of consistent Grem1 expression in healthy and fibrotic mouse liver tissues (not shown). However, Grem1 ISH staining was consistently increased in livers of rats fed a choline-deficient, L-amino acid defined high-fat diet (CDAA-HFD) for twelve weeks. Like our observations in human MASH liver tissue, Grem1 expression in rat livers mainly localised to periportal fibrotic areas (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Gremlin-1 is undetectable in the circulation, due to avid glycosaminoglycan binding</title>
<p>Increased circulating Gremlin-1 protein has been described in patients with type 2 diabetes and in MASH and has been linked to higher MASH disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Therefore, we wanted to verify these findings and investigate whether circulating Gremlin-1 protein also correlates with the stage of fibrosis. We developed a luminescent oxygen channelling immunoassay (LOCI, alphaLISA) using different combinations of in-house generated human recombinant anti-Gremlin-1 antibodies. These assays were highly sensitive, with a lower limit of quantification of 0.1 ng/mL, and highly specific as suggested by the absence of any signal. However, despite high sensitivity, we were unable to detect circulating Gremlin-1 in plasma or serum in a cohort of healthy subjects and MASLD patients with different stages of fibrosis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A and B</xref>, clinical characteristics see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Using size exclusion chromatography, we observed that dimeric Gremlin-1 forms dimers and trimers in complex with heparin under cell- and matrix-free conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting that Gremlin-1 might be retained on cell surfaces and extracellular matrix and thus not enter the systemic circulation. Furthermore, the binding affinity of Gremlin-1 to heparin was in the low nanomolar range (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), suggesting a strong localization towards extracellular matrix proteoglycans.</p>

<title>Development and characterisation of a neutralising anti-Gremlin-1 directed antibody</title>
<p>Given the potential role of Gremlin-1 in hepatic fibrogenesis in MASH, we developed therapeutic anti-Gremlin-1 antibodies and aimed to test whether neutralization of Gremlin-1 interfered with fibrosis in models of MASH. Generated antibodies were highly effective in blocking recombinant human Gremlin-1 from binding BMP4 in a Gremlin/BMP4 inhibition ELISA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, IC50 = 2.7-3.1×10<sup>-9</sup>M) as well as in a BRE-Luc RGA BMP reporter assay (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, EC50 = 1.27-1.36×10<sup>-8</sup>M) with IC50/EC50 values being the lowest possible that can be reached given the amount of Gremlin-1 used in the assays. Treatment of LX-2 cells with BMP4 also increased SMAD1 phosphorylation, which was prevented by the addition of Gremlin-1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), and anti-Gremlin-1 antibodies, but not isotype control, effectively restored SMAD1 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> = 2.04-2.96×10<sup>-</sup> <sup>9</sup> M). Antibodies differed in their binding stoichiometries; the 0032:ND/0568:ND antibody formed complexes with Gremlin-1 dimers in a 2:2 ratio, whilst the 0030:HD compound bound Gremlin-1 predominantly in a 1:1 ratio (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>Antibodies had different effects with regards to heparin binding, indicated by suffixes HD for heparin-displacing and ND for non-displacing antibodies. Using a fluorescence polarization assay we found that Gremlin-1 bound to heparin with high affinity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>, <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> [Grem1 alone] = 13 nM), confirming our chromatography findings. Whilst the 0032:ND compound did not affect heparin binding of Gremlin-1, the 0030:HD heparin-displacing antibody reduced the affinity by a factor of ten (K<sub>D</sub> [0032:ND-Gremlin-1] = 18 nM <italic>vs</italic> K<sub>D</sub> [0030:HD-Gremlin-1] = 99 nM, respectively, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). In line with these results, Atto-532-conjugated Gremlin-1 bound to the cell surface of LX-2 cells which was prevented by the heparin-displacing 0030:HD but not the 0032:ND or isotype control antibody (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Size-exclusion chromatography on mixtures of Gremlin-1, heparin and anti-Gremlin-1 antibodies revealed that the 0030:HD antibody forms 1:1 complexes with free Gremlin-1 not involving heparin, while the 0032:ND antibody captures heparin-bound Gremlin-1, leading to the formation of higher-order complexes that were insoluble and precipitated (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Overexpression but not antibody blockade of Gremlin-1 modified the expression profile of human hepatic fibrogenic cells</title>
<p>Having characterised effective neutralising antibodies against Gremlin-1, we evaluated whether anti-Gremlin-1 treatment reduced the fibrogenic activation of hepatic stellate cells. For this purpose we used the heparin-displacing 0030:HD antibody. However, anti-Gremlin-1 blockade did not change the expression of COL1A1, ACTA2 or TIMP1 either without or with TGFβ1 treatment, when compared to isotype control in primary human hepatic stellate cells (HHSC) or myofibroblasts (p &gt; 0.05, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A and B</xref>, respectively). To test whether Gremlin-1 had any impact on hepatic stellate cell biology, we overexpressed GREM1 on LX-2 cells and HHSC using a second-generation lentiviral vector. Overexpression increased the expression of GREM1 by a factor of 177 after sorting for GFP in LX-2 (p &lt; 0.001, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 4</xref>) and by a factor of 6.3 in unsorted HHSC (p = 0.0204, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 4</xref>). To assess the effects of overexpression on fibrogenic gene expression, we treated lentivirally transduced cells with TGFβ1 or PBS as vehicle control and performed qPCR for fibrogenic and BMP-signalling-related targets. Overexpression did not significantly affect the expression of COL1A1, ACTA2 or TIMP1 in either LX-2 or primary HHSC (all p &gt; 0.05, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C and D</xref>). However, in LX-2 cells, GREM1 overexpression significantly increased the expression LOX in vehicle control treated cells only (p = 0.020, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), while CCL2 and LOXL1 expression were unaffected (p = 0.11 and p = 0.15, respectively). Moreover, GREM1 overexpression affected gene expression of several BMP-related signalling targets; BMP4, SMAD6 and SMAD7 expression were reduced in vehicle-treated cells only (p = 0.016, p = 0.013 and p = 0.032, respectively, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Additionally, GREM1 overexpression resulted in a significant downregulation of INHBB expression irrespective of TGFβ1 co-treatment (p = 2.4×10<sup>-5</sup>) and upregulation of BMP7 and SMAD1 (p = 0.008 and p = 0.007, respectively, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>).</p>

<title>Lack of therapeutic efficacy in a rat model of MASH fibrosis</title>
<p>To investigate whether therapeutic targeting of hepatic Gremlin-1 could reduce fibrosis in rodent MASH, we used a choline-deficient, L-amino acid defined high fat 1% cholesterol diet (CDAA-HFD) rat model of MASH, in which we had observed increased Gremlin-1 expression. Eight to ten-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats were fed a CDAA-HFD for a total of 12 weeks. In the last six weeks of feeding, rats were treated with weekly subcutaneous injections of “murinised” monoclonal anti-Gremlin-1 non-heparin-displacing (0361:ND) or heparin-displacing antibody (2021:HD) at different concentrations (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Isotype matched mouse IgG1 antibody served as a control treatment. As expected, CDAA-HFD led to a reduction in body weight and induced a MASH phenotype, as evidenced by increased plasma levels of alanine- and aspartate aminotransferase (ALT and AST, respectively), increased liver weight, steatosis, picrosirius red (PSR) positive fibrosis area and CD45<sup>+</sup> immune cell infiltrates (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B-H</xref>).</p>

<p>To test for target engagement of therapeutic antibodies, we took blood at different timepoints of treatment and measured circulating Gremlin-1 concentrations.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In recent years, Gremlin-1 has been recognised as a potential therapeutic target in treating patients with MASH, and MASH fibrosis in particular. Baboota <italic>et al</italic> recently suggested that anti-Gremlin-1 based therapies may be able to halt or even reverse MASH progression through inhibition of hepatocellular senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). In the present study, we aimed to develop and evaluate anti-Gremlin-1 neutralising antibodies as therapeutic assets for the treatment of MASH fibrosis.</p>
<p>Gremlin-1 is mainly expressed in adipose tissue, the intestine and the kidneys, while hepatic expression is considered low in healthy human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) and rodent tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). In healthy mouse liver, Gremlin-1 expression was undetectable, but others have previously found increased mRNA expression in murine fibrotic liver in Mdr2<sup>-/-</sup> mice fed a cholate-containing diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>) and porcine serum-induced murine liver fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Similarly, in patients with type 2 diabetes and MASH, Hedjazifar <italic>et al</italic> have found increased Gremlin-1 expression and a positive correlation with liver steatosis, inflammation, ballooning and the stage of fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Our findings of increased RNAscope ISH signal in human and rat MASH fibrosis largely corroborate existing evidence, although our secondary analyses from existing bulk RNA-sequencing datasets conflicted in that regard. Furthermore, our RNAscope studies on human livers highlight the heterogeneity of Gremlin-1 expression across and within individual livers, resulting in a high risk of sampling bias. Not least, we showed increased hepatic Gremlin-1 expression across different aetiologies of end-stage chronic liver disease, pointing towards a role not specific to metabolic liver disease.</p>
<p>The exact cellular localisation of hepatic Gremlin-1 is under continuous investigation. Using RNAscope in-situ hybridization, we found that Gremlin-1 mRNA localised to COL3A1/THY1<sup>+</sup> myofibroblasts. Some authors previously found increased Gremlin-1 expression in human HSC-derived myofibroblasts when compared to quiescent and early activated HSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). However, following studies found evidence that Gremlin-1 expression is most abundant in portal fibroblasts when compared to hepatic stellate cells in murine bile duct ligation and CCl<sub>4</sub> models of fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>), suggesting that portal fibroblast-derived myofibroblasts, rather than HSC-derived myofibroblasts, are the predominant Gremlin-1-expressing cells of the liver. Still, as mentioned above, hepatic Gremlin-1 expression seems to be very low, evidenced by available liver scRNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). In our integrated analysis of both data sets, Gremlin-1 was barely detectable but showed considerable expression in smooth muscle cell subsets and myofibroblasts expressing COL3A1 and THY1. All taken together, our data confirmed a subset of myofibroblasts as the predominant hepatic cell population expressing Gremlin-1.</p>
<p>We found increased levels of Gremlin-1 expression in MASH fibrosis and localisation of Gremlin-1 to periportal hepatic fibroblasts. However, we did not find any therapeutic effect of antibody-mediated neutralisation of Gremlin-1, neither in a rat CDAA-HFD <italic>in vivo</italic> model nor in human <italic>ex vivo</italic> or <italic>in vitro</italic> culture models of MASH fibrosis. We extensively tested and characterised our therapeutic antibodies and were able to show high-affinity binding to Gremlin-1 and inhibition of its functional activity on BMP4. Furthermore, treating rats with the heparin-displacing anti-Gremlin-1 antibody <italic>in vivo</italic> led to a significant increase in circulating Gremlin-1 protein, evidencing reliable target engagement. However, the small subset of COL3A1+/THY1+ periportal fibroblasts unlikely represents the major fibrogenic cell subset in MASH. While periportal myofibroblasts play an important role in biliary fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>), in most chronic liver diseases such as MASH and alcohol-related liver disease, hepatic stellate cell (HSC)-derived myofibroblasts represent the predominant fibrogenic cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Moreover, hepatic Gremlin-1 expression is quite low when compared to organs such as the intestine or visceral adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Others suggested that Gremlin-1 plays an important role in visceral adipose tissue biology by driving adipocyte hypertrophy and adipose tissue dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Given the important role of visceral adipose tissue dysfunction in MASLD/MASH development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>), Gremlin-1 could drive the development and progression of MASH by modulating local adipose tissue function. Some authors even have hypothesized that visceral adipose tissue Gremlin-1 might act directly on the liver via delivery through the bloodstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), but this seems unlikely considering the high affinity binding of Gremlin-1 to glycosaminoglycans such as heparin, which very likely prevents Gremlin-1 from entering the blood stream. We carefully selected the CDAA-HFD rat model of MASH fibrosis for our <italic>in vivo</italic> studies as this was the only animal model tested that showed convincing and reliable hepatic upregulation of Gremlin-1 upon liver injury. While the CDAA-HFD model reliably reproduces the histological hallmarks of hepatic disease in MASH, such as liver steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>), it does not incorporate extrahepatic factors such as obesity and adipose tissue dysfunction as drivers of disease. On the contrary, CDAA-HFD leads to reduced weight gain and reduced visceral adiposity compared to control diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Data on adipose tissue biology in CDAA-HFD are scarce, but increased expression and release of the obesogenic cytokine leptin is considered a hallmark of severe obesity and the metabolic syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Experiments on mice suggest that this axis is disrupted in CDAA-fed animals as they show reduced leptin levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Likewise, although not specifically tested, obesity-induced changes in adipose tissue Gremlin-1 expression and biology are likely not reflected in the CDAA-HFD model used here.</p>
<p>Precision-cut liver slices (PCLS) are a well-established method that allows the study of hepatic signalling pathways <italic>ex vivo</italic>, and unlike monolayer cell culture models reflects hepatic cell-cell interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). We used liver specimen from patients undergoing liver transplantation, which enabled us to study the effects of anti-Gremlin-1 treatment on clinically relevant, chronically diseased liver. However, these samples were derived from patients with end-stage liver disease which is usually not amenable to pharmacological interventions aimed at reversing disease. We were also limited to studying samples after 24 hours of treatment, because we observed tissue and RNA degradation when keeping cirrhotic PCLS in culture for longer. While others have incubated cirrhotic PCLS for up to 48 hours, they still observed significant changes in gene expression as early as 24 hours after dosing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>), and we also found a clear anti-fibrotic response upon ALK5 inhibition, so it is unlikely that the shorter duration of our experiment precluded us from observing early effects of Gremlin-1 blockade. However, any potential effects of Gremlin-1 on infiltrating immune cells and extrahepatic signals, e.g. from the gut or adipose tissue, are not reflected in PCLS.</p>
<p>Our negative findings from rat <italic>in vivo</italic> and human <italic>ex vivo</italic> models were largely corroborated by our results obtained through <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture of fibrotic liver cells. Anti-Gremlin-1 treatment was ineffective in reducing pro-fibrogenic gene expression in both LX-2 and primary HHSC. This was in line with findings that lentiviral overexpression of GREM1 in both cell types did not alter the expression of fibrogenic genes in response to TGFβ1. Interestingly, overexpression of GREM1 increased the expression of CCL2, a proinflammatory cytokine upregulated in early stellate cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>) and LOX, which plays an important role in collagen-crosslinking and is typically upregulated later in the HSC activation cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). GREM1 overexpression also modulated the expression of BMP-signalling-related genes, including BMP7, SMADs and INHBB, which might counter-balance any potential pro-fibrogenic effect.</p>
<p>Overall, considering the minor role of periportal fibroblasts, the main cell population expressing Gremlin-1, in MASH fibrosis and the lack of an effect upon neutralisation of Gremlin-1, the role of hepatic Gremlin-1 in liver fibrosis seems questionable. While some authors described <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of siRNA knockdown of Gremlin-1 on liver fibrosis in a carbon tetrachloride model of liver fibrosis in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>), others did not find any effect of adenoviral overexpression or intraperitoneal injection of recombinant Gremlin-1 protein on steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis in high-fat diet-fed mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Furthermore, recent studies suggest that Gremlin-1 might not be a solely pro-fibrotic protein through inhibition of BMPs. Studies on myocardial fibrosis, urinary carcinoma and intervertebral disc degeneration found that Gremlin-1 can also directly antagonise TGFβ1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>), thereby potentially exerting anti-fibrotic effects. Therefore, the specific role of Gremlin-1 in organ fibrosis might be largely context-dependent, depending on the local balance of BMPs and TGF proteins.</p>
<p>Our findings regarding the heparin-binding properties of Gremlin-1 shed further light on biological function and potential use of Gremlin-1 as a biomarker or therapeutic target. Heparin binding is a hallmark of the TGFβ superfamily of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>), including Gremlin-1 belonging to the Dan family, and therefore it was not unexpected that Gremlin-1 also possesses high-affinity binding properties towards glycosaminoglycans such as heparan sulphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). To our surprise, using our highly sensitive and specific luminescent channelling assays, we found no consistent evidence of circulating Gremlin-1 protein. Other groups reported increased levels of Gremlin-1 protein in the blood of patients with MASLD/MASH and cardiovascular disease and even found correlations with parameters of hepatic disease activity and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Proving the absence of a protein is inherently challenging if not impossible. Still, leading up to this assay we tested many high-affinity polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, exploiting all epitopes of Gremlin-1 to avoid epitope masking in circulation. Using these antibodies on several detection platforms, we still found no detectable Gremlin-1 in circulation, despite high-sensitivity of our assays, which was confirmed using spike-ins of recombinant protein from several batches and the presence of detectable Gremlin-1 in circulation after anti-Gremlin-1 treatment in the rat CDAA-HFD model. Furthermore, the absence of any signal suggests that unspecific binding was not an issue. We are therefore confident that our assay worked and that we should have been able to pick up signals from Gremlin-1 concentrations as high as have been reported in the literature. We propose that the heparin-binding properties of Gremlin-1 preclude release of Gremlin-1 protein into systemic circulation while it is retained locally in its functional niche, amplifying local activity surrounding Gremlin-1-expressing cells. However, this likely precludes release of Gremlin-1 protein into systemic circulation. Therefore, previous findings relating to correlations of circulating Gremlin-1 need to be interpreted with caution. Still, extracellular vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>) and platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>) reportedly can contain Gremlin-1, which might still offer a route of inter-organ communication through Gremlin-1. Taken together, the implications of Gremlin-1 heparin-binding properties and possibility of its absence from systemic circulation clearly need to be considered when studying its function, therapeutic applications and suitability as a biomarker.</p>
<p>In summary, our data provide compelling evidence that hepatic Gremlin-1 is not a suitable target for treating MASH-induced liver fibrosis. However, this does not preclude a role for Gremlin-1 in other liver diseases, and biliary fibrosis in particular. Furthermore, mounting evidence suggests a role for Gremlin-1 in carcinogenesis and future studies will have to define its role in hepatocellular carcinoma development. Not least, the role of Gremlin-1 in adipose tissue is well established and targeting visceral adipose rather than hepatic Gremlin-1 might be a more promising target in MASH. More research is needed though, to confirm a link between adipose Gremlin-1 and hepatic inflammation and fibrosis.</p>

<title>Generation of human therapeutic anti-Gremlin-1 antibody</title>
<p>The Adimab antibody discovery platform was used to select antibodies against Gremlin-1 as described in the following. Eight separate libraries, representing different antibody families and each with a 1-2 × 10<sup>9</sup> diversity, were screened for specific binders through consecutive rounds of enrichment using MACS and FACS. In short, using biotinylated rhGremlin as a “bait” protein, two rounds of MACS selections were performed followed by three rounds of FACS, including a de-selection round for poly-specific binders. After the final selection round, clones were plated, picked and sequenced from each of the libraries. From the pool of sequences, unique antibodies were identified, and these were expressed, purified, and subsequently tested for binding to Gremlin-1 using Fortebio technology. To increase the panel of high affinity antibodies, a light chain shuffle was performed using the heavy chain output from the naïve selection. For use in the rat MASH study, the human variable light and heavy chains were grafted onto a murine scaffold.</p>

<title>Lentiviral overexpression</title>
<p>We used a replication-deficient recombinant second generation lentivirus for <italic>in vitro</italic> overexpression studies. The coding sequence for Gremlin-1 (Origene, Cat-No RC210835) was inserted into the plasmid pWPI (kindly provided by Roy Bicknell at University of Birmingham), followed by the coding sequence for the enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (eGFP). This plasmid will be referred to as GREM1-pWPI. The pWPI plasmid including the sequence for eGFP but lacking the GREM1 insert (GFP-pWPI) was used to generate an empty vector control in subsequent experiments (GFP-control). GFP-only control and GREM1 lentiviruses were produced by transfecting HEK293T cells with Lipofectamine 3000 (L3000001, Invitrogen) in OptiMEM (31985070, Gibco) containing 14.4 µg GFP-pWPI or GREM1-pWPI, 8.33 µg psPAX2 - providing the lentiviral replication function - and 2.63 µg pMD2.G - for pseudotyping with the VSV-G, enabling cell entry of the virus into mammalian cells.

<p>A BRE-MLP-Luc plasmid was constructed as described by Korchynskyi &amp; Dijke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>) with the exception that the reporter was inserted into a pGL4.20 vector (Promega). For generating the cell line, 1 ×10<sup>6</sup> C2C12 cells (ATCC® CRL-1772™) were seeded in 5 mL growth medium (high glucose Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (Gibco), 20% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin mix (Gibco)) in a T25 culture flask (Nunc) and incubated at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The following day, a mixture of 1.25 mL OptiMEM (Gibco), 25 µL Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and 10 µg BRE-MLP-Luc plasmid was added to the culture flask. On day 3, puromycin (Gibco) was added to the flask for a final concentration of 2 µg/mL to select for cells which had stably incorporated the transfected plasmid. The cells were cultured in growth medium with a supplement of 2 µg/mL puromycin until confluent, then a single cell clone was isolated. The resulting stable clone, C2C12/BRE-Luc, would emit luminescence following stimulation with BMP-4 in a concentration dependent manner upon addition of luciferase substrate.</p>

The following day, serial dilutions of therapeutic anti-Gremlin antibody (in-house) were prepared and pre-incubated with recombinant human Gremlin-1 (in-house) for 20 min at room temperature on a plate shaker at 350 RPM. Thereafter, the anti-Gremlin/Gremlin-1 mixes were incubated with recombinant human BMP-4 (R&amp;D, #314-BP/CF) for 20 min at room temperature on a plate shaker at 350 RPM. All dilutions were performed in high glucose Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium with 1% penicillin-streptomycin, resulting in final concentrations of anti-Gremlin, Gremlin-1 and BMP-4 of 100-0.78 nM, 50 nM and 1 nM, respectively.

The following day, plates were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 0.5% Tween-20 and blocked by incubating with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 4 hours at room temperature on a plate shaker at 350 RPM. Meanwhile, anti-Gremlin antibody was serially diluted and pre-incubated with primary amine biotinylated (degree of labelling ≈ 1) recombinant human Gremlin-1 (in-house) for 20 min at room temperature on a plate shaker at 350 RPM. Dilutions were performed with phosphate buffered saline with 0.2% Tween-20 and the final concentrations of anti-Gremlin antibody and biotinylated Gremlin-1 were 40-0.09 nM and 10 nM, respectively. After blocking, plates were washed as described above, and 25 µL per well anti-Gremlin/biotin-Gremlin-1 mixes were added and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature on a plate shaker at 350 RPM. To detect plate-bound biotinylated Gremlin-1, plates were washed, as described above, and 25 µL per well 0.06 µg/mL streptavidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Thermo Scientific) was added.

<title>Fluorescence polarization assay</title>
<p>The binding affinity of Gremlin-1 or Gremlin-1-mAb mixtures to fluorescein-labelled Heparin (Heparin-FL, H7482, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was measured in a fluorescence polarization assay. A 12-point dilution series of Gremlin-1 or Gremlin-1/mAb was titrated to a constant Heparin-FL concentration of 10 nM in 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) polysorbate 20, pH 7.4. The highest Gremlin-1 concentration assayed was thus 1 µM, referring to the dimer. In mAb-containing samples, mAb was used at a 1.5x molar excess, i.e. 1.5 µM at the highest concentration, and diluted alongside Gremlin-1 (so that the 1.5x molar excess was maintained throughout the dilution series). Both tested mAbs bind to Gremlin with high affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> &lt; 1 nM), so the mAb-Gremlin-1 complex can be assumed to be the dominating species in the mixture over the whole concentration range tested. Samples were incubated for 5 h at room temperature and fluorescence polarization was measured in duplicate in a 384-well plate (Cat # 784900, Greiner) on a microplate reader (Spark, Tecan), using 485/20 nm and 535/25 nm excitation and emission filters, respectively (a second measurement after 20 h confirmed that equilibrium was reached in the 5 h measurement). The binding curve was fitted with a 1:1 binding isotherm in GraphPad Prism (Graph Pad software), using the equation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="574043v2_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, with <italic>S</italic> the measured fluorescence polarization, <italic>b</italic> the fluorescence polarization signal of the unbound Heparin-FL, <italic>a</italic> the amplitude of the signal change, <italic>x</italic> the Gremlin-1 concentration and <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> the binding affinity.

Sections were stained manually with Picro Sirius Red (PSR), and in the Ventana Autostainer with anti-CD45 at 2 µg/ml (Abcam ab10558, Cambridge, UK), anti-alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) at 0.04 µg/ml (clone EPR5368, Abcam ab124964), anti-CD68 at 1.5 µg/ml (clone E3O7V, Cell Signaling 97778, Danvers, MA), anti-CD11b at 0.5 µg/ml (clone EPR1344, Abcam ab133357), or anti-type I collagen at 4 µg/ml (Southern Biotech 1310-01, Birmingham, AL) using heat-induced epitope retrieval at basic pH, HRP-coupled detection polymers, and the Purple chromogen. All primary antibodies were of rabbit or goat origin to avoid background from the mouse anti-gremlin therapeutic antibody. Stained liver sections were scanned as 8-bit RGB colour images (pixel size: 442 nm) using a NanoZoomer S60 digital slide scanner (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Hamamatsu City, Japan). Quantitative image analysis was applied to the entire liver sections using Visiopharm Integrator System software (VIS ver. 8.4; Visiopharm, Hørsholm, Denmark). The fractional area (%) of PSR, steatosis, CD45, α-SMA, CD68, CD11b, and Col1a1 stains was expressed relative to total sectional area.</p>

<title>RNAscope in situ hybridization</title>
<p>Twenty-five human diagnostic, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) histological liver needle biopsies were retrieved from the archives at Department of Pathology at Aalborg University Hospital, Denmark. The biopsies were diagnosed as normal, n=5, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (MASH) with mild fibrosis, n=7, MASH with moderate/severe fibrosis, n=6, and MASH with cirrhosis, n=7. RNAscope duplex in situ hybridization (ISH) was performed on the Leica Biosystems BOND RX platform. RNAscope probes (Advanced Cell Diagnostics (ACD) Newark, California) directed against human GREM1 and human THY1 or COL3A1 were hybridized for 2 h at 42°C using RNAscope 2.5 LS Duplex Reagent Kit (ACD) followed by RNAscope amplification. Fast red chromogenic detection of GREM1 was followed by green chromogenic detection (ACD) of THY1 or COL3A1. Sections were counterstained with haematoxylin. The GREM1-positive dot area fraction (dot area per tissue area) of single RNAscope ISH with the GREM1 probe has been quantified using HALO v3.5.3577 and the Area Quantification v2.4.2 module.</p>

<title>RNA sequencing</title>
<p>RNA was isolated as described above and quality checked on a spectrophotometer. RNA was then submitted to Genomics Birmingham at the University of Birmingham for further quality control, library preparation and sequencing. Quality control was performed using Qubit High Sensitivity RNA assay (Q32852, Invitrogen<sup>TM</sup>) on a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Invitrogen) and RNA ScreenTape (5067-5576, Agilent) on the Agilent TapeStation 4200. Single-end 75 base-pair libraries were generated using the QuantSeq 3’ mRNA-Seq Library Prep Kit FWD for Illumina (015.96, Lexogen) with an RNA input of 100 ng. Quality of libraries was then checked using the Agilent TapeStation D1000 ScreenTape (5067-5582, Agilent) and Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity kit (Q32851, Invitrogen). Finally, pooled libraries at 1.6 pM were sequenced on the NextSeq 500 sequencing platform (Illumina) on a NextSeq Mid 150 flowcell.</p>
<p>Raw sequencing files were obtained from Genomics Birmingham at the University of Birmingham. Adapter and quality trimming were performed using fastp using the adapter sequence GATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC and settings --trim_poly_g --trim_poly_x --cut_tail --cut_window_size=4 --cut_mean_quality=20--disable_quality_filtering --low_complexity_filter --complexity_threshold=30--length_required 36.</p>
<p>After quality control with fastqc, gene abundance was quantified using a decoy-aware transcriptome index (transcriptome gencode version 29, genome GRCh38) and salmon 1.5.9 with default settings. Downstream data import into R and differential gene expression analysis were performed as described for publicly available RNAseq data using the tximport and DESeq2 packages.</p>

<title>Analyses of publicly available transcriptome datasets</title>
<p>Publicly available datasets from liver tissue transcriptome experiments were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), the European Nucleotide Archive and ArrayExpress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>).</p>
<p>Raw sequencing data were transferred to the public Galaxy server <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://usegalaxy.org">usegalaxy.org</ext-link> to pre-process the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Data were transformed to standard FASTQ format using the fasterq-dump function. Quality control, quality and adapter trimming were performed with fastp and default settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). The trimmed sequencing files were then aligned to the human Gencode reference transcriptome (version 36, available from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gencodegenes.org/human">https://www.gencodegenes.org/human</ext-link>) using salmon quant from the pseudoalignment tool salmon with --validate Mappings, --seqBias and --gcBias turned on with default settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). For downstream analyses, gene or transcript counts were imported into R using the tximport pipeline for salmon output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). Differential gene expression was performed with the DESEq2 package using the likelihood ratio test or the Wald test as appropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). Variance stabilised expression values, obtained using the vst function in DESeq2, were used for visualisation of gene expression.</p>
<p>Raw count matrices for liver single-cell RNA sequencing datasets were obtained from the GEO server (GSE136103, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>)) and the Liver Cell Atlas website (GSE192742, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>)).</p>
<p>Low quality cells were removed if the number of detected features was below 300 or the percentage of mitochondrial genes per cell was higher than 30 percent. Following quality filtering, gene expression was normalised by cluster-based log-normalisation using the igraph method in the quickCluster function from the scran package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Variable features were identified using the fitted mean-variance calculated with the modelGeneVar function with default settings. Doublet contamination was removed using the default method of the doubletFinder v3 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>).</p>
<p>Following quality control and cleaning of both datasets separately, both datasets were integrated based on their common genes and using the reciprocal principal component analysis (RPCA) method implemented in the Seurat v4 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). Based on the integrated gene expression matrix, data scaling, principal component analysis and nearest neighbour graph-based clustering were performed using the standard Seurat workflow. Cell types were manually annotated by marker gene expression obtained from the FindConservedMarkers function in Seurat v4 and based on the annotation provided by the Guilliams lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>).</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> paper shows that the anti-gremlin-1 (GREM1) antibody is not effective at treating liver inflammation or fibrosis. Critically, the evidence also challenges existing data on the detection of GREM1 by ELISA in serum or plasma by demonstrating that high-affinity binding of GREM1 to heparin would lead to localisation of GREM1 in the ECM or at the plasma membrane of cells. The conclusions are supported by a <bold>convincing</bold>, well-controlled set of experiments.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Horn and colleagues present data suggesting that the targeting of GREM1 has little impact on a mouse model of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis. Importantly, they also challenge existing data on the detection of GREM1 by ELISA in serum or plasma by demonstrating that high-affinity binding of GREM1 to heparin would lead to localisation of GREM1 in the ECM or at the plasma membrane of cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is an impressive tour-de-force study around the potential of targeting GREM1 in MASH.</p>
<p>This paper will challenge many existing papers in the field around our ability to detect GREM1 in circulation, at least using antibody-mediated detection.</p>
<p>Well-controlled, detailed studies like this are critically important in order to challenge less vigorous studies in the literature.</p>
<p>The impressive volume of high-level, well-controlled data using an impressive range of in vitro biochemical techniques, rodent models, and human liver slices.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: only minor.</p>
<p>(1) The authors clearly show that heparin can limit the diffusion of GREM1 into the circulation-however, in a setting where GREM1 is produced in excess (e.g. cancer), could this &quot;saturate&quot; the available heparin and allow GREM1 to &quot;escape&quot; into the circulation?</p>
<p>(2) Secondly, has the author considered that GREM1 be circulating bound to a chaperone protein like albumin which would reduce its reactivity with GREM1 detection antibodies?</p>
<p>(3) Statistics-there is no mention of blinding of samples-I assume this was done prior to analysis?</p>

<p>It is controversial whether liver gremlin-1 expression correlates with liver fibrosis in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Horn et al. developed an anti-Gremlin-1 antibody in-house and tested its ability to neutralize gremlin-1 and treat liver fibrosis. This article has the advantage of testing its hypothesis with different animal and human liver fibrosis models and using a variety of research methodologies.</p>
<p>The experimental design and results support the conclusion that the anti-gremlin-1 antibody had no therapeutic effect on treating liver fibrosis, so there are no other suggestions for new experiments:</p>
<p>(1) The authors used RNAscope in situ hybridization to establish the correlation between Gremlin-1 expression and NMSH livers or cell lines.</p>
<p>(2) A luminescent oxygen channelling immunoassay was used to measure circulating Gremlin-1 concentration. They found that Gremlin-1 binds to heparin very efficiently, preventing Gremlin-1 from entering circulation, and restricting Gremlin-1's ability to mediate organ cross-communication.</p>
<p>(3) The authors developed a suitable NMSH rat model which is a choline-deficient, L-amino acid defined high fat 1% cholesterol diet (CDAA-HFD) fed rat model of NMSH, and created a selective anti-Gremlin-1 antibody which is heparin-displacing 0030:HD antibody. They also used human cirrhotic precision-cut liver slices to test their hypotheses. They demonstrated that neutralization of Gremlin-1 activity with monoclonal therapeutic antibodies does not reduce liver inflammation or liver fibrosis.</p>
<p>One concern is that several reagents and assays are made in-house without external validation. Also, will those in-house reagents and assays be available to the science community?</p>
<p>Overall this manuscript provides useful information that gremlin-1 has a limited role in liver fibrosis pathogenesis and treatment.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Horn and colleagues present data suggesting that the targeting of GREM1 has little impact on a mouse model of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis. Importantly, they also challenge existing data on the detection of GREM1 by ELISA in serum or plasma by demonstrating that high-affinity binding of GREM1 to heparin would lead to localisation of GREM1 in the ECM or at the plasma membrane of cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is an impressive tour-de-force study around the potential of targeting GREM1 in MASH.</p>
<p>This paper will challenge many existing papers in the field around our ability to detect GREM1 in circulation, at least using antibody-mediated detection.</p>
<p>Well-controlled, detailed studies like this are critically important in order to challenge less vigorous studies in the literature.</p>
<p>The impressive volume of high-level, well-controlled data using an impressive range of in vitro biochemical techniques, rodent models, and human liver slices.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their time in assessing our manuscript and are very grateful for the positive response. Below, we give a point-by-point response to the reviewer’s comments and indicate where we plan to adjust the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses: only minor.</p>
<p>(1) The authors clearly show that heparin can limit the diffusion of GREM1 into the circulation-however, in a setting where GREM1 is produced in excess (e.g. cancer), could this &quot;saturate&quot; the available heparin and allow GREM1 to &quot;escape&quot; into the circulation?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their question. Indeed theoretically, if the production of Gremlin-1 exceeds the capacity of heparin to immobilise Gremlin-1, the protein may be released into solution and thus may enter the circulation. Whilst we have not addressed this possibility in our studies, we agree that it may be a mechanism worthwhile exploring in future studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Secondly, has the author considered that GREM1 be circulating bound to a chaperone protein like albumin which would reduce its reactivity with GREM1 detection antibodies?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have thought of the possibility that Gremlin would bind other proteins such as BMPs, and thereby mask assay-antibody epitopes. To minimise this possibility, we used antibody pairs which bind different epitopes. We also used LC-MS for Gremlin-1 detection (data not shown in the manuscript), a method that is not affected by epitope masking. With the LC-MS analysis we did not pick up any gremlin-signal in plasma. We will mention the LC-MS data in the updated manuscript.</p>
<p>Also, we were able to detect circulating Gremlin-1 after treatment with anti-Gremlin-1 antibodies. As these were the same antibodies that were used in our assays, we should have not been able to detect Gremlin-1 if there had been a masking interaction with circulating high abundant plasma proteins such as albumin.</p>
<p>Finally, we believe that the assay antibodies would outcompete binding of any other proteins because of their high affinity and very high concentrations used in the assays.</p>
<p>In summary, we are very confident that Gremlin-1 is not present in circulation. We will though make some minor adjustments to the manuscript in order to stress this important point.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Statistics-there is no mention of blinding of samples-I assume this was done prior to analysis?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>All reported results were derived from hard quantitative readouts obtained through assays that are not liable to subjective interpretation. This also applies to immunohistochemistry and RNAscope histologic quantification, using Visiopharm Integrator System software ver. 8.4 or HALO v3.5.3577 (Area Quantification v2.4.2 module), respectively. Therefore, no blinding was necessary prior to analysis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Line 211-I suggest adding the Figure reference at the end of this sentence to direct the reader to the relevant data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion and will add a reference to Figure 1F here.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Figure 1E Y-axis units are a little hard to interpret-can integers be used?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As the y axis in Figure 1E is on the logarithmic scale, integer numbers would be very hard to read because of the large range of numbers. As we acknowledge that the notation used may be difficult to read, we will change it to superscript scientific notation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Did the authors attempt to detect GREM1 protein by IHC? There are published methods for this using the R&amp;D Systems mouse antibody (PMID 31384391).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Parallel to the work described in PMID 31384391 (Dutton et al., Oncotarget, 10: 4630-4639, 2019), we have tested a whole range of commercial and in-house gremlin-1 antibodies. We independently arrived at the same conclusion as Dutton et al namely that goat anti-gremlin antibody R&amp;D Systems AF956 can stain the mouse or rat intestine in the muscularis layer and in the crypts/lower part of the villi, using FFPE sections. As per Dutton et al. we also corroborated this IHC staining by RNAscope - the mRNA was restricted to the muscularis and the connective tissue just below the crypts, suggesting that Gremlin-1 partially diffuses away from the cells that produce it. In contrast, none of the other commercial or in-house gremlin antibodies that we tested provided any useful staining on FFPE sections.</p>
<p>We also used the R&amp;D Systems AF956 antibody on several rat MASH liver samples. We saw little or no staining in livers from chow-fed rats, with only occasional weak staining around portal areas. Depending on the rat model, we saw from little or no staining to at most weak staining in portal areas and fibrotic areas. Among the various models tested, we observed the strongest staining in the rat CDAA-HFD+cholesterol model, in line with the ISH data.</p>
<p>However, we were unable to establish IHC on human MASH liver samples using the R&amp;D Systems AF956 antibody (or any other antibody) despite 98% sequence identity at the amino acid level between human and rat gremlin-1. Considering the results in Dutton et al. on rodent intestines, we tested the antibody on some human intestine samples, but the results on the available samples (inflamed appendices) were inconclusive.</p>
<p>We will include representative IHC staining images for Gremlin-1 protein on rat livers as a Supplementary Figure and mention in the manuscript that IHC for human Gremlin-1 did not work with the available antibodies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Did the authors ever observe GREM1 internalisation using their Atto-532 labelled GREM1?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The Atto-532 Gremlin-1 cell association assay was mainly intended to visualise the association of Gremlin-1 with cell surface proteoglycans and how this interaction is affected by heparin-displacing and non-displacing antibodies. We observed a possible, but inconclusive intracellular association of Atto-532 Gremlin-1. However, this assay was not specifically designed for this purpose, and we did not follow up on this. Therefore, we cannot draw any conclusions on whether cell surface bound Gremlin-1 can be internalised. However, we appreciate that internalisation of Gremlin-1 would be an interesting biological mechanism worth following up in future studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Did the authors complete GREM1 ISH in the rat CDAA-HFD model? Was GREM1 upregulated, and if so, where?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have performed Grem1 ISH in the rat CDAA-HFD model and representative images of this are shown in Figure 1F. In chow-fed animals, Grem1 was expressed in a few cells in the portal tract, whereas after CDAA-HFD, Grem1 positive cells became more abundant in the portal tract and were also detectable in the fibrotic septa, as described in the respective results section. However, we performed no co-staining with other markers as we did for human liver samples.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) Supplementary Figure 4C - why does the GFP level decrease in the GREM1 transgenic compared to control the GFP mouse? No such change is observed in Supplementary Figure 4E.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In Supplementary Figure 4C we show expression of GFP mRNA and GREM1 mRNA in lysates of GFP-control and GREM1-GFP overexpressing LX-2 cells. The x-axis labels indicate the different lentiviruses. Therefore, the right panel in Supplementary Figure 4C shows that GREM1 overexpressing LX-2 cells expressed more GREM1 compared to GFP-control transduced LX-2, while GFP mRNA expression was comparable between the two.</p>
<p>The results in Supplementary Figure 4E look different because – as can also be seen from the % of GFP+ cells in Supplementary Figure 4D – the GREM1 lentivirus here was more effective in transducing the cells, which is why both GFP and GREM1 mRNA were increased with GREM1 lentivirus compared to the GFP-only control. Unlike LX-2, the lentivirally transduced HHSC were not sorted on GFP positive cells prior to qPCR, which may explain the differences in GFP mRNA expression pattern between the two cell types.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that the figure may be difficult to interpret and will adjust the figure annotation to improve on this.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for their time in assessing our manuscript and are very grateful for the positive response. We acknowledge the fact that most of our results were derived from assays using in-house generated reagents which will therefore be hard to reproduce externally. Whilst for legal reasons we cannot share the sequences of the monoclonal antibodies, we will be able to share aliquots with fellow scientists upon request. We will include a sentence to this end to the data availability statement.</p>
