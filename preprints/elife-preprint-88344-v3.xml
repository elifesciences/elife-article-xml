<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The force developed by actively lengthened muscle depends on different structures across different scales of lengthening. For small perturbations, the active response of muscle is well captured by a linear-time-invariant (LTI) system: a stiff spring in parallel with a light damper. The force response of muscle to longer stretches is better represented by a compliant spring that can fix its end when activated. Experimental work has shown that the stiffness and damping (impedance) of muscle in response to small perturbations is of fundamental importance to motor learning and mechanical stability, while the huge forces developed during long active stretches are critical for simulating and predicting injury. Outside of motor learning and injury, muscle is actively lengthened as a part of nearly all terrestrial locomotion. Despite the functional importance of impedance and active lengthening, no single muscle model has all of these mechanical properties. In this work, we present the viscoelastic-crossbridge active-titin (VEXAT) model that can replicate the response of muscle to length changes great and small. To evaluate the VEXAT model, we compare its response to biological muscle by simulating experiments that measure the impedance of muscle, and the forces developed during long active stretches. In addition, we have also compared the responses of the VEXAT model to a popular Hill-type muscle model. The VEXAT model more accurately captures the impedance of biological muscle and its responses to long active stretches than a Hill-type model and can still reproduce the force-velocity and force-length relations of muscle. While the comparison between the VEXAT model and biological muscle is favorable, there are some phenomena that can be improved: the low frequency phase response of the model, and a mechanism to support passive force enhancement.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The stiffness and damping of muscle are properties of fundamental importance for motor control, and the accurate simulation of muscle force. The central nervous system (CNS) exploits the activation-dependent stiffness and damping (impedance) of muscle when learning new movements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>], and when moving in unstable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>] or noisy environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Reaching experiments using haptic manipulanda show that the CNS uses co-contraction to increase the stiffness of the arm when perturbed by an unstable force field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. With time and repetition, the force field becomes learned and co-contraction is reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>].</p>
<p>The force response of muscle is not uniform, but varies with both the length and time of perturbation. Under constant activation and at a consistent nominal length, Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] were able to show that muscle behaves like a linear-time-invariant (LTI) system in response to small<sup>1</sup> perturbations: a spring-damper of best fit captured over 90% of the observed variation in muscle force for small perturbations (1-3.8% optimal length) over a wide range of bandwidths (4-90Hz). When active muscle is stretched appreciably, titin can develop enormous forces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], which may prevent further lengthening and injury. The stiffness that best captures the response of muscle to the small perturbations of Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] is far greater than the stiffness that best captures the response of muscle to large perturbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Since everyday movements are often accompanied by both large and small kinematic perturbations, it is important to accurately capture these two processes.</p>
<p>However, there is likely no single muscle model that can replicate the force response of muscle to small [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] and large perturbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] while also retaining the capability to reproduce the experiments of Hill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] and Gordon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Unfortunately, this means that simulation studies that depend on an accurate representation of muscle impedance may reach conclusions well justified in simulation but not in reality. In this work, we focus on formulating a mechanistic muscle model<sup>2</sup> that can replicate the force response of active muscle to length perturbations both great and small.</p>
<p>There are predominantly three classes of models that are used to simulate musculoskeletal responses: phenomenological models constructed using Hill’s famous force-velocity relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], mechanistic Huxley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] models in which individual elastic crossbridges are incorporated, and linearized muscle models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] which are accurate for small changes in muscle length. Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] demon-strated that, for small perturbations, the force response of muscle is well represented by a spring in parallel with a damper. Neither Hill nor Huxley models are likely to replicate Kirsch et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] experiments because a Hill muscle model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>] does not contain any active spring elements; while a Huxley model lacks an active damping element. Although linearized muscle models can replicate Kirsch et al.’s experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], these models are only accurate for small changes in length and cannot replicate the Hill’s nonlinear force-velocity relation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], nor Gordon et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] nonlinear force-length relation. However, there have been significant improvements to the canonical forms of phenomenological, mechanistic, and linearized muscle models that warrant closer inspection.</p>
<p>Several novel muscle models have been proposed to improve upon the accuracy of Hill-type muscle models during large active stretches. Forcinito et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] modeled the velocity dependence of muscle using a rheological element<sup>3</sup> and an elastic rack rather than embedding the force-velocity relationship in equations directly, as is done in a typical Hill model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. This modification allows Forcinito et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] model to more faithfully replicate the force development of active muscle, as compared to a Hill-type model, during ramp length changes of <italic>≈</italic> 10%<sup>4</sup> of the optimal CE length, and across velocities of 4 <italic>−</italic> 11% of the maximum contraction velocity<sup>5</sup>. Haeufle et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>] made use of a serial-parallel network of spring-dampers to allow their model to reproduce Hill’s force-velocity relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] mechanistically rather than embedding the experimental curve directly in their model. This modification allowed Haeufle et al.’s model to simulate high speed reaching movements that agree more closely with experimental data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] than is possible with a typical Hill model. Gü nther et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>] evaluated how accurately a variety of spring-damper models were able to reproduce the microscopic increases in crossbridge force in response to small length changes. While each of these models improves upon the force response of the Hill model to ramp length changes, none are likely to reproduce Kirsch et al.’s experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] because the linearized versions of these models lead to a serial, rather than a parallel, connection of a spring and a damper: Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] specifically showed (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]) that a serial connection of a spring-damper fails to reproduce the phase shift between force and length present in their experimental data.</p>
<p>Titin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>] has been more recently investigated to explain how lengthened muscle can develop active force when lengthened both within, and beyond, actin-myosin overlap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Titin is a gigantic multi-segmented protein that spans a half-sarcomere, attaching to the Z-line at one end and the middle of the thick filament at the other end [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. In skeletal muscle, the two sections nearest to the Z-line, the proximal immunoglobulin (IgP) segment and the PEVK segment — rich in the amino acids proline (P), glutamate (E), valine (V) and lysine (K) — are the most compliant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] since the distal immunoglobulin (IgD) segments bind strongly to the thick filament [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Titin has proven to be a complex filament, varying in composition and geometry between different muscle types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>], widely between species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], and can apply activation dependent forces to actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. It has proven challenging to determine which interactions dominate between the various segments of titin and the other filaments in a sarcomere. Experimental observations have reported titin-actin interactions at myosin-actin binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], between titin’s PEVK region and actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>], between titin’s N2A region and actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>], and between the PEVK-IgD regions of titin and myosin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. This large variety of experimental observations has led to a correspondingly large number of proposed hypotheses and models, most of which involve titin interacting with actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>], and more recently with myosin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>].</p>
<p>The addition of a titin element to a model will result in more accurate force production during large active length changes, but does not affect the stiffness and damping of muscle at modest sarcomere lengths because of titin’s relatively low stiffness. At sarcomere lengths of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> or less, the stiffness of the actin-myosin load path with a single attached crossbridge (0.22 <italic>−</italic> 1.15 pN<italic>/</italic>nm) equals or exceeds the stiffness of 6 passive titin filaments (0.0348 <italic>−</italic> 0.173 pN<italic>/</italic>nm), and our estimated stiffness of 6 active titin filaments (0.0696 <italic>−</italic> 0.346 pN<italic>/</italic>nm, see Appendix A for further details). When fully activated, the stiffness of the actin-myosin load path (4.05 <italic>−</italic> 18.4 pN<italic>/</italic>nm) far exceeds that of both the passive titin (0.0348 <italic>−</italic> 0.173 pN<italic>/</italic>nm), and our estimated active titin (0.0696 <italic>−</italic> 0.346 pN<italic>/</italic>nm) load paths. Since titin-focused models have not made any changes to the modeled myosin-actin interaction beyond a Hill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>] or Huxley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>] model, it is unlikely that these models would be able to replicate Kirsch et al.’s experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Although most motor control simulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>] make use of the canonical linearized muscle model, phenomenological muscle models have also been used and modified to include stiffness. Sartori et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>] modeled muscle stiffness by evaluating the partial derivative of the force developed by a Hill-type muscle model with respect to the contractile element (CE) length. Although this approach is mathematically correct, the resulting stiffness is heavily influenced by the shape of the force-length curve and can lead to inaccurate results: at the optimal CE length this approach would predict an active muscle stiffness of zero since the slope of the force-length curve is zero; on the descending limb this approach would predict a negative active muscle stiffness since the slope of the force-length curve is negative. In contrast, CE stiffness is large and positive near the optimal length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], and there is no evidence for negative stiffness on the descending limb of the force-length curve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Although the stiffness of the CE can be kept positive by shifting the passive force-length curve, which is at times used in finite-element-models of muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>], this introduces a new problem: the resulting passive CE stiffness cannot be lowered to match a more flexible muscle. In contrast, De Groote et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>] modeled short-range-stiffness using a stiff spring in parallel with the active force element of a Hill-type muscle model. While the approach of De Groote et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>] likely does improve the response of a Hill-type muscle model for small perturbations, there are several drawbacks: the short-range-stiffness of the muscle sharply goes to zero outside of the specified range whereas in reality the stiffness is only reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] (see <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>); the damping of the canonical Hill-model has been left unchanged and likely differs substantially from biological muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>].</p>
<p>In this work, we propose a model that can capture the force development of muscle to perturbations that vary in size and timescale, and yet is described using only a few states making it well suited for large-scale simulations. When active, the response of the model to perturbations within actin-myosin overlap is dominated by a viscoelastic crossbridge element that has different dynamics across time-scales: over brief time-scales the viscoelasticity of the lumped crossbridge dominates the response of the muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], while over longer time-scales the force-velocity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] and force-length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] properties of muscle dominate. To capture the active forces developed by muscle beyond actin-myosin overlap we added an active titin element which, similar to existing models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>], features an activation-dependent<sup>6</sup> interaction between titin and actin. To ensure that the various parts of the model are bounded by reality, we have estimated the physical properties of the viscoelastic crossbridge element as well as the active titin element using data from the literature.</p>
<p>While our main focus is to develop a more accurate muscle model, we would like the model to be well suited to simulating systems that contain tens to hundreds of muscles. Although Huxley models have been used to simulate whole-body movements such as jumping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>], the memory and processing requirements associated with simulating a single muscle with thousands of states is high. Instead of modeling the force development of individual crossbridges, we lump all of the crossbridges in a muscle together so that we have a small number of states to simulate per muscle.</p>
<p>To evaluate the proposed model, we compare simulations of experiments to original data. We examine the response of active muscle to small perturbations over a wide band-width by simulating the stochastic perturbation experiments of Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Herzog et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] active-lengthening experiments are used to evaluate the response of the model when it is actively lengthened within actin-myosin overlap. Next, we use Leonard et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] active lengthening experiments to see how the model compares to reality when it is actively lengthened beyond actin-myosin overlap. In addition, we examine how well the model can reproduce the force-velocity experiments of Hill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] and force-length experiments of Gordon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Since Hill-type models are so commonly used, we also replicate all of the simulated experiments using Millard et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>] Hill-type muscle model to make the differences between these two types of models clear.</p>

<p>We begin by treating whole muscle as a scaled half-sarcomere that is pennated at an angle <italic>α</italic> with respect to a tendon (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The assumption that mechanical properties scale with size is commonly used when modeling muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>] and makes it possible to model vastly different musculotendon units (MTUs) by simply changing the architectural and contraction properties: the maximum isometric force <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, the optimal CE length <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> (at which the CE develops <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>), the pennation angle <italic>α</italic><sub>o</sub> of the CE (at a length of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>) with respect to the tendon, the maximum shortening velocity <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline6.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> of the CE, and the slack length of the tendon <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. Many properties of sarcomeres scale with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline9.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> scales with physiological cross-sectional area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>], the force-length property scales with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline10.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>], the maximum normalized shortening velocity of different CE types scales with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline11.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> across animals great and small [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>], and titin’s passive-force-length properties scale from single molecules to myofibrils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]</p>

<caption><p>The name of the VEXAT model comes from the viscoelastic crossbridge and active titin elements (A.) in the model. Active tension generated by the lumped crossbridge flows through actin, myosin, and the adjacent sarcomeres to the attached tendon (B.). Titin is modeled as two springs of length <italic>𝓁</italic> <sup>1</sup> and <italic>𝓁</italic> <sup>2</sup> in series with the rigid segments L<sup>T12</sup> and L<sup>IgD</sup>. Viscous forces act between titin and actin in proportion to the activation of the muscle (C.), which reduces to negligible values in a purely passive muscle (D.). We modeled actin and myosin as rigid elements; the XE, titin, and the tendon as viscoelastic elements; and the ECM as an elastic element.</p></caption>

<p>The proposed model has several additional properties that we assume scale with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline12.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and inversely with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline13.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> the maximum active isometric stiffness <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline14.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and damping <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline15.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, the passive forces due to the extracellular matrix (ECM), and passive forces due to titin. As crossbridge stiffness is well studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>], we assume that muscle stiffness due to crossbridges scales such that
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="534347v6_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline16.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is the maximum normalized stiffness. This scaling is just what would be expected when many crossbridges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>] act in parallel across the cross-sectional area of the muscle, and act in series along the length of the muscle. Although the intrinsic damping properties of crossbridges are not well studied, we assume that the linear increase in damping with activation observed by Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] is due to the intrinsic damping properties of individual cross-bridges which will also scale linearly with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline17.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and inversely with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline18.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="534347v6_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline19.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is the maximum normalized damping. For the remainder of the paper, we refer to the proposed model as the VEXAT model due to the viscoelastic (VE) crossbridge (X) and active-titin (AT) elements of the model.</p>
<p>To reduce the number of states needed to simulate the VEXAT model, we lump all of the attached crossbridges into a single lumped crossbridge element (XE) that attaches at <italic>𝓁</italic> <sup>S</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) and has intrinsic stiffness and damping properties that vary with the activation and force-length properties of muscle. The active force developed by the XE at the attachment point to actin is transmitted to the main myosin filament, the M-line, and ultimately to the tendon (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). In addition, since the stiffness of actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>] and myosin filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>] greatly exceeds that of crossbridges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>], we treat actin and myosin filaments as rigid to reduce the number of states needed to simulate this model. Similarly, we have lumped the six titin filaments per half-sarcomere (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) together to further reduce the number of states needed to simulate this model.</p>
<p>The addition of a titin filament to the model introduces an additional active load-path (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>) and an additional passive load-path (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). As is typical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], we assume that the passive elasticity of these structures scale linearly with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline20.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and inversely with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline21.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. Since the VEXAT model has two passive load paths (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), we further assume that the proportion of the passive force due to the extra-cellular-matrix (ECM) and titin does not follow a scale dependent pattern, but varies from muscle-to-muscle as observed by Prado et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>].</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, there are several theories to explain how titin interacts with the other filaments in activated muscle. While there is evidence for titin-actin interaction near titin’s N2A region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>], there is also support for a titin-actin interaction occurring near titin’s PEVK region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>], and for a titin-myosin interaction near the PEVK-IgD region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. For the purposes of our model, we will assume a titin-actin interaction because current evidence weighs more heavily towards a titin-actin interaction than a titin-myosin interaction. Next, we assume that the titin-actin interaction takes place somewhere in the PEVK segment for two reasons: first, there is evidence for a titin-actin interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>] in the PEVK segment; and second, there is evidence supporting an interaction at the proximal end of the PEVK segment (N2A-actin interaction) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. We have left the point within the PEVK segment that attaches to actin as a free variable since there is some uncertainty about what part of the PEVK segment interacts with actin. The nature of the mechanical interaction between titin and the other filaments in an active sarcomere remains uncertain. Here we assume that this interaction is not a rigid attachment, but instead is an activation dependent damping to be consistent with the observations of Kellermayer and Granzier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>] and Dutta et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]: adding titin filaments and calcium slowed, but did not stop, the progression of actin filaments across a plate covered in active crossbridges (an in-vitro motility assay). When activated, we assume that the amount of damping between titin and actin scales linearly with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline22.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and inversely with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline23.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula></p>
<p>After lumping all of the crossbridges and titin filaments together we are left with a rigid-tendon MTUmodel that has two generalized positions
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="534347v6_eqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
and an elastic-tendon MTUmodel that has three generalized positions
<disp-formula id="eqn4">
<graphic xlink:href="534347v6_eqn4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Given these generalized positions, the path length <italic>𝓁</italic> <sup>P</sup>, and a pennation model, all other lengths in the model can be calculated. Here we use a constant thickness

<graphic xlink:href="534347v6_eqn7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
to evaluate the pennation angle of a CE with an elastic-tendon. We have added a small compressive element KE (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) to prevent the model from reaching the numerical singularity that exists as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline24.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> approaches <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline25.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, the length at which <italic>α →</italic> 90<sup><italic>°</italic></sup> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn6">Eqns. 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn7">7</xref>. The tendon length
<disp-formula id="eqn8">
<graphic xlink:href="534347v6_eqn8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
of an elastic-tendon model is the difference between the path length and the CE length along the tendon. The length of the XE
<disp-formula id="eqn9">
<graphic xlink:href="534347v6_eqn9.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
is the difference between the half-sarcomere length and the sum of the average point of attachment <italic>𝓁</italic> <sup>S</sup> and the length of the myosin filament L<sup>M</sup>. The length of <italic>𝓁</italic> <sup>2</sup>, the lumped PEVK-IgD segment, is
<disp-formula id="eqn10">
<graphic xlink:href="534347v6_eqn10.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
the difference between the half-sarcomere length and the sum of the length from the Z-line to the actin binding site on titin (<italic>𝓁</italic> <sup>1</sup>) and the length of the IgD segment that is bound to myosin (L<sup>IgD</sup>). Finally, the length of the extra-cellular-matrix <italic>𝓁</italic> <sup>ECM</sup> is simply
<disp-formula id="eqn11">
<graphic xlink:href="534347v6_eqn11.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
half the length of the CE since we are modeling a half-sarcomere.</p>
<p>We have some freedom to choose the state vector of the model and the differential equations that define how the muscle responds to length and activation changes. The experiments we hope to replicate depend on phenomena that take place at different time-scales: Kirsch et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] stochastic perturbations evolve over brief time-scales, while all of the other experiments take place at much longer time-scales. Here we mathematically decouple phenomena that affect brief and long time-scales by making a second-order model that has states of the average point of crossbridge attachment <italic>𝓁</italic> <sup>S</sup>, and velocity <italic>v</italic> <sup>S</sup>. When the activation <italic>a</italic> state and the titin-actin interaction model are included, the resulting rigid-tendon model that has a total of four states
<disp-formula id="eqn12">
<graphic xlink:href="534347v6_eqn12.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>

and the elastic-tendon model has
<disp-formula id="eqn13">
<graphic xlink:href="534347v6_eqn13.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
five states. For the purpose of comparison, a Hill-type muscle model with a rigid-tendon has a single state (<italic>a</italic>), while an elastic-tendon model has two states (<italic>a</italic> and <italic>𝓁</italic> <sup>M</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>].</p>
<p>Before proceeding, a small note on notation: throughout this work we will use an underbar to indicate a vector, bold font to indicate a curve, a tilde for a normalized quantity, and a capital letter to indicate a constant. Unless indicated otherwise, curves are constructed using <italic>C</italic><sup>2</sup> continuous<sup>7</sup> Bézier splines so that the model is compatible with gradient-based optimization. Normalized quantities within the CE follow a specific convention: lengths and velocities are normalized by the optimal CE length <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline26.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, forces by the maximum active isometric tension <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline27.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, stiffness and damping by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline28.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. Velocities used as input to the force-velocity relation <bold>f</bold> <sup>V</sup> are further normalized by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline29.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> annotated using a hat: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline30.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. Tendon lengths and velocities are normalized by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline31.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> tendon slack length, while forces are normalized by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline32.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>To evaluate the state derivative of the model, we require equations for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline33.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <italic>v</italic> <sup>1</sup>, and <italic>v</italic> <sup>M</sup> if the tendon is elastic.

We formulated the equation for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline35.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> with the intention of having the model behave like a spring-damper over small time-scales, but to converge to the tension developed by a Hill-type model

<caption><p>The passive force-length curve has been decomposed such that 56% of it comes from the ECM while 44% comes from titin to match the average of ECM-titin passive force distribution (which ranges from 43%-76%) reported by Prado et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>] (A.). The elasticity of the titin segment has been further decomposed into two serially connected sections: the proximal section consisting of the T12, proximal IgP segment and part of the PEVK segment, and the distal section consisting of the remaining PEVK section and the distal Ig segment (B.). The stiffness of the IgP and PEVK segments has been chosen so that the model can reproduce the movements of IgP/PEVK and PEVK/IgD boundaries that Trombitás et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] (C.) observed in their experiments. The curves that appear in subplots A. and B. come from scaling the two-segmented human soleus titin model to cat soleus muscle.

<p>The passive force developed by the CE in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn15">Eqn. 15</xref> is the sum of the elastic forces (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>) developed by the force-length curves of titin <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline57.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline58.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline59.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. We model titin’s elasticity as being due to two serially connected elastic segments: the first elastic segment <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline60.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is formed by lumping together the IgP segment and a fraction Q of the PEVK segment, while the second elastic segment <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline61.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is formed by lumping together the remaining (1 − Q) of the PEVK segment with the free IgD section. Our preliminary simulations of Herzog and Leonard’s active lengthening experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] indicate that a Q value of 0.5, positioning the PEVK-actin attachment point that is near the middle of the PEVK segment, allows the model to develop sufficient tension when actively lengthened. The large section of the IgD segment that is bound to myosin is treated as rigid.</p>
<p>The curves that form <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline62.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline63.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> have been carefully constructed to satisfy three experimental observations: that the total passive force-length curve of titin and the ECM match the observed passive force-length curve of the muscle (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]; that the proportion of the passive force developed by titin and the ECM is within experimental observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>] (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>); and that the Ig domains and PEVK residues show the same relative elongation as observed by Trombitás et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Even though Trombitás et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] measurements come from human soleus titin, we can construct the force-length curves of other titin isoforms if the number of proximal Ig domains, PEVK residues, and distal Ig domains are known (see Appendix B.3). Since the passive–force-length relation and the results of Trombitás et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] are at modest lengths, we consider two different extensions to the force-length relation to simulate extreme lengths: first, a simple linear extrapolation; second, we extend the force-length relation of each of titin’s segments to follow a worm-like-chain (WLC) model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>] (see Appendix B.3 for details on the WLC model). With titin’s passive force-length relations defined, we can next consider what happens to titin in active muscle.</p>
<p>When active muscle is lengthened, it produces an enhanced force that persists long after the lengthening has ceased called residual force enhancement (RFE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. For the purposes of the VEXAT model, we assume that RFE is produced by titin. Experiments have demonstrated RFE on both the ascending limb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>] and descending limb of the force-length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] relation. The amount of RFE depends both on the final length of the stretch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>] and the magnitude of the stretch: on the ascending limb the amount of RFE varies with the final length but not with stretch magnitude, while on the descending limb RFE varies with stretch magnitude. To develop RFE, we assume that some point of the PEVK segment bonds with actin through an activation-dependent damper. The VEXAT model’s distal segment of titin, <italic>𝓁</italic> <sup>2</sup>, can contribute to RFE when the titin-actin bond is formed and CE is lengthened beyond <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline64.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, the shortest CE length at which the PEVK-actin bond can form. In this work, we set <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline65.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> to be equal to the slack length of the CE’s force-length relation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline66.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> (see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1E</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">H</xref>). To incorporate the asymmetric length dependence of RFE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>], we introduce a smooth step-up function
<disp-formula id="eqn17">
<graphic xlink:href="534347v6_eqn17.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>

that transitions from zero to one as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline67.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> extends beyond <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline68.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, where the sharpness of the transition is controlled by R. Similar to Hisey et al.’s experimental work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>], active lengthening on the ascending limb will produce similar amounts of RFE since <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline69.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and the titin-actin bond is prevented from forming below <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline70.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. In contrast, the amount of RFE on the descending limb increases with increasing stretch magnitudes since the titin-actin bond is able to form across the entire descending limb.</p>

<caption><p>The VEXAT and Hill model’s elastic-tendon cat soleus MTU parameters. The VEXAT model uses all of the Hill model’s parameters which are highlighted in grey.

The letters ‘R’ or ‘H’ in front of a reference mean the data is from a rabbit or a human, otherwise the data is from cat soleus. The letters following a reference indicate how the data was used to create the parameter: ‘C’ calculated, ‘F’ fit, ‘E’ estimated, or ‘S’ scaled. Most of the VEXAT model’s XE and titin parameters can be used as rough parameter guesses for other muscles because we have expressed these parameters in a normalized space: the values will scale appropriately with changes to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline302.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline303.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. Titin’s force-length curves, however, should be updated if N <sup>IgP</sup>, N <sup>PEVK</sup>, or N <sup>IgD</sup> differ from the values shown below (see Appendix B.3 for details).

Finally, the parameters related to the compressive element (F.), the XE (G.), and titin (H. and I.) can be used as initial values when simulating the MTU’s other mammals.

<p>At very long CE lengths, the modeled titin-actin bond can literally slip off of the end of the actin filament (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) when the distance between the Z-line and the bond, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline71.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, exceeds the length of the actin filament, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline72.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. To break the titin-actin bond at long CE lengths we introduce a smooth step-down function
<disp-formula id="eqn18">
<graphic xlink:href="534347v6_eqn18.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
The step-down function <italic>u</italic><sup>L</sup> transitions from one to zero when the titin-actin bond <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline73.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> reaches <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline74.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, the end of the actin filament.</p>
<p>The strength of the titin-actin bond also appears to vary nonlinearly with activation. Fukutani and Herzog [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>] observed that the absolute RFE magnitude produced by actively lengthened fibers is similar between normal and reduced contractile force states. Since these experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>] were performed beyond the optimal CE length, titin could be contributing to the observed RFE as previously described. The consistent pattern of absolute RFE values observed by Fukutani and Herzog [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>] could be produced if the titin-actin bond saturated at its maximum strength even at a reduced contractile force state. To saturate the titin-actin bond, we use a final smooth step function
<disp-formula id="eqn19">
<graphic xlink:href="534347v6_eqn19.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where A<sub><italic>°</italic></sub> is the threshold activation level at which the bond saturates. While we model the strength of the titin-actin bond as being a function of activation, which is proportional Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>], this is a mathematical convenience. The work of Leonard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] makes it clear that both Ca<sup>2+</sup> and crossbridge cycling are needed to allow titin to develop enhanced forces during active lengthening: no enhanced forces are observed in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> when crossbridge cycling is chemically inhibited. Putting this all together, the active damping acting between the titin and actin filaments is given by the product of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline75.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline76.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is the maximum damping coefficient.</p>
<p>With a model of the titin-actin bond derived, we can focus on how the bond location moves in response to applied forces. Since we are ignoring the mass of the titin filament, the PEVK-attachment point is balanced by the forces applied to it and the viscous forces developed between titin and actin

The assumption of whether the tendon is rigid or elastic affects how the state derivative is evaluated and how expensive it is to compute. While all of the position dependent quantities can be evaluated using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn6">Eqns. 6</xref>-<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn11">11</xref> and the generalized positions, evaluating the generalized velocities of a rigid-tendon and elastic-tendon model differ substantially.</p>
<p>The CE velocity <italic>v</italic> <sup>M</sup> and pennation angular velocity <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline80.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> of a rigid-tendon model can be evaluated directly given the path length, velocity, and the time derivatives of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn6">Eqns. 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn8">8</xref>. After <italic>v</italic> <sup>1</sup> is evaluated using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn21">Eqn. 21</xref>, the velocities of the remaining segments can be evaluated using the time derivatives of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn9">Eqns. 9</xref>-<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn11">11</xref>.</p>
<p>Evaluating the CE rate of lengthening, <italic>v</italic> <sup>M</sup>, for an elastictendon muscle model is more involved. As is typical of lumped parameter muscle models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>], here we assume that difference in tension, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline81.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, between the CE and the tendon

is negligible<sup>10</sup>. During our preliminary simulations it became clear that treating the tendon as an idealized spring degraded the ability of the model to replicate the experiment of Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] particularly at high frequencies. Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] observed a linear increase in the gain and phase profile between the output force and the input perturbation applied to the muscle. This pattern in gain and phase shift can be accurately reproduced by a spring in parallel with a damper. Due to the way that impedance combines in series <sup>11</sup>, the models of both the CE and the tendon need to have parallel spring and damper elements so that the entire MTU, when linearized, appears to be a spring in parallel with a damping element. We model tendon force using a nonlinear spring and damper model

</disp-formula>
where the damping coefficient <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline82.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, is a linear scal, ing of the normalized tendon stiffness <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline83.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> by <italic>U</italic>, a constant scaling coefficient.

Now that all of the terms in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn22">Eqn. 22</xref> have been explicitly defined, we can use <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn22">Eqn. 22</xref> to solve for <italic>v</italic> <sup>M</sup>. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn22">Equation 22</xref> becomes linear in <italic>v</italic> <sup>M</sup> after substituting the force models described in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn23">Eqns. 23</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn15">15</xref>, and the kinematic model equations described in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn8">Eqns. 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn11">11</xref> (along with the time derivatives of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn8">Eqns. 8</xref>-<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn11">11</xref>).

allowing us to evaluate the final state derivative in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline84.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>.

In addition, the VEXAT’s <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline88.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> does not require iteration to numerically solve a root, giving it an advantage over a singularity-free formulation of the Hill model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>].

<title>Biological Benchmark Simulations</title>
<p>In order to evaluate the model, we have selected three experiments that capture the responses of active muscle to small, medium, and large length changes. The small <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline89.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> stochastic perturbation experiment of Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] demonstrates that the impedance of muscle is well described by a stiff spring in parallel with a damper, and that the spring-damper coefficients vary linearly with active force. The active impedance of muscle is such a fundamental part of motor learning that the amount of impedance, as indicated by co-contraction, is used to define how much learning has actually taken place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>]: co-contraction is high during initial learning, but decreases over time as a task becomes familiar. The active lengthening experiment of Herzog and Leonard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] shows that modestly stretched <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline90.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> biological muscle has positive stiffness even on the descending limb of the active force-length curve <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline91.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. In contrast, a conventional Hill model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>] can have negative stiffness on the descending limb of the active-force-length curve, a property that is both mechanically unstable and unrealistic. The final active lengthening experiment of Leonard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] unequivocally demonstrates that the CE continues to develop active forces during extreme lengthening <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline92.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> which exceeds actin-myosin overlap. Active force development beyond actin-myosin overlap is made possible by titin, and its activation dependent interaction with actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. The biological benchmark simulations conclude with a replication of the force-velocity experiments of Hill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] and the force-length experiments of Gordon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>].</p>
<p>The VEXAT model requires the architectural muscle parameters (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline93.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline94.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>) needed by a conventional Hill-type muscle model as well as additional parameters. The additional parameters are needed for these component models: the compressive element (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn15">Eqn. 15</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn24">24</xref>), the lumped viscoelastic XE (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eqn. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">2</xref>), XE-actin dynamics (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn16">Eqn. 16</xref>), the two-segment active titin model (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), titin-actin dynamics (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn21">Eqns. 21</xref>), and the tendon damping model (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn23">Eqn. 23</xref>). Fortunately, there is enough experimental data in the literature that values can be found, fitted, or estimated directly for our simulations of experiments on cat soleus (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), and rabbit psoas fibrils (see Appendix B for fitting details and Appendix H for rabbit psoas fibril model parameters). The parameter values we have established for the cat soleus (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> F.-I.) can serve as initial values when modeling other mammalian MTU’s because these parameters have been normalized (by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline95.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline96.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> where appropriate) and will scale appropriately given the architectural properties of a different MTU. By making use of these default values, the VEXAT model can be made to represent another MTU using exactly the same number of parameters as a Hill-type muscle model (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1A</xref>.-E.).</p>

<title>Stochastic Length Perturbation Experiments</title>
<p>In Kirsch et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] in-situ experiment, the force response of a cat’s soleus muscle under constant stimulation was measured as its length was changed by small amounts. Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] applied stochastic length perturbations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) to elicit force responses from the muscle (in this case a spring-damper <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>) across a broad range of frequencies (4-90 Hz) and across a range of small length perturbations <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline97.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. The resulting time-domain signals can be quite complicated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">B</xref>) but contain rich measurements of how muscle transforms changes in length into changes in force.</p>

<caption><p>Evaluating a system’s gain and phase response begins by applying a pseudo-random input signal to the system and measuring its output (A). Both the input and output signals (A) are transformed into the frequency domain by expressing these signals as an equivalent sum of scaled and shifted sinusoids (simple example shown in B and C). Each individual input sinusoid is compared with the output sinusoid of the same frequency to evaluate how the system scales and shifts the input to the output (D). This process is repeated across all sinusoid pairs to produce a function that describes how an input sinusoid is scaled (E) and shifted (F) to an output sinusoid using only the measured data (A).</p></caption>

<p>As long as muscle can be considered to be linear (a sinusoidal change in length produces a sinusoidal change in force), then system identification methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>] can be applied to extract a relationship between length <italic>x</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) and force <italic>y</italic>(<italic>t</italic>). We will give a brief overview of system identification methods here to make methods and results clearer. First, the time-domain signals (<italic>x</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) and <italic>y</italic>(<italic>t</italic>)) are transformed into an equivalent representation in the frequency-domain (<italic>X</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) and <italic>Y</italic> (<italic>s</italic>)) as a sum of scaled and shifted sine curves (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">C</xref>) using a Fourier transform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>].</p>
<p>In the frequency domain, we identify an LTI system of best fit <italic>H</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) that describes how muscle transforms changes in length into changes in force such that <italic>Y</italic> (<italic>s</italic>) = <italic>H</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) <italic>X</italic>(<italic>s</italic>). Next, we evaluate how <italic>H</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) scales the magnitude (gain) and shifts the timing (phase) of a sinusoid in <italic>X</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) into a sinusoid of the same frequency in <italic>Y</italic> (<italic>s</italic>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). This process is repeated across all frequency-matched pairs of input and output sinusoids to build a function of how muscle scales (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>) and shifts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>) input length sinusoids into output force sinusoids. The resulting transformation turns two complicated time-domain signals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) into a clear relationship in the frequency-domain that describes how muscle transforms length changes into force changes: a very slow (0Hz) length change will result in an output force that is scaled by 4.5 and is in phase (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">F</xref>), a 35 Hz sinusoidal length change will produce an output force that is scaled by 4.9 and leads the input signal by 24<sup><italic>°</italic></sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">F</xref>), and frequencies between 0 Hz and 35 Hz will be between these two signals in terms of scaling and phase. These patterns of gain and phase can be used to identify a network of spring-dampers that is equivalent to the underlying linear system (the system in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A, E</xref>, and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">F</xref> is a 4.46 N/mm spring in parallel with a 0.0089 Ns/mm damper). Since experimental measurements often contain noise and small nonlinearities, the mathematical procedure used to estimate <italic>H</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) and the corresponding gain and phase profiles is more elaborate than we have described (see Appendix D for details).</p>
<p>Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] used system identification methods to identify LTI mechanical systems that best describes how muscle transforms input length waveforms to output force waveforms. The resulting LTI system, however, is only accurate when the relationship between input and output is approximately linear. Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] used the coherence squared, (<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>xy</italic></sub>)<sup>2</sup>, between the input and output to evaluate the degree of linearity: <italic>Y</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) is a linear transformation of <italic>X</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) at frequencies in which (<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>xy</italic></sub>)<sup>2</sup> is near one, while <italic>Y</italic> (<italic>s</italic>) cannot be described as a linear function of <italic>X</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) at frequencies in which (<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>xy</italic></sub>)<sup>2</sup> approaches zero. By calculating (<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>xy</italic></sub>)<sup>2</sup> between the length perturbation and force waveforms, Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] identified the bandwidth in which the muscle’s response is approximately linear. Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] set the lower frequency of this band to 4 Hz, and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> of Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] suggests that this corresponds to (<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>xy</italic></sub>)<sup>2</sup> <italic>≥</italic> 0.67 though the threshold for (<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>xy</italic></sub>)<sup>2</sup> is not reported. The upper frequency of this band was set to the cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter applied to the input (15, 35, or 90 Hz). Within this bandwidth, Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] compared the response of the specimen to several candidate models and found that a parallel spring-damper fit the muscle’s frequency response best. Next, they evaluated the stiffness and damping coefficients that best fit the muscle’s frequency response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Finally, Kirsch et al. evaluated how much of the muscle’s time-domain response was captured by the spring-damper of best fit by evaluating the variance-accounted-for (VAF) between the two time-domain signals

Astonishingly, Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] found that a spring-damper of best fit has a VAF of between 78-99%<sup>12</sup> when compared to the experimentally measured forces <italic>f</italic> <sup><italic>EXP</italic></sup>. By repeating this experiment over a variety of stimulation levels (using both electrical stimulation and the crossed-extension reflex) Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] showed that these stiffness and damping coefficients vary linearly with the active force developed by the muscle. Further, Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] repeated the experiment using perturbations that had a variety of lengths (0.4 mm, 0.8mm, and 1.6mm) and bandwidths (15Hz, 35Hz, and 90Hz) and observed a peculiar quality of muscle: the damping coefficient of best fit increases as the bandwidth of the perturbation decreases (See <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref> of Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] for details). Here we simulate Kirsch et al.’s experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] to determine, first, the VAF of the VEXAT model and the Hill model in comparison to a spring-damper of best fit; second, to compare the gain and phase response of the models to biological muscle; and finally, to see if the spring-damper coefficients of best fit for both models increase with active force in a manner that is similar to the cat soleus that Kirsch et al. studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>].</p>
<p>To simulate the experiments of Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] we begin by creating the 9 stochastic perturbation waveforms used in the experiment that vary in perturbation amplitude (0.4mm, 0.8mm, and 1.6mm) and bandwidth (0-15 Hz, 0-35 Hz, and 0-90 Hz)<sup>13</sup>. The waveform is created using a vector that is composed of random numbers with a range of [<italic>−</italic>1, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>] that begins and ends with a series of zero-valued padding points.</p>
<p>Next, a forward pass of a 2<sup>nd</sup> order Butterworth filter is applied to the waveform and finally the signal is scaled to the appropriate amplitude (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). The muscle model is then activated until it develops a constant tension at a length of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline98.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. The musculotendon unit is then simulated as the length is varied using the previously constructed waveforms while activation is held constant. To see how impedance varies with active force, we repeated these simulations at ten evenly spaced tensions from 2.5N to 11.5N. Ninety simulations are required to evaluate the nine different perturbation waveforms at each of the ten tension levels. The time-domain length perturbations and force responses of the modeled muscles are used to evaluate the coherence squared of the signal, gain response, and phase responses of the models in the frequency-domain. Since the response of the models might be more nonlinear than biological muscle, we select a bandwidth that meets (<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>xy</italic></sub>)<sup>2</sup> <italic>&gt;</italic> 0.67 but otherwise follows the bandwidths analyzed by Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] (see Appendix D for details).</p>

<p>When coupled with an elastic-tendon, the 15 Hz perturbations show that neither model can match the VAF of Kirsch et al.’s analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] (compare <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref> to <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">G</xref>), while at 90Hz the VEXAT model reaches a VAF of 89% (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>) which is within the range of 78-99% reported by Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. In contrast, the Hill model’s VAF at 90 Hz remains low at 58% (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6J</xref>). While the VEXAT model has a gain profile in the frequency-domain that closer to Kirsch et al.’s data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] than the Hill model (compare <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref> to <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">H</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">E</xref> to K), both models have a greater phase shift than Kirsch et al.’s data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] at low frequencies (compare <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref> to I and F to L). The phase response of the VEXAT model to the 90 Hz perturbation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>) shows the consequences of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn16">Eqn. 16</xref>: at low frequencies the phase response of the VEXAT model is similar to that of the Hill model, while at higher frequencies the model’s response becomes similar to a spring-damper. This frequency dependent response is a consequence of the first term in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn16">Eqn. 16</xref>: the value of <italic>τ</italic> <sup>S</sup> causes the response of the model to be similar to a Hill model at lower frequencies and mimic a spring-damper at higher frequencies. Both models show the same perturbation-dependent phase-response, as the damping coefficient of best fit increases as the perturbation bandwidth decreases: compare the damping coefficient of best fit for the 15Hz and 90Hz profiles for the VEXAT model (listed on <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>. and D.) and the Hill model (listed on <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>. and J., respectively).</p>

<caption><p>The 15 Hz perturbations show that the VEXAT model’s performance is mixed: in the time-domain (A.) the VAF is lower than the 78-99% analyzed by Kirsch et al.

The response of the VEXAT model to the 90 Hz perturbations is much better: a VAF of 91% is reached in the time-domain (D.), the gain response follows the response of the cat soleus analyzed by Kirsch et al.

Although the Hill’s time-domain response to the 15 Hz signal has a higher VAF than the VEXAT model (G.), the RMSE of the Hill model’s gain response (H.) and phase response (I.) shows it to be more in error than the VEXAT model. While the VEXAT model’s response improved in response to the 90 Hz perturbation, the Hill model’s response does not: the VAF of the time-domain response remains low (J.), neither the gain (K.) nor phase responses (L.) follow the data of Kirsch et al.

<p>The closeness of each model’s response to the spring-damper of best fit changes when a rigid-tendon is used instead of an elastic-tendon. While the VEXAT model’s response to the 15 Hz and 90 Hz perturbations improves slightly (compare <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A-F</xref> to <xref rid="fig16" ref-type="fig">Fig. 16A-F</xref> in Appendix F), the response of the Hill model to the 15 Hz perturbation changes dramatically with the time-domain VAF rising from 55% to 85% (compare <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G-L</xref> to <xref rid="fig16" ref-type="fig">Fig. 16G-L</xref> in Appendix F). Although the Hill model’s VAF in response to the 15 Hz perturbation improved, the frequency response contains mixed results: the rigid-tendon Hill model’s gain response is better (<xref rid="fig16" ref-type="fig">Fig. 16H</xref> in Appendix F), while the phase response is worse in comparison to the elastic-tendon Hill model. While the rigid-tendon Hill model produces a better time-domain response to the 15 Hz perturbation than the elastic-tendon Hill model, this improvement has been made with a larger phase shift between force and length than biological muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>].</p>
<p>The gain and phase profiles of both models deviate from the spring-damper of best fit due to the presence of nonlinearities, even for small perturbations. Some of the VEXAT model’s nonlinearities in this experiment come from the tendon model (compare <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A-F</xref> to <xref rid="fig16" ref-type="fig">Fig. 16A-F</xref> in Appendix F), since the response of the VEXAT model with a rigid-tendon stays closer to the spring-damper of best fit. The Hill model’s nonlinearities originate from the underlying expressions for stiffness and damping of the Hill model, which are particularly nonlinear with a rigid-tendon model (<xref rid="fig16" ref-type="fig">Fig. 16G-L</xref> in Appendix F) The stiffness of a Hill model’s CE

also suffers from high degrees of nonlinearity for small perturbations about <italic>v</italic> <sup>M</sup> = 0 since the slope of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline103.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is positive and large when shortening, and positive and small when lengthening (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).

<p>By repeating the stochastic perturbation experiments across a range of isometric forces, Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] were able to show that the stiffness and damping of a muscle varies linearly with the active tension it develops (see <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12</xref> of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]). We have repeated our simulations of Kirsch et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] experiments at ten nominal forces (spaced evenly between 2.5N and 11.5 N) and compared how the VEXAT model and the Hill model’s stiffness and damping coefficients compare to <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12</xref> of Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). The stiffness and damping profile of the VEXAT model deviates a little from Kirsch et al.’s data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] because XE’s dynamics at 35 Hz are still influenced by the Hill model embedded in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn16">Eqn. 16</xref> (see Appendix B.4). Despite this, the VEXAT model develops similar stiffness and damping profile with either a viscoelastic-tendon (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A &amp; B</xref>) or a rigid-tendon (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C &amp; D</xref>). In contrast, when the Hill model is coupled with an elastic-tendon both its stiffness and damping are larger than Kirsch et al.’s data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] at the higher tensions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). This pattern changes when simulating a Hill model with a rigid-tendon: the model’s stiffness is slightly negative (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>), while the model’s final damping coefficient is nearly three times the value measured by Kirsch et al. (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). Though a negative stiffness may seem surprising, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn26">Eqn. 26</xref> shows a negative stiffness is possible at the nominal CE length of these simulations: just past <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline104.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> the slope of the active force-length curve is negative and the slope of the passive force-length curve is negligible. The tendon model also affects the VAF of the Hill model to a large degree: the elastic-tendon Hill model has a low VAF 30-51% (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A &amp; B</xref>) while the rigid-tendon Hill model has a much higher VAF of 86%. Although the VAF of the rigid-tendon Hill model is acceptable, these forces are being generated in a completely different manner than those obtained from biological muscle, as Kirsch et al.’s data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] indicate (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">D</xref>).</p>

<caption><p>When coupled with an elastic-tendon, the stiffness (A.) and damping (B.) coefficients of best fit of both the VEXAT model and a Hill model increase with the tension developed by the MTU.

In contrast, the stiffness and damping coefficients of the rigid-tendon Hill model differ dramatically from the elastic-tendon Hill model: while the elastic-tendon Hill model is too stiff and damped, the rigid-tendon Hill model is not stiff enough (compare A. to C.) and far too damped (compare B. to D.). Coupling the Hill model with a rigid-tendon increases the VAF from 30-51% to 86% but this improved accuracy is made using stiffness and damping that deviates from that of biological muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>].</p></caption>

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] while the Hill model’s 28-95% VAF differs (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>); and second, that there are systematic vari-ations in VAF, stiffness, and damping across the different perturbation magnitudes and frequencies (see <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Tables 5</xref> and <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">5</xref> in Appendix E).

This starting point was chosen specifically because the stiffness of a Hill model may actually change sign and become negative because of the influence of the active-force-length curve on <italic>k</italic> <sup>M</sup> as shown in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn26">Eqn. 26</xref> as <italic>ℓ</italic> <sup>M</sup> extends beyond <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline107.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. Herzog and Leonard’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] experiment is important for showing that biological muscle does not exhibit negative stiffness on the descending limb of the active-force-length curve. In addition, this experiment also highlights the slow recovery of the muscle’s force after stretching has ceased, and the phenomena of passive force enhancement after stimulation is removed. Here we will examine the 9 mm/s ramp experiment in detail because the simulations of the 3 mm/s and 27 mm/s ramp experiments produces similar stereotypical patterns (see Appendix G for details).</p>
<p>When Herzog and Leonard’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] active ramp-lengthening (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>) experiment is simulated, both models produce a force transient initially (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref>), but for different reasons. The VEXAT model’s transient is created when the lumped crossbridge spring (the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline108.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> term in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn15">Eqn. 15</xref>) is stretched. In contrast, the Hill model’s transient is produced, not by spring forces, but by damping produced by the force-velocity curve as shown in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn26">Eqn. 26</xref>.</p>
<p>After the initial force transient, the response of the two models diverges (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref>): the VEXAT model continues to develop increased tension as it is lengthened, while the Hill model’s tension drops before recovering. The VEXAT model’s continued increase in force is due to the titin model: when activated, a section of titin’s PEVK region remains approximately fixed to the actin element (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). As a result, the <italic>ℓ</italic> <sup>2</sup> element (composed of part of PEVK segment and the distal Ig segment) continues to stretch and generates higher forces than it would if the muscle were being passively stretched. While both the elastic and rigid-tendon versions of the VEXAT model produce the same stereotypical ramp-lengthening response (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref>), the rigid-tendon model develops slightly more tension because the strain of the MTU is solely borne by the CE.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Hill model develops less force during lengthening when it enters a small region of negative stiffness (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref> and <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">C</xref>) because the passive-force-length curve is too compliant to compensate for the negative slope of the active force-length curve. Similarly, the damping coefficient of the Hill model drops substantially during lengthening (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9D</xref>). <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn27">Equation 27</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> shows the reason that damping drops during lengthening: <italic>d</italic> <bold>f</bold> <sup>V</sup><italic>/dv</italic> <sup>M</sup>, the slope of the line in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, is quite large when the muscle is iso-metric and becomes quite small as the rate of lengthening increases.</p>
<p>After the ramp stretch is completed (at time 3.4 seconds in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref>), the tension developed by the cat soleus recovers slowly, following a profile that looks strikingly like a first-order decay. The large damping coefficient acting between the titin-actin bond slows the force recovery of the VEXAT model. We have tuned the value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline109.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline110.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> for the elastic-tendon model, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline111.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> for the rigid-tendon model, to match the rate of force decay of the cat soleus in Herzog and Leonard’s data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. The Hill model, in contrast, recovers to its isometric value quite rapidly. Since the Hill model’s force enhancement during lengthening is a function of the rate of lengthening, when the lengthening ceases, so too does the force enhancement.</p>
<p>Once activation is allowed to return to zero, Herzog and Leonard’s data shows that the cat soleus continues to develop a tension that is Δ<italic>f</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub> above passive levels (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref> for <italic>t &gt;</italic> 8.5<italic>s</italic>). The force Δ<italic>f</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub> is known as passive force enhancement, and is suspected to be caused by titin bind-ing to actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>]. Since we model titin-actin forces using an activation-dependent damper, when activation goes to zero our titin model becomes unbound from actin. As such, both our model and a Hill model remain Δ<italic>f</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub> below the experimental data of Herzog and Leonard (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref>) after lengthening and activation have ceased.</p>

<title>Active lengthening beyond actin-myosin overlap</title>
<p>One of the great challenges that remains is to decompose how much tension is developed by titin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>) separately from myosin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) in an active sarcomere. Leonard et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] active-lengthening experiment provides some insight into this force distribution problem because they recorded active forces both within and far beyond actin-myosin overlap. Leonard et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] data shows that active force continues to develop linearly during lengthening, beyond actin-myosin overlap, until mechanical failure. When activated and lengthened, the myofibrils failed at a length of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline112.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and force of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline113.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, on average. In contrast, dur-ing passive lengthening myofibrils failed at a much shorter length of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline114.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> with a dramatically lower tension of of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline115.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. To show that the extraordinary forces beyond actin-myosin overlap can be ascribed to titin, Leonard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] repeated the experiment but deleted titin using trypsin: the titin-deleted myofibrils failed at short lengths and insignificant stresses. Using the titin model of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn20">Eqn. 20</xref> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) as an interpretive lens, the huge forces developed during active lengthening would be created when titin is bound to actin leaving the distal segment of titin to take up all of the strain. Conversely, our titin model would produce lower forces during passive lengthening because the proximal Ig, PEVK, and distal Ig regions would all be lengthening together (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>).</p>
<p>Since Leonard et al.’s experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] was performed on skinned rabbit myofibrils and not on whole muscle, both the VEXAT and Hill models had to be adjusted prior to simulation (see Appendix H for parameter values). To simulate a rabbit myofibril we created a force-length curve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>] consistent with the filament lengths of rabbit skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>] (1.12<italic>µ</italic>m actin, 1.63<italic>µ</italic>m myosin, and 0.07<italic>µ</italic>m z-line width) and fit the force-length relations of the two titin segments to be consistent with the structure measured by Prado et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>] of rabbit psoas titin consisting of a 70%-30% mix of a 3300kD and a 3400kD titin isoform (see Appendix B.3 for fitting details and Appendix H for parameter values). Since this is a simulation of a fibril, we used a rigid-tendon of zero length (equivalent to ignoring the tendon), and set the pennation angle to zero.</p>
<p>As mentioned in Sec. 2, because this experiment includes extreme lengths, we consider two different force-length relations for each segment of titin (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10A</xref>): a linear extrapolation, and an extension that follows the WLC model. While both versions of the titin model are identical up to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline116.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, beyond <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline117.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> the WLC model continues to develop increasingly large forces until all of the Ig domains and PEVK residues have been unfolded and the segments of titin reach a physical singularity: at this point the Ig domains and PEVK residues cannot be elongated any further without breaking molecular bonds (see Appendix B.3 for details). Our preliminary simulations indicated that the linear titin model’s titin-actin bond was not strong enough to support large tensions, and so we increased the value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline118.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> from 71.9 to 975 (compare <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">6</xref> section H).</p>
<p>The Hill model was similarly modified, with the pennation angle set to zero and coupled with a rigid-tendon of zero length. Since the Hill model lacks an ECM element the passive-force-length curve was instead fitted to match the passive forces produced in Leonard et al.’s data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. No adjustments were made to the active elements of the Hill model.</p>
<p>When the slow active stretch (0.1<italic>µm</italic>/sarcomere/s) of Leonard et al.’s experiment is simulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] only the VEXAT model with the linear titin element can match the experimental data of Leonard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10B</xref>). The Hill model cannot produce active force for lengths greater than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline119.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> since the active force-length curve goes to zero (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) and the model lacks any element capable of producing force beyond this length. In contrast, the linear titin model continues to develop active force until a length of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline120.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is reached, at which point the titin-actin bond is pulled off the end of the actin filament and the active force is reduced to its passive value.</p>
<p>The WLC titin model is not able to reach the extreme lengths observed by Leonard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. The distal segment of the WLC titin model approaches its contour length early in the simulation and ensures that the the titin-actin bond is dragged off the end of the actin filament at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline121.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10B</xref>). After <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline121a.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10B</xref>), the tension of the WLC titin model drops to its passive value but continues to increase until the contour lengths of all of the segments of titin are reached at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline122.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. Comparing the response of the linear model to the WLC titin model two things are clear: the linear titin model more faithfully follows the data of Leonard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], but does so with titin segment lengths that exceed the maximum contour length expected for the isoform of titin in a rabbit myofibril.</p>
<p>This simulation has also uncovered a surprising fact: the myofibrils in Leonard et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] experiments do not fail at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline123.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, as would be expected by the WLC model of titin, but instead reach much greater lengths (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Physically, it may be possible for a rabbit myofibril to reach these lengths (without exceeding the contour lengths of the proximal Ig, PEVK, and distal Ig segments) if the bond between the distal segment of titin and myosin breaks down. This would allow the large Ig segment, that is normally bound to myosin, to uncoil and continue to develop the forces observed by Leonard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Unfortunately the mechanism which allowed the samples in Leonard et al.’s experiments to develop tension beyond titin’s contour length remains unknown.</p>

<title>Force-length and force-velocity</title>
<p>Although the active portion of the Hill model is embedded in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn16">Eqn. 16</xref>, it is not clear if the VEXAT model can still replicate Hill’s force-velocity experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] and Gordon et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] force-length experiments. Here we simulate both of these experiments using the cat soleus model that we have used for the simulations described in <xref rid="s3a" ref-type="sec">Sec. 3.1</xref> and compare the results to the force-length and force-velocity curves that are used in the Hill model and in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn16">Eqn. 16</xref> of the VEXAT model.</p>
<p>Hill’s force-velocity experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] is simulated by activating the model, and then by changing its length to follow a shortening ramp and a lengthening ramp. During short-ening experiments, the CE shortens from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline124.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline125.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> with the measurement of active muscle force is made at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline126.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> Lengthening experiments are similarly made by measuring muscle force mid-way through a ramp stretch that begins at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline127.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and ends at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline128.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. When an elastic-tendon model is used, we carefully evaluate initial and terminal path lengths to accommodate for the stretch of the tendon so that the CE still shortens from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline129.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline130.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and lengthens from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline131.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline132.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>The VEXAT model produces forces that differ slightly from the <bold>f</bold> <sup>V</sup> that is embedded in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn16">Eqn. 16</xref> while the Hill model reproduces the curve (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11</xref>). The maximum short-ening velocity of the VEXAT model is slightly weaker than the embedded curve due to the series viscoelasticity of the XE element. Although the model can be made to converge to the <bold>f</bold> <sup>V</sup> curve more rapidly by decreasing <italic>τ</italic> <sup>S</sup> this has the undesirable consequence of degrading the low-frequency response of the model during Kirsch et al.’s experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] (particularly <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>., and F.). These small differences can be effectively removed by scaling <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline133.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> by s<sup>V</sup> (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11A</xref> has s<sup>V</sup> = 0.95) to accommodate for the small decrease in force caused by the viscoelastic XE element.</p>

<p>Gordon et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] force-length experiments were simulated by first passively lengthening the CE, and next by measuring the active force developed by the CE at a series of fixed lengths. Prior to activation, the passive CE was simulated for a brief period of time in a passive state to reduce any history effects due to the active titin element. To be consistent with Gordon et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] experiment, we subtracted off the passive force from the active force before producing the active-force-length profile.</p>
<p>The simulation of Gordon et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] experiment shows that the VEXAT model (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12A</xref>, blue dots) produces a force-length profile that is shifted to the right of the Hill model (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12A</xref>, red line) due to the series elasticity in-troduced by the XE. We can solve for the size of this right-wards shift by noting that <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn16">Eqn. 16</xref> will drive the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline134.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> to a length such that the isometric force developed by the XE is equal to that of the embedded Hill model

the isometric strain of the XE.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A muscle model is defined by the experiments it can replicate and the mechanisms it embodies. We have developed the VEXAT muscle model to replicate the force response of muscle to a wide variety of perturbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] while also retaining the ability to reproduce Hill’s force-velocity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] experiment and Gordon et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] force-length experiments. The model we have developed uses two mechanisms to capture the force response of muscle over a large variety of time and length scales: first, a viscoelastic crossbridge element that over brief time-scales appears as a springdamper, and at longer time-scales mimics a Hill-model; second, a titin element that is capable of developing active force during large stretches.</p>
<p>The viscoelastic crossbridge and titin elements we have developed introduce a number of assumptions into the model. While there is evidence that the activationdependent stiffness of muscle originates primarily from the stiffness of the attached crossbridges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>], the origins of the activation-dependent damping observed by Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] have not yet been established. We assumed that, since the damping observed by Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] varies linearly with activation, the damping originates from the attached crossbridges. Whether this damping is intrinsic or is due to some other factor remains to be established. Next, we have also assumed that the force developed by the XE converges to a Hill model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>] given enough time (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn16">Eqn. 16</xref>). A recent experiment of Tomalka et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>] suggests the force developed by the XE might decrease during lengthening rather than increasing as is typical of a Hill model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. If Tomalka et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>] observations can be replicated, the VEXAT model will need to be adjusted so that the the XE element develops less force during active lengthening while the active-titin element develops more force. Finally, we have assumed that actin-myosin sliding acceleration (due to crossbridge cycling) occurs when there is a force imbalance between the external force applied to the XE and the internal force developed by the XE as shown in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn16">Eqn. 16</xref>. This assumption is a departure from previous models: Hill-type models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>] assume that the tension applied to the muscle instantaneously affects the actin-myosin sliding velocity; Huxley models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>] assume that the actin-myosin sliding velocity directly affects the rate of attachment and detachment of crossbridges.</p>
<p>The active titin model that we have developed makes assumptions similar to Rode et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>] and Schappacher-Tilp et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]: some parts of the PEVK segment bond to actin, and this bond cannot do any positive work on titin. The assumption that the bond between titin and actin cannot do positive work means that titin cannot be actively preloaded: it can only develop force when it is stretched. In contrast, two mechanisms have been proposed that make it possible for titin to be preloaded by crossbridge cycling: Nishikawa’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>] winding filament theory and DuVall et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>] titin entanglement hypothesis. If titin were significantly preloaded by crossbridge cycling, the titin load path would support higher forces and the myosin-actin load path would bear less force. Accordingly, the overall stiffness of the CE would be reduced, affecting our simulations of Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]: lower myosin-actin loads mean fewer attached crossbridges, since crossbridges are stiff in comparison to titin, the stiffness of the CE would decrease (see Appendix A). Hopefully experimental work will clarify if titin can be actively preloaded by crossbridges in the future.</p>
<p>Both the viscoelastic crossbridge and active titin elements include simple myosin-actin and titin-actin bond models that improve accuracy but have limitations. First, the viscoelastic crossbridge element has been made to represent a population of crossbridges in which the contribution of any single crossbridge is negligible. Though it may be possible for the XE model to accurately simulate a maximally activated single sarcomere (which has roughly 20 attached crossbridges per half sarcomere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>]) the accuracy of the model will degrade as the number of attached cross-bridges decreases. When only a single crossbridge remains, the XE model’s output will be inaccurate because it can only generate force continuously while a real crossbridge generates force discretely each time it attaches to, and detaches from, actin. Next, we have used two equations, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn16">Eqns. 16</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn21">21</xref>, that assume myosin-actin and titin-actin interactions are temperature-invariant and scale linearly with size (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline137.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline138.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>). In contrast, myosin-actin interactions and some titin-actin interactions are temperature-sensitive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>] and may not scale linearly with size. In Sec. 3.3 we had to adjust the active titin damping parameter, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline139.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> to simulate myofibril experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], perhaps because the assumptions of temperature-invariance and size-linearity were not met: the initial value for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline140.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> came from fitting to in-situ experimental data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] from whole muscle that was warmer (35 − 36.5° C vs 20 − 21° C) and larger (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline141.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> of 42.9 mm vs. 10 − 15 µm) than the myofibrils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>].</p>
<p>While the cat soleus XE and titin model parameters (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1 G, H</xref>, and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">I</xref>) can be used as rough default values, these parameters should be refit to accurately simulate muscle that differs in scale or temperature from cat soleus. Finally, the VEXAT model in its current form ignores phenomena related to submaximal contractions: the shift in the peak of the force-length relation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>], and the scaling of the maximum shortening velocity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>]. We hope to include these phenomena in a later version of the VEXAT model to more accurately simulate submaximal contractions.</p>
<p>The model we have proposed can replicate phenomena that occur at a wide variety of time and length scales: Kirsch et al.’s experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] which occur over small time and length scales; and the active lengthening experiments of Herzog and Leonard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] and Leonard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] which occur over physiological and supra-physiological length scales. In contrast, we have shown in <xref rid="s3a" ref-type="sec">Sec. 3.1</xref> to 3.3 that a Hill-type model compares poorly to biological muscle when the same set of experiments are simulated. We expect that a Huxley model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>] is also likely to have difficulty reproducing Kirsch et al.’s experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] because the model lacks an active damping element. Since titin was discovered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>] long after Huxley’s model was proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], a Huxley model will be unable to replicate any experiment that is strongly influenced by titin such as Leonard et al.’s experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Although there have been several more recent muscle model formulations proposed, none have the properties to simultaneously reproduce the experiments of Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], Herzog and Leonard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], Leonard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], Hill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], and Gordon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Linearized impedance models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] can reproduce Kirsch et al.’s experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], but these models lack the nonlinear components needed to reproduce Gordon et al.’s force-length curve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] and Hill’s forcevelocity curve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. The models of Forcinito et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], and Tahir et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>] have a structure that places a contractile element in series with an elastic-tendon. While this is a commonly used structure, at high frequencies the lack of damping in the tendon will drive the phase shift between length and force to approach zero. The measurements and model of Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], in contrast, indicate that the phase shift between length and force approaches ninety degrees with increasing frequencies. Though the Hill-type models of Haeufle et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>] and Günther et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>] have viscoelastic tendons, these models have no representation, of the viscoelasticity of the CE’s attached crossbridges. Similar to the Hill-type muscle model evaluated in this work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], it is likely that models of Haeufle et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>] and Günther et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>] will not be able to match the frequency response of biological muscle. De Groote et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>] introduced a short-range-stiffness element in parallel to a Hill model to capture the stiffness of biological muscle. While De Groote et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>] formulation improves upon a Hill model it is unlikely to reproduce Kirsch et al.’s experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] because we have shown in <xref rid="s3a" ref-type="sec">Sec. 3.1</xref> that a Hill model has a frequency response that differs from biological muscle. Rode et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>] muscle model also uses a Hill model for the CE and so we expect that this model will have the same difficulties reproducing Kirsch et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] experiment. Schappacher-Tilp et al.’s model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>] extends a Huxley model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>] by adding a detailed titin element. Similar to a Huxley model, Schappacher-Tilp et al.’s model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>] will likely have difficulty reproducing Kirsch et al.’s experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] because it is missing an active damping element.</p>
<p>While developing this model, we have come across open questions that we hope can be addressed in the future. How do muscle stiffness and damping change across the forcelength curve? Does stiffness and damping change with velocity? What are the physical origins of the active damping observed by Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]? What are the conditions that affect passive-force enhancement, and its release? In addition to pursuing these questions, we hope that other researchers continue to contribute experiments that are amenable to simulation, and to develop musculotendon models that overcome the limitations of our model. To help others build upon our work, we have made the source code of the model and all simulations presented in this paper available online<sup>14</sup>.</p>

<title>The stiffness of the actin-myosin and titin load paths</title>
<p>A single half-myosin can connect to the surrounding six actin filaments through 97.9 crossbridges. A 0.800 <italic>µ</italic>m half-myosin has a pair crossbridges over 0.700 <italic>µ</italic>m of its length every 14.3nm which amounts to 97.9 per halfmyosin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Although 97.9 crossbridges does not make physical sense, here we will evaluate the stiffness of the CE assuming that fractional crossbridges exist and that attached crossbridges can be perfectly distributed among the 6 available actin filaments: the alternative calculation is more complicated and produces stiffness values that differ only in the 3<sup><italic>rd</italic></sup> significant digit. Assuming a duty cycle of 20% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>] (values between 5-90% have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>]), at full actin-myosin overlap there will be 19.6 crossbridges attached to the 6 surrounding actin filaments. Assuming that these 19.6 crossbridges are evenly distributed between the 6 actin filaments, each single actin will be attached to 3.26 attached crossbridges.</p>
<p>At full overlap, the Z-line is 1 actin filament length L<sup>A</sup> (1.12 <italic>µ</italic>m in rabbits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]) from the M-line. The average point of crossbridge attachment is in the middle of the halfmyosin at a distance of 0.45 <italic>µ</italic>m from the M-line (0.1 <italic>µ</italic>m is bare and 0.35 <italic>µ</italic>m is half of the remaining length), which is L<sup>A</sup>−0.45 µm from the Z-line. A single actin filament has a stiffness of 46 − 68 pN/nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>] while a single crossbridge has a stiffness of 0.69 <italic>±</italic> 0.47 pN<italic>/</italic>nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>]. Since stiffness scales inversely with length, actin’s stiffness between the Zline and the average attachment point is 81.8−121 pN/nm. Finally, the stiffness of each actin filament and its 3.26 attached crossbridges is 0.712 − 3.67 pN<italic>/</italic>nm and all 6 together have a stiffness of 4.27 − 22.0 pN<italic>/</italic>nm.</p>
<p>Myosin has a similar stiffness as a single actin filament [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>], with the section between the average attach-ment point and the M-line having a stiffness of 76.9 − 113 pN/nm. The final active stiffness of half-sarcomere is 4.05 − 18.4 pN<italic>/</italic>nm which comes from comes from the se-ries connection of the group of 6 actin filaments, with 19.6 crossbridges, and finally the single myosin filament. When this procedure is repeated assuming that only a single crossbridge is attached the stiffness drops to 0.22−1.15 pN/nm, which is slightly less than the stiffness of a single crossbridge <sup>15</sup>.</p>
<p>The force-length profile of a single rabbit titin has been measured by Kellermayer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>] using laser tweezers to apply cyclical stretches. By digitizing <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref> (blue line) of Kellermayer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>] we arrive at a stiffness for titin of 0.0058 − 0.0288 pN<italic>/</italic>nm at 2 <italic>µ</italic>m (for a total sarcomere length of 4 <italic>µ</italic>m or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline142.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>), and 0.0505 − 0.0928 pN<italic>/</italic>nm at 4 <italic>µ</italic>m (8 <italic>µ</italic>m or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline143.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>). Since there are 6 titin filaments acting in parallel for each half-sarcomere, we end up with the total stiffness for titin ranging between 0.0348 − 0.173 pN<italic>/</italic>nm at 2 <italic>µ</italic>m and 0.303 − 0.557 pN<italic>/</italic>nm at 4 <italic>µ</italic>m.</p>
<p>When activated, the stiffness of our rabbit psoas linear-titin model (described in Sec. 3.3, fitted in Appendix B.3, and with the parameters shown in Appendix H) doubles, which would increase titin’s stiffness to 0.0696 − 0.346 pN<italic>/</italic>nm at 2 <italic>µ</italic>m and 0.606 − 1.11 pN<italic>/</italic>nm at 4 <italic>µ</italic>m.</p>
<p>Comparing the actin-myosin and titin stiffness ranges (<xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 14</xref>) makes it clear that the stiffness of actin-myosin with 1 attached crossbridge (AM:Low in <xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 14</xref>) is comparable to the highest stiffness values we have estimated for titin (TA:High in <xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 14</xref>). When all 20% of the available crossbridges are attached (AM:High in <xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 14</xref>), the average stiffness of the actin-myosin load path is roughly one order of magnitude stiffer than the highest stiffness values of titin (TA:High in <xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 14</xref>), and two to three orders of magnitude higher than the lowest stiffness titin load path (TP:Low in <xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 14</xref>). Similarly, the maximum XE stiffness and titin stiffness in this work are separated by roughly an order of magnitude: the cat soleus model has a XE stiff-ness of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline144.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and maximum active titin stiffness of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline145.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>); while the rabbit psoas fibril model has a XE stiffness of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline146.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and maximum active titin stiffness of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline147.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> (Appendix H).</p>

<caption><p>To evaluate the stiffness of the actin-myosin load path, we first determine the average point of attachment. Since the actin filament length varies across species we label it L<sup>A</sup>. Across rabbits, cats and human skeletal muscle myosin geometry is consistent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>]: a half-myosin is 0.8<italic>µm</italic> in length with a 0.1<italic>µm</italic> bare patch in the middle. Thus at full overlap the average point of attachment is 0.45<italic>µm</italic> from the M-line, or L<sup>A</sup>−0.45µm from the Z-line at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline299.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. The lumped stiffness of the actin-myosin load path of a half-sarcomere is the stiffness of three springs in series: a spring representing a L<sup>A</sup> − 0.45µm length of actin, a spring representing the all attached crossbridges, and a spring representing a 0.45<italic>µm</italic> section of myosin.</p></caption>

Parts of the Hill model’s response to the 15 Hz perturbation are better with a rigid-tendon, with a higher VAF (G.), a lower RMSE gain-response (H.). but have a poor phase-response (I.).

<title>Model Fitting</title>
<p>Many of the experiments simulated in this work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] have been performed using cat soleus muscle. While we have been able to extract some architectural parameters directly from the experiments we simulate (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline148.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline149.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]), we have had to rely on the literature mentioned in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for the remaining parameters. The remaining properties of the model can be solved by first building a viscoelastic damping model of the tendon; next, by solving for the intrinsic stiffness and damping properties of the CE; and finally, by fitting the passive curves <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline150.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline151.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> to simultaneously fit the passive force-length curve recorded by Herzog and Leonard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], using a mixture of tension from titin and the ECM that is consistent with Prado et al.’s data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>], all while maintaining the geometric relationship between <bold>f</bold> <sup>IgP</sup> and <bold>f</bold> <sup>PEVK</sup> as measured by Trombitás et al.

<title>Fitting the tendon’s stiffness and damping</title>
<p>Similar to previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], we model the force-length relation of the tendon using a quintic Bézier spline (<xref rid="fig15" ref-type="fig">Fig. 15A</xref>) that begins at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline152.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> (where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline153.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is tendon length normalized by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline154.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline155.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is tension normalized by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline156.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>), ends at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline157.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> with a nor-malized stiffness of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline158.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, and uses the constants <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline159.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline160.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> (given 30 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline161.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> from Scott and Loeb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>], <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline162.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is thus 4.58%). Using the experimental data of Netti et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>] we have also constructed a curve to evaluate the damping coefficient of the tendon. The normalized tendon stiffness (termed storage modulus by Netti et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>]) and normalized tendon damping (termed loss modulus by Netti et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>]) both have a similar shape as the tendon is stretched from slack to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline163.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> (<xref rid="fig15" ref-type="fig">Fig. 15B</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">C</xref>).</p>
<p>The similarity in shape is likely not a coincidence.</p>
<p>The nonlinear characteristics (<xref rid="fig15" ref-type="fig">Fig. 15</xref>) tendon originates from its microscopic structure. Tendon is composed of many fiber bundles with differing resting lengths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>]. Initially the tendon’s fiber bundles begin crimped, but gradually stretch as the tendon lengthens, until finally all fiber bundles are stretched and the tendon achieves its maximum stiffness (<xref rid="fig15" ref-type="fig">Fig. 15B</xref>) and damping (<xref rid="fig15" ref-type="fig">Fig. 15C</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>]. Accordingly, in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn23">Eqn. 23</xref> we have described the normalized damping of the tendon as being equal to the normalized stiffness of the tendon scaled by a constant <italic>U</italic>. To estimate <italic>U</italic> we have used the measurements of Netti et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>] (<xref rid="fig15" ref-type="fig">Fig. 15 B</xref> and <xref rid="fig15" ref-type="fig">C</xref>) and solved a least-squares problem
<disp-formula id="eqn32">
<graphic xlink:href="534347v6_eqn32.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
to arrive at a value of <italic>U</italic> = 0.057. The resulting damping model (<xref rid="fig15" ref-type="fig">Fig. 15C</xref>) fits the measurements of Netti et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>] closely.</p>

<title>Fitting the CE’s Impedance</title>
<p>We can now calculate the normalized impedance of the XE using the viscoelastic-tendon model we have constructed and Kirsch et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] measurements of the impedance of the entire MTU. Since an MTU is structured with a CE in series with a tendon, the compliance of the MTU is given by

where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline164.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is the stiffness of the CE in the direction of the tendon. We can calculate <italic>k</italic> <sup>M</sup> directly by fitting a line to the stiffness vs tension plot that appears in <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12</xref> of Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] (0.8mm, 0-35 Hz perturbation) and resulting in <italic>k</italic> <sup>M</sup> =2.47 N/mm at a nominal force of 5N. Here we use a nominal tension of 5N so that we can later compare our model to the 5N frequency response reported in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> of Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Since Kirsch et al.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>].</p>
<p>First, we fit the passive force-length curve to the data of Herzog and Leonard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] to serve as a reference. The curve <bold>f</bold> <sup>PE</sup> begins at the normalized length and force coordinates of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline178.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> with a slope of 0, ends at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline179.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> with a slope of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline180.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, and is linearly extrapolated outside of this region.

While <bold>f</bold> <sup>PE</sup> is not used directly in the model, it serves as a useful reference for constructing the ECM and titin force-length curves.

where P is a constant. In this work, we set P to 56% which is the average ECM contribution that Prado et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>] measured across 5 different rabbit skeletal muscles<sup>16</sup>. The remaining fraction, 1 − P, of the force-length curve comes from titin.</p>
<p>In mammalian skeletal muscle, titin has three elastic segments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>] connected in series: the proximal Ig segment, the PEVK segment, and the distal Ig segment that is between the PEVK region and the myosin filament (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Trombitás et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] labelled the PEVK region of titin with antibodies allowing them to measure the distance between the Z-line and the proximal Ig/PEVK boundary (<sup>Z</sup><italic>ℓ</italic> <sup>IgP<italic>/</italic>PEVK</sup>), and the distance between the Z-line and the PEVK/distal Ig boundary (<sup>Z</sup><italic>ℓ</italic> <sup>PEVK<italic>/</italic>IgD</sup>), while the passive sarcomere was stretched from 2.35 − 4.46µm. By fitting functions to Trombitás et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] data we can predict the length of any of titin’s segments under the following assumptions: the T12 segment is rigid (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), the distal Ig segment that overlaps with myosin is rigid (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), and that during passive stretching the tension throughout the titin filament is uniform. Since the sarcomeres in Trombitás et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] experiments were passively stretched it is reasonable to assume that tension throughout the free part of the titin filament is uniform because the bond between titin and actin depends on calcium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>] and crossbridge attachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>].</p>
<p>We begin by digitizing the data of <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> of Trombitás et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] and using the least-squares method to fit lines to <sup>Z</sup><italic>ℓ</italic> <sup>IgP<italic>/</italic>PEVK</sup> and <sup>Z</sup><italic>ℓ</italic> <sup>PEVK<italic>/</italic>IgD</sup> (where the superscripts mean <sup>from</sup><italic>ℓ</italic><sup>to</sup> and so <sup>Z</sup><italic>ℓ</italic> <sup>IgP<italic>/</italic>PEVK</sup> is the distance from the Z-line to the border of the IgP/PEVK segments). From these lines of best fit we can evaluate the normalized length of the proximal Ig segment
<disp-formula id="eqn50">

as a function of sarcomere length. Next, we extract the coefficients for linear functions that evaluate the lengths of

These coefficients have been extracted from data of <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> of Trombitás et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] using a least-squares fit. Since <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> of Trombitás et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] plots the change in segment length of a single titin filament against the change in length of the entire sarcomere, the resulting slopes are in length normalized units. The slopes sum to 0.5, by construction, to reflect the fact that these three segments of titin stretch at half the rate of the entire sarcomere (assuming symmetry). The cat soleus titin segment coefficients have been formed using a simple scaling of the human soleus titin segment coefficients, and so, are similar. Rabbit psoas titin geometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>] differs dramatically from human soleus titin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] and produce a correspondingly large difference in the coefficients that describe the length of the segments of rabbit psoas titin.</p></caption>

</table-wrap>
<p>These functions can be scaled to fit a titin filament of a differing geometry. Many of the experiments simulated in this work used cat soleus. Although the lengths of titin filament segments in cat soleus have not been measured, we assume that it is a scaled version of a human soleus titin filament (68 proximal Ig domains, 2174 PEVK residues, and 22 distal Ig domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]) since both muscles contain predominately slow-twitch fibers: slow twitch fibers tend to express longer, more compliant titin filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]. Since the optimal sarcomere length in cat skeletal muscle is shorter than in human skeletal muscle (2.43 <italic>µ</italic>m vs. 2.73 <italic>µ</italic>m, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>]) the coefficients for <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn53">Eqns. 53</xref>-<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn55">55</xref> differ slightly (see the feline soleus column in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In addition, by assuming that the titin filament of cat skeletal muscle is a scaled version of the titin filament found in human skeletal muscle, we have implicitly assumed that the cat’s skeletal muscle titin filament has 60.5 proximal Ig domains, 1934.7 PEVK residues, and 19.6 distal Ig domains. Although a fraction of a domain does not make physical sense, we have not rounded to the nearest domain and residue to preserve the sarcomere length-based scaling.</p>
<p>In contrast, the rabbit psoas fibril used in the simulation of Leonard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] has a known titin geometry (50 proximal Ig domains, 800 PEVK residues, and 22 distal Ig domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]) which differs substantially from the isoform of titin expressed in the human soleus. To create the rabbit psoas titin length functions <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline184.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline185.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> we begin by scaling the human soleus PEVK length function <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline186.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> by the relative proportion of PEVK residues of 800<italic>/</italic>2174. The length of the two Ig segments
<disp-formula id="eqn56">
<graphic xlink:href="534347v6_eqn56.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
is what remains from the half-sarcomere once the rigid lengths of titin (0.100 <italic>µ</italic>m for L<sup>T12</sup> and 0.8150 <italic>µ</italic>m for L<sup>IgD</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]) and the PEVK segment length have been subtracted away. The function that describes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline187.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline188.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> can then be formed by scaling <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline189.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> by the proportion of Ig domains in each segment

</disp-formula>
which produce the coefficients that appear in the rabbit psoas column in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. While we have applied this approach to extend Trombitás et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] results to a rabbit psoas, in principle this approach can be applied to any isoform of titin provided that its geometry is known, and the Ig domains and PEVK residues in the target titin behave similarly to those in human soleus titin.</p>
<p>The only detail that remains is to establish the shape of the IgP, PEVK, and IgD force-length curves. Studies of individual titin filaments, and of its segments, make it clear that titin is mechanically complex. For example, the tandem Ig segments (the IgD and IgP segments) are composed of many folded domains (titin from human soleus has two Ig segments that together have nearly 100 domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]). Each domain appears to be a simple nonlinear spring until it unfolds and elongates by nearly 25 nm in the process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>]. Unfolding events appear to happen individually during lengthening experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>], with each unfolding event occurring at a slightly greater tension than the last, giving an Ig segment a force-length curve that is saw-toothed. Although detailed models of titin exist that can simulate the folding and unfolding of individual Ig domains, this level of detail comes at a cost of a state for each Ig domain which can add up to nearly a hundred extra states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>] in total.</p>
<p>Active and passive lengthening experiments at the sarcomere-level hide the complexity that is apparent when studying individual titin filaments. The experiments of Leonard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] show that the sarcomeres in a filament (from rabbit psoas) mechanically fail when stretched passively to an average length of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline190.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, but can reach <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline191.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> when actively lengthened. Leonard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] showed that titin was the filament bearing these large forces since the sarcomeres were incapable of developing active or passive tension when the experiment was repeated after the titin filaments were chemically cut. It is worth noting that the forces measured by Leonard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] contain none of the complex saw-tooth pattern indicative of unfolding events even though 72 of these events would occur as each proximal and distal Ig domain fully unfolded and reached its maximal length<sup>17</sup>. Although we cannot be sure how many unfolding events occurred during Leonard et al.’s experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], due to sarcomere non-homogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>], it is likely that many Ig unfolding events occurred since the average sarcomere length at failure <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline192.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> was longer than the maximum length of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline193.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> that would be predicted from the geometry of rabbit psoas titin<sup>18</sup>.</p>
<p>Since we are interested in a computationally efficient model that is accurate at the whole muscle level, we model titin as a multi-segmented nonlinear spring but omit the states needed to simulate the folding and unfolding of Ig domains. Simulations of active lengthening using our titin model will exhibit the enhanced force development that appears in experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], but will lack the nonlinear saw-tooth force-length profile that is measured when individual titin filaments are lengthened [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>]. To have the broadest possible application, we will fit titin’s force-length curves to provide reasonable results for both moderate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] and large active stretches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Depending on the application, it may be more appropriate to use a stiffer force-length curve for the Ig segment if normalized sarcomere lengths stays within <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline194.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and no unfolding events occur as was done by Trombitás et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>].</p>
<p>To ensure that the serially connected force-length curves of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline195.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline196.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> closely reproduce <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline197.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, we are going to use affine transformations of <bold>f</bold> <sup>PE</sup> to describe <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline198.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline199.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>.

at a CE length of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline212.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline213.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> curve is formed by shifting and scaling the (1−P)<bold>f</bold> <sup>PE</sup> curve so that it develops a normalized tension of (1 − P) and a stiffness of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline214.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> a length of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline215.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. Similarly, the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline216.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> curve is made by shifting and scaling the (1 − P)<bold>f</bold> <sup>PE</sup> curve to develop a normalized tension of (1 − P) and a stiffness of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline217.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> at a length of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline218.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>By construction, the spring network formed by the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline219.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline220.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> curves follows the fitted <bold>f</bold> <sup>PE</sup> curve (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>) such that the ECM curve makes up 56% of the contribution. When the CE is active and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline221.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is effectively fixed in place, the distal segment of titin contributes higher forces since <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline222.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> undergoes higher strains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Finally, when the experiment of Trombitás et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] are simulated the movements of the IgP/PEVK and PEVK/IgD boundaries in the titin model closely follow the data (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>The process we have used to fit the ECM and titin’s segments makes use of data within modest normalized CE lengths (2.35-4.46<italic>µ</italic>m, or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline223.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]). Scenarios in which the CE reaches extremely long lengths, such as during injury or during Leonard et al.’s experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], require fitting titin’s force-length curve beyond the typical ranges observed in-vivo. The WLC model has been used successfully to model the force-length relation of individual titin segments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>] at extreme lengths. In this work, we consider two different extensions to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline224.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline225.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> : a linear extrapolation, and the WLC model. Since the fitted <bold>f</bold> <sup>PE</sup> curve is linearly extrapolated, so too are the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline226.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline227.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> curves by default. Applying the WLC to our titin curves requires a bit more effort.</p>
<p>We have modified the WLC to include a slack length <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline228.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> (the superscript W means WLC) so that the WLC model can made to be continuous with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline229.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline230.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. The normalized force developed by our WLC model is given by
<disp-formula id="eqn71">
<graphic xlink:href="534347v6_eqn71.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where B is a scaling factor and the normalized segment length <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline231.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is defined as
<disp-formula id="eqn72">
<graphic xlink:href="534347v6_eqn72.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline232.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is the slack length, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline233.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is the contour length of the segment. To extend the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline234.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> curve to follow the WLC model, we first note the normalized contour length of the <italic>ℓ</italic> <sup>1</sup> segment
<disp-formula id="eqn73">
<graphic xlink:href="534347v6_eqn73.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
by counting the number of proximal Ig domains (N <sup>IgP</sup>), at the number of PEVK residues (QN <sup>PEVK</sup>) associated with <italic>ℓ</italic> <sup>1</sup> and by scaling each by the maximum contour length of each Ig domain (25nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>]), and each PEVK residue (between 0.32 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>] and 0.38 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>] see pg. 254). This contour length defines the maximum length of the segment, when all of the Ig domains and PEVK residues have been unfolded. Similarly, the contour length of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline235.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is given by
<disp-formula id="eqn74">
<graphic xlink:href="534347v6_eqn74.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Next, we define the slack length by linearly extrapolating backwards from the final fitted force (1 − P)
<disp-formula id="eqn75">
<graphic xlink:href="534347v6_eqn75.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
and similarly
<disp-formula id="eqn76">
<graphic xlink:href="534347v6_eqn76.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
We can now solve for B in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn71">Eqn. 71</xref> so that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline236.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline237.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> are continuous with each respective WLC extrapolation. However, we do not use the WLC model directly because it contains a numerical singularity which is problematic during numerical simulation. Instead, we add an additional Bézier segment to fit the WLC extension that spans between forces of (1 − P) and twice the normalized failure force <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline238.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> noted by Leonard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. To fit the shape of the final Bézier segment, we adjust the locations of the internal control points to minimize the <sub>W</sub> squared differences between the modified WLC model and <sup>S</sup> the final Bézier curve (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10A</xref>). The final result is a set of curves <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline239.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline240.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> which, between forces 0 and (1 − P), will reproduce <bold>f</bold> <sup>PE</sup>, Trombitás et al.’s measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], and do so with a reasonable titin-ECM balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]. For forces beyond (1 − P), the curve will follow the segment-specific WLC model up to twice the expected failure tension noted by Leonard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>].</p>

Just prior to discussing titin, we had evaluated the impedance of the cat soleus CE in Kirsch et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12</xref> to be <italic>k</italic> <sup>M</sup> =2.90 N/mm and <italic>β</italic> <sup>M</sup> =0.020 Ns/mm at a nominal active tension of 5N.

When using to the data from <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12</xref> in Kirsch et al.

When this procedure is repeated for <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> of Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] (from a different specimen) we are left with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline247.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> for the elastic-tendon model and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline248.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> for the rigid-tendon model. The value for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline249.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is much larger than <italic>k</italic> <sup>M</sup> because the <italic>a</italic> needed to generate 5N is only 0.231.

<disp-formula id="eqn81">
<graphic xlink:href="534347v6_eqn81.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
which evaluates to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline252.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> for both the elastic and rigid-tendon models using Kirsch et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12</xref> data. The damping coefficients of the elastic and rigid-tendon models is similar because the damping coefficient of the musculotendon is dominated by the damping coefficient of CE. When the data from Kirsch et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> is used, the damping coefficients of the elastic and rigid-tendon models are <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline253.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline254.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> respectively.</p>
<p>The dimensionless parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline255.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline256.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> can be used to approximate the properties of other MTUs given <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline257.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline258.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. The stiffness and damping of the lumped cross-bridge element will scale linearly with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline259.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and inversely with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline260.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> provided the impedance properties of individual crossbridges, and the maximum number of crossbridges attached per sarcomere, is similar between a feline’s skeletal muscle sarcomeres and those of the target MTU. This approximation is rough, however, since the values for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline261.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline262.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) have a relative error of 41% and 76% when evaluated using Kirsch et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12</xref>. In addition, when simulated, the stiffness and damping of the LTI system of best fit may differ from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline263.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline264.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> at low frequencies because the movement of the attachment point has been ignored in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn79">Eqns. 79</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn81">81</xref>. This approximation explains why the VEXAT’s stiffness profile (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>. and C) is below Kirsch et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] data, despite having used this data to fit the <italic>k</italic> <sup>M</sup> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline265.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> terms in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn79">Eqns. 79</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn81">81</xref>. The accuracy of this approximation, however, improves at higher frequencies (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 E</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">F</xref>) because the attachment point’s movements become increasingly limited due to the time constant <italic>τ</italic> <sup>S</sup> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn16">Eqn. 16</xref>. Unfortunately this is a trade-off due to the formulation of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn16">Eqn. 16</xref>: the VEXAT mode can fit Kirsch et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] data at low frequencies, or high frequencies, but not both simultaneously.</p>

Finally, values for N <sup>IgP</sup>, N <sup>PEVK</sup>, and N <sup>IgD</sup> were obtained by taking a 70% and 30% average of the values for 3300 kD and 3400 kD titin to match the composition of rabbit psoas titin as closely as possible.</p></caption>

<title>Model Initialization</title>
<p>Solving for an initial state is challenging since we are given <italic>a, ℓ</italic> <sup>P</sup>, and <italic>v</italic> <sup>P</sup> and must solve for <italic>v</italic> <sup>S</sup>, <italic>ℓ</italic> <sup>S</sup>, and <italic>ℓ</italic> <sup>1</sup> for a rigid-tendon model, and additionally <italic>ℓ</italic> <sup>M</sup> if an elastic-tendon model is used. The type of solution that we look for is one that produces no force or state transients soon after a simulation begins in which activation and path velocity is well approximated as constant. Our preliminary simulations found that satisfactory solutions were found by iterating over both <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline266.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline267.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> using a nested bisection search that looks for values which approximately satisfies <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn22">Eqn. 22</xref>, result in small values for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline268.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn16">Eqn. 16</xref>, and begins with balanced forces between the two segment titin model in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn20">Eqn. 20</xref>.</p>
<p>In the outer loop, we iterate over values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline269.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. Given <italic>a, ℓ</italic> <sup>P</sup>, <italic>v</italic> <sup>P</sup>, and a candidate value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline270.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, we can immediately solve for <italic>α</italic> and <italic>ℓ</italic> <sup>T</sup> using the pennation model. We can numerically solve for the value of another state, <italic>ℓ</italic> <sup>1</sup>, using the kinematic relationship between <italic>ℓ</italic> <sup>M</sup> and <italic>ℓ</italic> <sup>1</sup> and by assuming that the two titin segments are in a force equilibrium
<disp-formula id="eqn82">
<graphic xlink:href="534347v6_eqn82.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
In the inner loop, we iterate over values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline271.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> between 0 and <italic>v</italic> <sup>P</sup> cos <italic>α</italic> (we ignore solutions in which the sign of <italic>v</italic> <sup>M</sup> and <italic>v</italic><sup>T</sup> differ) to find the value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline272.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> that best satisfies <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn22">Eqn. 22</xref>. Prior to evaluating <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn22">Eqn. 22</xref>, we need to set both <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline273.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline274.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. Here we choose a value for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline275.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> that will ensure that the XE is not producing transient forces
<disp-formula id="eqn83">
<graphic xlink:href="534347v6_eqn83.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
and we use fixed-point iteration to solve for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline276.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> such that <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn16">Eqn. 16</xref> evaluates to zero. Now the value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline277.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> can be directly evaluated using the candidate value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline278.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, the first derivative of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn9">Eqn. 9</xref>, and the fact that we have set <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline279.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> to zero. Finally, the error of this specific combination of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline280.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline281.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is evaluated using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn22">Eqn. 22</xref>, where the best solution leads to the lowest absolute value for of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline282.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn22">Eqn. 22</xref>. If a rigid-tendon model is being initialized the procedure is simpler because the inner loop iterating over <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline283.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is unnecessary: given <italic>v</italic> <sup>P</sup> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline284.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> are zero, the velocities <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline285.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline286.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> can be directly solved using the first derivative of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn9">Eqn. 9</xref>. While in principle any root solving method can be used to solve this problem, we have chosen to use the bisection method to avoid local minima.</p>

<title>Evaluating a muscle model’s frequency response</title>
<p>To analyze the the frequency response of a muscle to length perturbation we begin by evaluating the length change
<disp-formula id="eqn84">
<graphic xlink:href="534347v6_eqn84.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
and force change
<disp-formula id="eqn85">
<graphic xlink:href="534347v6_eqn85.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
with respect to the nominal length <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline287.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and nominal force <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534347v6_inline288.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. If we approximate the muscle’s response as a linear time invariant transformation <italic>h</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) we can express
<disp-formula id="eqn86">
<graphic xlink:href="534347v6_eqn86.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>∗</italic> is the convolution operator. Each of these signals can be transformed into the frequency-domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>] by taking the Fourier transform <italic>ℱ</italic> (·) of the time-domain signal, which produces a complex (with real and imaginary parts) signal. Since convolution in the time-domain corresponds to multiplication in the frequency-domain, we have
<disp-formula id="eqn87">
<graphic xlink:href="534347v6_eqn87.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
In <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn87">Eqn. 87</xref> we are interested in solving for <italic>H</italic>(<italic>s</italic>). While it might be tempting to evaluate <italic>H</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) as
<disp-formula id="eqn88">
<graphic xlink:href="534347v6_eqn88.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
the result will poorly estimate <italic>H</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) because <italic>Y</italic> (<italic>s</italic>) is only approximated by <italic>H</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) <italic>X</italic>(<italic>s</italic>): <italic>Y</italic> (<italic>s</italic>) may contain nonlinearities, non-stationary signals, and noise that cannot be described by <italic>H</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) <italic>X</italic>(<italic>s</italic>).</p>
<p>Using cross-spectral densities, Koopmans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>] (p. 140) derived the estimator
<disp-formula id="eqn89">
<graphic xlink:href="534347v6_eqn89.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
that minimizes the squared errors between <italic>Y</italic> (<italic>s</italic>) and its linear approximation of <italic>H</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) <italic>X</italic>(<italic>s</italic>). The cross-spectral density <italic>G</italic><sub><italic>xy</italic></sub> between <italic>x</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) and <italic>y</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is given by
<disp-formula id="eqn90">
<graphic xlink:href="534347v6_eqn90.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
the Fourier transform of the cross-correlation (⋆) between <italic>x</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) and <italic>y</italic>(<italic>t</italic>). When the order of <italic>x</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) and <italic>y</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) are reversed in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn90">Eqn. 90</xref> the result is <italic>G</italic><sub><italic>yx</italic></sub>, while <italic>G</italic><sub><italic>xx</italic></sub> and <italic>G</italic><sub><italic>yy</italic></sub> are produced by taking the Fourier transform of <italic>x</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) <italic>⋆ x</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) and <italic>y</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) <italic>⋆ y</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) respectively.</p>
<p>Though Koopmans’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>] estimator is a great improvement over <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn88">Eqn. 88</xref>, the accuracy of the estimate can be further improved using Welch’s method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>]. Welch’s method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>] breaks up the time domain signal into K segments, transforms each segment into the frequency domain, and returns the average across all segments. Using Welch’s method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>] with K segments allows us to evaluate
<disp-formula id="eqn91">
<graphic xlink:href="534347v6_eqn91.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
which has a lower frequency resolution than <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn89">Eqn. 89</xref>, but an improved accuracy in <italic>H</italic>(<italic>s</italic>). Now we can evaluate the gain of <italic>H</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) as
<disp-formula id="eqn92">
<graphic xlink:href="534347v6_eqn92.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
while the phase of <italic>H</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) is given by
<disp-formula id="eqn93">
<graphic xlink:href="534347v6_eqn93.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where ℝ (<italic>H</italic>(<italic>s</italic>)) and 𝕀 (<italic>H</italic>(<italic>s</italic>)) are the real and imaginary parts of <italic>H</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) respectively.</p>
<p>The transfer function estimated in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn91">Eqn. 91</xref> is meaningful only when <italic>y</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) can be approximated as a linear time-invariant function of <italic>x</italic>(<italic>t</italic>). By evaluating the coherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>] (p. 137) between <italic>x</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) and <italic>y</italic>(<italic>t</italic>)
<disp-formula id="eqn94">
<graphic xlink:href="534347v6_eqn94.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
we can determine the strength of the linear association between <italic>X</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) and <italic>Y</italic> (<italic>s</italic>) at each frequency. When <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>xy</italic></sub> is close to 1 it means that <italic>Y</italic> (<italic>s</italic>) is well approximated by <italic>H</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) <italic>X</italic>(<italic>s</italic>). As <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>xy</italic></sub> approaches 0, it means that the approximation of <italic>Y</italic> (<italic>s</italic>) by <italic>H</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) <italic>X</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) becomes poor.</p>
<p>Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] analyzed a bandwidth that spanned from 4 Hz up to the cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter ap-plied to the input signal <italic>x</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) (15 Hz, 35 Hz, and 90 Hz).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we cannot use this bandwidth directly when analyzing model output because we have no guarantee that the simulated output is sufficiently linear in this range. Instead, to strike a balance between accuracy and consistency with Kirsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], we analyze the bandwidth that is common to Kirsch et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] defined range and has the minimum acceptable (<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>xy</italic></sub>)<sup>2</sup> of 0.67 that is pictured in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> of Kirsch et al.</p>

<p>This is a <bold>valuable</bold> study that develops a new model of the way muscle responds to perturbations, synthesizing models of how it responds to small and large perturbations, both of which are used to predict how muscles function for stability but also how they can be injured, and which tend to be predicted poorly by classic Hill-type models. The evidence presented to support the model is <bold>solid</bold>, since it outperforms Hill-type models in a variety of conditions. Although the combination of phenomenological and mechanistic aspects of the model may sometimes make it challenging to interpret the output, the work will be of interest to those developing realistic models of the stability and control of movement in humans or other animals.</p>

<p>Muscle models are important tools in the fields of biomechanics and physiology. Muscle models serve a wide variety of functions, including validating existing theories, testing new hypotheses, and predicting forces produced by humans and animals in health and disease. This paper attempts to provide an alternative to Hill-type muscle models that includes contributions of titin to force enhancement over multiple time scales. Due to the significant limitations of Hill-type models, alternative models are needed and therefore the work is important and timely.</p>
<p>The effort to include a role for titin in muscle models is a major strength of the methods and results.

<p>This model of skeletal muscle includes springs and dampers which aim to capture the effect of crossbridge and titin stiffness during the stretch of active muscle. While both crossbridge and titin stiffness have previously been incorporated, in some form, into models, this model is the first to simultaneously include both. The authors suggest that this will allow for the prediction of muscle force in response to short-, mid- and long-range stretches. All these types of stretch are likely to be experienced by muscle during in vivo perturbations, and are known to elicit different muscle responses. Hence, it is valuable to have a single model which can predict muscle force under all these physiologically relevant conditions. In addition, this model dramatically simplifies sarcomere structure to enable this muscle model to be used in multi-muscle simulations of whole-body movement.</p>
<p>In order to test this model, its force predictions are compared to 3 sets of experimental data which focus on short-, mid- and long-range perturbations, and to the predictions of a Hill-type muscle model. The choice of data sets is excellent and provide a robust test of the model's ability to predict forces over a range of length perturbations. However, I find the comparison to a Hill-type muscle model to be somewhat limiting. It is well established that Hill-type models do not have any mechanism by which they can predict the effect of active muscle stretch. Hence, that the model proposed here represents an improvement over such a model is not a surprise. Many other models, some of which are also simple enough to be incorporated into whole-body simulations, have incorporated mechanistic elements which allow for the prediction of force responses to muscle stretch. And it is not clear from the results presented here that this model would outperform such models.</p>
<p>The paper begins by outlining the phenomenological vs mechanistic approaches taken to muscle modelling, historically. It appears, although is not directly specified, that this model combines these approaches. A somewhat mechanistic model of the response of the crossbridges and titin to active stretch is combined with a phenomenological implementation of force-length and force-velocity relationships. This combination of approaches may be useful improving the accuracy of predictions of muscle models and whole-body simulations, which is certainly a worthy goal. However, it also may limit the insight that can be gained. For example, it does not seem that this model could reflect any effect of active titin properties on muscle shortening. In addition, it is not clear to me, either physiologically or in the model, what drives the shift from the high stiffness in short-range perturbations to the somewhat lower stiffness in mid-range perturbations.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p>
<p>This is a valuable study that develops a new model of the way muscle responds to perturbations, synthesizing models of how it responds to small and large perturbations, both of which are used to predict how muscles function for stability but also how they can be injured, and which tend to be predicted poorly by classic Hill-type models. The evidence presented to support the model is solid, since it outperforms Hill-type models in a variety of conditions. Although the combination of phenomenological and mechanistic aspects of the model may sometimes make it challenging to interpret the output, the work will be of interest to those developing realistic models of the stability and control of movement in humans or other animals.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Muscle models are important tools in the fields of biomechanics and physiology. Muscle models serve a wide variety of functions, including validating existing theories, testing new hypotheses, and predicting forces produced by humans and animals in health and disease. This paper attempts to provide an alternative to Hill-type muscle models that includes contributions of titin to force enhancement over multiple time scales. Due to the significant limitations of Hill-type models, alternative models are needed and therefore the work is important and timely.</p>
<p>The effort to include a role for titin in muscle models is a major strength of the methods and results. The results clearly demonstrate the weaknesses of Hill models and the advantages of incorporating titin into theoretical treatments of muscle mechanics. Another strength is to address muscle mechanics over a large range of time scales.</p>
<p>The authors succeed in demonstrating the need to incorporate titin in muscle models, and further show that the model accurately predicts in situ force of cat soleus (Kirsch et al. 1994; Herzog &amp; Leonard, 2002) and rabbit posts myofibrils (Leonard et al. 2010). However, it remains unclear whether the model will be practical for use with data from different muscles or preparations. Several ad hoc modifications were described in the paper, and the degree to which the model requires parameter optimization for different muscles, preparations and experiment types remains unclear.</p>
<p>I think the authors should state how many parameters require fitting to the data vs the total number of model parameters. It would also be interesting for the authors to discuss challenges associated with modeling ex vivo and in vivo data sets, due to differences in means of stimulation vs. model inputs.</p>
<p>(1) I think the authors should state how many parameters require fitting to the data vs the total number of model parameters.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The total number of model parameters are listed in Table 1. Each parameter has, in addition, references listed for the source of data (if one exists) along with how the data were used (’C’ calculate, ’F’ fit, ’E’ estimated, or ’S’ for scaled) for the specific simulations that appear in this paper. While this is a daunting number of parameters, only a few of these parameters must be updated when modeling a new musculotendon.</p>
<p>Similar to a Hill-type muscle model, at least 5 parameters are needed to fit the VEXAT model to a specific musculotendon: maximum isometric force (fiso), optimal contractile element (CE) length, pennation angle, maximum shortening velocity, and tendon slack length. However, similar to a Hill model, it is only possible to use this minimal set of parameters by making use of default values for the remaining set of parameters. The defaults we have used have been extracted from mammalian muscle (see Table 1) and may not be appropriate for modeling muscle tissue that differs widely in terms of the ratio of fast/slow twitch fibers, titin isoform, temperature, and scale.</p>
<p>Even when these defaults are appropriate, variation is the rule for biological data rather than the exception. It will always be the case that the best fit can only be obtained by fitting more of the model’s parameters to additional data. Standard measurements of the active force-length relation, passive forcelength relation, and force-velocity relations are quite helpful to improve the accuracy of the model to a specific muscle. It is challenging to improve the fit of the model’s cross-bridge (XE) and titin models because the data required are so rare. The experiments of Kirsch et al., Prado et al, and Trombitas et´ al. are unique to our knowledge. However, if more data become available, it is relatively straight forward to update the model’s parameters using the methods described in Appendix B or the code that appears online (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/mjhmilla/Millard2023VexatMuscle">https://github.com/mjhmilla/Millard2023VexatMuscle</ext-link>).</p>
<p>We have modified the manuscript to make it clear that, in some circumstances, the burden of parameter identification for the VEXAT model can be as low as a Hill model:</p>

<p>(2) It would also be interesting for the authors to discuss challenges associated with modeling ex vivo and in vivo data sets, due to differences in means of stimulation vs. model inputs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>All of the experiments simulated in this work are in-situ or ex-vivo. So far the main challenges of simulating any experiment have been quite consistent across both in-situ and ex-vivo datasets: there are insufficient data to fit most model parameters to a specific specimen and, instead, defaults from the literature must be used. In an ideal case, a specimen would have roughly ten extra trials collected so that the maximum isometric force, optimal fiber length, active force-length relation, passive force-length relation (upto ≈ 0_._6_f_oM), and the force-velocity relations could be identified from measurements rather than relying on literature values. Since most lab specimens are viable for a small number of trials (with the exception of cat soleus), we don’t expect this situation to change in future.</p>
<p>However, if data are available the fitting process is pretty straight forward for either in-situ or ex-vivo data: use a standard numerical method (for example non-linear least squares, or the bisection method) to adjust the model parameters to reduce the errors between simulation and experiment. The main difficulty, as described in the previous paragraph, is the availability of data to fit as many parameters as possible for a specific specimen. As such, the fitting process really varies from experiment to experiment and depends mainly on the richness of measurements taken from a specific specimen, and from the literature in general.</p>
<p>Working from in-vivo data presents an entirely different set of challenges. When working with human data, for example, it’s just not possible to directly measure muscle force with tendon buckles, and so it is never completely clear how force is distributed across the many muscles that typically actuate a joint. Further, there is also uncertainty in the boundary condition of the muscle because optical motion capture markers will move with respect to the skeleton. Video fluoroscopy offers a method of improving the accuracy of measured boundary conditions, though only for a few labs due to its great expense. A final boundary condition remains impossible to measure in any case: the geometry and forces that act at the boundaries as muscle wraps over other muscles and bones. Fitting to in-vivo data are very difficult.</p>
<p>While this is an interesting topic, it is tangent to our already lengthy manuscript. Since these reviews are public, we’ll leave it to the motivated reader to find this text here.</p>

<p>While many muscle physiologists are aware of the limitations of the Hill model, these limitations are not so well known among computational biomechanists. There are at least two reasons for this gap: there are few comprehensive evaluations of Hill models against several experiments, and some of the differences are quite nuanced. For example, active lengthening experiments can be replicated reasonably well using a Hill model if the lengthening is done on the ascending limb of the force length curve. Clearly the story is quite different on the descending limb as shown in Figure 9. Similarly, as Figure 8 shows, by choosing the right combination of tendon model and perturbation bandwidth it is possible to get reasonably accurate responses from the Hill model to stochastic length changes. Yet when a wide variety of perturbation bandwidths, magnitudes, and tendon models are tested it is clear that the Hill model cannot, in general, replicate the response of muscle to stochastic perturbations. For these reasons we think many of the Hill model’s drawbacks have not been clearly understood by computational biomechanists for many years now.</p>

<p>We agree that it will be valuable to benchmark other models in the literature using the same set of experiments. Hopefully we, or perhaps others, will have the good fortune to secure research funding to continue this benchmarking work. This will, however, be quite challenging: few muscle models are accompanied by a professional-quality open-source implementation. Without such an implementation it is often impossible to reproduce published results let alone provide a fair and objective evaluation of a model.</p>

<p>The titin model described in the paper will provide an enhancement of force during a stretch-shortening cycle. This certainly would be an interesting next experiment to simulate in a future paper.</p>

<p>We can only respond to what drives the frequency dependent stiffness in the model, though we’re quite interested in what happens physiologically. Hopefully that there are some new experiments done to examine this phenomena in the future. In the case of the model, the reasons are pretty straight forward: the formulation of Eqn. 16 is responsible for this shift.</p>
<p>Equation 16 has been formulated so that the acceleration of the attachment point of the XE is driven by the force difference between the XE and a reference Hill model (numerator of the first term in Eqn. 16) which is then low pass filtered (denominator of the first term in Eqn. 16). Due to this formulation the attachment point moves less when the numerator is small, or when the differences in the numerator change rapidly and effectively become filtered out. When the attachment point moves less, more of the CE’s force output is determined by variations in the length of the XE and its stiffness.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the attachment point will move when the numerator of the first term in Eqn. 16 is large, or when those differences are not short lived. When the attachment point moves to reduce the strain in the XE, the force produced by the XE’s spring-damper is reduced. As a result, the CE’s force output is less influenced by variations of the length of the XE and its stiffness.</p>

<p>I find the clarity of the manuscript to be much improved following revision. While I still find the combination of phenomenological and mechanistic approaches to be a little limiting with regards to our understanding of muscle contraction, the revised description of small length changes makes the interpretation much less confusing.</p>
<p>Similarly, while I agree that Hill-type models are widely used their limitations have been addressed extensively and are very well established. Hence, moving forward I think it would be much more valuable to start to compare these newer models to one another rather than just showing an improvement over a Hill model under (very biologically important) conditions which that model has no capacity to predict forces.</p>

<p>We have had to abstract some of the details of reality to have a model that can be used to simulate hundreds of muscles. In contrast, FiberSim produced by Kenneth Campbell’s group uses much less abstraction and might be of greater interest to you. FiberSim’s models include individual cross-bridges, titin molecules, and an explicit representation of the spatial geometry of a sarcomere. While this model is a great tool for testing muscle physiology questions through simulation, it is computationally expensive to use this model to simulate hundreds of muscles simultaneously.</p>
