<title>Abstract</title><p>Ketamine (KET) and isoflurane (ISO) are two widely used general anesthetics, yet their distinct and shared neurophysiological mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we conducted a comparative analysis of KET and ISO effects on c-Fos expression across the brain, utilizing principal component analysis (PCA) and c-Fos-based functional network analysis to evaluate the responses of individual brain regions to each anesthetic. Our findings demonstrate that KET significantly activates cortical and subcortical arousal-promoting nuclei, with the somatosensory cortex (SS) serving as a hub node, corroborating the top-down general anesthesia theory for dissociative anesthesia. In contrast, ISO activates the nuclei in the hypothalamus and brain-stem, with the locus coeruleus (LC) as a hub node, implying a bottom-up mechanism for anesthetic-induced unconsciousness. Notably, the coactivation of sleep-wakefulness regulation, analgesia-related, neuroendocrine-related nuclei (e.g., prelimbic area (PL) and infralimbic areas (ILA), and the anterior paraventricular nucleus (aPVT), Edinger-Westphal nucleus (EW), locus coeruleus (LC), parabrachial nucleus (PB), solitary tract nucleus (NTS)) by both anesthetics underscores shared features such as unconsciousness, analgesia, and autonomic regulation, irrespective of their specific molecular targets. In conclusion, our results emphasize the distinct actions of KET and ISO while also uncovering the commonly activated brain regions, thus contributing to the advancement of our understanding of the mechanisms under-lying general anesthesia.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Despite considerable investigation into the molecular targets, neural circuits, and functional connectivity associated with various anesthetics, our comprehension of their effects on overall brain activity continues to be limited and incomplete [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. At the molecular level, ketamine (KET) and isoflurane (ISO) interact with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAa) receptors, respectively, modulating neuronal excitability and ultimately leading to a loss of consciousness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. In systems neuroscience, the neural mechanisms of anesthetic induced unconsciousness involve both top-down and bottom-up processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. As evidenced by in vivo electro-physiology or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, the top-down paradigm illustrates that anesthetics induce unconsciousness by disrupting corticocortical and corticothalamic circuits responsible for neural information integration, while peripheral sensory information can still be conveyed to the primary sensory cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. The bottom-up approach, exemplified by ISO, involves the activation of sleep-promoting nuclei like ventral lateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) and inhibition of arousal centers in the brain-stem and diencephalon, supporting the shared circuits of sleep and anesthesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. However, the limited spatial resolution of fMRI studies and the inability of EEG to capture specific brainstem nuclei hinder the acquisition of comprehensive whole-brain information. Although a substantial body of knowledge has been amassed, our understanding of the reciprocal responses among different brain regions during general anesthesia remains relatively sparse and fragmented. To bridge these gaps, further investigation using advanced techniques that can capture the whole-brain dynamics is needed to elucidate the complex interactions and shared mechanisms between various anesthetics.</p>
<p>Neuronal extracellular stimulation typically results in the elevation of adenosine 3’,5’-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) levels and calcium influx, ultimately leading to the upregulation of immediate early genes (IEGs) such as c-<underline>fos</underline> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. The translation product of c-fos, c-Fos protein, offers single-cell spatial resolution and has been utilized as a biomarker to identify anesthetic-activated brain regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Previous investigations of c-Fos expression throughout the brain demonstrated that GABAergic agents inhibited cortical activity while concurrently activating subcortical brain regions, including the VLPO, median preoptic nucleus (MnPO), lateral septal nucleus (LS), Edinger-Westphal nucleus (EW), and locus coeruleus (LC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. In contrast, KET was shown to provoke wake-like c-Fos expression and intense augmentation of c-Fos expression in various brain regions at clinical dosages (75-100 mg/kg) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. It is important to note that these experiments administered KET at lights-on and GABAa receptor agonists at lights-off, potentially introducing circadian influences for direct comparison of ISO and KET. Moreover, it has been re-vealed that state of general anesthesia is not determined by activity in individual brain areas, but emerges as a global change within the brain. This change involves the activation of lateral habenular nucleus (LHb), VLPO, supraoptic nucleus (SON), and central amygdaloid nucleus (CeA), which are essential for anesthetics induced sedation, unconsciousness, or analgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. However, brain-wide mapping and comparison of distinct anesthetic (KET and ISO) activated nuclei at a cellular level have not been fully elucidated.</p>
<p>In this study, we examined the distribution of nuclei activated by ISO and KET in 987 brain regions using immunochemical labeling and a customized MATLAB software package, which facilitated signal detection and registration to the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. We compared whole-brain c-Fos expression induced by KET and ISO through principal component analysis (PCA) and calculated inter-regional correlations by determining the covariance across subjects for each brain region pair. We then extracted significantly positively correlated brain regions to construct functional networks and performed graph theory-based network analyses to identify hub nodes. Our results uncovered distinct yet overlapping whole-brain activation patterns for KET and ISO.</p>

<title>A comparison of the activation patterns of c-Fos in 53 brain areas in response to ISO and KET</title>
<p>To examine the pattern of c-Fos expression throughout the brain, 1.5% ISO was continuously ventilated, or 100 mg/kg KET was administrated 90 minutes before harvesting (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Raw images of brain slices were aligned to the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The entire brain was divided into 12 main regions in grade four with a total of 53 subregions in <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">supplementary table 1</xref>. We first calculated the c-Fos cell density in each brain region across the four groups and then log-transformed the data for principal component analysis (PCA). The top two principal components revealed a clear separation between the KET and ISO groups, with KET induced c-Fos expression closely associated with PC1, accounting for 30.72% of the variance, while ISO was associated with PC2, accounting for 25.89%. The absence of overlap between PC1 and PC2 suggests distinct patterns of brain region activation for each anesthetic (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> illustrates the component coefficients of principal component 1 (PC1) and principal component 2 (PC2) for each brain region. The points in the figure represent brain regions with absolute component coefficients within the top 25%. KET, closely related to PC1, predominantly affected cortical regions, as evidenced by top 25% positive PC1 coefficients in MOB, AON, MO, ACA, and ORB, while subcortical areas exhibited negative coefficients. In contrast, ISO, showing a notable association with PC2, displayed top 25% positive coefficients in PALc, LSX of CNU, cortical ILA, and hypothalamic PVZ, with top 25% negative coefficients primarily found in cortical regions. These findings reveal distinct patterns of brain region activation for each anesthetic, with KET primarily affecting cortical regions, and ISO mainly influencing the central nucleus (CNU) and hypothalamus. To reduce inter-individual variability, we normalized c-Fos+ cell counts in each brain area by dividing them by the total c-Fos+ cells in the entire brain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), enabling a more accurate comparison of KET and SO induced activation patterns. In line with PCA results, KET significantly activated the isocortex (16.55 ± 2.31 vs. 40.13 ± 1.97, P &lt; 0.001) and reduced the proportion of c-Fos+ cells in the hypothalamus (14.88 ± 2.18 vs. 4.03 ± 0.57, P = 0.001) and midbrain (21.87 ± 2.74 vs. 6.48 ± 1.06, P = 0.001) compared to the saline group. In contrast, ISO induced c-Fos+ cells were mainly observed in the striatum and hypothalamus compared to the home cage group, specifically in the periventricular zone (PVZ) (2.330 ± 0.759 vs. 6.63 ± 0.84, P = 0.004) and lateral zone (LZ) (2.82 ± 0.3 vs. 5.59 ± 0.75, P = 0.007) of the hypothalamus, as well as STRv (0.59 ± 0.10 vs. 2.77 ± 0.40, P &lt; 0.001) and LSX (1.93 ± 0.59 vs. 5.11 ± 0.41, P = 0.0012) of the striatum (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and Table 1). In summary, our findings reveal that KET predominantly affects cortical regions, whereas isoflurane mainly targets subcortical areas, specifically the striatum, and hypothalamus. These results demonstrate distinct patterns of brain region activation for each anesthetic agent.</p>

<title>Similarities and differences in ISO and KET activated c-Fos brain areas</title>
<p>To further elucidate the similarities and differences between ISO and KET induced c-Fos expression patterns, we conducted a PCA on the logarithm of cell density across 201 brain regions, aiming to analyze their responses and characterize the variance among the respective experimental groups (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). The top two principal components displayed well-separated ISO and KET groups (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), where the KET group had a strong association with PC1 (accounting for 28.97% of the variance) and the ISO group was associated with PC2 (accounting for 15.54% of the variance), indicating distinct features for the ISO and KET groups. We then further calculated the PC coefficients corresponding to the c-Fos density within each brain region (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). The points in the figure represent brain regions with absolute component coefficients within the top 25%, highlighting the most influential regions in the PCA analysis. KET, closely associated with PC1, mainly activates brain regions within the cerebral cortex (CTX), including the visceral area (VISC), claustrum (CLA), dorsal peduncular area (DP), orbital area (ORB), and temporal association areas (TEA), while significantly inhibiting the hypothalamus, midbrain, and hindbrain. In contrast, ISO, closely associated with PC2, predominantly activates the hypothalamic regions, such as the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO), suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCH), tuberal nucleus (TU), medial preoptic area (MPO), and supraoptic nucleus (SON), as well as certain nuclei in the central nucleus (CNU), while suppressing the cortex, midbrain, and hindbrain. KET predominantly affects brain regions within the cerebral cortex (CTX), while significantly inhibiting the hypothalamus, midbrain, and hindbrain. This result is in line with the top-down mechanism proposed previously, whereby anesthetic agents suppress consciousness by modulating cortical and thalamocortical circuits involved in the integration of neural information. ISO primarily activates hypothalamic regions, while suppressing the cortex, midbrain, and hindbrain. This aligns with the bottom-up mechanism, where anesthetics suppress consciousness by modulating sleep-wakefulness nuclei and neural circuits in the brainstem and diencephalon that have evolved to control arousal states[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. We summarized the responses differences between the two anesthetics in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, KET acts mainly via the top down mechanism, affecting cortical regions, while ISO operates through the bottom up mechanism, primarily targeting subcortical areas such as the hypothalamus, suggesting that different anesthetic agents may achieve the loss of consciousness by modulating distinct brain regions and neural circuits.</p>

(C) Activation patterns of ISO and KET in different parts of brain regions were summarized. ISO was predominantly characterized by increased activation of hypothalamic and cerebral nuclei while reducing activity in the cortex and midbrain, indicating that ISO primarily exerts its effects through a bottom-up mechanism. On the other hand, KET primarily activated the cortex and inhibited hypothalamus and midbrain activity, suggesting that KET regulates consciousness through a top-down mechanism.</p></caption>

<title>Identifying brain regions activated by KET</title>
<p>We further employed quantitative methods to identify the brain regions activated by KET across the entire brain. Our findings concur with previous studies, numerous cortical regions associated with somatosensory, auditory, visual, and movement were activated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A and C</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>, <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Additionally, we identified several innovative observations that enrich the current understanding in this field. To provide a clearer overview of our findings, we categorized the activated brain areas based on their functions: (1) Arousal: Several nuclei associated with arousal were activated,includingtheprelimbicarea(PL),infralimbiccortex(ILA), paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT), sublaterodorsal nucleus (SLD), and dorsal raphe (DR). Prior evidence indicates that the PL/ILA and PVT regions play a role in regulating sleep and arousal in both cortical and subcortical areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. The SLD has been reported to stabilize REM sleep, while dopaminergic neurons in the DR are involved in sleep-wake regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. (2) Pain modulation, KET significantly activated pain-related areas such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACA) in the cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], the anterior pretectal nucleus (APN) in the thalamus, which is known to be involved in managing chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>], and the anterior periaqueductal gray (PAG) region and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), both part of the endogenous pain inhibitory pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>],. Additionally, the activation of the locus coeruleus (LC) in the midbrain may contribute to KET’s analgesic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. (3) Neuroendocrine regulation: The paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH) and supraoptic nucleus (SON), which are neuroendocrine-related regions, were also activated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. (4) Movement: Subcortical nuclei associated with movement, such as the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and nucleus incertus (NI), were prominently activated by KET administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. (5) Connectivity: We observed significant activation of the nucleus reunions (Re) located in the thalamus, which receives substantial afferent input from limbic structures and serves as a connector linking the hippocampus to the medial prefrontal cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. In summary, our study identified extensive activation of cortical and subcortical nuclei during KET anesthesia, encompassing regions related to arousal, pain modulation, neuroendocrine regulation, movement, and connectivity.</p>

<title>Identifying brain regions activated by ISO</title>
<p>In our study, we aimed to identify brain regions activated by ISO and compare these with those activated by KET. We began by summarizing previously reported ISO activated nuclei, including PIR, LSd/LSv, CeA in the cortex and striatum, and VLPO, MnPO, EW, NTS, LC, ventral group of the dorsal thalamus (VeN), and area postrema (AP) in the hypothalamus and midbrain (<xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). We subsequently conducted a comprehensive MATLAB-based analysis of c-Fos expression throughout the entire brain, uncovering previously undetected activated nuclei (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Newly identified activated nuclei in the CTX and the CNU included PL/ILA and ENT, aPVT in the thalamus, TU, ARH, PVi, and PVH in the hypothalamus, and PB in the hindbrain. All nuclei activated by ISO in this study were functionally classified and depicted in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>. Our results confirmed the activation of several brain regions involved in sleep-wakefulness regulation, such as the prelimbic area (PL) and infralimbic areas (ILA), and the anterior paraventricular nucleus (aPVT), leads to increased NREM sleep and decreased wakefulness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Additionally, we observed activation in previously reported analgesia-related nuclei, including CeA and LC, as well as the parabrachial nucleus (PB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. We also found activation in neuroendocrine function-related nuclei of the hypothalamus, such as TU, PVi, ARH, PVH, and SON. Moreover, we identified activations related to ISO induced side effects, such as in the piriform cortex (PIR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>] and ENT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. which may be stimulated by ISO odor, and the solitary tract nucleus (NTS), potentially responsible for ISO induced vomiting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. The only activated nucleus in the midbrain was the Edinger-Westphal nucleus (EW). Recent research has found that sevoflurane activates EW and is involved in sleep induction and maintenance of anesthesia, suggesting its crucial role in general anesthesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. By comparing the ISO and KET induced c-Fos expression, we summarized the brain regions activated by both anesthetics in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>. Despite variations in molecular targets, the coactivation of regions such as PL/ILA, aPVT, CeA, PVH, SON, EW, PB, LC, and NTS by both ISO and KET suggests an overlapping neuronal circuitry that influences sleep-wake regulation, analgesia, and neuroendocrine functions. This shared neural circuitry may potentially offer a common mechanism across the two anesthetics for the maintenance of general anesthesia.</p>

<title>Network generation and Hub identification</title>
<p>Previous research has established that general anesthesia is mediated by various brain regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. c-Fos expression serves as an indicator of neuronal activity, providing a single index of activation per region per animal. By examining the covariance of c-Fos expression across animals within each group, we can infer interactions between brain regions and identify functional networks engaged during general anesthesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Highly correlated activities across different brain regions are presumed to constitute components of a functional network, reflecting the complex interplay of brain areas during general anesthesia. We first employed c-Fos expression as a neuronal activity marker and calculated a comprehensive set of interregional correlations for four groups. The matrices exhibited interregional correlations for the number of c-Fos-positive cells in each condition (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Network graphs were generated by extracting Pearson’s coefficients &gt; 0.82, as well as significant positive correlations (P &lt; 0.05), from these matrices to construct functional brain networks (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). In comparison to the control group, isoflurane (ISO) slightly decreased interconnections between regions (network density: 0.13 vs. 0.10; edges: 267 vs. 198), with no significant difference in mean interregional correlation coefficients between the ISO group and the home cage group (Fisher Z = -0.018, P = 0.98). Conversely, ketamine (KET) significantly increased the network’s connectivity density (network density: 0.13 vs. 0.47; edges: 265 vs. 1008) and showed a significant increase in mean interregional correlation coefficients compared to the saline group (Fisher Z = 3.54, P &lt; 0.001) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). These findings suggest that ISO may exert a mild inhibitory effect on functional network connectivity, whereas KET appears to enhance interregional correlation following administration (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>).</p>

<p>Hubs are nodes that occupy critical central positions within the network, enabling the network to function properly. To determine the brain regions that serve as the hubs for ISO and KET induced functional networks, we calculated each node’s degree (the number of links that connect it) and betweenness centrality (the fraction of all shortest paths in the network that contain a given node). Nodes with a high degree and betweenness centrality typically have a lot of connections. We ranked each node according to its degree and betweenness centrality and extracted nodes with a rank greater than the 80th percentile in its network. Additionally, we segmented the functional network into non-overlapping modules using a spectral community detection algorithm and calculated the within-modal degree Z-score (the degree of nodes within a module, which indicates within-module connectivity) as well as participation coefficients (the distribution of the edges of a node between other modules, which indicates within-module connectivity) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. Nodes with relatively high values for both parameters were considered relatively significant within and outside the network module. We classified nodes with participation coefficients &gt; 0.4 and Z scores &gt; 1 as connector hubs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. The LC, exhibiting elevated degree and betweenness centrality as well as relatively higher Z-scores and participation coefficients, may play a pivotal role in mediating isoflurane-induced general anesthesia, given its known involvement in arousal, attention, and analgesia. In contrast, the somatosensory cortex (SS) functions as a connector hub in the KET group, indicating its integrative and coordinating role in ketamine-induced dissociative anesthesia (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). The LSc served as the central hub in the saline group (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). No significant findings were observed in the within-modal degree Z-score and participation coefficient analyses for the home cage group. However, the analysis did reveal a relatively high degree and betweenness centrality of APNs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>), suggesting that the within-module connections are relatively independent, or that the pathways of inter-module information transmission do not depend on specific connector nodes.</p>

<caption><title>The possible framework for ketamine and isoflurane induced unconsciousness.</title>
<p>The distinct pathways of ketamine and isoflurane induced unconsciousness can be explained by two contrasting mechanisms. The “top-down” process attributes KET’s effect to widespread cortical activation (represented in yellow), with the somatosensory cortex (SS) acting as the central node in the functional network (depicted in blue) and relative inhibition of hypothalamic sleep-promoting nuclei. Conversely, the “bottom-up” approach posits that isoflurane induced unconsciousness arises from the activation of hypothalamic sleep-promoting regions (indicated in yellow) and relative inhibition of cortical and thalamic nuclei, with the locus coeruleus (LC) serving as the hub node in the isoflurane induced functional network. Nuclei activated by both anesthetics are shown in green. Adapted from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we conducted a comparative analysis of the effects of two general anesthetics, isoflurane (ISO) and ketamine (KET), on c-Fos expression throughout the brain. By employing principal component analysis (PCA), we were able to thoroughly examine the responses of individual brain regions to each anesthetic agent. Our findings reveal that KET dominantly activates the cerebral cortex yet suppresses subcortical regions, reflecting a top down mechanism of action, while ISO predominantly stimulates subcortical brain regions with relative cortical inhibition, substantiating its bottom up mechanism of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Further functional analysis of brain networks, based on c-Fos expression, identified the somatosensory cortex (SS) and the locus coeruleus (LC) as central nodes for KET and ISO, respectively, highlighting the crucial roles of LC and SS under ISO and KET induced unconsciousness.</p>
<p>Our results demonstrate that ISO activates the sleep-promoting VLPO nucleus, the aPVT-infralimbic loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], and broadly inhibits the cortex, supporting a bottom-up mechanism of ISO induced unconsciousness. Nonetheless, our findings also reveal the activation of arousal related nuclei, such as PB and LC, which implies that the influence of isoflurane on consciousness may not solely rely on suppressing arousal centers, but rather through a more intricate relationship than formerly recognized. Identifying cell types and their dynamic changes during anesthesia will be crucial for clarifying their role in ISO induced unconsciousness.</p>
<p>While c-Fos-based functional network analysis offers lower temporal resolution, its single-cell resolution across the entire brain allows for the inclusion of midbrain and hindbrain regions, supplementing previous fMRI analyses. Our observations reveal that ISO mildly inhibits network density, and through graph theoretical analysis, we identify the LC as a highly connected hub, high-lighting the critical role of the brainstem in ISO induced general anesthesia. The LC performs a wide range of functions in mice, including arousal, pain modulation, attention, stress response, and neuroprotection. Studies have shown that chemical activation of the LC increases whole-brain functional connectivity, attributed to its role as the primary source of norepinephrine (NE) and its extensive influence on nearly the entire brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. The significant LC activation and its central position within the functional network underlying ISO induced unconsciousness suggest that the LC plays a crucial part in maintaining and integrating the entire unconsciousness functional network, emphasizing the involvement of LC in the bottom-up paradigm of ISO induced unconsciousness.</p>
<p>Mashour et al. proposed that anesthesia-induced unconsciousness encompasses not only the modulation of lower-level brain activity but also top down neural processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Within this top down framework, anesthetics diminish consciousness by interfering with cortical and thalamocortical circuits responsible for neural information integration. Our study discovered that KET administration substantially activated cortical and subcortical arousal-promoting nuclei while concurrently causing relative thalamic suppression, with only the RE and TRS exhibiting activation. This suggests that thalamic inhibition may lead to a reduction in thalamocortical communication, which is characterized by the inability to perceive the external environment and results in disconnection from reality. Graph theoretical analysis also identified the somatosensory cortex (SS) as the hub node of the KET induced functional network. As a critical cortical area, SS is responsible for sensory processing, motor control, and cognitive functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. Previous studies have demonstrated that local KET administration to SS recapitulates the effects of systemic KET on both the switch in pyramidal cell activity and dissociative-like behavior, implying that SS may serve as a key target for KET induced dissociation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. Our findings that SS acts as a hub node suggest that KET may modulate brain network function by influencing connectivity between SS and other brain regions, thereby affecting the behavior and cognitive states of mice. This further supports the significance of cortical areas during KET anesthesia.</p>
<p>Identifying shared neural features between KET and ISO is essential for understanding anesthetic-induced unconsciousness. The coactivation of sleep-wake regulation-related regions, such as PL/ILA and aPVT, along with analgesia-related nuclei like CeA, PB, and LC, suggests a shared mechanism for sleep-wake regulation and the common pathways for pain relief. This observation provides valuable insights into the fundamental mechanisms of anesthesia-induced hypnosis and analgesia. Additionally, the coactivation of neuroendocrine-related nuclei, including PVH and SO in the hypothalamus, raises questions about the potential influence of anesthetics on hormonal release and homeostatic regulation. Other coactivated nuclei, such as EW and NTS, warrant further investigation of their roles in anesthesia. In summary, the coactivated nuclei imply a potential shared neuronal circuitry for general anesthesia, encompassing common features like unconsciousness, analgesia, and autonomic regulation, regardless of the specific molecular targets of each drug. Future research could examine coactivated brain regions by the two anesthetics or manipulate identified hub nodes to further understand the mechanisms of general anesthesia. In summary, our study reveals distinct and shared neural mechanisms underlying isoflurane and ketamine anesthesia using c-Fos staining and network analysis. Our findings support “top-down” and “bottom-up” paradigms, and the identification of hub nodes and coactivated brain regions suggests shared neurocircuitry for general anesthesia, providing insights into the mechanisms underlying anesthetic-induced unconsciousness and analgesia.</p>

<sec id="s4a">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines and were approved by the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Neuroscience. Adult male wild-type (WT) mice (C57BL/6J) (8-10 weeks old, weight from 22 to 26 g) were purchased from institute-approved vendors (LingChang Experiment Animal Co., China). Mice were individually housed and maintained on a 12 h:12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 07:00 a.m. and off at 07:00 p.m.) with food and water available ad libitum.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4b">
<title>Drug administration</title>
<p>All experiments occurred between 13:00-14:30 (ZT6–ZT7.5). We adapted mice to handling and the anesthesia chamber (10×15×15 cm) for several days to minimize experimental confound-induced c-Fos induction. Adult male mice were handled for the KET group for 10 min per day with normal saline (NS) injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) for three consecutive days at 13:00. On day five, a randomly chosen mouse received an injection of Ketamine (Gutian Medicine, H35020148), and the control groups (n=8) received the same volume of saline. ISO group (n=6) mice were handled and inhaled 1.5% isoflurane (RWD Life Science, 1903715) at 13:00 on day four in the chamber. Meanwhile, the control groups (n=6) were left undisturbed in their home cages prior to sampling. We confirmed the loss of righting reflex at 5 min after anesthetics exposure. For 90 min after KET injection or ISO inhalation, mice were deeply anesthetized with 5% ISO and transcardially perfused with 35ml 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 35ml 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The brains were then removed and postfixed overnight with 4% PFA. Following fixation, the brains were dehydrated for 48 hours with 30% sucrose (wt/vol) in PBS. Coronal sections (50 µm) of the whole brain were cut using a cryostat (HM525 NX, Thermo Scientific) after being embedded with OCT compound (NEG-50, Thermo Scientific) and freezing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4c">
<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>One out of every three brain slices (100 µm intervals) of each whole brain was washed three times with 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min and permeabilized for 30 minutes at room temperature with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBST). Slices were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature with 2% normal donkey serum (Sigma, G6767) in PBS overnight at 4°C with c-Fos primary antibodies (226003, Synaptic Systems; 1:500) diluted in PBS with 1% donkey serum. After three washes with PBST, slices were incubated with the Cy3 donkey anti-rabbit (711165152, Jackson; 1:200) secondary antibody for 2 hours at room temperature. Immunostained slices were mounted with VECTASHIELD mounting medium with DAPI and then scanned under a fluorescent microscope equipped with a 10× objective (VS120, Olympus) or a confocal microscope with a 20× objective (FV300, Olympus).</p>

<title>Quantification of c-Fos positive cells</title>
<p>The procedures used for c-Fos analysis were based on previously research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. A custom-written software package was employed for the analysis of brain images. The software consists of four modules: atlas rotation, image registration, signal detection, and quantification/visualization.</p>
<sec id="s4d1">
<title>Rotation module</title>
<p>The rotation module allows the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas to be rotated in three dimensions at arbitrary angles to fit individual samples. Anatomical landmarks were manually selected to estimate rotation angles. The most posterior slices containing the CA3 in each hemisphere were used to calculate the rotation angle about the left-right axis. The most anterior slice with the anterior commissure crossing the midline and the most posterior slice with the corpus callosum crossing the midline were used to calculate the rotation angle about the dorsal-ventral axis. The reference atlas was then rotated using these estimated angles to match the experimental brain’s sectioning angle.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d2">
<title>Registration module</title>
<p>The registration module is an image alignment software that uses reference points to align brain section images with a rotated 3D reference atlas for further quantification. First, reference points in both the atlas and the brain image were chosen. The module then applied geometric transformations to the brain section to optimize the match between the brain image and the atlas’s reference points. After the transformation, the image was compared to the atlas, and any necessary adjustments were made manually.</p>

<title>Network generation</title>
<p>To evaluate how functional connectivity changed under general anesthetics in WT mice, we extracted 63 brain regions from major brain subdivisions (cerebral cortex, cerebral nuclei, thalamus, hypothalamus, midbrain, and hindbrain) listed in <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 2</xref>. Correlation matrices were generated by computing Pearson correlation coefficients from interregional c-Fos expression in the 63 regions.

Weighted undirected networks were constructed by considering correlations with Pearson’s r ≥0.82, corresponding to a one-tailed significance level of P&lt;0.05 (uncorrected). The nodes in the networks represent brain regions, and the correlations that survived thresholding were considered connections. Theoretical graph analysis was performed using Brain Connectivity Toolbox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/">https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/</ext-link>, version 2019-03-03) in MATLAB R2021 (The MathWorks Inc.)

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The sample size was determined based on prior studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Normality of data distribution was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk W test.

Data are presented as mean ± SEM, with all statistical tests being two-sided. Pearson correlation coefficients (R) were transformed into Z-scores using Fisher’s Z transformation before computing group means and conducting statistical comparisons.

<p>This potentially <bold>important</bold> study used single-cell whole-brain imaging of the immediate early gene Fos to identify the brain areas recruited by two anesthetics, ketamine and isoflurane. The results suggest these anesthetics might induce anesthesia via different brain regions and pathways. However, the support for the primary conclusions is <bold>incomplete</bold> owing to differences in route of administration between the drugs, lack of a dose response curve and behavioral/physiological measures of the depth of anesthesia, and statistical analysis that does not correct for multiple comparisons. With these issues addressed, this paper would be of interest to preclinical and clinical scientists working with anesthetic and dissociative drugs.</p>

<p>The authors performed a comparative study of the effect of the anesthetics isoflurane and ketamine on whole-brain network activation by mapping whole-brain c-fos expression in mice. Principle component analysis on the normalized Fos density showed opposite effects of the 2 anesthetics, consistent with top-down functioning for ketamine and bottom-up functioning for isoflurane. Based on the network analysis the authors suggest that isoflurane mediates anesthesia through a bottom-up mechanism activating subcortical regions and inactivating cortical regions with the locus coeruleus being the most important region while ketamine produced anesthesia through a top-down mechanism activating the cortex and subcortical nuclei with the somatosensory cortex as the most important region. Overall they show that these two anesthetics have two opposite mechanisms to induce unconsciousness, although they also have overlapping coactivation of central sleep-wake, pain, and neuroendocrine regulating areas. This manuscript highlights some interesting findings through interesting analysis. The results are likely to have a significant impact on the field of anesthesia but also on the much larger field of neuropsychopharmacology as the tools and analyses used in this report will be useful for researchers investigating the effects of any psychoactive drugs on the brain. However, there are several issues that should be addressed to support their conclusions. The two main issues of this report are the lack of behavioral/physiological measures of the depth of anesthesia produced by ketamine/isoflurane and inadequate data analysis/interpretations for some of the results.</p>

The lack of behavioral/physiological measures of the depth of anesthesia (ventilation, heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, O2, pain reflexes, etc...) combined with the lack of dose-response and the use of different routes of administration makes the data difficult to interpret. Sure, there is a clear difference in network activation between KET and ISO, but are those effects due to the depth of the anesthesia, the route of administration, and the dose used? The lack of behavioral/physiological measures prevents the identification of brain regions responsible for some of the physiological effects and different effects of anesthetics.</p>
<p>
2. Under anesthesia there should be an overall reduction of activity, is that the case? There is no mention of significantly downregulated regions. The authors use multiple transformations of the data to interpret the results (%, PC1 values, logarithm) without much explanation or showing the full raw data in Fig 1. It would be helpful to interpret the data to compare the average fos+ neurons in each region between treatment and control for each drug.</p>
<p>
3. I do not understand their interpretation of the PCA analyses. For instance, in Fig 2 they claim that KET is associated with PC1 while ISO is associated with PC2. Looking at the distribution of points it's clear that the KET animals are all grouped at around +2.5 on PC1 and -2.0 on PC2, this means that KET is associated with both PC1 and PC2 to a similar degree (2 to 2.5). Moreover, I'm confused about why they use PCA to represent the animals/group. PCA is a powerful technique to reduce dimensionality and identify groups of variables that may represent the same underlying construct; however, it is not the best way to identify clusters of individuals or groups.</p>
<p>
4. The actual metric used for the first PCA is unclear, is it the FOS density in each of the regions (some of those regions are large and consist of many subregions, how does that affect the analysis) is it the %-fos, or normalized cells? The wording describing this is variable causing some confusion. How would looking at these different metrics influence the analysis?</p>
<p>
5. Based on Fig 3 the authors concludes that ISO activates the hypothalamic regions and inhibits the cortex, however, Fig 1 shows neither an activation of the hypothalamus in the ISO nor an inhibition of the cortex when compared to home cage control. If anything it suggests the opposite.</p>
<p>
6. Control for isoflurane should be air in the induction chamber rather than home cage. It is possible that Fos activation reflects handling/stress pre-anesthesia in the animals, which would increase Fos expression in the stress-related regions such as the BST, striatum (CeA), hypothalamus (PVH) and potentially the LC.</p>
<p>
7. In the Ket network there are a few anticorrelated regions, most of which are amongst the list of the most activated regions, does this mean that the strong correlation results from an overall decreased activation? And if so, is it possible that the ketamine anesthesia was stronger than the isoflurane, causing a more general reduction in activity?</p>
<p>
8. Since they have established networks it would be easy and useful to look at how the different regions identified (sleep, pain, neuroendocrine, motor-related, ...) work together to maintain analgesia, are they within the same module? Do they become functionally connected and is this core network of functional connections similar for KET and ISO?</p>
<p>
9. The naming of the function of some of the regions is very much debatable. For instance, PL/ILA are named &quot;sleep-wakefulness regulation&quot; regions in the paper. I can think of many more important functions of the PL/IL including executive functions, behavioral flexibility, and emotional control. It is unclear how the functions of all the regions were attributed. I am not sure that this biased labeling of structure-function is useful to the reports, it may instead suggest wrong conclusions.</p>
<p>
10. A point of concern and confusion is the number of brain regions analyzed. In the introduction, it is mentioned that 987 brain regions are considered, but this is reduced to 53 selected brain regions in Figure 2, then 201 brain regions in Figure 3, and reduced again to 63 for the network analysis. The rationale for selecting different brain regions is not clear.</p>
<p>
11. The statistical analysis does not seem appropriate considering the high number of comparisons. They use simple t-tests without correction for multiple comparisons.</p>
<p>
12. There is no statistical analysis in Fig 2C,</p>

<p>In this paper the authors aim to investigate brain-wide activation patterns following administration of the anesthetics ketamine and isoflurane, and conduct comparative analysis of these patterns to understand shared and distinct mechanisms of these two anesthetics.</p>
<p>To this end, they perform Fos immunohistochemistry in perfused brain section to label active nuclei, use a custom pipeline to register images to the ABA framework and quantify Fos+ nuclei, and perform multiple complementary analyses to compare activation patterns across groups.</p>
<p>This is an interesting line of research and a tour de force in brain-wide Fos quantification. However, there are several issues with the analysis, and overall integration that dampen my enthusiasm for the article in its current form.</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>1- The authors report 987 brain regions in the introduction, but I cannot find any analysis that incorporates these or even which regions they are. Very little rationale is provided for the regions included in any of the analyses and numbers range from 53 in Figure 1, to 201 in Figure 3, to 63 in Figure 6. It would help if the authors could first survey Fos+ counts across all regions to identify a subset that is of interest (significantly changed by either condition compared to control) for follow up analysis.</p>
<p>2- Different data transformations are used for each analysis. One that is especially confusing is the 'normalization' of brain regions by % of total brain activation for each animal prior to PCA analysis in Figures 2 and 3. This would obscure any global differences in activation and make it unlikely to observe decreases in activation (which I think is likely here) that could be identified using the Fos+ counts after normalizing for region size (ie. Fos+ count / mm3) which is standard practice in such Fos-based activity mapping studies. While PCA can be powerful approach to identify global patterns, the purpose of the analysis in its current form is unclear. It would be more meaningful to show that regional activation patterns (measured as counts/mm3) are on separate PCs by group.</p>
<p>3- Critical problem: The authors include a control group for each anesthetic (ketamine vs. saline, isofluorane vs. homecage) but most analyses do not make use of the control groups or directly compare Fos+ counts across the groups. Strictly speaking, they should have compared relative levels of induction by ketamine versus induction by isoflurane using ANOVAs. Instead, each type of induction was separate from the other. This does not account for increased variability in the ketamine versus isoflurane groups. There is no mention in the Statistics section or in Results section that any multiple comparison corrections were used. It appears that the authors only used Students t-test for each region and did not perform any corrections.</p>
<p>4- Figures 4 and 5 show brain regions 'significantly activated' following KET or ISO respectively, but again a subset of regions are shown and the stats seem to be t-tests with no multiple comparisons correction. It would help to show these two figures side by side, include the same regions, and keep the y axis ranges similar so the reader can easily compare the 'activation patterns' across the two treatments. Indeed, it looks like KET/Saline induced activation is an order or magnitude or two higher than ISO/Homecage. I would also recommend that this be the first data figure before any other analyses and maybe further analysis could be restricted to regions that are significantly changed in following KET or ISO here.</p>
<p>5- Analyses in Figure 6 and 7 are interesting but again the choice of regions to include is unclear and makes interpreting the results impossible. For example, in Figure 7 it is unclear why the list of regions in bar graphs showing Degree and Betweenness Centrality are not the same even within a single row?</p>

<p>The present study presents a comprehensive exploration of the distinct impacts of Isoflurane and Ketamine on c-Fos expression throughout the brain. To understand the varying responses across individual brain regions to each anesthetic, the researchers employ principal component analysis (PCA) and c-Fos-based functional network analysis. The methodology employed in this research is both methodical and expansive. Notably, the utilization of a custom software package to align and analyze brain images for c-Fos positive cells stands out as an impressive addition to their approach. This innovative technique enables effective quantification of neural activity and enhances our understanding of how anesthetic drugs influence brain networks as a whole.</p>
<p>The primary novelty of this paper lies in the comparative analysis of two anesthetics, Ketamine and Isoflurane, and their respective impacts on brain-wide c-Fos expression. The study reveals the distinct pathways through which these anesthetics induce loss of consciousness. Ketamine primarily influences the cerebral cortex, while Isoflurane targets subcortical brain regions. This finding highlights the differing mechanisms of action employed by these two anesthetics-a top-down approach for Ketamine and a bottom-up mechanism for Isoflurane. Furthermore, this study uncovers commonly activated brain regions under both anesthetics, advancing our knowledge about the mechanisms underlying general anesthesia.</p>
