<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Olfactory receptor (OR) choice represents an example of genetically hardwired stochasticity, where every olfactory neuron expresses one out of â¼2000 OR alleles in a probabilistic, yet stereotypic fashion. Here, we propose that topographic restrictions in OR expression are established in neuronal progenitors by two opposing forces: polygenic transcription and genomic silencing, both of which are influenced by dorsoventral gradients of transcription factors NFIA, B, and X. Polygenic transcription of OR genes may define spatially constrained OR repertoires, among which one OR allele is selected for singular expression later in development. Heterochromatin assembly and genomic compartmentalization of OR alleles also vary across the axes of the olfactory epithelium and may preferentially eliminate ectopically expressed ORs with more dorsal expression destinations from this âprivilegedâ repertoire. Our experiments identify early transcription as a potential âepigeneticâ contributor to future developmental patterning and reveal how two spatially responsive probabilistic processes may act in concert to establish deterministic, precise, and reproducible territories of stochastic gene expression.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The development of multicellular organisms relies on gene expression programs that are precisely regulated in space and time. To transform probabilistic biochemical reactions, such as transcription and translation, into reproducible differentiation processes, plants and animals convert individual cellular variability into predictable cell population averages. Yet, there are cases in biology where gene expression variability is desirable, as it generates diverse cellular identities that are difficult to obtain with deterministic gene regulation. For example, production of antibodies via VDJ recombination, and evasion of immunological responses by antigenic variation represent biological systems that seek utmost randomness[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Other biological functions, however, benefit from balancing absolute determinism with complete randomness, producing biased stochasticity. Genetically encoded biased stochasticity is often observed in the nervous system, where gene expression choices generated by neurons must integrate into functional and reproducible circuits[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. In fly ommatidia, for example, biased randomness preserves a ratio of photoreceptor neuron identities across animals[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>], whereas in mammals, random Protocadherin promoter choice[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], was recently shown to obey spatial patterns in the mouse neocortex, assuring proper tiling between neighboring neurons[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Mammalian olfactory receptor (OR) gene choice provides an extreme case of hardwired biased randomness[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. OR transcription starts in neuronal progenitors of the main olfactory epithelium (MOE), which transiently express 5-15 ORs out of &gt;1,000 OR genes distributed in genomic clusters across chromosomes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. As these progenitor cells differentiate into post-mitotic olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), they switch from polygenic to monogenic and monoallelic OR transcription[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. This transition is mediated by the assembly of a multi-chromosomal enhancer hub over the chosen OR allele[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], followed by the stabilizing effects of an OR-elicited feedback signal[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. During this developmental progression, heterochromatic silencing[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>] and genomic OR compartmentalization[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>] act together to assure that the non-chosen OR alleles will remain transcriptionally repressed for the life of the OSN. Interestingly, the position of the OSN across the dorsoventral (DV) axis of the MOE predisposes this singular transcriptional choice towards a group of 50-250 OR genes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], providing reproducible topographic restrictions in OR expression. The anatomical segments of the MOE that express a specific collection of OR identities are known as âzonesâ, with their total number varying from 4 to 9, depending on the analyses and criteria used to define them[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Although zonal restrictions in OR expression have a well-established influence in the wiring of the olfactory circuit[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>], the mechanisms that bias this singular transcriptional choice towards specific OR identities remain unknown.</p>
<p>Here, we identified genetically encoded mechanisms that introduce topographic biases in OR gene regulation. We report that OSN progenitor cells from various MOE segments transcribe OR mixtures consisting of ORs with the corresponding or with more dorsal expression identities. Ectopic expression of dorsal identity ORs at the polygenic stage of OR transcription is rectified during differentiation by preferential genomic silencing that is skewed towards ORs with more dorsal expression identities than the identity of the OSN. Patterns of polygenic OR transcription and genomic OR silencing are influenced by gradients of transcription factors NFI A, B, and X [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Triple NFI (NFIA, B and X) deletion both eliminates heterochromatic silencing and genomic compartmentalization from ORs with ventral identities, as well as extinguishes their transcription in olfactory progenitors. Furthermore, spatial transcriptomics revealed a dramatic expansion of dorsomedial identity OR expression towards the ventral MOE and reciprocal transcriptional reduction of ventral identity ORs in triple NFI knockouts (cKOs), suggesting that patterns of genomic OR silencing and polygenic OR transcription influence OR gene choice. Indeed, transcriptional induction of an OR allele in OSN progenitors biases the choice towards this allele in mature OSNs (mOSNs) throughout the MOE. Strikingly, by modulating the levels of OR induction in progenitor cells we can restrict expression of this OR allele to more dorsal OSNs, where heterochromatic silencing and genomic compartmentalization is less prevalent. Thus, our studies reveal that position-responsive OR transcription in OSN progenitors may act as an âepigeneticâ signal for future singular choice among the previously transcribed ORs. Moreover, our data suggest that polygenic OR transcription and heterochromatic silencing/genomic compartmentalization could act as opposing regulatory ârheostatsâ that determine in a spatially influenced fashion the exact OR repertoire that is available for stochastic singular choice in mature OSNs.</p>

<title>OSN progenitors co-transcribe an increasing number of zonal OR identities towards the ventral MOE</title>
<p>The mouse MOE is divided into a limited series of stereotypic segments, based on expression of OR genes, that exhibit bilateral symmetry between the two nasal cavities (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). In whole mount views, these segments present a dorsoventral (DV) segmentation pattern, with zone 1 being at the dorsal and zone 5 at the ventral end of the MOE. Intricate invaginations of the MOE occurring during embryonic development and early postnatal growth convolute this dorsoventral segmentation pattern, especially when viewing coronal sections of the MOE (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). However, we will continue referring to the DV coordinates of each one of the five segments, or zones, as they correspond to their initial patterning during development.</p>

</fig>
<p>Within each zone, mOSNs express a single OR allele among 50-250 OR genes with proper zonal identities. However, before the onset of singular OR expression, mitotically active OSN progenitors, the immediate neuronal precursor (INP) cells, co-express multiple lowly expressed ORs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. To determine whether zonal restrictions are operational from this polygenic stage of OR transcription, we performed plate-based single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis of FAC-sorted OSNs and OSN progenitors isolated from the MOE, which was micro-dissected into two parts: a more dorsal (zone 1-2) and a more ventral (zone 3-5) segment (Supplementary Figure S1A). With a median of over 130,000 unique transcripts per cell, this method readily detected low level OR gene transcription in OSN progenitors. Additionally, to enrich our plate-based scRNA-seq for cell populations of interest we used Mash1-CreER; tdTomato; Ngn1-GFP triple transgenic mice (Supplementary Figure S1A). We injected P2 mice with tamoxifen, inducing permanent tdTomato expression, and then collected cells 48 hours later (Supplementary Figure S1A). From each dissection we isolated four major cellular populations corresponding to four successive differentiation stages, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]: GBCs (MOE stem cells), INPs (immediate neuronal precursors), iOSNs (immature OSNs), and mOSNs (Supplementary Figure S1A-B).</p>
<p>Dimensionality reduction and clustering of single cell RNA-seq data with Seurat[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>] sorted cells into 6 populations. We determined each populationâs stage of OSN development using expression of known MOE markers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, Supplementary Figure S1B-C). We first detect OR mRNAs in INP3 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), which consistently transcribe multiple ORs. Next, we examined the zonal identity of ORs co-transcribed within individual dorsal or ventral INP3 cells. We created a separate category for the â¼100 âclass Iâ OR genes, which were grouped based on homology and resemblance to OR genes first identified in fish. Virtually all class I OR genes are expressed in zone 1, but their expression is likely regulated though a separate mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>], thus we chose to analyze them separately. Surprisingly, while dorsally positioned INPs transcribe almost exclusively dorsal identity ORs, ventrally positioned INPs transcribe complex mixtures consisting of ORs of every zonal identity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C-D</xref>). Overall, ventral INPs transcribe a greater number of OR genes compared to dorsal INPs. Focusing on OR genes detected with at least 3 unique transcripts, we detect dorsal identity ORs in 43 ventral INP cells and ventral identity ORs in only 29 of them, while dorsal INP cells express predominantly dorsal ORs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C-D</xref>). Moreover, as the ventral INPs differentiate to iOSNs, dorsal identity OR transcription is replaced by the âcorrectâ (zone-appropriate) ventral OR transcription, culminating in singular expression of an OR allele with the correct zonal identity in mOSNs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). These observations were independently confirmed by bulk RNA-seq on FAC-sorted INP and mOSN cells extracted from trisected dorsal (zone 1), dorsomedial (zone 2-3), and ventral (zone 4-5) MOE, using the same labeling and FAC-sorting approach used for the single cell experiments. This bulk analysis showed that in every case INPs co-transcribe ORs with the correct as well as more dorsal zonal identities, while further differentiation replaces dorsal ORs with ORs of the correct identity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). This finding immediately poses mechanistic questions about the process that shuts off dorsal ORs and enhances the transcription of the ORs expected to be expressed in each MOE segment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Heterochromatin eliminates ectopically expressed ORs along the dorsoventral MOE axis</title>
<p>We previously showed that OSN differentiation coincides with heterochromatin-mediated OR gene silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. If heterochromatinization contributes to singular OR choice by eliminating every non-chosen OR allele transcribed in INPs, then in any MOE segment silencing should be preferentially applied to ORs with the correct or more dorsal zonal identities. We performed native ChIP-seq in the MOE to determine deposition of histone marks associated with heterochromatin including H3K9me3, a marker of constitutive heterochromatin, and H3K79me3, which we also find labeling heterochromatin on OR gene clusters[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. We predicted that dorsal-most identity (zone 1) ORs, which are expressed in INPs throughout the MOE, should have the highest levels of heterochromatin, whereas ventral-most identity (zone 5) ORs, which are transcribed only in ventral INPs, should have the lowest, with the rest of the OR repertoire having intermediate levels of heterochromatin marks. Indeed, visual inspection of ChIP-seq genomic tracks along OR gene clusters with mixed zonal constitution reveals highest H3K9me3/H3K79me3 levels on the dorsal identity OR genes and lowest on the ventral identity OR genes of the cluster (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Aggregate ChIP-seq analysis of all the OR genes grouped by their zonal identities corroborates the gradual reduction of H3K9me3 and H3K79me3 enrichment from dorsal to ventral ORs for the whole OR repertoire (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). The only exception from this pattern is found at the dorsally expressed class I ORs, which rely on different regulatory mechanisms than the canonical class II ORs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>] (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Finally, using the FACS-based strategy described earlier, we confirmed that both heterochromatic marks are predominantly deposited during the INP to iOSN transition, simultaneously with the transition from polygenic to singular, zonally appropriate OR expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, Supplementary Figure S2A). Importantly, the descending pattern of heterochromatin enrichment from dorsal to ventral OR identities is preserved throughout differentiation.</p>

<p>We then asked if the patterns of heterochromatin deposition detected in mixed OSNs from the whole MOE are preserved in distinct zones. We performed ChIP-seq in mOSNs isolated from dissected dorsal (zone 1), dorsomedial (zone 2-3) and ventral (zone 4-5) segments of the MOE. In each segment, OR genes with either the correct or more dorsal zonal identities had a higher level of heterochromatin compared to more ventral identity ORs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, Supplementary Figure S2B). Intriguingly, this is the same zonal pattern observed for OR gene transcription in INP cells. Only the OR gene identities able to be transcribed in the INP cells of a given zonal MOE segment acquire heterochromatin. Thus, most OR genes are heterochromatic in ventral OSNs; dorsal and dorsomedial identity OR genes are heterochromatic in dorsomedial OSNs; and only dorsal identity OR genes have some heterochromatin in dorsal OSNs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, Supplementary Figure S2B). Although each zonal identity OR group is heterochromatic in the MOE segment where it is expressed by mOSNs, the level of H3K9me3/H3K79me3 enrichment is lower than in more ventral segments, where it is not chosen for stable expression. Thus, dorsal identity ORs have less heterochromatin in dorsal OSNs than in the rest of the MOE, and dorsomedial identity ORs have less heterochromatin in dorsomedial OSNs than ventral OSNs. Similarly, at the ventral end of the DV axis, ventral identity ORs have less heterochromatin than dorsal and dorsomedial identity ORs. Detection of heterochromatin on OR genes with the correct zonal identity is not counterintuitive, as only one OR allele from the ones co-transcribed will be eventually chosen, and the rest must be silenced. Thus, in a pure population of ventral mOSNs expressing Olfr1507 (a ventral, zone 5 identity OR), the remaining non-chosen zone 5 identity OR genes are silenced with the same level of heterochromatin as OR genes with more dorsal zonal identities (Supplementary Figure S2C). In other words, in every MOE segment, OR heterochromatinization is preserved only for the ORs that have the potential to be expressed and is not applied to more ventral ORs, which were not transcriptionally active in INPs. This is consistent with recent reports of heterochromatin marks being detected on trace amine-associated receptor (TAAR) genes only in TAAR-expressing OSNs and not the rest of the MOE[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>].</p>

<title>DV gradient of OR gene compartmentalization follows patterns of heterochromatin assembly</title>
<p>Heterochromatic OR genes converge into multi-chromosomal genomic aggregates of extreme chromatin compaction that contributes to the effective and stable silencing of non-chosen ORs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. We thus asked if the spatially determined pattern of OR heterochromatinization at the linear genome coincides with a similar pattern of 3D genomic compartmentalization. We performed <italic>in situ</italic> Hi-C in FAC-sorted mOSNs isolated from MOE segments along the DV axis and determined the frequency with which OR genes form long range interactions in each segment. We saw a striking resemblance between deposition of heterochromatic marks on OR genes and genomic compartmentalization (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-B</xref>, Supplementary Figure S2D). For example, inspection of the long range <italic>cis</italic> genomic interactions between 3 OR gene clusters on chromosome 2 shows that a cluster of predominately ventral identity OR genes is recruited to OR compartments only in ventral OSNs, where they are heterochromatic (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, the other two OR gene clusters, which are either enriched for dorsal ORs, or have mixed constitution, make strong genomic contacts with each other in all three MOE segments (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). To expand this analysis to every OR, we measured the frequency of interchromosomal <italic>trans</italic> genomic interactions between OR genes with different DV identities. To do so, we annotated each OR gene cluster bin at 50kb resolution according to the zonal identity of the residing ORs and plotted the average interchromosomal contacts between bins of different constitution, excluding class I OR genes, which formed very few contacts with other ORs. This analysis yielded the same conclusion: Interactions between dorsal OR genes is the default in every OSN, whereas compartmentalization for the remaining of the OR repertoire increases along the DV axis of the MOE (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Intriguingly, as with levels of heterochromatin, we detect the following recurrent pattern of OR compartmentalization: every OR has intermediate Hi-C contact frequencies with other OR genes in their segment of expression in the MOE, lower Hi-C contact frequencies in more dorsal MOE segments, and higher Hi-C contacts in more ventral segments.</p>

<p>The âintermediateâ levels of heterochromatin enrichment and Hi-C contacts observed on OR genes within their segment of expression in the MOE may reflect a less compact, transcription-compatible state of heterochromatin, or less frequent silencing of these OR genes compared to more dorsal identity ORs. To distinguish between the two scenarios, we explored OR silencing at the single cell level using Dip-C, a single cell Hi-C method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. We performed Dip-C in 48 dorsal and 48 ventral mOSNs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). To retain allelic information, we used heterozygous mice from a cross between OMP-IRES-GFP (a mOSN reporter) and Castaneous (Cas) mice, and used Cas-specific SNPs to distinguish Cas from non-Cas alleles. Analyzing single cell genomic contacts, we saw a greater enrichment of contacts between OR gene loci in ventral cells relative to dorsal cells, consistent with our bulk Hi-C data (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). We then used the haplotype resolved chromatin contacts to compute distances of all genomic loci at 20kb resolution, from which we generated 3D genome structures for all cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Analyzing distances between pairs of OR loci in the 3D genome structures we determined the size and complexity of OR compartments in each cell. We confirmed that OR compartments in ventral mOSNs are larger and contain more OR genes from more chromosomes than in dorsal mOSNs (Supplementary Figure 3C). Importantly, in each cell, significantly fewer ventral identity OR genes were found in OR compartments compared to dorsal (zone 1) or dorsomedial (zone 2-3) identity OR genes (Supplementary Figure 3D). From this result we can conclude that the âstrongerâ Hi-C contacts among dorsal ORs observed in bulk, represent an increased number of dorsal ORs participating in OR compartments in each OSN. Thus, extrapolating Dip-C results to H3K9me3/H3K79me3 enrichment, we conclude that âintermediateâ silencing levels of each OR group in their own zone likely reflect less frequent silencing of these ORs than ORs with more dorsal zonal identities. In this note, OR compartmentalization is highly probabilistic, with each one of the 48 dorsal and ventral OSNs having unique maps of OR-OR genomic interactions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>, Supplementary Figure 3A, B). Thus, we propose that the balance between two probabilistic yet DV-responsive processes, early transcription and genomic silencing, may define the OR ensemble that is available for singular choice along the DV axis. To test this model, we sought to identify factors responsible for generating these remarkable patterns.</p>

<title>NFI paralogues generate DV patterns in OR expression</title>
<p>We searched our RNA-seq data for transcription factors that have strong expression during the INP to iOSN transition that is graded across the DV axis of the MOE.

<p>To interrogate the potential role of NFIA, B and X in zonal OR expression we deleted all three genes simultaneously using the Krt5-CreER driver, which is expressed in the quiescent stem cells of the MOE (HBCs). We crossed Krt5-CreER; tdTomato mice to NFIA, B, X fl/fl mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>], and induced recombination with tamoxifen. To force the quiescent HBCs to differentiate into OSNs, we ablated the MOE with methimazole and allowed 40 days for a complete restoration by the marked progeny of the NFI triple conditional knockout (cKO) or control HBCs (Supplementary Figure S4A-B), as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. RNA-seq analysis of the FAC-sorted cKO OSNs from the whole MOE revealed significant transcriptional reduction of ventral OR identities and reciprocal increase of dorsomedial ORs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast, triple NFI deletion only in mOSNs, using the OMP-IRES-Cre driver, has no measurable effects on OR expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). To determine whether the reduced transcription of ventral ORs reflects a developmental defect of ventral OSN differentiation, versus a <italic>bona fide</italic> dorsalization of ventral OSNs, we performed RNA-seq in cKO OSNs isolated specifically from ventral MOE microdissections. This experiment revealed ectopic expression of OR genes with dorsomedial zonal identities in place of the OR genes with proper ventral ones (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>), a result confirmed by immunofluorescence (IF) experiments (Supplementary Figure S4D,E). This transcriptional transformation of ventral OSNs satisfies the original criteria of homeosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>], since the overall mOSN identity is not altered by the triple NFI deletion: Only 13 out of â¼200 OSN-specific genes are significantly different between control and cKO OSNs, and 117/207 non-OR ventral markers are still expressed in the ventral-most zones, acting as independent fiducial markers for our zonal dissection (Supplementary Figure S4F). Interestingly, deletion of just one NFIA, B, and X allele had an intermediate effect, with expression of ventral-most (zone 5) ORs replaced with zone 4 ORs in ventral mOSNs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). In fact, the severity of this dorsomedial transformation depends on the total number of NFI alleles deleted, with the triple NFIA, B, X cKO mOSNs expressing predominantly zone 2 and 3 ORs, double NFIA, B cKO mOSNs expressing zone 3 and 4 ORs, and single NFIX cKO mOSNs having almost wild type expression patterns of zone 4 and 5 ORs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>, Supplementary Figure S4C).</p>

<title>Spatial transcriptomics reveals widespread homogenization and dorsalization of the MOE upon triple NFI deletion</title>
<p>To obtain a complete and unbiased understanding of the consequences of triple NFI deletion on patterns of OR expression, we deployed a spatial transcriptomic approach. Since our goal was to decipher zonal patterns of OR expression across the dorsoventral MOE axis without requirements for single cell resolution, we opted for the Visium Spatial Gene Expression workflow (10X Genomics) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>], rather than the previously described TOMO-seq approach[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. This workflow is ideal for interrogation of spatial OR expression in mOSNs, as OR mRNAs are highly abundant and readily detectable in most spatial spots that contain OSN mRNAs. For increased stringency, we only included spatial spots that include more than 2 OR genes and 3 OR transcripts. We analyzed 2 MOE sections each from an NFI ABX triple cKO and age-matched control mouse (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Expression data on OR genes were normalized and integrated across replicates (see methods). We performed PCA analysis, by which spatial spots were arranged in 5 clusters in control and cKO MOEs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Interestingly, while dimensionality reduction and unbiased clustering generated OR clusters that correspond to zonal patterns of OR expression (i.e., each cluster contains OR genes with one zonal identity) in control MOEs, only dorsal-most zone 1/class I OR genes followed this correlation in cKO MOEs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). The other 4 clusters in the cKO homogenously express dorsomedial zone 2-4 ORs, with expanded expression of zone 2 ORs in every cluster and complete loss of ventral-most zone 5 OR expression. Thus, conditional triple NFI deletion causes loss of spatial patterning for zone 2-4 OR genes and loss of expression for zone 5 OR genes, without influencing the expression of zone 1 ORs.</p>

<p>To depict the effects of triple NFI deletion on spatial patterns of OR expression, we plotted the average OR expression per spatial spot of the top 20 most highly expressed OR genes with dorsal-most (zone 1), dorsomedial (zone 2), and ventral-most (zone 5) identities. We then overlaid the corresponding values against the histological images of the control (wt) and NFI ABX cKO MOEs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). As observed in the clustering and heatmap analysis, dorsal-most zone1 OR expression is confined to the same anatomical region for both samples. However, dorsomedial zone 2 OR expression in the cKO MOE extends beyond its defined anatomical region from the control MOE, and spreads to the ventral-most zones (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). This expansion is also observed in the expression of individual zone 2 OR genes (Supplementary Figure S5A). In contrast, the top 20 zone 5 OR genes, while highly expressed in control MOEs, are almost undetectable in NFI cKO MOEs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>), consistent with our RNA-seq analysis. Olfr1507, the most highly expressed zone 5 OR, is undetectable in the cKO spatial spots (Supplementary Figure S5B), in agreement with our IF data. Finally, to obtain a more general understanding of the spatial transformations in OR expression patterning upon triple NFI deletion, we assigned a zonal identity to each spatial spot using the maximum normalized expression of all the OR genes detected within a spot (see methods). Unlike control MOEs, where spot assignment reproduces zonal anatomical positions, most spatial spots in the cKO MOEs, excluding the unchanged zone1, are assigned a zone 2 identity. Even the few spots assigned a zone 3 identity are shifted towards more ventral positions within the MOE relative to control, in a striking dorsalization and homogenization of the MOE (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>

<title>NFI gradients control patterns of OR heterochromatinization and polygenic OR transcription</title>
<p>We searched for a mechanistic explanation for the homeotic transformation of ventral OSNs in triple NFI cKO mice. Our experiments so far have identified 3 spatially responsive processes that may contribute to the dorsoventral patterning of OR gene choice: polygenic OR transcription in INPs, OR heterochromatinization and genomic compartmentalization during the INP to iOSN transition. Thus, we explored the effects of triple NFI deletion in all three processes. First, we investigated the effects of NFI deletion on OR heterochromatinization with ChIP-seq in triple NFI cKO OSNs from the ventral-most MOE segments. ChIP-seq revealed an almost complete loss of heterochromatin from ventral ORs as well as a reduction on zone 3 dorsomedial ORs in NFI cKO ventral OSNs and INPs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, Supplementary Figure S7F-G).

In contrast, dorsal ORs did not exhibit strong changes in ChIP-seq and Hi-C contacts (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A, B</xref>). Strikingly, in both processes, heterochromatin assembly and genomic compartmentalization, the patterns observed in ventral OSNs upon NFI deletion are similar to those observed in dorsomedial OSNs from the control MOEs (Supplementary Figure S6A, B).</p>

<p>Finally, we explored the effects of triple NFI deletion on the polygenic transcription of ORs in INP cells. We used a FACS-based strategy to isolate INPs from the ventral MOE followed by bulk RNA-seq as described earlier (Supplementary Figure S4A). Again, as with the results from ChIP-seq and Hi-C experiments, we detect a conversion toward the signatures observed in dorsomedial INPs, i.e., detection of only dorsal and dorsomedial ORs and depletion of ventral OR identities from the INP transcriptome (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Thus, our data reveal an unexpected correlation between OR transcription in INP cells, and two diametrically opposing gene expression outcomes in OSNs: silencing for the majority of the co-transcribed OR alleles and singular choice for one of them. We devised a genetic strategy that would test the hypothesis that polygenic OR transcription is a pre-requisite for singular OR choice.</p>

<title>Early OR transcription promotes OR gene choice in mOSNs</title>
<p>We manipulated OR transcription using a genetically modified Olfr17 allele with a tetO promoter inserted immediately downstream of its transcription start site[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. This allele enables strong transcriptional activation of Olfr17 from the endogenous genomic locus under the control of tTA (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>, Supplementary Figure S7A). Olfr17 expression is monitored by an IRES-GFP reporter inserted immediately downstream of the Olfr17 translational stop codon (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). To induce transcription of this âtetO-Olfr17â OR allele in INPs and iOSNs, we used Gng8-tTA transgenic mice. Gng8 is expressed in INPs and iOSNs, and completely shuts off in mOSNs (Supplementary Figure S7D). Consistent with the expression properties of Gng8 and previous reports[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>], we only detect GFP in the basal MOE layers of Gng8-tTA; tetO-GFP mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>), which are enriched for INP and iOSN cells. However, when we cross the same Gng8-tTA driver to tetO-Olfr17 mice, we detect widespread GFP signal in apical MOE layers, which contain predominantly mOSNs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). Since there is no tTA expression in mOSNs, we reasoned that the INP/iOSN-induced tetO-Olfr17 allele is chosen for expression by the endogenous transcriptional machinery responsible for singular OR choice. Indeed, Hi-C experiments of these OSNs revealed that Greek Islands, the intergenic OR enhancers that converge over the chosen OR allele[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], are recruited specifically to the tetO-Olfr17 allele (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>), explaining the sustained expression of this OR in mOSNs. The hallmark of OR choice is the singular and stable expression of the chosen allele. Consistent with this, cells expressing the tetO-Olfr17 allele do not express any other OR genes (Supplementary Figure S7E). Furthermore, treating tetO-Olfr17; Gng8-tTA mice with high doxycycline (200 mg/kg in food) for 35 days fails to extinguish tetO-Olfr17 expression in mOSNs (Supplementary Figure S7B,C). Together these findings support the notion that transcriptional induction of Olfr17 in INPs/iOSNs signals for the preferential choice of this OR in mOSNs.</p>

</fig>
<p>Intriguingly, transient induction of Olfr17 transcription promotes preferential choice of this OR throughout the MOE, rather than only in zone 2, where Olfr17 is normally expressed (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). In fact, the vast majority of mOSNs from zones 1 to 4 are GFP<sup>+</sup>, and only in the ventral-most zone 5 we detect a more sporadic pattern of ectopic Olfr17 choice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D, E</xref>). We hypothesized that reduced frequency of ectopic Olfr17 expression in the most ventral segment reflects the fact that heterochromatin levels and genomic compartmentalization of this dorsomedial OR allele is highest at this MOE segment (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>). This immediately suggests that the balance between transcriptional activation and heterochromatic silencing during INP to iOSN transition determines whether an OR can be chosen for singular expression. If this hypothesis is correct, then reducing Olfr17 transcription in INP/iOSN cells should preferentially prohibit ectopic Olfr17 expression in ventral MOE segments, where heterochromatic silencing is stronger. To test this, we pharmacologically manipulated tTA activity using a low level of doxycycline (1ug/ml in water) administered throughout gestation and postnatal life of the mouse (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>), which reduces but does not eliminate tTA-driven transcription. Remarkably, mice that were subjected to this doxycycline regimen continue to frequently express Olfr17 in dorsal mOSNs (zones 1-2), but not in mOSNs from more ventral MOE segments (zones 3-5) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D, E</xref>), where heterochromatin levels on this OR allele are highest (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>). Thus, we can manipulate the zonal expression of an OR allele in mOSNs, by pharmacologically modulating the frequency and levels of transcriptional activation in INP/iOSN cells.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We uncovered a mechanism by which a probabilistic transcriptional process becomes skewed towards specific outcomes, transforming the relative position of a neuron across the dorsoventral axis of the MOE into biased OR gene choice. The solution to the perplexing segmentation of the MOE into distinct and reproducible territories of OR expression may be the following: polygenic OR transcription in neuronal progenitors highlights a small group of ORs that can be chosen for singular expression later in development (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>). In each MOE segment this OR mixture includes ORs that should be expressed in mOSNs of the segment, as well as ORs that are only expressed in more dorsal MOE segments (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>). As these progenitor cells differentiate into iOSNs, heterochromatic silencing may preferentially decommission from this mixture more dorsal ORs, and with lower efficiency, ORs that could be expressed in the segment, biasing this singular choice towards a spatially appropriate OR repertoire (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>). Our scRNA-seq analysis revealed two vectors in the determination of the OR ensemble that is co-transcribed in each OSN progenitor: chance, as every OR combination is unique, and determinism, as the overall zonal identities of the co-transcribed OR mixtures are informed by the position of the progenitor cell. Similarly, analysis of OR gene compartments with Hi-C revealed that genomic silencing also follows skewed patterns, eliminating preferentially ORs with more dorsal expression signatures than ORs that could be expressed in each zone, while Dip-C suggests that OR compartmentalization also retains an element of skewed randomness. The final product of these opposing probabilistic ârheostatsâ may be the generation of gene expression programs that do not have sufficient resolution to determine which OR will be chosen in every OSN but are precise enough to generate reproducible expression territories for each one of the â¼1400 OR genes. Recent reports describing opposing effects of chromatin compaction and transcriptional activation in the probabilistic expression patterns of the Spineless gene in R7 photoreceptors argue for the generality of this regulatory principle in vertebrates and invertebrates[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>].</p>
<p>We identified gradients of transcription factors NFI A, B, and X as partial orchestrators of the dorsoventral patterning of OR expression, which they establish as follows: they contribute to the silencing of some dorsomedial (primarily zone 3) ORs; they activate both polygenic transcription and silencing of ventral (zone 4 and 5) ORs; and they have no influence on the expression of dorsal-most (class I and zone 1) ORs. Without NFI transcription factors, the majority of the MOE, excluding dorsal-most zone1, defaults to a zone 2 identity. Given that NFI factors are predominantly known as regulators of embryonic and adult stem cell biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>], it is surprising that in the olfactory system their deletion does not interfere with the maintenance of stem cell populations, but with the OR expression patterns in post-mitotic, fully differentiated mOSNs. Interestingly, triple NFI deletion after the onset of singular OR choice has no effect in OR patterning, consistent with the emerging model that OR specification takes place exclusively at the INP to iOSN transition, and the notion that these patterning factors are not required for maintenance of OR transcription. Thus, we speculate that singular OR gene choice in OSNs can be executed by the common nucleoprotein complex of Lhx2/Ebf/Ldb1 bound to the multi-enhancer hub, consistent with the fact that we detect hubs of similar constitution associating with active ORs in different zones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>].</p>
<p>A question emerging from these observations is why not use the same transcription factor gradients to regulate both polygenic and monogenic OR transcription? The answer is likely related to the absolute requirement for transcriptional singularity: transcription factor gradients can transcribe specific OR mixtures in a DV-responsive fashion, but they cannot activate only a single OR promoter among the many they can bind to. But even if singularity was achievable by transcription factor combinations and the OR-elicited feedback, OR promoters with the strongest binding motifs would be consistently chosen first, excluding ORs with weaker promoters in a âwinner takes allâ model. This would result in preferential choice of specific ORs, reduced diversity in OR representation, and a narrower sensory spectrum for the olfactory system. With the process revealed here, any OR promoter activated in INPs/iOSNs is probabilistically chosen for singular expression in OSNs. Thus, by segregating OR gene regulation into two stages, polygenic transcription in progenitor cells and singular choice in OSNs, the olfactory system can impose deterministic biases while assuring equitable receptor representation. Of course, this system has limitations in preserving transcriptional equity: artificial transcriptional induction of an OR allele in OSN progenitors under the powerful tetO promoter bypasses these constraints and results in biased choice of this allele in most mOSNs. This immediately suggests that <italic>cis</italic> OR regulatory elements are subject to selective pressure that preserves their weak transcriptional activation properties, explaining why robust OR transcription in mOSNs requires assembly of interchromosomal multi-enhancer hubs.</p>
<p>In this note, zones may also have evolved to satisfy the requirement for distributed OR representation: if dorsal-most ORs, which are detected in every OSN progenitor regardless of DV origin, have the most frequently activated promoters, then silencing them in more ventral MOE segments assures that other OR identities will also have the chance to be expressed. Consistent with this model is the observation that mutations on the Lhx2 or Ebf binding sites of the promoter of dorsal OR M71 result in less frequent and more ventral M71 expression patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. Thus, DV segmentation of the MOE may serve as a mechanism that prevents ORs with stronger differences in promoter strength from competing for singular expression, assuring that every OR is expressed at meaningful, for odor perception, frequencies. In addition, as our spatial transcriptomic data showed, zonal regulation assures that ORs are expressed in a reproducibly patterned fashion in the MOE. While in wild type mice unbiased machine learning approaches identify at least 5 distinct OR expression patterns, in the triple NFI cKO mice these patterns become intermixed for all but zone 1 ORs. With recent observations arguing that individual mitral cells, the second order neurons in the olfactory circuit, have patterned projections in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>], non-random OR expression in the MOE may contribute to putative hardwired components of odor perception and valence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>].</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Polygenic OR transcription as the arbiter between OR gene silencing and OR gene choice</title>
<p>A peculiar feature of the OR gene family that had emerged from our past work is that OR gene silencing is highest in the very cells that express ORs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Our zonal analysis further strengthened this intriguing correlation, as both H3K9me3/H3K79me3 and genomic compartmentalization in each MOE segment are strongest on OR groups that are transcriptionally active during OSN differentiation. A fascinating implication of this observation is that early OR transcription is the signal for both genomic silencing and singular choice. Although the former is only implied by the strong correlation between OR transcription in OSN progenitors and genomic silencing, the latter is experimentally supported by the striking observation that strong transcriptional induction of Olfr17 at the INP/iOSN stage results in strong recruitment of the Greek Island hub, and stable choice of this OR allele in most mOSNs throughout the MOE. Such a mechanism of promoter choice influenced by spatially-determined early transcription could also explain the recent demonstration that clustered Pcdh choice, which is regulated by anti-sense transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>], abides by spatial restrictions in the neocortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>].</p>
<p>How could two fundamentally opposite gene expression outcomes be encoded on the same molecular feature? We propose that the timing and levels of transcriptional induction could be the arbiters between genomic silencing and singular choice. ORs that are transcribed first in the INP stage, when the Greek Island hub cannot yet form due to the continuous expression of Lamin b receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>], are most likely to be silenced. OR alleles activated during the assembly of the multi-enhancer hub, at the INP to iOSN transition, may compete for hub recruitment. The OR allele that will first associate with a multi-enhancer hub will be stably protected from heterochromatic silencing, possibly due to the significantly increased rates of OR transcription, whereas the other co-transcribed ORs will succumb to heterochromatic silencing. If timing and rates of OR transcription determine whether an OR allele will be silenced or chosen, then an OR allele that is highly transcribed in both INP and iOSN stage should evade silencing and dominate the competition for hub recruitment, explaining the striking expression pattern of the tTA-induced Olfr17 allele. Thus, according to this model, in each OSN ORs with more dorsal identity will be transcribed first, because they have stronger promoters, and therefore will become silenced in higher frequency; ORs with the correct zonal identity will be transcribed later, with a chance to associate with the Greek Island hub, explaining why one is chosen and the rest are silenced; ORs with more ventral identities will not be transcribed at all, thus, will not be silenced but also will not be chosen. In other words, singular OR transcription may not depend on the silencing of every single OR in the genome: by encoding silencing and stable choice with the same exact molecular feature, OSNs choose one and silence a small fraction of the whole OR repertoire in each nucleusâthe rest are not relevant. Notably, this constitutes a refinement of our original model, which proposed that all but one OR alleles become silenced in each OSN[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Without knowledge of the zonal identity of most ORs, and without the technical ability to perform Hi-C and ChIP-seq on micro-dissected MOE zones, the striking patterns of gradual increase of OR silencing along the D-V axis of the MOE were not appreciated. As the cellular and temporal resolution of our genome wide approaches increases, the aforementioned model will be further refined.</p>

<title>Limitations of this study</title>
<p>Our experiments did not clarify whether NFI proteins bind directly on OR promoters, or act indirectly by activating other transcription factors and chromatin modifying enzymes. Although there is a statistically significant enrichment of NFI motifs on zone 4/5 OR promoters compared to the other OR promoters (data not shown), we were not able to detect direct binding of NFI proteins on these promoters, which is expected since these promoters are active in less than 1% of the cells. Given that our studies provide the mechanism by which NFI gradients establish zonal boundaries, via polygenic OR transcription and chromatin-mediated silencing, answering this question is not essential for understanding the mechanism of dorsoventral patterning of OR expression. A second limitation of this study is that it did not reveal the mechanisms that regulate the expression of the dorsal-most ORs (zone 1 ORs), as NFI deletion had no effects on the expression and chromatin regulation of these OR genes. However, having revealed the regulatory logic whereby these patterns are established, we expect that other transcription factors with zonal expression patterns identified here regulate early transcription and silencing of these genes across the MOE.</p>

<p>(A) Normalized expression per spatial spot of the zone 2 identity OR genes Olfr309 and Olfr17 overlaid against histological H&amp;E tissue image of wt control and NFI ABX knockout MOE. Olfr309 is the highest expressed zone2 OR gene in the control dataset. Expression of Olfr309 and Olfr17 in the NFI ABX knockout sample spreads to more ventral areas of the MOE compared to the control.</p>
<p>(B) Normalized expression per spatial spot of Olfr1507, the most highly expressed zone 5 OR gene in the control MOE dataset. As expected, Olfr1507 is expressed in the ventral zone 5 anatomical region in the control MOE, while its expression is almost completely absent in the NFI ABX knockout MOE.</p>

<p><bold>(A)</bold> Schematic showing that the tetO promoter and the IRES-GFP tag have been inserted in the endogenous Olfr17 gene locus on Chromosome 7 (top). Olfr17 (green) resides in a large OR gene cluster surrounded by other OR genes (shown in black). Early induction of this âtetO-Olfr17â allele in olfactory progenitors with the Gng8-tTA driver results in sustained, tTA-independent, expression in mature OSNs. GFP signal from induced tetO-Olfr17 expression persists in most OSNs after 35 days in high doxycycline diet (B,C).</p>
<p><bold>(B-C)</bold> Schematic of the high doxycycline feeding protocol used to inhibit the tTA and thereby confirm tTA-independent tetO-Olfr17 expression in mOSNs (B). After adult (&gt; 8 weeks old) tetO-Olf17 with Gng8-tTA mice were placed in high DOX diet for 35 days their OSNs continued to express GFP (C), excluding the possibility that tTA traces could support tetO-Olfr17 transcription. Note the distinction from the low DOX treatment described in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>, where mice were exposed <italic>in utero</italic> to doxycycline and never had a chance to induce tetO-Olfr17 expression at high levels.</p>
<p><bold>(D)</bold> Feature plot showing of Gng8 expression in single cell RNA-seq from sorted cells in the MOE (as described in Supplementary Figure S1).

<title>Experimental model and subject details</title>
<p>Mice were treated in compliance with the rules and regulations of IACUC under protocol number AC-AAAT2450 and AC-AABG6553. Mice were sacrificed using CO<sub>2</sub> following cervical dislocation. A complete list of mouse genotypes used for every experiment is in the Supplementary Table 2. Mash1-CreER (also known as Ascl1<sup>CreERT2</sup>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]; Ngn1-GFP[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>] and Cre inducible tdTomato reporter (also known as <italic>B6N.129S6-Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm1(CAG-tdTomato*,-EGFP*)Ees/J</sup></italic>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>] mice were used to isolate four cell types in the olfactory lineage (GBC: tdTomato+ GFP-, INP: tdTomato+ GFP+, iOSN: tdTomato-GFP+ (bright), and mOSN: tdTomato+ GFP dim) by sorting cells 48 hours after tamoxifen injection. We used young pups ranging from P2 to P4 at the start of the tamoxifen injection. GFP bright and dim cells from Ngn1-GFP pups (P6) were also used to isolate a mix of INP/iOSN cells and mOSN cells respectively. OMP-IRES-GFP[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] mice were used to isolate mature OSNs from adult (&gt; 8-week-old) mice. In order to obtain zonal iOSNs and mOSNs, Olfr1507-IRES-Cre[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] and tdTomato alleles were crossed in with either Ngn1-GFP or OMP-IRES-GFP alleles to aid in zonal dissection (by labeling Ollfr1507+ expressing cells in zone5).</p>
<p>Early knockout of NFI A, B, and X (NFI ABX) in horizontal basal cells (HBSs: the stem cell of the olfactory epithelium) was achieved by crossing NFIA fl/fl NFIB fl/fl and NFIX fl/fl triple conditional alleles, described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>], with Krt5-CreER[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>] and tdTomato. Adult mice (&gt; 8-week-old) had deletion of NFI ABX in horizontal basal cells induced with 3 intraperitoneal injections with tamoxifen (24 hours apart). Ten days after the first injection, the olfactory epithelium was ablated with one intraperitoneal injection of methimazole, inducing proliferation of the HBCs and regeneration of a NFI ABX knockout olfactory epithelium. The olfactory epithelium was allowed to regenerate for 40 days before collecting the MOE and FAC-sorting the tdTomato+(dim) cell population, which contains a mixture of mostly mOSNs and some INP and iOSN cells, as described in detail in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. For some experiments OMP-IRES-GFP was crossed in to ensure all cells collected were mOSNs. To collect knockout INP cells the olfactory epithelium was only allowed to regenerate for 8-10 days before collecting the MOE and FAC-sorting the tdTomato+(dim) cells. We allowed the MOE to regenerate for 8 days for the RNA-seq experiments and 10 days for the native ChIP experiments, as heterochromatin deposition was still too low after 8 days to meaningfully analyze the pattern, although it followed the same trend as on day 10 (data not shown). As controls for all experiments (including RNA-seq, native ChIP-seq, Hi-C, imaging and spatial transcriptomics) involving early knockout of NFI ABX we used Krt5-CreER; tdTomato mice (in some cases with OMP-IRES-GFP). These control animals were age and sex matched and underwent the same tamoxifen induction and methimazole ablation as the knockout animals. Late knockout of NFI ABX in mOSNs was achieved by crossing NFIA, B, and X triple conditional alleles with tdTomato and OMP-IRES-Cre, and FAC-sorting tdTomato+ cells from adult mice. Age and sex matched OMP-IRES-Cre; tdTomato mice were used as controls for the late NFI ABX knockout experiments. A complete list of all the mouse genotypes can be found in Supplementary Table 2.</p>
<p>Induction of Olfr17 was achieved by crossing tetO-Olfr17-IRES-GFP mice[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>] with Gng8-tTA mice[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. To assess stability of tetO-Olfr17 expression after induction, adult mice &gt;8 weeks were placed on a diet containing high doxycyclineâ200mg/kg (Bio Serv, S3888)âfor 35 days. To achieve a lower level of tetO-Olfr17 induction, tetO-Olfr17 mice were crossed with Gng8-tTA mice while being kept on a low amount of doxycycline in waterâ 1ug/ml (Sigma Aldrich, D9891)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>] Mice were kept on doxycycline water throughout gestation and postnatal life, until collecting the MOE for analysis from mice &gt; 6 weeks old. A concentration of doxycycline in water at 5ug/ml produced a similar pattern of expression as 1ug/ml, albeit with fewer cells choosing tetO-Olfr17; and a concentration of 50ug/ml and greater fully suppressed all tetO-Olfr17 induction (data not shown).</p>

<title>Zonal OR gene annotation</title>
<p>OR genes were assigned a zonal annotation (referring to their native zone of expression) based on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. We generated bins from the continuous data by rounding to the nearest integer. There are a total of 1011 ORs with known zonal annotation. Of these, 115 are Class I ORs, of which nearly all are expressed in zone1, and 896 are Class II ORs, of which 261 are expressed in zone1, 283 in zone2, 164 in zone3, 144 in zone4 and 44 in zone5. To have accurate mapping of OR promoters and gene bodies in all high throughput analysis we used the OR transcriptome generated by Ibarra-Soria et al[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>].</p>

<title>Zonal dissection of the olfactory epithelium</title>
<p>We used the fluorescent signal in Olfr545-delete-YFP[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>] (zone 1 OR), Olfr17-IRES-GFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>](zone 2 OR), and Olfr1507-IRES-GFP[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] (zone 5 OR) mice to practice dissections of dorsal (zones 1) MOE, dorsomedial (zone 2-3) MOE, and ventral (zone 4-5) MOE, respectively. Upon obtaining an accurate understanding of the zonal boundaries in the MOE we performed zonal dissections without the use of these fiduciary markers. Accuracy of dissections was confirmed by RNA-seq. For some experiments Olfr1507-IRES-Cre and tdTomato reporter was crossed in to assist with accurate ventral MOE dissection (see Table 2.)</p>

<title>Fluorescence-activated cell sorting</title>
<p>Cells were prepared for FAC-sorting as previously described in[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>] by dissociating olfactory epithelium tissue with papain for 40 minutes at 37Â°C according to the Worthington Papain Dissociation System. Cells were washed 2x with cold PBS before passing through a 40-um strainer. Live (DAPI-negative) fluorescent cells were collected for RNA-seq and native ChIP-seq. Alternatively, for Hi-C cells were fixed for 10 minutes in 1% formaldehyde in PBS at room temperature, quenched with glycine, and washed with cold PBS before sorting fluorescent cells. Alternatively, for Dip-C, cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 10 minutes, inactivated with 1% BSA, and washed with cold 1% BSA in PBS before sorting fluorescent cells. All cells were sorted on a BD Aria II.</p>

<title>Single cell RNA-seq in olfactory lineage cell types</title>
<p>Mash1-CreER; tdTomato; Ngn1-GFP pups (ages P2-P4) were injected with tamoxifen and olfactory epithelium was collected after 48 hours. The tissue was dissected into ventral (zone 3-5) and dorsal OE (zone1-2) sections, from which GBC (tdTomato+, GFP-), INP (tdTomato+, GFP+), iOSN (tdTomato-, GFP+ bright) and mOSN (tdTomato-, GFP dim) cells were sorted into 384 well plates (split between the cell types). Each well of the 384 well plate had unique cell and molecular barcodes. Library preparation and sequencing was performed in collaboration with the New York Genome Center (NYGC) using a TSO approach for library preparation and sequenced on HiSeq2500. Reads were aligned to the mm10 genome according to the Drop-seq[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>] pipeline (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mccarrolllab.org/dropseq/">http://mccarrolllab.org/dropseq/</ext-link>), which uses STAR for alignment, and discarding multi mapped reads with Samtools -q 255. Aligned single cells had a median of 133,686 unique transcripts (UMIs) and 2,331 genes per cell (detected with a threshold of at least 3UMI). Experiment was performed in biological replicate, resulting in 764 cells, from which we discarded cells with less than 1000 genes and 20,000 UMIs, resulting in 669 cells. We further filtered for cells that contained less than 5% mitochondrial reads, resulting in 591 cells used for analysis. We used Seurat v3 to normalize counts and cluster single cells, resulting in 6 populations. Clusters were assigned a cell-type based on expression of known olfactory lineage markers. We used the default setting of genes expressed in at least 3 cells for clustering but changed it to 1 when looking at OR expression (since expression of any OR out of &gt; 1000 genes is a rare event). For all OR expression analysis, we used a threshold of 3UMI for an OR to be considered expressed.</p>

<title>Bulk RNA-seq in olfactory lineage cell types</title>
<p>GBC, INP, iOSN and mOSN were isolated from Mash1-CreER; tdTomato; Ngn1-GFP pups as described above with the tissue being dissected into a ventral (mostly zone 4-5), dorsal OE (mostly zone1) and a central section (that is enriched for zone2-3). The experiment was performed in biological replicate. RNA was extracted from FAC-sorted cells using Trizol and libraries were prepared with Nugen NuQuant RNA-seq library system and sequenced 50PE on HiSeq2500 or 75PE NextSeq (and trimmed to 50bp before aligning). Cutadapt was used to remove adapter sequences and reads were aligned to the mm10 genome with STAR. Samtools was used to select high mapping quality reads (-q 30). Normalization, calculation of FPKM (which we converted to TMP), and differential expression analysis was performed in R with DEseq2. For all RNA-seq data p-values refer to adjusted p-value (padj) calculated in DEseq2.</p>
<p>To find zone5 enriched transcription factors at each developmental stage we determined significantly differentially expressed transcription factors (from the Gene Ontology database annotation âDNA binding transcription factor activityâ) between ventral and dorsal cells with a padj less than 0.05 and at least a twofold change in expression (see Supplementary Table 1.) To get the most likely candidates driving zonal identity we further filtered the list for TFs with at least a 3-fold difference between dorsal and ventral cells, and an expression level of at least 15 TPM).</p>

<title>Zonal vs non-zonal mOSN markers from olfactory lineage RNA-seq data</title>
<p>To find ventrally enriched mOSN markers, we looked at non-OR genes differentially expressed between ventral mOSNs and dorsal or dorsomedial mOSNs (tomato-, GFP dim cells) with padj less than 0.05, and at least a two-fold change in expression, of which there were 208; and performed the inverse analysis to generate a list of dorsal or dorsomedial enriched mOSN markers, of which there were 141 genes. To find non-zonal mOSN markers, we made a list of significantly upregulated genes (with a padj less than 0.05, and a fold change greater two) in mOSNs (tomato-, GFP dim cells) across all zones compared to iOSNs (tomato-, GFP+ bright cells) across all zones. We further filtered out genes that were significantly differentially expressed between ventral and dorsal or dorsomedial mOSNs and took the top 200 most significant genes.</p>

<sec id="s6g">
<title>RNA-seq in ventral NFI knockout mOSNs</title>
<p>To look at gene expression changes resulting from NFI deletion in olfactory progenitors we used NFI triple knockout (NFI A,B,X fl/fl, tdTomato, OMP-gfp, Krt5-CreER), AB only double knockout (NFI A,B fl/fl, tdTomato, OMP-gfp, Krt5-CreER), X only knockout (NFI X fl/fl, tdTomato, OMP-gfp, Krt5-CreER) or wt (tdTomato, OMP-gfp, Krt5-CreER) mice and followed the induction protocol for early knockout, described above. After rebuilding the MOE from knockout progenitors, we dissected ventral (zone5) MOE and FAC-sorted GFP+ mOSNs. RNA was extracted from sorted cells using Trizol and RNA-seq libraries were prepared with Nugen Nuquant RNA-seq library prep kit and sequenced 75PE on Nextseq 550. Reads were aligned exactly as described for zonal olfactory lineage data and similarly DEseq2 was used to determine differentially expressed genes between the different knockout and wt cells. To determine if ventral mOSN, dorsal mOSN and non-zonal mOSN markers change in ventral NFI knockout cells, we analyzed the expression differences of the genes in our marker lists.</p>

<title>Spatial Transcriptomics</title>
<p>Whole MOE from NFI ABX knockout (using the Krt5-CreER) and wt control mice (two mice for each genotype) were embedded in OCT and frozen on dry ice. 14Âµm cryosections of tissue were mounted onto Visium Spatial Gene Expression slides (10X Genomics) and kept at -80Â°C prior to processing. Tissue sections were fixed in methanol, stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin y, and imaged using a Nikon Eclipse Ti2 inverted microscope. Barcoded cDNA libraries of tissue sections were generated using the Spatial Gene Expression Reagent Kit (10X Genomics) according to the manufactureâs protocols. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq instrument at the University of Chicago Genomics Core with the following runtype: 28 cycles (Read 1); 10 cycles (i7 index); 10 cycles (i5 index); 120 cycles (Read 2). Data were demultiplexed and processed using SpaceRanger v1.1.0. Reads were aligned to the mm10 2020-A reference mouse transcriptome (10X Genomics) and the OR transcriptome generated by Ibarra-Soria et al[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>]. After confirming similarity between the two biological replicates, we did an additional round of sequencing of libraries from 2 sections from each an NFI ABX knockout and wt control mouse to obtain deep data sets used for analysis of OR gene expression.</p>

<title>Spatial Transcriptomics analysis</title>
<p>Analysis was performed in R using STUtility[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]. Spatial spots expressing fewer than 2 OR genes and 3 OR transcripts were removed prior to analysis. Expression data across replicate sections were normalized using SCTransform, filtered to include only OR genes, and integrated using Harmony[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>]. PCA was performed using the first 5 principal components and spatial spots were grouped into 5 clusters for both NFI ABX knockout and wt samples. Heatmaps were generated using the top 20 highest expressed DEGs within each zone (Class I through zone 5) for the wt sample and kept the same for the heatmap of the NFI ABX knockout. The same top 20 DEGs for zone 1, zone 2, and zone 5 were averaged per spot and overlaid against the H&amp;E histology image (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5 C</xref>). For zonal spot assignment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5 D</xref>), spots were designated to the zone with the largest summed normalized counts for all genes in that zone.</p>

<title>Native chromatin immunoprecipitation from FAC-sorted cells</title>
<p>Native chip was performed as described in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Unless otherwise indicated all steps were carried out at 4Â°C. Briefly, FAC-sorted cells were pelleted at 600 rcf for 10 minutes in a swinging bucket centrifuge at 4Â°C and resuspended in cold Buffer I (0.3M Sucrose, 60 mM KCl, 15 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM EGTA, 15 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.1 mM PMSF, 0.5 mM DTT, 1x protease inhibitors). Cells were lysed by adding equal volume cold BufferII (Buffer I with 0.4% NP40) and incubating for 10 minutes on ice. Nuclei were pelleted 10 min at 1000 rcf and resuspended in 250ul cold MNase buffer (0.32M Sucrose, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.1 mM PMSF, 1x protease inhibitors). Micrococcal Nuclease digestion was carried out by adding 0.1U Micrococcal Nuclease (Sigma) per 100ul buffer and incubating for 1 min 40 sec in a 37Â°C water bath, then stopping the digestion by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 20mM. The first soluble chromatin fraction (S1) was collected by pelleting nuclei 10 min at 10,000 rcf at 4Â°C and taking the supernatant to store at 4Â°C overnight. Undigested, pelleted material was resuspended in 250ul cold Dialysis Buffer (1 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM PMSF, 1x protease inhibitors) and rotating overnight at 4Â°C. The second soluble chromatin fraction (S2) was collected by pelleting insoluble material 10 min at 10,000 rcf at 4Â°C and taking the supernatant. S1 and S2 chromatin fractions were combined and used for immunoprecipitation with 5% material being retained for input. Equal cell numbers were used for control and knockout IPs, or between different cell types or zones. To perform immunoprecipitation (IP), chromatin was diluted to 1ml in Wash Buffer1 (50mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 125 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, 5 mM 1x protease inhibitors) and rotated overnight at 4Â°C with 1ug antibody. Dynabeads (10ul Protein A and 10ul Protein G per IP) were blocked overnight with 2 mg/ml yeast tRNA and 2 mg/mL BSA in Wash Buffer 1. Blocked beads were washed once with Wash Buffer 1, then added to antibody bound chromatin and rotated 2-3 hours at 4Â°C. Chromatin bound beads were washed 4x with Wash Buffer1, 3x with Wash Buffer 2 (50mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 175 mM NaCl, 0.1% NP40, 1x protease inhibitors), and 1x in TE pH 7.5. IPâd DNA was eluted by resuspending beads in 100 uL Native ChIP Elution Buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 0.1 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) in a thermomixer set to 37Â°C and 900 rpm for 15 minutes, repeating the elution 2x and combining the eluates. IPs and inputs (diluted to 200ul in elution buffer) were cleaned up with Zymo ChIP DNA columns (Zymo Research, D5205). Libraries were prepared with NuGEN Ovation V2 DNA-Seq Library Preparation Kit, and sequenced 50PE on HiSeq2500 and or 75PE on NextSeq 550.</p>

<title>Native ChIP-seq analysis</title>
<p>Sequenced reads were pre-processed by trimming adapters with Cutadapt, then aligned to the mm10 genome using Bowtie2, with default setting except for maximum insert size set to 1000 (-X 1000), allowing larger fragments to be mapped. Duplicate reads were removed with Picard, and high mapping quality reads were selected with Samtools (-q 30). After confirming the nChIP replicates looked similar, they were merged with HOMER and used to generate signal tracks at 1bp resolution normalized to a library size of 10,000,000 reads. Thus, one of three replicates of H3K79me3 native ChIP-seq in zonal mOSNs was excluded for poor signal to noise ratio. Signal density over OR genes was calculated with HOMER annotatePeaks.pl then normalized to the length of each OR gene. Native ChIP heatmaps were generated with deeptools with OR gene bodies re-scaled to 6kb and showing 2kb flanking on each side.</p>

Nuclei were then digested with DpnII (6U/ul) in 1Ã DpnII buffer overnight at 37 Â°C. In the morning, nuclei were pelleted at 2,500<italic>g</italic> for 5 min and buffers and fresh DpnII enzyme were replenished to their original concentration and nuclei were digested for 2 additional hours. Restriction enzyme was inactivated by incubating 20 minutes at 62 Â°C. Digested ends were filled in for 1.5 hours at 37 Â°C using biotinylated dGTP. Ligation was performed for 4h at room temperature with rotation. Nuclei were pelleted and sonicated in 10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 0.25% SDS on a Covaris S220 (16 minutes, 2% duty cycle, 105 intensity, Power 1.8-1.85 W, 200 cycles per burst, max temperature 6Â°C). DNA was reverse crosslinked with RNAseA and Proteinase K overnight at 65 Â°C then purified with 2Ã Ampure beads following the standard protocol and eluted in water. Biotinylated fragments were enriched with Dynabeads MyOne Strepavidin T1 beads and on bead library preparation was carried out with NuGEN Ovation V2 DNA-Seq Library Preparation Kit, with some modifications: instead of heat inactivation following end repair beads were washed 2x for 2 min at 55 Â°C with Tween Washing Buffer (TWB)(0.05% Tween, 1 M NaCl in TE pH 7.5) and 2x with 10 mM Tris pH 7.5 to remove excess detergent. After ligation of adapters beads were washed 5x with TWB and 2x with 10 mM Tris pH 7.5. Libraries were amplified for 10 cycles and cleaned up with 0.8V Ampure beads. Each experiment was performed with two biological replicates and prepared Hi-C libraries were sequenced 75PE on NextSeq 500.</p>

<title>In situ Hi-C analysis</title>
<p>Reads were aligned to the mm10 genome using the distiller pipeline (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/mirnylab/distiller-nf">https://github.com/mirnylab/distiller-nf</ext-link>), uniquely mapped reads (mapq &gt; 30) were retained and duplicate reads discarded. Contacts were then binned into matrices using cooler. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>]. Analysis was performed on data pooled from two biological replicates, after confirming that the results of analysis of individual replicates were similar. Hi-C contact maps of OR clusters on chromosome 2 were generated with raw counts of Hi-C contacts normalized to counts/billion at 100kb resolution. The maximum value on the color scale was set to 150 contacts per 100kb bin. Analysis of zonal OR gene cluster contacts was performed normalized counts binned at 50kb resolution. All analyses were repeated using balanced counts generated by cooler (-mad-max 7), with similar results except balanced matrices discarded almost 10% of OR cluster bins due to relatively poor sequencing coverage.</p>

<title>Dip-C</title>
<p>To isolate mature olfactory sensory neurons (mOSNs), Castaneous (Cas) mice were crossed to OMP-IRES-GPF mice. MOE was collected from adult heterozygous mice resulting from this cross. The tissue was dissected into zone 1 and zone4/5, fixed for 10 minutes in 2% formaldehyde and FAC-sorted to isolate GFP+ mOSNs. Dip-C was performed as described[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>] on 96 mature OSNs: 48 each from dorsal and ventral MOE. Briefly, cells were lysed in Hi-C Lysis Buffer (10mM Tris pH8, 10mM NaCl, 0.2% NP40, 1x protease inhibitors) on ice for 15 minutes, nuclei were pelleted at 2500 rcf for 5 min at 4Â°C, then resuspended in 0.5% SDS and permeabilized 10 minutes at 62 Â°C then quenched in 1.1% Triton X-100 15min at 37 Â°C. Nuclei were digested in 1x DpnII buffer and 6U/ul DpnII enzyme and digested overnight at 37Â°C. Nuclei were then washed once in Ligation Buffer, and resuspended in Ligation buffer with 10U T4 DNA Ligase (Life Tech), and incubated for 4 hours at 16oC shaking at 600rpm. After ligation nuclei were pelleted and resuspended in cold PBS with DAPI to a final concentration of 300nM and GFP+ cells were FAC-sorted into a 96 well plate with 2ul lysis buffer (20mM Tris pH 8, 20mM NaCl, 0.15% Triton X-100, 25mM DTT, 1mM EDTA, 500nM Carrier ssDNA, and 15ug/mL Qiagen Protease) and lysed for 1 hour at 50Â°C and inactivated 15 minutes at 70Â°C. DNA was transposed by adding 8ul transposition buffer (12.5 mM TAPS pH 8.5, 6.25mM MgCl2, 10% PEG 8000) with â¼0.0125 uLTn5 (Vanzyme) and incubated at 55Â°C for 10 min, then stopped with transposome removal buffer (300nM NaCl, 45 mM EDTA, 0.01% Triton X-100 with 100ug/mL Qiagen Protease) and incubated at 50Â°C for 40 minutes and 70Â°C for 20 minutes. Libraries were amplified 14 cycles with i5 and i7 Nextera primers, with unique barcodes for each cell. Libraries from all cells were pooled and cleaned up with Zymo DNA Clean and Concentrate Kit. Libraries were sequenced 150PE on NextSeq 550.</p>

<title>Dip-C analysis</title>
<p>Sequenced Dip-C reads were processed according to the Dip-C pipeline (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/tanlongzhi/dip-c">https://github.com/tanlongzhi/dip-c</ext-link>). Reads were aligned to mm10 with BWA mem, and hickit was used to determine the haplotype of each contact based on SNPs between Cas and OMP-IRES-GFP mice and make a model of the 3D genome. Since OMP-IRES-GFP mice were a mixture of Bl6/129 strains, we only included SNPs that were unique to Cas mice to distinguish homologs. After alignment, cells were filtered using several quality control metrics described in Tan et al. 2019: We excluded cells that had less than 20,000 reads, cells that had a low contact-to-read ratio, and cells that had a high variability in 3D structure across computational replicates. Only 4 of 96 cells failed these metrics. Overall, the median number of contacts across cells was over 400,000. Computational analysis OR genes and Greek Island enhancers, including computing average contact densities and analysis of the 3D models, was performed using the Dip-C pipeline. Average contact densities between OR genes were calculated with âdip-c ardâ. Pairwise distances between OR genes from the 3D models were extracted with âdip-c pdâ. Heatmaps of pairwise distance were either ordered by genomic position or reordered using hierarchical clustering. To determine the size of OR gene aggregates, the number of OR genes within a specified radius of was calculated with ânetwork_around.pyâ. 3D models were visualized with PyMol and used to generate slices of the nucleus.</p>

<p>Mature mammalian olfactory sensory neurons (OSN) express only one of the hundreds of possible odor receptors (ORs) encoded in the genome. The process of selecting this OR in each OSN is the consequence of both deterministic developmental processes involving transcription factors, and more stochastic processes. How this balance is implemented is a major problem in molecular neuroscience, one whose solution has significant systems-level implications for odor coding. In Bashkirova et al the authors substantially revise the canonical view of how this process works. By querying single cell transcriptomes and genetic architecture across OSN development, the authors demonstrate that OSN progenitors express ORs for their zone and for more dortsal zones, and that the degree of heterochromatinization of non-expressed ORs varies as a function of which zone a given OSN resides in. Through additional genetic experiments (including knockouts of transcription factors that seem to be associated with zonal identity, and the clever use of OR transgenes) they synthesize these findings into a model in which progenitors co-express many ORs - both ORs that are appropriate for their zone and ORs that are dorsal to their zone - and that this expression both facilitates heterochromatinzation of non-selected and extra-zonal ORs, and enables singular OR selection. The experiments are careful and the data are novel, and definitely revise our simplistic current view of how this process works; as such this work will have significant impact on the field. As presented the model requires additional experiments to fully flesh it out, and to definitively demonstrate that i.e., precocious expression leads to gene silencing, but with some additional clarifications in the discussion this paper both breaks new ground and sets the stage for future work exploring mechanisms of OSN development and OR selection.</p>

<p>In this study, Bashkirova et al. analyzed how the gene choice of olfactory receptors (ORs) is regulated in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) during development. In the mouse olfactory system, there are more than 1000 functional OR genes and several hundred pseudogenes. It is well-established that each individual OSN expresses only one functional OR gene in a mono-allelic manner. This is referred to as the one neuron - one receptor rule. It is also known that OR gene choice is not entirely stochastic but restricted to a particular area or zone in the olfactory epithelium (OE) along the dorsoventral axis. It is interesting to study how this stochastic but biased gene-choice is regulated during OSN development, narrowing down the number of OR genes to be chosen to eventually achieve the monogenic OR expression in OSNs.</p>
<p>In the present study, the authors cell-sorted OSNs into three groups; immediate neuronal precursors (INPs), immature OSNs (iOSNs), and mature OSNs (mOSNs). They found that OR gene choice is differentially regulated positively by transcription factors in INPs and negatively by heterochromatin-mediated OR gene silencing in iOSNs. The authors propose that by the combination of two opposing forces of polygenic transcription (positive) and genomic silencing (negative), each OSN finally expresses only one OR gene out of over 2000 alleles in a stochastic but stereotypic manner.</p>
<p>The authors' model of OR gene choice is supported by well-designed experiments and by large amounts of data. In general, the paper is clearly written and easy to follow. It will attract a wide variety of readers in the fields of neuroscience, developmental biology, and immunology. The present finding will give new insight into our understanding of gene choice in the multigene family in the mammalian brain and shed light on the long-standing question of monogenic expression of OR genes.</p>

<p>This manuscript investigates how a seemingly random choice of odourant receptor (OR) gene expression is organised into sterotypic zones of OR expression along the olfactory epithelium. Using a varietty of functional genomics methods, the authors find that along the differentiation axis (progenitor to mature olfactory sensory neuron, OSN) multiple ORs are initally transcribed and from among these, only one OR is selected for expression. The rest are suppressed through chromatin silencing. In addition to this, the authors report a dorso-ventral gradient in OR expression at the immature stage - dorsally expressed ORs are also expressed ventrally and these then get silenced. The expression of the ventrally expressed ORs, on the other hand, are restricted to the ventral region. They suggest a role for the transcription factor NF1 in this dorsoventral process.</p>
<p>This is a valuable study. The data are compelling and generally well presented.</p>
