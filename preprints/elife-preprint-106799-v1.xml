<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Type I interferon responses have been considered detrimental to host protection in tuberculosis (TB). We provide novel data to challenge this paradigm, derived from transcriptional profiling of human in vivo immune responses to discover associations with radiographic disease severity in pulmonary TB, combined with mechanistic studies to test causality for observed associations using a zebrafish larval mycobacterial infection model. Type I interferon activity in tissue samples from the site of a standardised mycobacterial challenge, the tuberculin skin test, was associated with less severe human TB disease. Abrogation of type I interferon signalling, by CRISPR-mediated mutagenesis of <italic>stat2</italic>, led to increased burden and dissemination of <italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic> infection in zebrafish larvae. The mechanism for increased severity of mycobacterial infection in zebrafish involves reduced recruitment of myeloid cells required to restrict bacterial growth. Our data support a clear host protective role for type I interferon responses in mycobacterial infection, with potential applications for risk-stratification of adverse outcomes and development of a host-directed therapy to mitigate against severe disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) infection results in diverse clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic infection to active tuberculosis (TB), which comprises an enormous spectrum of disease severity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Although we know that immune responses contribute to the risk of disease, current understanding of the role of immune response variation in disease severity is limited. Identification of immune correlates of disease severity may offer new insights into the immune pathways that contribute to protection and pathogenesis. This is necessary to enable novel vaccine design and evaluation, stratify disease risk in people who become infected and inform development of novel host-directed therapies to shorten treatment regimens, mitigate against antimicrobial resistance, and against the chronic sequelae of tissue injury in TB <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To date, protective immunity has focussed on tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and type II interferon mediated immune signalling pathways <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Type I interferon immune responses are also pervasive in TB. Unlike the protective role of type I interferons in viral infections, the prevailing view has been that this pathway may contribute to TB pathogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. However, causal inferences have been limited to mouse models which do not represent a natural host-pathogen interaction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. We sought to re-evaluate the differential role of immune signalling pathways in protection or pathogenesis in TB, by combining observational human data with genetic perturbation of immune signalling pathways in zebrafish infected with its natural pathogen <italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic> (Mm).</p>
<p>Observational immunology in human TB is limited by reverse causality. This is particularly true for positive correlations between immune responses and disease severity. Therefore, we specifically sought to identify negative correlations with disease severity, that are less susceptible to this limitation and suggestive of protective immunity. Transcriptional profiling can be used to make unbiased system level assessment of immune signalling pathways. In patients with TB, we used transcriptional profiling to investigate steady state perturbation of the immune system in peripheral blood <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, and to measure inducible immune responses at the tissue site of a standardised Mtb challenge modelled by the tuberculin skin test (TST) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Our innovative strategy revealed an inverse relationship between type I interferon activity in the TST transcriptome and radiographic severity of human TB, challenging the paradigm of a host-pathogenic role for type I interferons. Here, we confirmed a role for type I interferon responses in host protection against mycobacteria by showing that mutagenesis of <italic>stat2</italic> to abrogate downstream type I interferon signalling, led to increased severity of <italic>M. marinum</italic> infection in zebrafish larvae, due to reduced recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils required to contain bacterial growth.</p>

<p>Next, we sought to identify immunological pathways correlated with disease severity. We identified individual genes in the blood transcriptome that showed statistically significant correlations with the radiographic severity score (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Pathway analysis revealed no enrichment at pathway level among genes negatively correlated with TB severity. There was modest enrichment for innate and adaptive immune response pathways among genes positively correlated with radiographic disease score (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Next, we subjected these genes to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) upstream regulator analysis to collate groups of co-regulated genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and Figure S3A). These were annotated by their upstream regulators at the level of cytokines, transmembrane receptors, kinases and transcriptional regulators, representing the key components of signalling pathways which mediate immune responses. To provide increased confidence that these modules represented co-regulated genes in each molecular pathway, we retained only those that had significantly greater co-correlated expression than modules of genes randomly selected from our blood transcriptomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Only six gene modules were identified among genes negatively correlated with disease severity, but these did not represent obvious coordinated biology (Figure S3B). Among genes positively correlated with TB severity 94 gene modules were identified, reflecting pro-inflammatory cytokine activity, type II interferon and T cell activation and innate immune signalling pathways (Figure S3C and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

<title>Outlier analysis of the TST transcriptome defines inducible human in vivo immune responses in active tuberculosis</title>
<p>We repeated the same analysis of the dynamic response to TST challenge in the same patient cohort. In this analysis, we identified transcripts in the TST of each individual that were significantly enriched compared to gene expression in control data from skin biopsies at the site of saline injections. The integrated list of outlier genes statistically enriched in TST samples from all 51 individuals compared to control saline samples defined an active TB TST transcriptome comprised of 3222 transcripts. This analysis revealed that although some aspects of the TST response are consistent in all people, there is also considerable variability between individuals (Figure S4A). The 3222 transcripts identified by this approach, were enriched for canonical pathways involved in cell mediated responses, consistent with our previous description of the TST gene signature identified by conventional differential gene expression analysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> (Figure S4B).</p>

<title>Reduced type I interferon activity in the TST transcriptome is associated with increased severity of human TB disease</title>
<p>In contrast to the peripheral blood analysis, pathway analysis of individual genes in the TST transcriptome that showed statistically significant correlations with the radiographic severity score identified enrichment for cell mediated immune responses among genes negatively correlated with disease severity. Statistically less significant enrichment for immune response pathways was evident among genes positively correlated with TB severity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and Figure S5A). Subsequent IPA upstream regulator analysis identified 111 modules among genes inversely correlated with radiographic TB severity, suggesting they may contribute to host protection against severe disease (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-C</xref> and Figure S5B). These included transcriptional modules representing pro-inflammatory cytokine activity, interferon gamma and T cell activity, consistent with existing evidence predominantly supporting their protective roles in TB <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). In addition, we found enrichment of multiple co-regulated gene networks attributed to type I interferon signalling, suggesting that type I interferon responses may also contribute to host protection in mycobacterial infection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, C). Interferon gamma was also predicted to regulate one of only two small putative networks within genes positively correlated with disease severity; the other driven by TCL1A, an AKT kinase activator that promotes cellular survival <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> (Figure S5C).</p>

<p>To validate the immunological responses predicted to be associated with disease severity by upstream regulator analysis, we quantified the expression of two independently derived and largely non-overlapping type I interferon inducible gene modules reflecting the specific biological activity of type I interferons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tables1">Table S1</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, within the TB TST transcriptome (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). This provided independent validation of the inverse relationship between type I interferon responses and radiographic severity of TB (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>), suggestive of a host-protective role. By contrast, the expression of the entire TST transcriptome and that of three distinct independently derived modules specific for interferon gamma inducible genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tables1">Table S1</xref>) did not correlate with disease severity (Figure S6A-E).

<p>The finding of numerous modules pertaining to type I interferon signalling among TST transcriptome genes negatively correlated with disease severity prompted us to test the role of this pathway in mycobacterial infection experimentally. Since type I interferons are primarily induced following activation of innate immune recognition pathways <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, we investigated their role in the zebrafish larval <italic>M. marinum</italic> infection model, which allows exclusive assessment of innate immunity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. The mammalian canonical type I interferon signalling pathway is highly conserved in zebrafish <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). First, we confirmed that intravenous <italic>M. marinum</italic> infection of wild type zebrafish larvae induces a type I interferon response, by showing enrichment for two distinct independently derived transcriptional modules reflecting type I interferon activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tables1">Table S1</xref>) within genome-wide transcriptomic data from whole embryos after four days of mycobacterial growth (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, C). To block downstream type I interferon signalling we used CRISPR-mediated mutagenesis of <italic>stat2</italic>, as a critical component of the principal transcription factor complex which induces expression of type I interferon stimulated genes (ISG) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, for which there is a single zebrafish orthologue <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Injection of three guide RNA/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes each targeting a distinct <italic>stat2</italic> exon, into one cell stage wild type zebrafish embryos led to &gt;90% efficient mutagenesis in CRISPant embryos, confirmed by next-generation sequencing (Figure S7A and Figure S8A). We verified loss of functional downstream type I interferon signalling by showing that induction of the classical ISG Mxa <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> by injection of recombinant Interferon phi 1 protein, measured by expression of a reporter <italic>mxa:mCherry</italic> transgene <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, was significantly attenuated in <italic>stat2</italic> CRISPants compared to siblings injected with “scrambled” (negative control) RNPs designed to lack genomic targets (Figure S7B and Figure S8B-C). <italic>stat2</italic> CRISPants developed normally up to five days post-fertilisation (Figure S8B).</p>

<title>Recruitment of macrophages but not neutrophils to the site of sterile injury is <italic>stat2</italic> dependent</title>
<p>Type I interferons have previously been shown to influence cellular migration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>.

<p>Macrophage recruitment to the site of a sterile tail wound has previously been reported to be slower than that of neutrophils <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have taken an innovative approach, combining molecular and systems level evaluation of human immune responses to a standardised experimental challenge, to identify biological pathways associated with TB disease severity. We experimentally validated host factors responsible for differences in phenotype using a relevant, tractable animal model which represents a natural host-pathogen relationship <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Molecular interrogation of human in vivo responses to Mtb revealed that reduced type I interferon activity within the TST transcriptome was associated with worse pulmonary disease. Deficient type I interferon signalling, achieved by genetic disruption of <italic>stat2</italic>, led to more severe mycobacterial infection in zebrafish larvae, via a mechanism involving impaired recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils to the site of disease and reduced neutrophil numbers at baseline. Taken together our results demonstrate an important role for type I interferon responses in contributing to innate immune protection against mycobacterial disease.</p>
<p>Previous studies report peripheral blood interferon-inducible gene expression that diminishes with successful treatment in human active TB <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. These transcriptional signatures comprise both type I and type II interferon inducible genes but have mainly been interpreted as type I interferon responses, fostering the view that type I interferons are detrimental to the host in human TB. In the present study we found no relationship between disease severity and peripheral blood expression of gene modules specific for type I interferon activity. Mouse data predominantly suggest that type I interferon responses contribute to increased susceptibility to mycobacterial infection, by mechanisms including antagonism of IL1 mediated protection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> and reduced responsiveness of macrophages to interferon gamma <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. However, this phenotype has not been universally observed, likely due to differences in host and pathogen genetics <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Moreover, impaired type I interferon responses are generally associated with relatively minor differences in bacterial burden or survival <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Of note, Mtb is not a natural mouse pathogen, and this approach may not model host-pathogen interactions in human TB faithfully <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In support of a protective role for type I interferons, adjunctive interferon alpha therapy in addition to conventional anti-tuberculous antibiotic treatment led to symptomatic and radiological improvement, with a reduction in bacterial burden in respiratory tract samples, in small-scale human studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. In keeping with this, an early peripheral blood type I interferon-inducible gene signature predicts successful BCG-induced protection of macaques from subsequent Mtb challenge <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Type I interferon mediated restriction of mycobacterial growth in in vitro granulomas comprising collagen impregnated microspheres containing Mtb infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> also suggests that type I interferon responses benefit the host.</p>
<p>Our observation of reduced recruitment of macrophages to the site of disease is likely the most important factor driving increased susceptibility to <italic>M. marinum</italic> infection in <italic>stat2</italic> CRISPants. Although macrophages have been implicated in the dissemination of <italic>M. marinum</italic> in zebrafish larvae <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, reduction of total macrophage numbers, impaired macrophage migration to the site of mycobacterial infection or failure to control intracellular bacterial growth within macrophages have all been associated with poor outcome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. In contrast, increasing macrophage numbers via augmentation of M-CSF signalling either pre-or post-granuloma formation, promotes resistance to <italic>M. marinum</italic> infection by reducing granuloma necrosis, with consequent curtailment of extracellular mycobacterial growth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. The recent report that human genetically inherited CCR2 deficiency is associated with reduced pulmonary recruitment of monocytes, resulting in depleted numbers of functionally normal alveolar macrophages and increased susceptibility to mycobacteria, is also consistent with the concept that adequate numbers of macrophages at the site of infection are important for protective anti-mycobacterial immunity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The reduction in neutrophils present at the site of <italic>M. marinum</italic> infection in <italic>stat2</italic> CRISPants may have arisen due to baseline neutropenia, defective migration or both combined. On the basis that steady state neutropenia did not affect the timing and magnitude of peak neutrophil recruitment to sterile injury, impaired migration is probably the main driver of this phenotype, which likely also contributed to increased severity of mycobacterial disease. Previous data show that reduced access of neutrophils to mycobacteria leads to increased bacterial burden in a zebrafish line in which neutrophils express mutant <italic>cxcr4</italic>, resulting in peripheral neutropenia and impaired neutrophil recruitment to sites of inflammation, due to their retention in haematopoietic tissue <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Our study has some limitations. We were not able to address the reasons for variation in type I interferon activity in our human cohort. Variation in type I interferon responses may arise due to genetically or epigenetically encoded variation in the immune response to Mtb, neutralising type I interferon auto-antibodies, burden and virulence of the mycobacterial inoculum and stochasticity in the immune response pathway following exposure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Our sample size is insufficient for robust detection of associations between genetic variation and the expression levels of type I interferon signalling pathway genes. Serum samples for measurement of autoantibodies to type I interferons are not available, although anti-interferon antibodies are very rare in cohorts of this age distribution <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. We were also unable to completely disentangle whether reduced neutrophil recruitment to the site of <italic>M. marinum</italic> infection was a consequence of neutropenia or impaired migration. We have not determined the mechanism by which attenuated type I interferon signalling leads to reduced myeloid cell recruitment to <italic>M. marinum</italic>. The expression of several chemokines is type I interferon inducible <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> and the CCR2-CCL2 and CXCR3-CXCL11 chemokine axes are known to be involved in macrophage recruitment to <italic>M. marinum</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Future studies are required to test the hypothesis that <italic>stat2</italic> mutagenesis disrupts chemokine-mediated cellular recruitment to the site of mycobacterial disease. Nonetheless, our work provides new insights into type I interferon mediated host protection against mycobacterial infection.</p>
<p>Our findings have potential implications for risk stratification of individuals in whom any of the above mechanisms predisposing to low type I interferon activity are identified. In active TB, such individuals could be targeted for longer or more intensive drug regimens, or adjunctive type I interferon therapy delivered to the respiratory tract, to mitigate against severe disease. Early intervention with type I interferon treatment, before destruction of the lung parenchyma, is likely to be crucial to augment macrophage containment of Mtb, but timing and duration of therapy will require evaluation in relatively large-scale experimental medicine trials.</p>

Transcript alignment and quantitation against the Ensembl GRCh38 human genome assembly release 100 or GRCz11 zebrafish genome assembly release 104 was performed using Kallisto <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Transcript-level output counts and transcripts per million (TPM) values were summed on gene level and annotated with Ensembl gene ID, gene name, and gene biotype using the R/Bioconductor packages tximport and BiomaRt <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. Downstream analysis was performed using R 3.6.3 on log2 transformed TPM values for protein-coding genes only. 0.001 was added to all TPM values prior to log2 transformation. To determine the need for and effect of batch correction in the human data, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using the prcomp R function on the integrated list of genes with the 10% lowest variance in expression for each library preparation date. This revealed separation of three TST samples in PC1, likely accounted for by lower RNA concentrations or RIN values compared to the rest of the dataset (Figure S1A). After batch correction performed using the ComBat function of the sva R package <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>, allocating samples with PC1 score &lt; and &gt;0 to separate batches, this was no longer evident (Figure S1B).</p>

<p>The BioBase Bioconductor R package was used to perform outlier analysis based on the z-score outlier detection (ZODET) algorithm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, to identify transcripts in each TB patient blood sample whose expression was significantly higher than the mean expression in control blood samples from healthy volunteers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> and transcripts in each TST sample whose expression was significantly higher than the mean expression in control saline samples (&gt;2SD, p value &lt;0.05), with a fold difference filter of &gt;1 log2. Chi-squared tests implemented in R were then used to identify outlier genes statistically enriched in blood samples from TB patients compared to healthy individuals and TST samples compared to saline samples, using a p value &lt;0.05. To avoid type 2 error no correction for multiple testing was used in this analysis.

<p>Peripheral blood and TST transcriptome genes whose expression was significantly correlated with radiographic severity of TB disease were identified by Spearman rank correlation, p value &lt;0.05, without correction for multiple testing, to prevent type 2 error. Genes positively and negatively correlated with disease severity were separately subjected to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Qiagen) to identify upstream molecules responsible for their transcriptional regulation. This analysis was restricted to molecules annotated with the following functions: cytokine, transmembrane receptor, kinase and transcriptional regulator, representing the canonical components of pathways which mediate transcriptional reprogramming in immune responses.

<p>Blood and TST gene modules representing the functional activity of their upstream molecule were identified as previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. In brief, we calculated the average correlation coefficient for pairwise correlations of the expression levels of the target genes associated with each predicted upstream regulator. We compared these to the distribution of average correlation coefficients obtained from 100 iterations of randomly selecting equivalent sized groups of genes from the blood or TST transcriptome. Only target gene modules with average correlation coefficients higher than the mean of the distribution of equivalent sized randomly selected groups by ≥2 SD (Z score ≥2) with false discovery rate &lt;0.05, were retained.

<p>Zebrafish were raised and maintained at 28.5°C following a 14/10 light/dark cycle according to standard protocols <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup> in University College London (UCL) and Neuro-PSI Zebrafish Facilities. All work was approved by the British Home Office (Project License PP8780756) and the French Ministry for Research and Higher Education (Project License 39238). All experiments were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations, on larvae up to five days post-fertilisation, before they are protected under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act. Adult zebrafish were spawned to collect embryos for experiments. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table S2</xref> lists the lines used in this study <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>.

<title>CRISPant Generation</title>
<p>To maximise the likelihood of loss of functional protein we employed a previously described triple-exon targeting approach <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>, with the modification that Cas9 protein was not diluted before use. CRISPR RNA (crRNA) (Alt-R CRISPR-Cas9 crRNA), tracrRNA (Alt-R CRISPR-Cas9 tracrRNA) and recombinant Cas9 protein (Alt-R Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 Nuclease V3) were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). Three pre-designed crRNAs targeting distinct exons were selected for the <italic>stat2</italic> gene, prioritizing those that targeted early, asymmetric (not divisible by three) exons common to both protein-coding transcripts, with low off-target and high on-target scores and in a genomic position which allowed design of primers flanking the target site to generate a ∼200 bp amplicon, for verification of mutagenesis by next generation sequencing (MiSeq). crRNA sequences and genomic locations are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tables3">Table S3</xref>. To generate gRNAs equal volumes of crRNA and tracrRNA diluted to 61 μM in Duplex buffer (IDT) were annealed at 95°C for 5 minutes. Equal volumes of gRNA (61 μM) and Cas9 protein (61 μM) were incubated at 37°C for 5 minutes to assemble separate 30.5 μM ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) for each target. Equal volumes of the three RNPs were pooled, prior to injection giving a final concentration of 10.2 μM for each. Negative control “scrambled” crRNAs computationally designed to be non-targeting (Alt-R CRISPRCas9 Negative Control crRNA #1, #2, #3) were prepared and pooled as described above. 0.5 nl of pooled <italic>stat2</italic> RNPs or scrambled RNPs was injected into the yolk sac of single-cell stage wild type or transgenic zebrafish embryos before cell inflation as previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>.

Briefly, live anaesthetised three dpf zebrafish larvae were transferred with a 1 ml Pasteur pipette (Scientific Laboratory Supplies) to a sterile petri dish containing 2% agarose (Bioline). Transections of the caudal fin were performed using a sterile microscalpel (World Precision Instruments) by applying steady downward pressure to create the incision at the boundary with the notochord. Following injury, larvae were rinsed in egg water and maintained in individual wells of a 96-well tissue culture plate (TPP) at 28.5°C until live imaging to quantify neutrophil or macrophage recruitment to the site of injury at 1, 6 and 24 hours-post-wound (hpw).</p>

<title>Fluorescence microscopy</title>
<p>All fluorescence microscopy was performed on live, anasethised larvae. For quantitation of bacterial burden and dissemination four days post-infection, steady state neutrophil numbers at two dpf and cellular recruitment at 2-4 dpf, larvae were imaged using an M205FA stereofluorescence microscope (Leica) with a 1x objective. Larvae were imaged on a flat 1% agarose plate for quantitation of severity of mycobacterial infection and steady state neutrophil numbers and a 96-well tissue culture plate (TPP) in which the wells were coated with 1% agarose, for cellular recruitment to tailfin transection. Micro-wells were created in 1% agarose using a Stampwell Larvae 1 device (Idylle) for optimal positioning of 2-3 dpf larvae for imaging of cellular recruitment to hindbrain ventricle <italic>M. marinum</italic> infection. Brightfield and fluorescence images were captured using a DFC365 FX camera (Leica) and exported as 16-bit Tagged Image Format (TIF) files for analysis. For quantitation of steady state macrophage numbers three dpf larvae were imaged in 96-well alignment plates (Funakoshi) containing 75 μl egg water per well using a high-content wide-field fluorescence microscope (Hermes, IDEA Bio-Medical) with a 4x objective, capturing five z planes 50.6 μm apart in four contiguous fields of view per embryo. We created an ImageJ macro to semi-automate generation of single maximum intensity projection z-stack montages from the Hermes images, which were saved as 16-bit TIF files for analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table S4</xref>). Mxa reporter expression was recorded with an EVOS M7000 microscope (ThermoFisher) equipped with a 2x/NA0.06 objective and Texas Red fluorescence cube. Larvae were positioned laterally in micro-wells created in 2% agarose with an in-house-printed stamp. A single fluorescence plane was recorded as the depth of field is sufficient to capture the entire larva. Transmitted light images were also recorded and both were exported as 16-bit TIF files.</p>

<title>Image analysis</title>
<p>To quantify bacterial burden, number of bacterial foci and spatial distribution of bacteria, images were analysed using custom QuantiFish software, previously developed in our group, to enable rapid quantitation of fluorescent foci in zebrafish larvae <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. Mxa reporter fluorescence was measured with ImageJ. Transmitted and fluorescence images were stacked. Images were slightly rotated to horizontality where necessary. A 600x100 pixel rectangular region of interest was defined on the transmitted light image to encompass the entire gut and liver areas. Mean fluorescence intensity was then measured on the fluorescence image. For quantitation of total cell number and recruitment of fluorescent immune cells to the site of tailfin transection we developed a new custom Python script which enables quantitation of integrated fluorescence within concentric zones (known as Sholl circles) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup> (Figure S9). To achieve this, the script leverages the OpenCV, NumPy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>, Matplotlib, SciPy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.scipy.org">http://www.scipy.org</ext-link>), scikit-image <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup> and pandas Python libraries to facilitate image processing and data extraction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table S5</xref>). First the user is prompted to select a folder containing images for analysis, as well as the file extensions corresponding to the brightfield and fluorescence images, which are essential for the subsequent steps. The script then iterates through each pair of brightfield and fluorescent images prompting the user to define two points on the brightfield image, which serve as the start and end positions between which to create concentric circular regions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup> on the corresponding fluorescence image. The script employs the image processing techniques described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table S5</xref> to quantify integrated fluorescence of the entire image and that within each region, as surrogates for the total number of immune cells and the number at each spatial location, respectively and generates output files containing this information. Integrated fluorescence within the first zone (the wound site) and distance from the site of tailfin transection of the zone in which the maximal integrated fluorescence (a surrogate for the highest cell numbers) was detected (identified manually) were used as measures of immune cell recruitment for each zebrafish larva.

<p>This <bold>useful</bold> study shows a protective role of type 1 IFN during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. It shows that the type 1 IFN response in human skin TST inversely correlates with TB severity, suggesting its protective role. Considering that type I IFN is usually shown to be pro-pathogenic, the higher vulnerability of zebrafish larvae lacking stat2 to M marinum infection is a strong result. However, the conclusion that IFN-I is protective during mycobacterial infection remains indirect and <bold>incomplete</bold>; the study requires additional mechanistic insights and validation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript finds a negative relationship between tuberculin skin test-induced type I interferon activity with chest X-ray tuberculosis severity in humans. This evidence is between incomplete and solid. It needs a bioinfomatics/transcriptomics reviewer to make a more insightful judgement. The manuscript demonstrates a convincing role for Stat2 in controlling Mycobacterium marinum infection in zebrafish embryos, incomplete data are presented linking reduced leukocyte recruitment to the infection susceptibility phenotype.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) An interesting analysis of TST response correlated with chest X-ray pathology.</p>
<p>(2) Novel data on a protective role for Stat2 in a natural host-mycobacterial species infection pairing.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The transcriptional modules are very large sets of genes that do not present a clear picture of what is actually being measured relative to other biological pathways.</p>
<p>(2) The link between infection-Stat2-leukocyte recruitment and containment of infection is plausible, but lacks a specific link to the first part of the manuscript.</p>
<p>Major concerns</p>
<p>(1) Line 158: The two transcriptional modules should be placed in the context of other DEG patterns. The macrophage type I interferon module, in particular, is quite large (361 genes). Can this be made more granular in terms of type I IFN ligands and STAT2-dependent genes?</p>
<p>(2) The ifnphi1 injection into mxa:mCherry stat2 crispants is a nice experiment to demonstrate loss of type I IFN responsiveness. Further data is required to demonstrate if important mycobacterial control pathways (IFNy, TNF, il6?, etc) are intact in stat2 crispants before being able to conclude that these phenotypes are specific to type I IFN.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study shows that type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling helps protect against mycobacterial infection. Using human gene expression data and a zebrafish model, the authors find that reduced IFN-I activity is linked to more severe disease.

These results suggest a protective role for IFN-I in mycobacterial disease, challenging previous findings from other animal models.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors presented an interesting study providing an insight into the role of Type-I interferon responses in tuberculosis (TB) pathogenesis by combining transcriptome analysis of PBMCs and TST from tuberculosis patients. The zebrafish model was used to identify the changes in the innate immune cell population of macrophages and neutrophils. The findings suggested that Type-I interferon signatures inversely correlated with disease severity in the TST transcriptome data. The authors validated the observations by CRISPR-mediated disruption of stat2 (a critical transcription factor for type I interferon signaling) in zebrafish larvae, showing increased susceptibility to M. marinum infection. Traditionally, type-I interferon responses have been viewed as detrimental in mycobacterial infections, with studies suggesting enhanced susceptibility in certain mouse models. The study tried to identify and further characterize the understanding of the role of type-I interferons in TB.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Traditionally, type-I interferon responses have been viewed as detrimental in mycobacterial infections, with studies suggesting enhanced susceptibility in certain mouse models. The study tried to further understand the role of type-I interferons in TB pathogenesis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Though the study showed an inverse correlation of Type-I interferon with radiological features of TB, the molecular mechanism is largely unexplored in the study, which is making it difficult to understand the basis of the results shown in the manuscript by the authors.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript finds a negative relationship between tuberculin skin test-induced type I interferon activity with chest X-ray tuberculosis severity in humans. This evidence is between incomplete and solid. It needs a bioinfomatics/transcriptomics reviewer to make a more insightful judgement. The manuscript demonstrates a convincing role for Stat2 in controlling Mycobacterium marinum infection in zebrafish embryos, incomplete data are presented linking reduced leukocyte recruitment to the infection susceptibility phenotype.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) An interesting analysis of TST response correlated with chest X-ray pathology.</p>
<p>(2) Novel data on a protective role for Stat2 in a natural host-mycobacterial species infection pairing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s positive comments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The transcriptional modules are very large sets of genes that do not present a clear picture of what is actually being measured relative to other biological pathways.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The transcriptional module analysis is a major strength of our approach. These gene signatures are derived from independent experiments, most of which have been previously published/validated [1,2]. To clarify, they represent co-regulated gene sets downstream of signalling pathways. Increased number of genes in these modules increases their combinatorial specificity for a given biological pathway. In the human data, they serve as orthogonal validation for the bioinformatic analysis showing enrichment of the type I IFN pathway among TST transcriptome genes that are negatively correlated with radiographic disease severity in pulmonary TB (see Figure 2). Importantly, our modules confirm the relationship with type I IFN signalling (see Figure 2E) by discriminating from type II IFN signalling, which is not statistically significantly correlated with radiographic TB severity (see Figure S6C-E).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The link between infection-Stat2-leukocyte recruitment and containment of infection is plausible, but lacks a specific link to the first part of the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>For clarification, the first part of the study seeks to identify immune response pathways that relate to severity of human disease, leading to the identification of type I IFN signalling. Since the human data are limited to an observational analysis in which we cannot test causality, the second part of our study uses a genetically tractable experimental model to test the hypothesis that type I IFN signalling is host-protective and explore possible mechanisms for a beneficial effect. This leads to the observation that type I IFN responses contribute to early myeloid cell recruitment to the site of infection, that has previously been shown to be crucial for containment of mycobacterial infection in zebrafish larvae. We will further evaluate the introduction and results sections to ensure a clear link between the human and zebrafish work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Major concerns</p>
<p>(1) Line 158: The two transcriptional modules should be placed in the context of other DEG patterns. The macrophage type I interferon module, in particular, is quite large (361 genes). Can this be made more granular in terms of type I IFN ligands and STAT2-dependent genes?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully disagree with this comment. For clarification, the 360 gene module reflects the zebrafish larval response to IFNphi1 protein [3]. Type I IFNs are known to induce hundreds of interferon stimulated genes [4]. As explained above, the size of the modules increases specificity for a given signalling pathway. In this case, we are most interested in discriminating type I and type II IFN signalling pathways that represent very different upstream biological processes. The discrimination we achieve with our modular approach is a major advance over previous reports of gene signatures in TB that do not discriminate between the two pathways. In this study, we did not discriminate between signalling downstream of type I IFN ligands and STAT2, consistent with existing literature showing that type I IFN signalling is STAT2 dependent [5,6].</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The ifnphi1 injection into mxa:mCherry stat2 crispants is a nice experiment to demonstrate loss of type I IFN responsiveness. Further data is required to demonstrate if important mycobacterial control pathways (IFNy, TNF, il6?, etc) are intact in stat2 crispants before being able to conclude that these phenotypes are specific to type I IFN.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the positive comment. We acknowledge this point and will attempt to evaluate whether pro-inflammatory cytokine responses are intact in <italic>stat2</italic> CRISPants by qPCR or bulk RNAseq. However, these experiments may prove inconclusive because of the limited sensitivity in this approach.</p>

<p>This study shows that type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling helps protect against mycobacterial infection. Using human gene expression data and a zebrafish model, the authors find that reduced IFN-I activity is linked to more severe disease. They also show that zebrafish lacking the IFN-I signaling gene stat2 are more vulnerable to infection due to poor macrophage migration.

<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Strengths of the manuscript include the use of human clinical samples to support relevance to disease, along with a genetically tractable zebrafish model that enables mechanistic insight.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We welcome the reviewer’s positive summary of our study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript presents intriguing human data showing an inverse correlation between IFN-I gene signatures and TB disease, but the findings remain correlative and may be cohort-specific. Given that the skin is not a primary site of TB and is relatively immunotolerant, the biological relevance of downregulated IFN-I-related genes in this tissue to systemic or pulmonary TB is unclear.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that the observational human data are correlative. That is precisely why we extend the study to undertake mechanistic studies in a genetically tractable animal model, using <italic>M. marinum</italic> infection of zebrafish larvae. In the introduction, we already provide a detailed rationale for the strengths of the TST model to study human immune responses to a standardised mycobacterial challenge. This approach mitigates against the confounding of heterogeneity in bacterial burden and sampling different stages of the natural history of infection in conventional observational human studies. Therefore, the application of the TST is a major strength of this study. We do not understand the context in which the reviewer suggests the skin is immunotolerant. In the present study and previous work we provide molecular level analysis of the TST as a robust cell mediated immune response that reflects molecular perturbation in granuloma from the site of pulmonary TB disease 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The reliance on stat2 CRISPants in zebrafish offers a limited view of IFN-I signaling. Including additional crispant lines targeting other key regulators (e.g., ifnar1, tyk2, irf3, irf7) would strengthen the interpretation and clarify whether the observed effects reflect broader IFN-I pathway disruption.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully disagree with this comment. Our objective was to test the role of type I IFN signalling in <italic>M. marinum</italic> infection of zebrafish. We show that <italic>stat2</italic> deletion effectively disrupts type I IFN signalling (Figure S8). Therefore, we do not see a compelling rationale to evaluate other molecules in the signalling pathway.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The conclusion that IFN-I is protective contrasts with established findings from murine and non-human primate models, where IFN-I is often detrimental. While the authors highlight species differences, the lack of functional human data and reliance on M. marinum in zebrafish limit the translational relevance. A more balanced discussion addressing these discrepancies would improve the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge that our findings contrast with the prevailing view in published literature to date. We will further review the discussion to see how we can elaborate on the potential strengths and weaknesses of different experimental approaches, which may underpin these discrepancies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Quantification of bacterial burden using fluorescence intensity alone may not accurately reflect bacterial viability. Complementary methods, such as qPCR for bacterial DNA, would provide a more robust assessment of antimicrobial activity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We and others have previously validated the use of the quantitative measures of fluorescence, used here as a measure of bacterial load [7,8]. Importantly, our measurements do not rely purely on the total fluorescence signal, but also measures of dissemination of infection, for which we see consistent findings. It is also widely recognised that DNA measurements do not necessarily correlate well with bacterial viability. Therefore, we respectfully disagree that a PCR-based approach will add substantial value to our existing analysis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Finally, the authors should clarify whether impaired macrophage recruitment in stat2 crispants results from defects in chemotaxis, differentiation, or survival, and address discrepancies between their human blood findings and prior studies.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge that these are important questions. Our data show that <italic>stat2</italic> disruption does not impact total macrophage numbers at baseline (Figure 4A,B) and therefore do not support any effect of Stat2 signalling on steady state macrophage survival or differentiation. The downregulation of macrophage <italic>mpeg1</italic> expression in <italic>M. marinum</italic> infection precludes long-term follow-up of these cells in the context of infection [9]. Therefore, we cannot currently test the hypothesis that Stat2 signalling may influence death of macrophages recruited to the site of infection or make them more susceptible to the cytopathic effects of direct mycobacterial infection. We will attempt to confirm using short-term time-lapse imaging that cellular migration to the site of hindbrain <italic>M. marinum</italic> infection is reduced in <italic>stat2</italic> deficient zebrafish. On the strength of what is possible to test and the established role of type I IFNs in induction of several chemokines [10,11], the most likely effect is that Stat2 signalling increases recruitment through chemokine production. We are exploring the possibility of testing changes to the chemokine profile in <italic>stat2</italic> CRISPants by qPCR or bulk RNAseq, but these experiments may prove inconclusive because of the limitations of sensitivity in this approach.</p>
<p>We recognize that our finding of no relationship between peripheral blood type I IFN activity and severity of human TB contrasts with that of previous studies. As stated in the discussion, the most likely explanation for this is our use of transcriptional modules which reflect exclusive type I IFN responses. The signatures used in other studies include both type I and type II IFN inducible genes and therefore also reflect IFN gamma driven responses.</p>
