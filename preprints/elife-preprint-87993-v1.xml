<title>Abstract</title><p>Enterovirus D68 is a re-emerging enterovirus that causes acute respiratory illness in infants and has recently been linked to Acute Flaccid Myelitis. Here, we show that the histone deacetylase, SIRT-1, is essential for autophagy and EV-D68 infection. Knockdown of SIRT-1 blocks autophagy and reduces EV-D68 extracellular titers. The proviral activity of SIRT-1 does not require its deacetylase activity or functional autophagy. SIRT-1’s proviral activity is, we demonstrate, mediated through the repression of ER stress. Inducing ER stress through thapsigargin treatment or SERCA2A knockdown in SIRT-1 knockdown cells had no additional effect on EV-D68 extracellular titers. Knockdown of SIRT-1 also decreases poliovirus and SARS-CoV-2 titers but not coxsackievirus B3. In non-lytic conditions, EV-D68 is primarily released in an enveloped form, and SIRT-1 is required for this process. Our data show that SIRT-1, through its translocation to the cytosol, is critical to promote the release of enveloped EV-D68 viral particles.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is a re-emerging enterovirus and a cause of acute respiratory illness in infants. EV-D68 infection has recently been associated with Acute Flaccid Myelitis, a severe polio-like neurological disease that causes limb weakness and loss of muscle tone in infants(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Eshaghi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lang et al., 2014</xref>). There is currently no FDA-approved drug or vaccine against EV-D68. It is important to understand how EV-D68 hijacks host processes to facilitate its life cycle within the host.</p>
<p>EV-D68 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA enterovirus belonging to the <italic>Piconarviridae</italic> family. The viral genome encodes a single polyprotein that is immediately processed upon translation by viral proteases into multiple intermediate and mature structural and seven non-structural proteins(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Esposito et al., 2015</xref>). Picornavirus infection induces extensive rearrangement of cytosolic membranes, beginning with the formation of complex single convoluted membranes, also known as replication vesicles, on the cytosolic face of which viral RNA replication occurs. For most picornaviruses, these intricate structures eventually morph into double-membrane autophagosome-like structures, which play roles in virus replication, maturation, and nonlytic release(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jackson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jackson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Shi and Luo, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Autophagy is a highly regulated catabolic process that maintains cell survival by targeting superfluous cytoplasmic contents and infectious microorganisms, including pathogenic bacteria and viruses, for degradation. Several RNA viruses, including EV-D68, are known to subvert autophagy for their own benefit, and our interest in this pathway led us to study sirtuin 1 (SIRT-1)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ahmad et al., 2018</xref>). SIRT-1 is important for autophagy initiation, but whether SIRT-1 is essential for the later stages of autophagy (autophagic flux) or translocates to the cytosol during starvation or other stress stimuli, such as viral infection, is unknown(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bai and Zhang, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lee et al., 2008</xref>). A growing body of evidence implicates SIRT-1 as an essential regulator of autophagy downstream of the nucleation complex(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Green and Levine, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lee et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>SIRT-1 belongs to the NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent family of histone deacetylase enzymes, which are known to control several physiological processes. The sirtuin family of enzymes contains seven members (SIRT-1 to 7), which display varying subcellular localization, with SIRT-1 being the most studied owing to its role in lifespan expansion(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chalkiadaki and Guarente, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Jing and Lin, 2015</xref>). SIRT-1 has been shown to regulate cellular responses to various stresses, including the cell cycle, apoptosis, inflammation, ER stress, and more(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chalkiadaki and Guarente, 2015</xref>). SIRT-1 has also been shown to promote the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection, but whether SIRT-1 regulates picornavirus infection is unknown(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Weston et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>A less well-known or studied role for SIRT-1 is in regulating Endoplasmic Reticulum stress (ER stress)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Singh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Tang et al., 2018</xref>). ER stress, which can be provoked by various stress stimuli, including viral infection, happens when proteins cannot properly fold, leading to the accumulation of unfolded/misfolded protein. ER stress engages the unfolded protein response (UPR), which attenuates transcription and translation, decreases protein synthesis, and enhances the expression of molecular chaperones to increase the cell’s protein folding capacity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Oslowski and Urano, 2011</xref>). The inositol-requiring enzyme (IRE) 1-X-box binding protein (XBP) 1 pathway constitutes one of the three major pathways induced by UPR(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hetz, 2012</xref>). Upon ER stress, IRE-1 cleaves XBP-1 mRNA into spliced forms which, in turn, activates UPR target genes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Yoshida et al., 2001</xref>). Studies have shown an intricate interplay between SIRT-1 and ER stress. While SIRT-1 regulates ER stress by binding and inhibiting the transcriptional activity of XBP1, ER stress also regulates SIRT-1 levels(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). For instance, ER stress induction through Thapsigargin (TG) treatment induces SIRT-1 protein levels <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> to promote hepatocellular injury(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Koga et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we report that EV-D68 infection induces SIRT-1 translocation to the cytosol. We also show that SIRT knockdown impedes the extracellular vesicle-mediated release of infectious EV-D68 particles. We further demonstrate that the pro-EV-D68 activity of SIRT-1 is mediated through repressing ER stress and does not require SIRT-1’s deacetylase function, nor is it dependent on functional autophagy. Moreover, SIRT-1 knockdown reduces extracellular titers of poliovirus (PV) and SARS-CoV-2 but not Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3). Our results indicate that certain picornaviruses induce SIRT-1 translocation to the cytosol and require the cellular protein for efficient release.</p>

<title>EV-D68 infection changes SIRT-1’s subcellular localization</title>
<p>SIRT-1 is proviral in some cases and has previously been reported to regulate autophagy initiation, which is important for EV-D68 infection(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Weston et al., 2019</xref>). But whether SIRT-1 is essential for EV-D68 reproduction is unknown. We first interrogated the effects of SIRT-1 knockdown on EV-D68 titers. SIRT-1 knockdown reduced both the intracellular (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) and extracellular (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) EV-D68 titers, with the knockdown being more effective in decreasing the extracellular titers than the cell-associated viral titers. Pharmacological inhibition of SIRT-1, through EX527 pre-treatment, yielded similar results (Fig. S1A and B). Next, we assessed the effect of SIRT-1 overexpression on EV-D68 titers. Both wild-type (SIRT-1 WT) and the deacetylase inactive mutant (SIRT-1 H363Y) increased EV-D68 extracellular titers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Furthermore, overexpression of both wild-type and mutant SIRT-1 constructs partially rescued EV-D68 extracellular titers in SIRT-1 knockdown cells (Fig. S1C), indicating that the pro-EV-D68 activity of SIRT-1 does not require its deacetylase function.</p>

<p>Given SIRT-1’s proviral role in EV-D68 infection, we asked whether EV-D68 infection alters SIRT-1 protein levels or subcellular localization. We infected H1HeLa cells for various time points before subjecting the cells to immunofluorescence analysis (IFA) against SIRT-1. As indicated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, SIRT-1 is localized to the nucleus in the mock-infected cells. EV-D68 infection, on the other hand, induced translocation of a fraction of SIRT-1 to the cytosol (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>) beginning at 3hpi, which coincides with peak viral RNA replication. To understand whether SIRT-1 translocation during EV-D68 infection is dependent on exportin-1, the major mammalian nuclear export protein, we pretreated H1HeLa cells with and without leptomycin-B, a specific exportin-1 inhibitor, followed by EV-D68 infection(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fornerod et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fukuda et al., 1997</xref>). Leptomycin-B treatment blocked transcription factor-EB, the master transcriptional regulator of autophagy translocation upon refeeding, as expected (Fig. S2), but it did not obstruct SIRT-1 translocation induced by EV-D68 infection (Fig. S2B). In some cases, cleavage of nuclear pore proteins by picornaviruses has been shown to cause leakage of proteins from the nucleus during infection(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gustin and Sarnow, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hanson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Watters et al., 2017</xref>). However, we found that the autophagy kinase regulator RB1CC1 does not leave the nucleus during EV-D68 infection, indicating that SIRT-1 is being targeted for translocation (Fig S3). We then examined the effect of EV-D68 infection on SIRT-1 protein levels. Results in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref> and its associated densitometry analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>) revealed that in contrast to starvation, which marginally decreased SIRT-1 protein levels, EV-D68 infection does not significantly impact SIRT-1 protein levels.</p>

<title>SIRT-1 promotes autophagy but decreases EV-D68 extracellular titers in autophagy-deficient ATG-7 KO cells</title>
<p>While SIRT-1 is known to regulate autophagy initiation, whether the cellular histone deacetylase is important for basal and stress-induced autophagy is unclear. SIRT-1 and scramble knockdown H1HeLa cells were starved or treated with Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) to induce or block autophagy, respectively. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, starvation reduces p62 protein levels, and CCCP treatment increased LC3 lipidation in the scramble control group as expected. In contrast, acute amino acid starvation did not significantly alter p62 protein expression, and CCCP treatment failed to trigger LC3II accumulation in SIRT-1 knockdown cells, confirming that SIRT-1 is essential for basal and starvation-induced autophagy. To further confirm SIRT-1’s importance for basal autophagy, we knocked down SIRT-1 and performed IFA against endogenous LC3.</p>

<p>In contrast to the scramble control, which mainly displayed diffused nuclear-localized LC3, SIRT-1 knockdown provoked endogenous LC3 puncta accumulation near the perinuclear region (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Similar results were observed in GFP-LC3-overexpressing SIRT-1 knockdown cells, wherein knockdown of SIRT triggered GFP-LC3 puncta accumulation (Fig. S1D). Together, these results confirm that SIRT-1 is essential for stress-induced and basal autophagy.</p>
<p>Given SIRT-1’s regulation of autophagy, we asked whether SIRT-1’s proviral activity depends on functional autophagy. SIRT-1, which is typically localized to the nucleus in cancer cells, forms a molecular complex with three proteins essential for autophagy initiation: ATG-5, ATG-7, and LC3. SIRT-1 deacetylates these autophagy-related proteins, thereby regulating autophagy induction(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bai and Zhang, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lee et al., 2008</xref>). We first examined whether SIRT-1 colocalizes with ATG-7 during EV-D68 infection. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, EV-D68 induces ATG-7 puncta formation, which partially colocalizes with SIRT-1. We next examined the effect of ATG-7 knockout (ATG-7 KO), which cannot form autophagosomes, on EV-D68 release. ATG-7 KO severely impeded both extracellular and vesicle-mediated release of EV-D68 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), consistent with the importance of autophagy for picornavirus release(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jackson, 2014</xref>). We then knocked down SIRT-1 in ATG-7 knockout (ATG-7 KO) cells, then infected these cells with EV-D68. Knockdown of SIRT-1 decreased EV-D68 extracellular titers in ATG-7 KO cells without significantly altering the intracellular titers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>), suggesting that the proviral function of SIRT-1 does not require functional autophagy. Since SIRT-1 regulates autophagy through its deacetylase activity, these data are consistent with our findings in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<title>SIRT-1’s proviral activity is mediated by repressing ER stress</title>
<p>SIRT-1 has previously been reported to negatively regulate ER stress by deacetylating X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). To determine whether SIRT-1’s proviral activity is mediated via ER stress, we treated H1HeLa cells with or without Thapsigargin (TG), a well-known ER stress inducer, for 5 h after viral adsorption. TG provokes ER stress by inhibiting the Sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase pump (SERCA), which mediates calcium transfer from the cytosol to the lumen of the ER, and is important for maintaining ER homeostasis. While TG treatment only marginally reduced EV-D68 intracellular titers, it markedly decreased the extracellular titers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), similar to what we observed in SIRT-1 knockdown cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). This finding suggests that TG and SIRT-1 may share common cellular targets. To confirm this hypothesis, we treated scramble and SIRT-1 knockdown cells with and without TG after viral adsorption. TG treatment significantly reduced viral extracellular titers in the scramble control group. In contrast, TG did not significantly alter viral extracellular titers when SIRT-1 is depleted (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). We also observed similar results in our genetic epistasis analysis, in which the knockdown of SERCA2A did not further reduce viral titers in SIRT-1-depleted cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). We then examined the effect of SIRT-1 depletion and EV-D68 infection on SERCA2A protein levels by western blot. While EV-D68 infection did not alter SERCA2A levels, the knockdown of SIRT-1 decreases SERCA2A protein levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>), suggesting SIRT-1 is essential for SERCA2A stability.</p>

<p>Since the induction of ER stress, through either SIRT-1 depletion or TG treatment, attenuates EV-D68 egress, we asked whether EV-D68 infection induces ER stress. For this purpose, H1HeLa cells were mock-infected, infected with EV-D68, or treated with TG for western blot against XBP1, which is upregulated upon ER stress. As expected, TG treatment, which was used as a positive control, induced XBP-1 protein levels in H1HeLa cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). In contrast, EV-D68 infection reduced XBP1 levels compared to the mock-infection control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>), indicating that the picornavirus does not trigger ER stress in H1HeLa cells.</p>

<title>Induction of ER stress impairs EV-D68 release in hSABCi-NS1.1 primary cells</title>
<p>To confirm whether TG could impair EV-D68 non-lytic release in a more physiologically relevant cell line, we infected hSABCi-NS1.1 immortalized small airway cells with and without TG. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, TG treatment significantly reduced EV-D68 extracellular titers without appreciably impacting the intracellular titers, similar to what we observed in H1HeLa cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Our western blot data in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref> showed that while TG treatment induced BiP protein levels, indicating the induction of ER stress in hSABCi-NS1.1 cells, EV-D68 infection reduced BiP levels compared to the mock control and impaired TG-induced BiP protein expression, suggesting that EV-D68 blocks ER stress. Next, we examined the impact of EX527 pretreatment on EV-D68 titers in the primary cells. Similar to our observation in H1HeLa cells, EX527 reduced EV-D68 extracellular titers and only marginally decreased EV-D68 intracellular titers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Finally, we inquired whether EV-D68 infection causes SIRT-1 translocation in these primary cells. As indicated in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, SIRT-1 localizes to the nucleus in uninfected cells. In contrast, EV-D68 infection, as shown by VP3 staining, induces SIRT-1 translocation to the cytosol. These findings demonstrate that SIRT-1’s proviral effect in mediating EV-D68 non-lytic release is not cell-type specific.</p>

<title>SIRT-1 Reduces PV, not CVB3, titers</title>
<p>We next sought to understand whether SIRT-1 modulates the infection of other medically important picornaviruses, including PV and CVB3. While protective vaccines are available for PV, few vaccine-derived PV infection cases exist. On the other hand, there is no vaccine or treatment against CVB3, a significant cause of myocarditis and neurological disorders in infants. Therefore, identifying host factors that influence the infection of these viruses could help control their infection. We first examined whether PV and CVB3 alter the subcellular localization of SIRT-1. To our surprise, while PV, similar to EV-D68, induces SIRT-1 translocation to the cytosol, CVB3 did not significantly alter SIRT-1’s subcellular localization (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). We then examined the impact of SIRT-1 knockdown on PV and CVB3 infection. SIRT-1 knockdown marginally reduced PV intracellular titers but significantly decreased its extracellular titers (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). In contrast, the knockdown of SIRT-1 did not alter CVB3 intracellular titers but slightly increased CVB3 extracellular titers (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>). To further confirm SIRT-1’s role in PV and CVB3 infection, we pretreated H1HeLa cells with EX527 followed by viral infection. Consistent with siRNA-mediated depletion of SIRT-1, EX527 decreased PV titers, but not CVB3 titers (Fig. S4). These results indicate that certain but not all picornaviruses require SIRT-1 for their egress from infected cells.</p>

<title>SIRT-1 knockdown reduces the extracellular vesicle-mediated release of enveloped EV-D68 viral particles</title>
<p>Since SIRT-1 knockdown reduces the extracellular EV-D68 titer an order of magnitude more than the intracellular titers, we posit that SIRT-1 proviral activity promotes non-lytic viral release. Multiple members of the <italic>Piconarviridae</italic> family have been previously reported to be released in an enveloped form, usually with multiple virions per vesicle.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Feng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Robinson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Sin et al., 2017</xref>) Hence, we asked whether EV-D68 is similarly released in extracellular vesicles (EVs) and whether SIRT-1 is essential for this process. We knocked down SIRT-1 and isolated EVs for viral titer measurement. As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, EV-D68 appears to be released chiefly in EVs compared to the post-spin supernatant (PSS), and SIRT-1 knockdown severely impeded the extracellular vesicle-mediated release of EV-D68. We knocked down SIRT-1 to understand its impact on viral release. We also examined the expression of CD63, the most widely used marker for exosomes/multivesicular bodies, by western blot. As depicted in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, SIRT-1 knockdown induced CD63 protein levels compared to the scramble control. Given the increase in CD63 protein levels in SIRT-1 knockdown cells, we hypothesize that the knockdown of SIRT-1 may prevent the exocytosis of CD63-positive EVs. To confirm this hypothesis, we infected SIRT-1 knockdown cells for 4 h and isolated the EVs for western blotting against CD63. As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>, SIRT-1 knockdown increased CD63 levels in the whole cell lysate. Our IFA analysis in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref> also showed the aggregation of sizable CD63-positive puncta in SIRT-1 knockdown cells, as previously observed(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Latifkar et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, for the extracellular vesicle fraction, we observed that SIRT-1 knockdown decreased the release of CD63-positive EVs during EV-D68 infection compared to the scramble control (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). Consistent with the decrease in CD63-positive signal in SIRT-1 knockdown EVs, we detected VP3 only in the scramble control EVs, not EVs purified from SIRT-1 knockdown cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). Together, these results indicate that SIRT-1 is essential for EV-D68 release in EVs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our work shows that SIRT-1, largely thought of as a transcriptional regulator, is essential for the release of the enveloped form of EV-D68. Here, we confirm that SIRT-1 is essential for basal and starvation-mediated autophagy, and traffics to the cytosol during autophagic induction and infeciton. In addition, we show that most EV-D68 is released non-lytically in an enveloped form, and that knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of SIRT-1 severely decreases the release of infectious enveloped EV-D68 particles. Knockdown of SIRT-1 also attenuates the release of PV and SARS-CoV-2 but marginally increases CVB3 egress (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C,E</xref>; Figure 7C). Our results suggest that many viruses induce SIRT-1 translocation to the cytosol to promote their vesicular release. Interestingly, our genetic and pharmacological data lead us to conclude that SIRT-1 is not acting to promote virus release through autophagy, nor through histone deacetylation, but through a mechanism related to ER stress.</p>
<p>We observed that EV-D68 infection induces relocalization of SIRT-1 from the nucleus to the cytosol starting at 3 hpi (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Given that RNA replication peaks at 3hpi, we initially thought SIRT-1 might be essential for viral RNA replication. However, during EV-D68 infection, SIRT-1 did not colocalize to dsRNA, a marker of active viral RNA replication (Fig. S5A). In contrast, GBF-1, a cellular factor that is required for picornavirus replication, colocalizes with dsRNA during EV-D68 infection (Fig. S5A). The kinetic studies in our supplemental data revealed that starvation induces rapid SIRT-1 translocation to the cytosol as early as 1h post-treatment (Fig. S6A). This finding is consistent with the notion that SIRT-1 drives autophagosome formation during amino acid starvation. Although starvation slightly decreased SIRT-1 protein levels by western blot, pharmacological inhibition of autophagic flux failed to restore SIRT-1 levels. Moreover, SIRT-1 did not colocalize with p62 in starved cells (Fig. S6B), suggesting that the cellular protein is not a substrate for autophagy.</p>
<p>We found that SIRT-1 knockdown did not significantly impact EV-D68 RNA replication (Fig. S5C), virus binding (Fig. S5D), or virus entry (Fig. S5E). Instead, our findings suggest that the effect of SIRT-1 on virus production can largely be explained by a role in re-configuring the exocytosis pathway to promote the release of virus-loaded EVs. Knockdown of SIRT-1 led to the accumulation of large CD63 positive puncta in cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>), suggesting that the turnover or the release of these vesicles is blocked in the absence of SIRT-1. Infection results in an increase in CD63 in the extracellular vesicles. Interestingly, our western blot data shows a marked decrease in CD63 and a complete lack of VP3 detection in EVs from infected cells with reduced SIRT-1 expression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). This finding, coupled with the increased CD63 in the whole-cell lysates (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">C</xref>), indicates that the reduction of SIRT-1 attenuates the release of virus-loaded CD63-positive EVs.</p>
<p>While picornaviruses are mainly released by cell lysis, a growing body of evidence indicates that these viruses can be released from intact cells without cell lysis, a phenomenon called non-lytic release. For instance, PV has been shown to escape intact cells through AWOL (autophagosome-mediated exit without lysis), in which virus-containing autophagosomes fuse with the plasma membrane to release virions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jackson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Richards and Jackson, 2012</xref>). We show that knockout of ATG-7 reduces EV-D68 extracellular/EV titers, which is consistent with the AWOL model (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Hepatitis A virus (HAV), which is non-lytic, has been reported to exit cells in an enveloped form known as eHAV(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Feng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Rivera-Serrano et al., 2019</xref>). Similar events, modulated through the autophagic pathway, have been shown for multiple picornaviruses(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Robinson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Sin et al., 2017</xref>). We show here for the first time that EV-D68 can also exit intact cells non-lytically in EVs. This extracellular vesicle-mediated release of EV-D68 virions is, as we demonstrate here, dependent upon SIRT-1, a protein best known as a histone deacetylase and autophagy regulator (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). However, our data suggest that SIRT-1’s proviral activity is mediated through a role in repressing ER stress.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that SIRT-1 negatively regulates crucial ER stress-related proteins, including XBP1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, knocking down SIRT-1 would be expected to permit ER stress induction, which, in turn, could attenuate EV-D68 non-lytic release. Consistent with this presumption, provoking ER stress through TG treatment, similar to SIRT-1 knockdown, markedly decreases EV-D68 extracellular titers in both H1HeLa and hSABCi cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>). Our drug-based epistasis analysis revealed that SIRT-1 and TG share common cellular targets since TG did not further reduce viral titers in SIRT-1 knockdown cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>Since TG binds SERCA2A and blocks its activity leading to ER stress(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lytton et al., 1991</xref>), we investigated whether depleting SERCA2A will impact EV-D68 extracellular titers. As anticipated, knocking down SERCA2A reduces EV-D68 release. However, double knockdown of SIRT-1 and SERCA2A failed to appreciably decrease viral titers compared to SERCA2A or SIRT-1 knockdowns alone, indicating SERCA2A is a downstream target of SIRT-1. Intriguingly, we observed that the knockdown of SIRT-1 concomitantly reduced SERCA2A protein levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>), which is in agreement with a previous study(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gorski et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, knocking down SIRT-1 decreases SERCA2A levels, allowing ER stress induction and decreasing EV-D68 release.</p>
<p>TG has been demonstrated to possess antiviral activity against many viruses using various mechanisms. For instance, TG attenuates Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infection by restricting viral entry and viral protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kumar et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, TG inhibits respiratory viruses such as Influenza and coronaviruses by provoking a robust interferon response(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Al-Beltagi et al., 2021</xref>). Here, for the first time, we demonstrate that TG also inhibits EV-D68 infection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>). TG’s anti-EV-D68 activity seems unlikely to involve blocking viral entry, viral RNA replication, or inducing the type 1 interferon response since the drug treatment only marginally reduced EV-D68 intracellular titers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>). Instead, TG’s anti-EV-D68 activity involves limiting the non-lytic release of EV-D68 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>).</p>
<p>Although exactly how TG attenuates EV-D68 non-lytic release is unclear, we hypothesize that TG reduces EV-D68 nonlytic release by inducing ER Stress. Consistent with this hypothesis, the knockdown of SERCA2A, which induces ER stress, also reduces EV-D68 release (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Since EV-D68 infection blocks ER stress, as indicated by the decrease in XBP1 and BiP protein levels, and the lack of BiP induction when EV-D68-infected cells were treated with TG (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>), this suggests that ER stress is detrimental to EV-D68 release. Although we did not observe specific XBP1 or BiP cleavage products during EV-D68 infection, a recent study showed that PV and CVB3 induce cleavage of XBP1 at late time points during their infection(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Shishova et al., 2022</xref>). However, the study did not determine the specific mechanism of XBP1 cleavage. Nonetheless, decreasing full-length XBP1 and BiP levels during infection may be a common strategy employed by picornaviruses to avoid ER stress, which, as we have shown, is a negative for non-lytic release. While SIRT-1 is thought to negatively regulate Endoplasmic Reticulum stress (ER stress) by deacetylating X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1), we found that the deacetylase inactive mutant (SIRT-1 H363Y) increased EV-D68 release (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). This suggests a non-deacetylase role of SIRT-1 in ER stress, at least during picornavirus infection.</p>
<p>SIRT-1 was previously demonstrated to be essential for MERS-CoV infection(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Weston et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that the cellular protein is also crucial for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data show that, much like in the MERS-CoV study, the knockdown of SIRT-1 decreases SARS-CoV-2 release (Fig. S7C), suggesting that SIRT-1 may be a shared host factor utilized by many Betacoronaviruses.</p>
<p>Our data show that a portion of nuclear SIRT-1 re-localizes to the cytosol upon infection by EV-D68 and PV (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>, and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>). We also observe that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes SIRT-1 translocation to the cytosol (Fig S7A). These viruses require SIRT-1 for normal virus release. It will be interesting to examine whether other Betacoronaviruses alter the subcellular localization of SIRT-1 and whether SIRT-1 is important for their infection.</p>
<p>CVB3, which does not require SIRT-1, also fails to induce re-localization of the protein (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). This, along with the finding that SIRT-1 is found on virus-induced extracellular vesicles, suggests to us a central role for SIRT-1 in constructing virus-containing vesicles for extracellular release - but only for some viruses. Why at least one picornavirus has evolved a SIRT-1-independent mechanism for release and what the mechanism might be will help understand how to target specific viruses or broad classes of viruses to prevent their release from infected cells. While we believe SIRT-1 is a common regulator of virus release, it is not a universal one. Future work identifying a homolog, or paralog, protein playing a parallel role in CVB3 release, and understanding the relationship of CVB3 to ER stress, will undoubtedly shed light on the differences between these otherwise similar viruses.</p>
<p>In summary, our data show that SIRT-1 is essential for basal- and stress-induced autophagy and EV-mediated non-lytic release of EV-D68. We also demonstrated that SIRT-1 is crucial for releasing other important public health viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and PV, indicating that SIRT-1 may be a common host factor regulating multiple viruses’ release. Understanding how SIRT-1 regulates viral egress could open avenues for therapeutic intervention against many viruses.</p>

The transfection complexes were replaced with growth media at 6 h post-transfection. The cells were then used for viral infection or western blot for transfection efficiency determination.</p>

<title>Virus entry assays</title>
<p>Scramble and SIRT-1 knockdown cells were pre-chilled on ice for 30 minutes for viral binding assay. The cells were then infected with EV-D68 (MOI =30) for 1 h on ice. The inoculum was removed, and the cells were washed twice with PBS, scraped, freeze-thawed 3 times, and stored at -80°C for plaque assay. For viral entry, scramble and SIRT-1 knockdown cells were similarly pre-chilled on ice for 30 minutes and then infected with EV-D68 for 30 minutes on ice. The unbound viral particles were washed off with PBS before shifting the cells to 37°C, allowing viral entry for 1 h. The cells were finally washed with PBS, scraped into Eppendorf tubes, and prepared for plaque assay.</p>

<title>SARS-CoV-2 titer determination by plaque assay</title>
<p>Plaque assays were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Coleman and Frieman, 2015</xref>). Briefly, 12-well plates were seeded with 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> VeroT cells/well one day before processing. On the day of processing, media was removed from the 12-well plates, and 200 µl of dilutions of virus stock or collected cell supernatants in DMEM were added to each well. Plates were incubated at 37°C (5% CO<sup>2</sup>) for 1 hour with rocking every 15 minutes. Following incubation, 2 ml of plaque assay media, DMEM containing 0.1% agarose (UltraPure™) and 2% FBS (Gibco), was added to each well and incubated for 48 h at 37°C (5% CO<sup>2</sup>). Following incubation, plates were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with 0.25% crystal violet (w/v), plaques counted, and titers calculated as plaque-forming units (PFU)/ml.</p>

<title>siRNA Knockdown Protocol for SARS-CoV-2 infection</title>
<p>siRNA knockdown assays were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Weston et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, A549/hACE2 cells were seeded in 24-well cell culture plates one day before siRNA treatment. On the day of treatment, 4.4 µl Opti-MEM (Gibco) and 2.2 µl Oligofectamine (Thermo Scientific) were combined and incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. This mixture was then added to 35.5 µl Opti-MEM and 0.8µl of 50 µM siRNA and incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature. Following incubation, a further 177 µl of Opti-MEM was added to the transfection mixture, media were removed from cells, and 200 µl of transfection mixture was added. After a 4 h incubation at 37°C/5% CO<sup>2</sup>, 200 µl of DMEM (+20% FBS) was added to the cells resulting in a final concentration of 10% FBS. Cells were then incubated at 37°C/5% CO<sup>2</sup> overnight. Following incubation, cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (WA1, MOI = 0.01 for titer, MOI = 0.5 for IFA), and supernatants were collected 24 hours post-infection. SARS-CoV-2 titers from supernatants were determined by plaque assay.</p>

<p><bold>SIRT-1 in LC3 puncta formation and virus release</bold> H1HeLa cells were pretreated with 50 µM EX527 for 24 h, followed by 0.1 MOI EV-D68 infection. The intracellular (B) and extracellular (C) viral titers were determined by a plaque assay. (C) H1HeLa cells were transfected with scramble control or SIRT-1 siRNA for 24 h, after which the cells were reseeded and transfected with the DNA constructs for 24 h. The cells were then infected with EV-D68 (MOI =0.1) for 5 h. A plaque assay was used to determine the viral titer. (D) H1HeLa cells were transfected with either scramble or SIRT-1 siRNA for 48 h. GFP-LC3 transfection was initiated at 24 h post-siRNA transfection for 24 h. The cells were then fixed, and images were acquired with a revolve microscope.

<p>The presence or absence of a surrounding envelope, previously a clear distinguishing feature of different viruses, has been blurred by the recent recognition that many so-called 'nonenveloped' viruses are released from cells as quasi-enveloped virions cloaked in host cell membranes. This mechanism of viral egress allows for non-lytic infection, and has potentially <bold>important</bold> implications for pathogenesis. In this manuscript, Jassey and colleagues provide <bold>solid</bold> evidence that the protein deacetylase SIRT-1 is required for the non-lytic release of enteroviruses in extracellular vesicles.</p>

<p>The enteroviruses comprise a medically important genus in the large and diverse picornavirus family, and are known to be released without lysis from infected cells in large vesicles containing numerous RNA genome-containing capsids - a feature allowing for en bloc transmission of multiple viral genomes to newly infected cells that engulf these vesicles. SIRT-1 is an NAD-dependent protein deacetylase that has numerous and wide ranging effects on cellular physiology and homeostasis, and it is known to be engaged in cellular responses to stress and autophagy.</p>
<p>Jassey et al. show that RNAi depletion of SIRT-1 impairs the release of enterovirus D-68 (EV-D68) in EVs recovered from the supernatant fluids of infected cells using a commercial exosome isolation kit. The many functions attributed to SIRT-1 in the literature reflect its capacity to deacetylate various cell proteins engaged in transcription, DNA repair, and regulation of metabolism, apoptosis and autophagy. However, Jassey et al. make the surprising claim that the proviral role of SIRT-1 in promoting enterovirus release is not dependent on its deacetylase activity. Fig. S1C is crucial to this suggestion, as it is said to show that reconstituting expression with a catalytically-inactive mutant can rescue virus release from SIRT-1 depleted cells. However, no information is provided concerning the levels of endogenous and ectopically-expressed SIRT-1 proteins in this experiment, making it very difficult to interpret the results. Is the mutant SIRT-1 protein expressed at a higher level than the non-mutant protein? Is there a 'sponging' effect with these transfections that lessens the siRNA efficiency and reduces knockdown of the endogenous protein? Fig. S1B and Fig. 4C convincingly show that EX527, a small molecule inhibitor of the deacetylase activity of SIRT-1, inhibits extracellular release of the virus. This suggests that the deacetylase activity of SIRT-1 is in fact required for the proviral effect of SIRT-1. This is a fundamentally important question that will require more investigation.</p>
<p>Fig. 6 shows how SIRT-I knockdown impacts the release of enterovirus D68 in EVs recovered from cell culture supernatant using a commercial 'Total Exosome Isolation Kit'. The authors should describe the principle this kit exploits to isolate 'exosomes' (affinity isolation?) and specify which antibodies it involves (anti-phosphatidylserine, anti-CD63, others?) This could impact the outcome of these experiments, and moreover is important to include in the long-term scientific record. The authors are appropriately cautious in describing the vesicles they presume to be isolated by the kit as simply 'extracellular vesicles', since there are multiple types of EVs with very different mechanisms of biogenesis, of which 'exosomes' are but one specific type. It would have been more elegant had the authors shown that SIRT-1 is required for EV-D68 release in detergent-sensitive vesicles with low buoyant density in isopycnic gradients, and to characterize the size and number of viral capsids in these vesicles by electron microscopy.</p>
<p>Fig. 6 shows that SIRT-1 depletion upregulates CD63 expression, but has no apparent impact on the release of CD63-positive 'EVs' from uninfected cells. EV-D68 infection also upregulates CD63 expression in SIRT-1 replete cells, and in this case, increases the release of CD63-positive EVs. The combination of infection and SIRT-1 depletion massively upregulates CD63 expression, but appears to eliminate the enhanced release of CD63-positive EVs resulting from infection alone. These are interesting results, from which the authors infer CD63 is associated with EVs containing EV-D68. But, do we know this? Can a CD63 pulldown immunoprecipitate EV-D68 capsid proteins or viral RNA? CD63 is strongly associated with exosomes released from cells through the multi-vesicular body pathway, which are distinct from the LC3-positive EVs released by secretory autophagy that have previously been associated with enteroviruses. The authors suggest that 'knockdown of SIRT-1 may prevent the exocytosis of CD63-positive EVs&quot;, but this is a very broad claim (and not really demonstrated by Fig. 6): it requires a clearer definition of what the authors mean by 'exocytosis' and a much more detailed analysis of the size and buoyant density of EVs released in a SIRT-1-dependent process.</p>
<p>The authors suggest that almost all EV-D68 released from infected cells is released without cell lysis in EVs. However, they generally show data from only a single time point following infection (5 or 6 hrs post-infection). It would have been interesting to see a more complete temporal analysis, and to know whether a high proportion of virus continues to be released in EVs, or if it is swamped out ultimately by lytic release of nonenveloped virus.</p>
<p>Fig. 1D indicates that a small fraction of SIRT-1 leaks from the nucleus in EV-D68 infected cells. The authors suggest this is due to targeted nuclear export, rather than simply leaky nuclear pores which are well known to exist in enterovirus-infected cells. The authors present similar fluorescent microscopy data showing inhibition of TFEB export in leptomycin-B treated cells in Fig. S2A in support of their claim that this is specific SIRT-1 export, but these data are far from convincing - there is equivalent residual TFEB and SIRT-1 in the cytoplasm of the treated cells. Quantitative immunoblots of cytoplasmic and nuclear cell fractions might prove more compelling.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors should be more specific in describing the viruses they have studied (EV-D68 and PV). It would be preferable to describe these as 'enteroviruses' (including in the title of the manuscript), rather than more broadly as 'picornaviruses'. There is no certainty that the requirement for SIRT-1 in non-lytic release of virus extends to hepatoviruses or other picornaviral genera, for which mechanisms of nonlytic release may be quite different.</p>

<p>The authors aimed to connect SIRT-1 to EV-D68 virus release through mediating ER stress. They are successful in robustly connecting these pathways experimentally and show a new role for SIRT-1 in EV-D68 infection. These results extend to additional viruses, suggesting role(s) for SIRT-1 in diverse virus infection.</p>
<p>The authors note that EV-D68 does not significantly impact SIRT-1 protein levels (Fig 1E and F), though this has been described for other picornaviruses (Xander et al., J Immunol 2019; Han et al., J Cell Sci 2016; Kanda et al Biochem Biophys Res Commun 2015). This may be of interest to note in the manuscript.</p>
<p>The data regarding CVB3 (Fig S4) are especially interesting because they show no discernable impact on infection. The manuscript should describe this further and perhaps speculate on potential reasons. Could it be due to inefficient knockdown?</p>
<p>SIRT-1 (and other sirtuins) have been linked to an innate interferon response. Are any of the phenotypes observed here due to IFN responses? The use of H1HeLa cells would suggest this is not the case.</p>
