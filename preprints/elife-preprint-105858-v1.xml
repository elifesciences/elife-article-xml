<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Maize originated from teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> following a subspeciation event occurred in volcanic regions of Mesoamerica. The elucidation of the phenotypic changes that gave rise to maize have focused on the direct consequences of domestication, with no insights on how environmental factors could have influenced specific gene function and human selection. We explored the impact of heavy metal (HM) stress by exposing both subspecies to sublethal concentrations of copper and cadmium. We also assessed the genetic diversity of loci encompassing three HM response genes affected by domestication: <italic>ZmHMA1</italic>, <italic>ZmHMA7</italic> – encoding for heavy metal ATPases of the P1<sub>b</sub> family-, and <italic>ZmSKUs5,</italic> encoding a multicopper oxidase. <italic>ZmHMA1</italic> and <italic>ZmSKUs5</italic> map in the short arm of chromosome five, in a genomic region containing multiple linked QTLs with pleiotropic effects on domestication. A genomic analysis of the full chromosome shows that their loci show strong positive selection as compared to previously identified domestication genes. Exposure of teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> to HM stress results in a plant architecture reminiscent of extant maize, and upregulation of <italic>Teosinte branched1</italic> (<italic>Tb1</italic>) in the meristem. <italic>ZmHMA1</italic> and <italic>ZmHMA7</italic> are expressed throughout development and respond to HM stress in both subspecies. <italic>ZmHMA1</italic> is mainly involved in restricting plant height and optimizing the number of female inflorescences and seminal roots. Our results suggest that HM stress acted on specific ATPases involved in homeostasis, giving rise to phenotypic variants that were identified and selected by humans during domestication.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Driven by either conscious or unconscious human selection, domestication can be considered a gradual evolutionary process resulting in the adaptation to agroecological environments and anthropogenic preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Ross-Ibarra et al. 2007</xref>). In the case of plants, the obvious consequences of domestication are represented by visually recognizable traits that include changes in photoperiod response, reduced capacity of seed dispersion, reduced lateral branching, larger fruits or grains, reduced duration of seed dormancy, and increase in the size of female inflorescences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pickersgill 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Larson et al. 2014</xref>). Notably, research efforts to understand the phenotypic changes that gave rise to maize have mainly focused on the direct consequences of domestication in aerial organs and sometimes roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chen et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lopez-Valdivia et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Ren et al. 2022</xref>), with no emphasis on the role of adaptive environmental responses that, by acting on specific gene function, could have given rise to phenotypic traits that were identified and selected by humans.</p>
<p>It is generally accepted that domestication of maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic> ssp. <italic>mays</italic>) from teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> (<italic>Zea mays</italic> ssp. <italic>parviglumis</italic>) initiated in Mesoamerica around 9,000 years before present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Matsuoka et al. 2002</xref>). The initial evolutionary transition that resulted in the event of subspeciation most likely occurred within the Balsas river drainage, in regions geographically converging with the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, at the intersection of the States of Mexico, Guerrero, and Michoacan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Matsuoka et al. 2002</xref>). Although the nature of the initial phenotypic changes that allowed the emergence of primitive maize remains unclear, the most obvious architectural and morphological differences between both subspecies affect their vegetative and reproductive organs. Teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> generates numerous lateral branches ending in male inflorescences, while maize often has a few short or no lateral branches, not ending in male reproductive organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wills et al. 2013</xref>). Additionally, the seeds of teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> are covered by a hard glume that protects the kernel externally, while in maize glumes are reduced, soft and do not cover the kernel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Doebley and Stec 1993</xref>). Large scale efforts involving physical mapping and comparative genomic analysis have resulted in the identification of numerous regions showing differential nucleotide variability between teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> and the B73 reference maize genome. In some cases, mutations in genes located within those genomic regions result in phenotypes that reveal their involvement in domestication traits. One of the major genes affected by maize domestication is <italic>Teosinte branched1</italic> (<italic>Tb1</italic>), a transcription factor of the TCP family that controls lateral branching, sexual determination, and glume formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Doebley et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Martín-Trillo and Cubas 2010</xref>). <italic>Tb1</italic> acts as a repressor of lateral branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Studer et al. 2017</xref>), giving rise to maize plants usually composed of a single stem. Other genes involved in domestication include <italic>Teosinte glume architecture1 (Tga1)</italic>, <italic>ramosa2 (ra2)</italic> and <italic>Zea floricaula leafy2 (zfl2),</italic> among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bomblies and Doebley 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sigmon and Vollbrecht 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wang et al. 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>The importance of phenotypic plasticity is considered as likely relevant in the domestication history of crops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Ross-Ibarra et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lorant et al. 2020</xref>; Mueller et al., 2023); however, the role of environmental factors influencing their origins remains elusive and poorly investigated. A previous study showed that teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> grown under low temperatures and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations - reminiscent of those prevailing in the late Pleistocene and early Holocene - exhibit some phenotypes related to the domestication syndrome, including short branches, a single main stalk, and partially open seed fruitcases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Piperno et al. 2015</xref>; Piperno et al. 2019); however, the genetic basis of these changes have not been investigated. Although these results suggest that phenotypic plasticity could have influenced the domestication process, to this date there are no hints on how the adaptation to local environmental conditions could have affected specific gene function and guided human selection.</p>
<p>Recent genomic evidence indicates that admixture of maize with native teosinte <italic>mexicana</italic> populations (<italic>Zea mays</italic> ssp. <italic>mexicana</italic>) contributed to maize adaptation across a wide range of altitudes and latitudes in the American continent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Yang et al. 2023</xref>); however, the earliest maize macro-specimens found to date lack teosinte <italic>mexicana</italic> admixture and exhibit morphological attributes of fully domesticated cobs, indicating that <italic>mexicana</italic> is not a direct ancestor of maize and that its introgression occurred after initial divergence from teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Vallebueno-Estrada et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Acosta-Bayona et al. 2024</xref>). Consequently, the nature of the genetic factors that guided the emergence of maize remain largely unknown, and the initial phenotypic changes that caused the original divergence of these two subspecies have not been identified. It is also unknown if domestication initiated by direct action of human selection on teosinte natural standing variation, or if the response to specific environmental factors generated phenotypic changes that were identified and selected by humans to act on native teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> populations.</p>
<p>Maize can adapt to abiotic factors such as heavy metal (HM) stress through numerous mechanisms that prevail during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">AbdElgawad et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gallo-Franco et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Malenica et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gao et al. 2022</xref>). These include metal immobilization by mycorrhizal association, metal sequestration, or complexation by exuding organic compounds from roots, metal intracellular sequestration and compartmentalization in vacuoles. HMs include essential elements that are necessary for maize growth through enzymatic function, such as iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), magnesium (Mg), molybdenum (Mo), and copper (Cu); and non-essential elements like Cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), aluminum (Al), and selenium (Se). In general, HM stress leads to visibly reduced plant growth due to the reduced cell elongation and cell wall elasticity. At the molecular level, metal toxicity can disturb the cellular redox balance and lead directly or indirectly to oxidative stress and the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), shifting the redox balance to the pro-oxidative side until the antioxidative defense system allows a new balanced redox status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Smeets et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hall 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The comparison of the <italic>Palomero toluqueño</italic> and B73 genomes resulted in the identification of a large collection of identical sequence regions (IdSRs) with low nucleotide variability and transcriptional evidence of expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Vielle-Calzada et al. 2009</xref>). Putative domestication loci included <italic>ZmHMA1</italic> and <italic>ZmHMA7</italic>, two genes encoding members of the P1<sub>b</sub>-ATPases protein superfamily, also known as Heavy Metal ATPases (P-type ATPases) characterized by the generation of a phosphorylated intermediate during the transport reaction cycle. Members of this superfamily contain 8 to 12 transmembrane domains as well as conserved ATP binding, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Solioz and Vulpe 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Axelsen and Palmgren 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Voskoboinik et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Williams and Mills 2005</xref>). The superfamily can be divided in subfamilies that include H±ATPases (type 3<sub>A</sub>) in plants and fungi, Na+/K ATPases (type 2<sub>C/D</sub>) in animals, Ca2±ATPases (type 2<sub>A/B</sub>), and heavy metal (HM) transporting ATPases (type 1<sub>B</sub>) capable of transporting a large variety of HM cations across cell membranes. <italic>ZmHMA1</italic> and <italic>ZmHMA7</italic> are type 1<sub>B</sub> ATPases that include a conserved Cys-Pro-Cys/His/Ser motif within a transmembrane domain necessary for the translocation of HMs cations through the membrane channel. A third <italic>Palomero toluqueño</italic>/B73 IdSR included <italic>Skewed Root Growth Similar5</italic> (<italic>ZmSKUs5</italic>), a gene encoding a Skewed5 (SKU5)-similar (SKS) protein classified as a multi-copper oxidase containing cuperdoxin domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sedbrook et al. 2002</xref>). All three genes map to chromosome five (chr.5), with <italic>ZmHMA1</italic> and ZmSKUs<italic>5</italic> within a genomic region that fractionates into multiple QTLs under selection during the <italic>parviglumis</italic> to maize transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Doebley and Stec 1993</xref>; Lemmon and Doebley, 2014). Contrary to major domestication loci showing a single highly pleiotropic gene responsible for important domestication traits, in this chr.5 genomic region the smallest 1.5-LOD support interval contained more than 50 genes, suggesting that phenotypic effects are due to multiple linked QTLs (Lemmon and Doebley, 2014). While the functional characterization of all three maize genes remains elusive, the Arabidopsis and barley <italic>ZmHMA1</italic> homologs act during heavy metal transport in the chloroplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Boutigny et al. 2014</xref>), demonstrating their functional involvement in homeostasis.</p>
<p>To investigate a possible involvement of heavy metal response in the origin and domestication of maize, we compared the phenotypic changes that teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> and maize undergo when grown in the presence of sublethal concentrations of Cu and Cd. We show that teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> responds to HM stress by acquiring an aerial architecture reminiscent of extant maize, and that <italic>Tb1</italic> expression is upregulated in teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> meristems when grown under HM stress. A large-scale genomic analysis of nucleotide variability across maize chr.5 indicates that loci encompassing <italic>ZmHMA1</italic>, <italic>ZmHMA7</italic>, and <italic>ZmSKUs5</italic> show reduced nucleotide variability in maize as compared to teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic>. Both <italic>ZmHMA1</italic> and <italic>ZmHMA7</italic> are active throughout maize and teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> development, and their expression responds to HM stress. In addition, mutations in <italic>ZmHMA1</italic> show phenotypic defects related to the maize domestication syndrome, some of which are only manifested under exposure to HMs. Overall, our results indicate that the evolutionary transition that gave rise to extant maize was influenced by heavy metal stress through the activity of P1b-ATPases.</p>

<title>Teosinte parviglumis responds to heavy metal stress by acquiring an architecture reminiscent of extant maize</title>
<p>To compare HM response in teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> and maize, we exposed wild-type W22 maize inbred and CIMMYTMA 29791 teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> individuals to sublethal concentrations of Cu (400 mg/kg of CuSO<sub>4</sub>) and Cd (16mg/kg of CdCl<sub>2</sub>). CuSO<sub>4</sub> and CdCl<sub>2</sub> were homogenized in soil before transplant and grown under controlled greenhouse conditions. HM concentrations were based on preliminary dose responses that allowed maize plants to reach reproductive stages and complete their life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">AbdElgawad et al. 2020</xref>). As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Atta et al. 2023</xref>), maize individuals grown in the presence of HMs showed a significant reduction in aerial traits such as stem diameter, size of leaves, size and number of roots, and size of female inflorescences (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Tables 2</xref> and <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">S2</xref>). On average, stem diameter showed a reduction of about 17% as compared to plants grown in absence of HM stress (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1f</xref> to <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1j</xref>). Similarly, the length and width of developing leaves showed average reductions of 12%, and mature leaves of 6%. Reproductive traits such as the number of female inflorescences (NFI) and their average weight (WFI) showed a significant reduction (NFI = 1.20 ± 0.42 in absence of HMs and NFI = 0.70 ± 0.67 in presence of HMs; WFI = 40.06 ± 14.39 in absence of HMs and WFI = 37.75 ± 18.83 in presence of HMs; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). As expected, the most significant effects occurred in the root system, with a significant increase in the number of brace roots under HMs (NBR = 12.90 ± 4.33 in absence of HMs; NBR = 16.30 ± 4.99 in presence of HMs; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), and a significant decrease in their length (LBR = 16.15 ± 9.75 cm in absence of HMs; LBR = 4.00 ± 2.04 cm in presence of HMs; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The number and length of crown roots were reduced on average by 33% and 18%, respectively (NCR = 11.30 ± 2.11 in absence of HMs; NCR = 7.60 ± 0.97 in presence of HMs; LCR = 58.90 ± 21.87 cm in absence of HMs; LCR = 48.85 ± 11.80 cm in presence of HMs; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Nodal roots also showed a significant reduction in their number and length (NNR = 10.50 ± 2.27 in absence of HMs; NNR = 6.70 ± 2.79 in presence of HMs; LNR = 87.20 ± 16.80 cm in absence of HMs; LNR = 55.30 ± 21.10 cm in presence of HMs; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Tables 2</xref> and <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">S2</xref>). By contrast, the number (NSR) and length (LSR) of seminal roots was significantly increased in the presence of HMs (NSR = 4.10 ± 1.45 in absence of HMs; NSR = 6.60 ± 1.35 in presence of HMs; LSR = 27.70 ± 13.38 cm in absence of HMs; LSR = 43.50 ± 14.01 cm in presence of HMs<bold>)</bold> when measured 50 days after transplant (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Interestingly, teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> exhibited a maize-like phenotype when grown in the presence of HMs, with complete absence of tillering in most plants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref>, <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">S1</xref> and <xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">S3</xref>). From a total of 30 plants tested, 28 showed total absence of tillering, and two initiated secondary stems during vegetative stages but arrested their growth early during development, resulting in the presence of a single dominant stem at reproductive stages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref> to <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Additionally, all 30 plants tested showed complete absence or residual lateral branching, with unusual proliferation of female inflorescences arising from independent axillary meristems in primary stems (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e</xref>). This significant increase in the number of female inflorescences clustered within a single stem (NFI = 1.80 ± 0.63 in absence of HMs; NFI = 3.90 ± 1.66 in presence of HMs; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) was associated with shorter flowering time as compared with normal growing conditions in absence of HMs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>). In addition, teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> grown in the presence of HMs showed significantly reduced leaf length (LIL = 71.30 ± 11.32 cm in absence of HMs; 56.25 ± 7.80 cm in presence of HMs; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The absence of lateral branches resulted in lower values of aerial dry weight (DWAP = 133.49 ± 28.28 gr in the absence of HMs; DWAP = 82.72 ± 11.67 gr in presence of HMs; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> grown under HMs showed a significant reduction in the length of brace roots (LBR = 20.00 ± 11.49 cm in absence of HMs; LBR = 2.88 ± 0.66 cm in presence of HMs; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), but no significant changes in their number. The number and length of crown and nodal roots was not affected by HM stress, nor did the presence of HMs modify the absence of seminal roots intrinsic to teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> accessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Perkins and Lynch 2021</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the response of maize and teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> to HM stress can give rise to phenotypes previously shown to distinguish both subspecies at the light of the domestication syndrome.</p>

<title>Genomic regions encompassing ZmHMA1, ZmHMA7 and ZmSKUs5 show reduced nucleotide variability in extant maize as compared to teosinte parviglumis</title>
<p><italic>ZmHMA1</italic> and <italic>ZmSKU5</italic> mapped 52.1 and 41.8 cM, respectively, in a genetic map of chr.5 calculated to be 86.64 cM, with an average megabase pair to centimorgan ratio of 1.873 Mbp/cM (Lemmon and Doebley, 2014; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>). The corresponding mapping population used isogenic recombinant inbred lines (NIRILs) with informative cross-over events concentrated in the region of interest and replicated phenotypic assessments in block experiments. Multiple QTLs were detected in a region spanning across 82 cM, none with single large effect genes such as those found in other chromosomes (Wang et al., 2005; Studer et al. 2011; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wills et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that several associated domestication traits are due to multiple linked QTLs of small effect (Lemmon and Doebley, 2014). The location of <italic>ZmSKU5</italic> overlaps with a single wide 1.5-LOD support interval that spreads across 50.6 cM (number of kernels per rank; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>). By contrast, <italic>ZmHMA1</italic> overlaps with a contiguous region containing no less than five QTL 1.5- LOD support intervals (ear diameter; number of kernels per rank; percentage of staminate spikelets; tassel branch number; and tillering index; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine if the regulatory and coding regions of <italic>ZmHMA1, ZmHMA7,</italic> and <italic>ZmSKUs5</italic> were affected by human selection, we calculated their level of nucleotide variability based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for all extant maize and teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> accessions included in the diversity panel HapMap3, using the corresponding sequences of <italic>Tripsacum dactyloides</italic> as an outgroup. The levels of the nucleotide variability index - π(m) and π(t) for maize and teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic>, respectively - were determined in bins of 100 nt using VCFtools, including alignments encompassing a genomic region that included 15 kb upstream of the START codon, the corresponding coding region for each gene, and 15 kb downstream of the STOP codon (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="tbls4" ref-type="table">Table S4</xref>). In the case of <italic>ZmHMA1</italic>, the upstream region values were π(m)= 0.00071 and π(t)= 0.00870, and for the downstream region, π(m)=0.00097 and π(t)=0.00248. By contrast, the <italic>ZmHMA1</italic> coding sequence showed low values in both subspecies: π(m)= 0.0050 and π(t)= 0.00106. These results indicate that human selection in the <italic>ZmHMA1</italic> locus preferentially affected its upstream and downstream regulatory regions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref> and <xref rid="tbls4" ref-type="table">Table S4</xref>). Interestingly, although maize π values are at least one order of magnitude lower than π values in teosinte, π(t) values are also one order of magnitude lower than π values of <italic>Tripsacum sp</italic>., suggesting that a genetic bottleneck also affected teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> in these loci. <italic>ZmHMA7</italic> showed contrasting values of π(m) and π(t) across the entire coding sequence and its regulatory regions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). For the upstream region, values were π(m)= 0.0009 and π(t)=0.00411; for the <italic>ZmHMA7</italic> coding region, π(m)= 0.00015 and π(t)= 0.00148; and for the downstream region, π(m)=0.00066 and π(t)=0.00454. <italic>ZmSKUs5</italic> also showed contrasting nucleotide variability in the entire coding and flanking regions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref> and <xref rid="tbls4" ref-type="table">Table S4</xref>). Values were π(m)= 0.0011 and π(t)= 0.00735 for the upstream region, π(m)= 0.00044 and π(t)= 0.00754 for the coding sequence, and π(m)=0.00203 and π(t)=0.00626 for the downstream region (<xref rid="tbls4" ref-type="table">Table S4</xref>). For all three genes, similar π values in the coding region of maize landraces and improved lines indicates that the loss of nucleotide variability occurred during the teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> to maize transition, and not during subsequent contemporary breeding (<xref rid="tbls4" ref-type="table">Table S4</xref>).

The analysis was conducted using 100 bp bins and sliding windows of 50 bp; for a total of 385,829 bins in the case of chr.5 domestication genes, and 2,373,010 bins for neutral genes. As shown in <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>, the levels of nucleotide variability in the three candidate genes and their six neighboring loci are significantly reduced in maize landraces as compared to teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> inbred lines. When compared to the full neutral gene set of chr.5, this reduction is more severe than the reduction affecting 304 previously identified domestication genes, confirming the exceptional selective pressure that was imposed in those three loci during the evolutionary transition from teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> to extant maize.</p>

<p>To elucidate the expression patterns of <italic>ZmHMA1</italic> and <italic>ZmHMA7</italic>, we conducted reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) in leaves, stems, roots, and flowers at two vegetative (V2 and V6) and one reproductive (R1) developmental stage, in teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> and wild-type W22 maize individuals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>). In the case of maize, <italic>ZmHMA1</italic> was expressed in leaves, stems, roots and flowers throughout development in either absence or presence of HMs. <italic>ZmHMA7</italic> was also expressed in aerial organs throughout development in both absence and presence of HMs but was not expressed in roots at reproductive stage R1.

<title>ZmHMA1 null mutant individuals show phenotypic defects related to the domestication syndrome</title>
<p>Transposon <italic>Mu</italic> insertional lines have been widely used to elucidate gene function in maize. To elucidate the function of <italic>ZmHMA1</italic>, we phenotypically analyzed <italic>LANMu1029790</italic>, a 4- generation backcross of line <italic>mu1029790</italic> into the W22 background selected for single copy insertions in <italic>ZmHMA1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">McCarty et al. 2005</xref>). In <italic>LANMu1029790,</italic> a single <italic>Mu</italic> insertion is in the first exon of <italic>ZmHMA1</italic>, 65 bp downstream of the START codon (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). RT- PCR analysis showed that expression of Z<italic>mHMA1</italic> is completely absent in homozygous individuals for the <italic>LANMu1029790</italic> insertion (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref>), confirming that the corresponding mutant is a null allele.

<p>To determine the function of <italic>ZmHMA1</italic> in maize, we compared the phenotype of wild-type W22 and homozygous <italic>zmhma1-m1</italic> individuals at the reproductive R1 stage (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Under normal growing conditions, homozygous <italic>zmhma1-m1</italic> individuals generated significantly less leaves than wild-type (NL = 13.4 ± 0.84 in wild-type, and NL = 11.4 ± 0.84 in <italic>zmhma1-m1; P&lt;0.001</italic>). Whereas the length of mutant leaves was smaller than wild-type (LML = 77.4 ± 6.64 cm in wild-type, and LML = 69.85 ± 9.18 cm in <italic>zmhma1-m1</italic>), their width was significantly larger (WML = 6.75 ± 1.3 cm in wild-type, and WML = 9.75 ± 1.4 cm in <italic>zmhma1-m1</italic>; P&lt;0.001), resulting in an increase of the total dry weight of aerial organs in mutant plants (DWAP = 18.43 ± 8.04 grams in wild-type, and DWAP = 28.46 ± 9.54 grams in <italic>zmhma1-m1</italic>). Homozygous <italic>zmhma1</italic>-<italic>m1</italic> individuals also produced significantly more female inflorescences per plant (NFI = 1.2 ± 0.42 in wild-type, and NFI = 1.9 ± 0.32 in <italic>zmhma1</italic>; P&lt;0.001) a difference that reflected in the total dry weight of female inflorescences per plant (WFI = 40.06 ± 14.39 gr in wild-type and WFI = 69.5 ± 11.2 gr in <italic>zmhma1</italic>; P&lt;0.001); and significantly more spikes per male inflorescence (NSB = 9 ± 1.63 in wild-type, and NSB = 13.4 ± 2.32 in <italic>zmhma1-m1</italic>; P&lt;0.001). Interestingly, the general length of roots was significantly smaller in homozygous <italic>zmhma1-m1</italic> individuals, in particular nodal roots (LNR = 87.2 ± 16.8 cm in wild-type, and LNR = 50.9 ± 12.83 cm in <italic>zmhma1-m1</italic>; P&lt;0.001); however, mutant plants showed a significant increase in the number of seminal roots per plant (NSR = 4.1 ± 1.45 in wild-type, and NSR = 7.3 ± 1.16 in <italic>zmhma1-m1</italic>; P&lt;0.001). When wild-type and mutant individuals were grown under HM stress, differences in the size of leaves, number of female inflorescences per plant, and number of spikes per male inflorescence were maintained. In addition, mutant individuals exposed to HM stress were significantly taller than wild-type (HEI = 82.2 ± 34.94 cm in wild-type, and HEI = 125.9 ± 18.81 cm in <italic>zmhma1-m1</italic>; P&lt;0.01). In addition, total root and seminal root length were equivalent in wild-type and mutant individuals, mainly because the length of wild-type roots was significantly reduced under HM stress; however, the number of seminal roots was again significantly higher in mutant individuals (NSR = 6.6 ± 1.35 in wild-type, and NSR = 8.2 ± 1.62 in <italic>zmhma1-m1</italic>; P&lt;0.05). These results indicate that in maize aerial organs, <italic>ZmHMA1</italic> is involved in promoting leaf growth, restricting the number of female inflorescences per plant, and restricting the number of spikes in male inflorescences.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although the evolutionary transition from teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> to maize resulted in important phenotypic divergence between landraces and their wild progenitor, the relevance of teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> phenotypic plasticity and its genetic consequences during domestication remain poorly understood. Our study offers the first evidence showing that a specific environmental factor (heavy metal stress) influenced specific gene function (heavy metal response ATPases) and human selection during the <italic>parviglumis</italic> to maize transition. The comparison of HM responses between both subspecies indicates that teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> phenotypically responds to HM stress acquiring phenotypes reminiscent of maize. Whereas low temperatures and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations also caused a significant decrease in lateral branching, these environmental response has not been related to specific gene function and human selection. The absence of tillering exhibited by teosinte <italic>parviglumi</italic>s under HM stress was not reported under conditions simulating an early Holocene environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Piperno et al., 2015</xref>). Our results also show an increase in the number of female inflorescences per plant. This HM stress-dependent proliferation of several closely associated female inflorescences in a single teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> stem has not been previously reported. Female inflorescences arose from individual axillary meristems in multiple internodes, significantly increasing teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> seed yield. Our evidence indicates that HM stress revealed a teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> environmental plasticity that is directly related to the function of specific HM response genes that were affected by domestication through human selection.</p>
<p>We also show that <italic>ZmHMA1</italic>, <italic>ZmHMA7</italic> and <italic>ZmSKUs5</italic> exhibit reduced genetic diversity in extant maize as compared to teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic>, suggesting that all three loci were affected by the evolutionary transition that gave rise to maize. The maize regulatory region and downstream 3’ area of the <italic>ZmHMA1</italic> locus exhibit pronounced reduction in SNPs compared to teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> lines, likely affecting the molecular scope of its regulatory proteins, including transcription factors of the TCP family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Martín-Trillo and Cubas 2010</xref>). By contrast, <italic>ZmHMA7</italic> and <italic>ZmSKUs5</italic> showed a selective sweep across the entire maize locus. Although loss of genetic diversity is usually the result of human selection during domestication, it can also represent a consequence of natural selective pressures favoring fitness of specific teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> allelic variants better adapted to environmental changes and subsequently affected by human selection during the domestication process. The significant reduction of nucleotide variability in the <italic>ZmHMA1</italic> locus of teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> suggests that indeed that a natural selection pressure Examples of edaphological factors driving genetic divergence in the teosintes or maize include local adaptation to phosphorus concentration in <italic>mexicana</italic> and <italic>parviglumis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aguirre-Liguori et al. 2019</xref>), and fast maize adaptation to changing iron availability through the action of genes involved in its mobilization, uptake, and transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Benke and Stich 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The maize genome contains 12 genes encoding for members of the P1b family of ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cao et al. 2019</xref>).

Initial studies suggested that <italic>ZmHMA1</italic> is expressed at low levels in vegetative, reproductive or root organs throughout development, contrary to <italic>ZmHMA7</italic> that is strongly expressed in developing seeds 10 days after pollination; however, both genes appeared downregulated in plants grown under either Cu or Cd stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Zhiguo et al. 2018</xref>).

In Arabidopsis and barley, the corresponding <italic>ZmHMA1</italic> structural homologs (<italic>AtHMA1</italic> and <italic>HvHMA1</italic>, respectively) can transport a wide range of metals into the chloroplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mikkelsen et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Boutigny et al. 2014</xref>). In the case of the Arabidopsis structural homolog of ZmHMA7, AtHMA7 (also called RAN1) is proposed to act as a metallochaperone located in the Golgi apparatus, delivering Cu to the ethylene receptor located in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hirayama et al. 1999</xref>). Our evidence complements previous studies by showing that, in maize, <italic>ZmHMA1</italic> root expression is restricted to vegetative developmental stages, and that <italic>ZmHMA7</italic> is expressed in roots in response to HM stress. We also show through qPCR analysis that, under HM stress, the expression of both <italic>ZmHMA1</italic> and <italic>ZmHMA7</italic> is upregulated in teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> primary roots of 4- week-old plantlets. Overall, these results confirm that both <italic>ZmHMA1</italic> and <italic>ZmHMA7</italic> are heavy metal response genes active throughout teosinte and maize development.</p>
<p>In maize, the phenotypic analysis of null mutant individuals indicates that <italic>ZmHMA1</italic> is involved in the control of aerial and underground developmental traits, some of which are related to important functional adaptations that distinguish maize from its wild ancestor. In addition to changes in leaf number, leaf length, and number of spikes per male inflorescence, <italic>zmhma1-m1</italic> mutant individuals grown under normal edaphological conditions showed a significant increase in the number of female inflorescences per plant, a significant reduction in the length of nodal roots, and a significant increase in the number of seminal roots per plant. Whereas the promotion of nodal root growth is a distinctive trait of maize phenotypic plasticity and adaptation, previous studies showed that contrary to maize, plants of teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> lack seminal roots. This absence is also characteristic of paleobotanical maize specimens dating more than 5,000 years before present, confirming that the acquisition of seminal roots is an important trait acquired during domestication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lopez-Valdivia et al. 2022</xref>). The presence of seminal roots distinguishes extant maize from the teosintes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Burton et al. 2013</xref>), suggesting a possible involvement in domestication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Perkins and Lynch 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lopez-Valdivia et al. 2022</xref>). Our results suggest that the allelic variants of the <italic>ZmHMA1</italic> locus selected during domestication could have contributed to promote seminal root formation in maize, optimizing their number in accordance to seed endosperm availability and carbohydrate reserves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Perkins and Lynch 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lopez-Valdivia et al. 2022</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>ZmHMA1</italic> plays an important role in contributing to restricting plant height in response to HM stress, a phenotype that is also an important distinction between teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> and maize. Taken together, these results indicate that <italic>ZmHMA1</italic> function was involved in the phenotypic transition from teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> to maize through the influence of HM stress; however, a better definition of its role in the origin and domestication of maize will require a functional analysis of the <italic>ZmHMA1</italic> teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> homolog, and a detailed molecular analysis of the corresponding allelic variants and their phenotypic effects in both subspecies.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Ideas and Speculation</title>
<p>Our results point to an evolutionary model in which environmental changes in the form of edaphological HM stress imposed natural selective forces that acted on native teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> populations, causing phenotypic responses and a severe genetic bottleneck (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4</xref>). Adapted plants developed phenotypic traits such as shorter height and emergence of seminal roots, progressively giving raise to primitive maize individuals with reduced genetic variation in HM response genes such as <italic>ZmHMA1</italic>. The subsequent action of human selection caused a drastic reduction in allelic variation of heavy metal response genes, and genetic fixation of the resulting domestication traits.</p>
<p>The most important source of HMs in ancient soils of Mesoamerica is volcanic activity through short- and long-term effects related to ores, hydrothermal water flow and ash deposits. The history of eruptive activity in the Trans Mexican Volcanic Belt during the early Holocene coincides with the temporal estimation of initial stages in the evolutionary transition that gave rise to maize. Intense and recurrent eruptions occurred 24,000 to 6,000 years ago near the region of the Balsas River basin presumed to be the cradle of maize domestication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Matsuoka et al. 2002</xref>; Macias 2005). Located less than 100 Km from the region that harbors the natural teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> populations most closely related to maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Matsuoka et al. 2002</xref>), the Nevado de Toluca volcano underwent four major eruptions approximately 24100, 12100, 10500, and 8500 years before present (yr BP; Macias 2005), causing in the region a period of climatic instability that lasted until 8500 yr BP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ludlow-Wiechers et al., 2005</xref>). Could volcanic eruptions during the early Holocene have modified soil composition and influence the initial evolutionary transition from teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> to primitive maize? The possibility of environmental cues influencing maize emergence was mentioned by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Benz and Iltis (1992)</xref>, but not in relation to volcanic activity. Deciphering the ancient DNA sequence of HM response genes such as <italic>ZmHMA1</italic> in paleobotanical maize specimens found in Central Mexico could help determine if its genetic diversity was already reduced by 5,300 to 6,200 yr BP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ramos-Madrigal et al., 2016</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Vallebueno-Estrada et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Benz, 2001</xref>). Our results open the possibility for environmental changes caused by volcanic activity acting as a driving force in the selection of loci involved in adaptive responses such as heavy metal tolerance.</p>

<p>The SNP collection of maize chromosome 5 was analyzed on the basis of the HapMap V3.2.1 dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bukowski et al. 2018</xref>), selecting individuals from maize landraces (LR) (<xref rid="tbls6" ref-type="table">Table S6</xref>) and teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> inbred line accessions (Teo; <xref rid="tbls7" ref-type="table">Table S7</xref>). A sliding window diversity (π) was calculated using VCFtools v0.1.13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Danecek et al. 2011</xref>) with a window size of 100 bp (--window-pi 100) and a sliding step of 50 bp (--window-pi-step 50). Regions under selection were extracted from a list of 304 genes with domestication-related selection signatures across the whole chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hufford et al. 2012</xref>; Tables S8), for a total of 385,829 sliding windows (Table S9 and S10). A second set of neutral gene regions comprising 2,373,010 windows was also extracted across the entirety of chromosome 5. These two collections were compared to <italic>ZmHMA1</italic> (GRMZM2G067853), <italic>ZmHMA7</italic> (GRMZM2G029951), and <italic>ZmSKUs5</italic> (GRMZM2G076985), encompassing 2,743 windows (Table S11 and S12). Additionally, we analyzed genetic diversity in the neighboring regions of these candidate genes, which included six genes (<italic>GRMZM2G701784</italic>, <italic>GRMZM2G014508</italic>, <italic>GRMZM2G367857</italic>, <italic>GRMZM2G375607</italic>, <italic>GRMZM2G374375</italic>, and <italic>GRMZM2G067883</italic>), totaling 3,088 windows.

<title>Gene expression analysis</title>
<p>Leaves, stems, tassels, female inflorescences, as well as primary, nodal, and crown roots were manually isolated, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 4°C. Total RNA was extracted using TRIZOL (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). For reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), RNA was converted to coding DNA using the One-step RT-PCR kit (QIAGEN, USA). The full list of primers is presented in Table S8. <italic>ZmCDK</italic> was used as a positive control. PCR amplification was conducted using the following parameters: at 94°C for 5 min.; 94°C 30 sec., 60°C 30 sec., 72°C 1 min. for 35 cycles; final stop after 72°C for 10 min. For quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), total RNA was isolated from 4-week-old meristems using TRIZOL. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using 4 μg of total RNA, 10 mM oligodTs and Superscript reverse transcriptase II (Invitrogen, USA). Primers for PCR were designed using the online program Primer 3 Plus (v.0.4.0) and verified with Oligocalculator (Sigma Chemical, St Louis MO) to discard dimer formation. PCR efficiencies of target and reference gene were determined by generating standard curves based on serial dilutions prepared for cDNA templates. PCR efficiency was calculated according to the slope of the standard curve (primers with 100% efficiency, the fold equals 2). Each quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) reaction was performed in a 10 μl volume consisting of 5 μl of 23 SYBR Green PCR reaction Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). 3.5 μl of the DNA template (100 ng/ml), 0.5 μl of the forward primer (5 mM), 0.5 μl of the reverse primer (5 mM), and 0.5 μl of ultrapure water. The qPCR reactions were performed using the CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR detection System and the data were analyzed using the Bio-Rad CFX Manager software v3.1. The thermal profile consisted of 10 min at 95°C, 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95°C, and 1 min at 60°C. Amplification results were collected at the end of the extension step. Primer sequences for qPCR amplification are listed in <xref rid="tbls7" ref-type="table">Table S7</xref>.

<p>This study presents a <bold>valuable</bold> investigation into how heavy metal stress may have influenced the domestication of maize from its wild ancestor, teosinte parviglumis, focusing on specific ATPase genes with proposed roles in heavy metal homeostasis. The evidence supporting the main claims is <bold>incomplete</bold>, with suggestive but not definitive data linking gene function to domestication traits, and limited environmental context for the hypothesized selection pressures. While the work introduces an interesting model connecting environmental stress responses to evolutionary transitions and highlights underexplored aspects of teosinte plasticity, the conclusions would benefit from more comprehensive analyses such as transcriptomics, a broader survey of loci, and stronger paleoenvironmental validation. The study will be of interest to researchers in plant evolution and domestication, but currently lacks the analytical depth to fully support its central hypothesis.</p>

<p>In this study, Acosta-Bayona et al. aim to better understand how environmental conditions could have influenced specific gene functions that may have been selected for during the domestication of teosinte parviglumis into domesticated maize. The authors are particularly interested in identifying the initial phenotypic changes that led to the original divergence of these two subspecies. They selected heavy metal (HM) stress as the condition to investigate. While the justification for this choice remains speculative, paleoenvironmental data would add value; the authors hypothesize that volcanic activity near the region of origin could have played a role.</p>
<p>The authors exposed both maize and teosinte parviglumis to a fixed dose of copper and cadmium, representing an essential and a non-essential element, respectively. They assessed shoot and root phenotypic traits at a defined developmental stage in plants exposed to HM stress versus controls. They then focused on three genes already known to help plants manage HM stress: ZmHMA1, ZmHMA7, and ZmSKUs5. Two of these genes are located in a genomic region linked to traits selected during domestication. A closer examination of nucleotide variability in the coding and flanking regions of these genes provided evidence of selective pressure among teosinte parviglumis, maize, and the outgroup Tripsacum dactyloides.</p>
<p>They further generated a null mutant for ZmHMA1 and showed, for the first time in maize, a pleiotropic phenotype reminiscent of traits associated with the domestication syndrome. Finally, using qPCR, they reported increased expression of the domestication gene Teosinte branched1 (tb1) in teosinte parviglumis under HM stress. Comparative studies focusing on teosinte parviglumis and the genes ZmHMA1, ZmHMA7, and ZmSKUs5 under HM stress are limited; thus, this phenotypic characterization provides a promising starting point for further understanding the genetic basis of the response.</p>
<p>The dataset is of good quality, but the conclusions are not sufficiently supported by the data. Analyses should be expanded, and additional experiments included to strengthen the findings.</p>
<p>(1) Although the paper presents some interesting findings, it is difficult to distinguish which observations are novel versus already known in the literature regarding maize HM stress responses. The rationale behind focusing on specific loci is often lacking. For example, a statistically significant region identified via LOD score on chromosome 5 contains over 50 genes, yet the authors focus on three known HM-related genes without discussing others in the region. It is unclear why ZmHMA1 was selected for mutagenesis over ZmHMA7 or ZmSKUs5.</p>
<p>(2) The idea that HM stress impacted gene function and influenced human selection during domestication is of interest. However, the data presented do not convincingly link environmental factors with human-driven selection or the paleoenvironmental context of the transition. While lower nucleotide diversity values in maize could suggest selective pressure, it is not sufficient to infer human selection and could be due to other evolutionary processes. It is also unclear whether the statistical analysis was robust enough to rule out bias from a narrow locus selection. Furthermore, the addition of paleoclimate records (Paleoenvironmental Data Sources as a starting point) or conducting ecological niche modeling or crop growth models incorporating climate and soil scenarios would strengthen the arguments.</p>
<p>(3) Despite the interest in examining HM stress in maize and the presence of a pleiotropic phenotype, the assessment of the impact of gene expression is limited. The authors rely on qPCR for two ZmHMA genes and the locus tb1, known to be associated with maize architecture. A transcriptomic analysis would be necessary to 1- strengthen the proposed connection and 2- identify other genes with linked QTLs, such as those in the short arm of chromosome 5.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work explores the phenotypic developmental traits associated with Cu and Cd responses in teosinte parviglumis, a species evolutionary related to extant maize crops. Cu and Cd could serve as a proxy for heavy metals present in the soils. The manuscript explores potential genetic loci associated with heavy metal responses and domestication identified in previous studies. This includes heavy metal transporters, which are unregulated during stress. To study that, the authors compare the plant architecture of maize defective in ZmHMA1 and speculate on its association with domestication.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Very few studies covered the responses of teosintes to heavy metal stress. The physiological function of ZmHMA1 in maize also gives some novelty in this study. The idea and speculation section is interesting and well-implemented.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors explored Cu/Cd stress but not a more comprehensive panel of heavy metals, making the implications of this study quite narrow. Some techniques used, such as end-point RT-PCR and qPCR, are substandard for the field. The phenotypic changes explored are not clearly connected with the potential genetic mechanisms associated with them, with the exception of nodal roots. If teosintes in response to heavy metal have phenotypic similarity with modern landraces of maize, then heavy metal stress might have been a confounding factor in the selection of maize and not a potential driving factor. Similar to the positive selection of ZmHMA1 and its phenotypic traits. In that sense, there is no clear hypothesis of what the authors are looking for in this study, and it is hard to make conclusions based on the provided results to understand its importance. The authors do not provide any clear data on the potential influence of heavy metals in the field during the domestication of maize. The potential role of Tb-1 is not very clear either.</p>

<p>The selection of heavy metal stress as the condition to investigate is not speculative. The elucidation of the genome from the <italic>Palomero toluqueño</italic> maize landrace revealed heavy metal effects during domestication (Vielle-Calzada et al., 2009). Differences concordant with its ancient origin identified chromosomal regions of low nucleotide variability that contained the three domestication loci included in this study; all three are involved in heavy-metal detoxification. Results presented in Vielle-Calzada et al 2009 indicated that environmental changes related to heavy metal stress were important selective forces acting on maize domestication. Our study expands those results by starting to elucidate the function of these heavy metal response genes and their role in the evolutionary transition from teosinte parviglumis to maize.</p>

<p>We appreciate the value of this comment. We will modify the manuscript to clearly show which phenotypic observations are novel and which were previously reported for maize grown under HM stress. The rationale for focusing on three specific loci is related to results from Vielle-Calzada et al. 2009 (see comment above). Although we demonstrated that these three loci show unusual reduction in genetic variability when compared to the rest of chromosome 5 – including a separate class of genes previously identified as being affected by domestication (Hufford et al., 2012) -, we will expand the genetic and expression analysis to all genes included in a region precisely defined via LOD scores of five QTL 1.5-LOD support intervals that overlap with <italic>ZmHMA1</italic>.Within this region of 1.5 to 2 Mb, we will compare nucleotide variability and gene expression in response to HMs. Contrary to major domestication loci showing a single highly pleiotropic gene responsible for important domestication traits, in this chr.5 genomic region phenotypic effects are due to multiple linked QTLs (Lemmon and Doebley, 2014). The mutagenic analysis of <italic>ZmHMA7</italic> and <italic>ZmSKUs5</italic> will be included in a different publication; we can anticipate that the results reinforce the conclusions of this study.</p>

<p>We agree that lower nucleotide diversity values in maize are not sufficient to infer human selection and could be due to other evolutionary processes. As a matter of fact, since these same HM response loci also show unusually low nucleotide variability in teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> (Fig 2), we cannot discard the possibility that natural selection forces related to environmental changes could have affected native teosinte <italic>parviglumis</italic> populations in the early Holocene, before maize emergence. This possibility supports a speculative model suggesting that phenotypic changes caused by HM stress could have preceded human selection and its consequences, contributing to initial subspeciation; the model is proposed in the “Ideas and Speculation” section of the manuscript. Fortunately, as suggested by the reviewer, a large body of paleoclimatic records and paleoenvironmental data is available for the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt  in the Holocene, including geographic regions where the emergence of maize presumably occurred. We will include an extensive analysis of available paleoenvironmental data and discuss it at the light of our current results regarding the effects of HM stress. We are also expanding the physical range of our statistical analysis to cover at least 60 Kb per locus - including neighboring genes for all three loci - to determine if our results could be due to narrow locus selection.</p>

<p>Although real-time qPCR is an accurate and reliable approach to assess the expression of specific genes such as <italic>ZMHMA1</italic> and <italic>Tb1</italic>, we will explore the possibility of complementing our analysis with available RNA-seq results that are pertinent for this study (see for example Li et al., 2022 and Zhang et al., 2024) and further explore causative effects between HM stress, <italic>Tb1</italic> and <italic>ZmHMA1</italic> expression. As also pointed by Reviewer#1, TEs are known to influence gene expression under abiotic stress and RNA-Seq analysis would allow to determine if TE activity could lead to similar outcomes.</p>

<p>Thank you for these comments. We will clearly emphasize our hypothesis that HM stress was an important factor driving the emergence of maize from teosinte <italic>parvglumis</italic> through action of HM response genes. A comprehensive panel of heavy metals would not be more accurate in terms of simulating the composition of volcanic soils evolving across 9,000 years in the region where maize presumably emerged. Copper (Cu) and cadmium (Cu) correspond each to a different affinity group for proteins of the ZmHMA family. ZmHMA1 has preferential affinity for Cu and Ag (silver), whereas ZmHMA7 has preferential affinity to Cd, Zn (zinc), Co (cobalt), and Pb (lead). Since these P1b-ATPase transporters mediate the movement of divalent cations, their function remains consistent regardless of the specific metal tested, provided it belongs to the respective affinity group. By applying sublethal concentrations of Cd (16 mg/kg) and Cu (400 mg/kg), we caused a measurable physiological response while allowing plants to complete their life cycle, including the reproductive phase, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of metal stress adaptation.</p>
<p>Although real-time qPCR is an accurate and reliable approach to assess gene expression, we agree that RNA-Seq results would improve the scope of the analysis and better assess the role of <italic>Tb1</italic> in relation to HM response (see comments for Reviewer#1). There are two phenotypic changes clearly connected with the genetic mechanisms involved in the <italic>parviglumis</italic> to maize transition: plant height and the number of seminal roots (not nodal roots). We will emphasize these phenotypic changes in a modified version of the manuscript. There is a possibility for HM stress to represent a confounding factor in the selection of maize and not a driving factor; however, if such is the case, we think it is rather unlikely that the real driving factor could have acted through mechanisms not related to abiotic stress or HM response. To address the possibility that HM stress was a cofounding factor, we will extensively analyze genetic diversity and gene expression in all loci containing genes mapping in close proximity to peak LOD scores of all 1.5-LOD support intervals located in chromosome 5 and showing pleiotropic effects on domestication traits (Lemmon and Doebley, 2014). These will also include those mapping in close proximity to <italic>ZmHMA1.</italic> The potential influence of heavy metals in the field is being investigated through the analysis of paleoenvironmental data (see response to Reviewer#1); we will include our results in a modified version of the manuscript.</p>
