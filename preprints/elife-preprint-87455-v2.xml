<title>Abstract</title><p>The loss of a single chromosome in a diploid organism halves the dosage of many genes and is usually accompanied by a substantial decrease in fitness. We asked whether this decrease simply reflects the joint damage caused by individual gene dosage deficiencies. We measured the fitness effects of single heterozygous gene deletions in yeast and combined them for each chromosome. This predicted a negative growth rate, i.e. lethality, for multiple monosomies. However, monosomic strains remained alive and grew as if much (often most) of the damage caused by single mutations had disappeared, revealing an exceptionally large and positive epistatic component of fitness. We looked for functional explanations by analyzing the transcriptomes. There was no evidence of increased (compensatory) gene expression on the monosomic chromosomes. Nor were there signs of the cellular stress response that would be expected if monosomy led to protein destabilization and thus cytotoxicity. Instead, all monosomic strains showed extensive upregulation of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, but in an indiscriminate manner that did not correspond to their altered dosage. This response did not restore the stoichiometry required for efficient biosynthesis, which probably became growth limiting, making all other mutation-induced metabolic defects much less important. In general, the modular structure of the cell leads to an effective fragmentation of the total mutational load. Defects outside the module(s) currently defining fitness lose at least some of their relevance, producing the epiphenomenon of positive interactions between individually negative effects.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cells and entire organisms can tolerate a surprisingly large number of deleterious mutations, especially when they affect gene function partially rather than completely, for example, when only one of two alleles is inactivated. In fact, a typical human germline cell has as many as about one hundred inactive genes, usually complemented by active alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">MacArthur et al., 2012</xref>). Somatic cell lines in healthy tissues can add dozens of new (nearly always heterozygous) mutations every year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Moore et al., 2021</xref>). Understanding how this high burden of DNA damage translates into a relatively low mutational load, defined as a reduction in fitness, has proven to be a real challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Henn et al., 2015</xref>). One possible explanation is that mutations typically have negligible effects, especially when heterozygous. Another is that deleterious mutations are balanced by compensatory mutations, although the latter may not yet have been identified. However, it is also possible that the negative effects of mutations are significantly reduced when they are numerous, i.e. they effectively offset each other through positive epistasis.</p>
<p>Because the fitness architecture of complex organisms is particularly difficult to disentangle, researchers have turned to simpler systems. In the model organism <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, collections of engineered single-gene mutations, such as complete deletions, have been created and used to estimate selection and dominance coefficients, as well as the effects of interactions between a few (typically two) loci (Costanzo et al., 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Giaever et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Steinmetz et al., 2002</xref>). It would be much more difficult to combine large numbers of deleterious mutations. This inevitably long process would expose the strains under construction to a high probability of developing fitness-restoring genetic adaptations, which are known to occur even with limited cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Szamecz et al., 2014</xref>). A rapid way to generate genomes with extensive loads of known mutations is needed. With this in mind, we noted that the budding yeast genome consists of approximately five thousand genes, distributed in a largely random manner across 16 chromosomes. We reasoned that monosomy, the loss of one chromosome in an otherwise regular diploid (2<italic>n</italic>-1), would mimic the sudden mutation (partial inactivation) of numerous and randomly assembled genes.</p>

<title>Viability of monosomic strains</title>
<p>We began our study by inserting three markers into one chromosome within each homologous pair. These were two <italic>URA3</italic> genes, each at the center of every arm, and one copy of <italic>kan</italic> near a centromere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Tutaj et al., 2022</xref>). Since its homolog was unmarked, mutants lacking the markers signaled a possible loss of the marked chromosome (Materials and Methods). We expected that such generated true monosomic strains (M1, M2, …, M16) would show visible growth defects, which we indeed observed, except for M1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). The loss of markers and slow growth were only hints, and often turned out to be false when DNA sequencing revealed that the expected loss of an entire single chromosome did not occur, or that it did occur but was accompanied by other changes. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> shows isolates that passed the sequencing test. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, small colonies formed by monosomic cells were regularly invaded by much larger ones. For each monosomic, dozens of the latter were re-streaked and found to reproduce the fast-growing phenotype almost universally. To prevent the monosomics from overgrowing by the fast-growers, we had to keep the cultures small, down to 5 µl of YPD medium in the case of M5 or M15. The cultures had to be replicated (in tens or hundreds) so that a sufficient number of those dominated by the slow-growing cells could still be found and replenished.</p>

<p>The procedure described above could not be completed for three chromosomes-VII, XII, and XIII-although we paid special attention to them. Regarding the screens for M7 and M13, we did not find a single mutant that lacked the markers, grew slowly, and could rapidly revert to a normal phenotype. Instead, we regularly encountered isolates of the desired genotype with no growth defect and a diploid genome. Hypothetically, two mitotic crossovers within a pair of homologous chromosomes could produce an offspring cell without the markers. We were able to reject this possibility based on the results of the present study and a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Tutaj et al., 2022</xref>). Relevant data and calculations are provided in the Supplementary Text. The best explanation is that the marked chromosomes VII and XIII were lost and their unmarked homologs underwent endoreduplication shortly thereafter. The endoreduplication could result rom non-disjunction of a monosomic chromosome. Thus, we suggest that the cells of M7 and M13 were viable but suffered from very slow growth, high rate of endoreduplication, or both, and were thus especially rapidly overgrown by revertants. The search for M12 yielded unusually numerous and genotypically variable isolates, but none that were correct in terms of growth phenotype or DNA copy number mapping (Materials and Methods, Supplementary Text). Chromosome XII contains the only yeast rDNA region and is a strong recombinational hotspot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Tutaj et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, we suspended attempts to derive M12, especially since, as we show below, its predicted fitness loss from haploinsufficiency was well within the range covered by other chromosomes.</p>
<p>In the wild, monosomic isolates have only been found for a few and the shortest chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Peter et al., 2018</xref>). Similar examples of monosomy have been detected in mutation-accumulation experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sui et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>). It is uncertain whether these monosomies were simply tolerated, compensated by other changes, or conditionally adaptive in certain environments. There have been laboratory experiments suggesting that all monosomies can be induced in yeast, though indicated only by loss of heterozygosity at selected loci, but they may have been transient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Beach et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Reid et al., 2008</xref>). We suggest that past work on yeast monosomy should be taken with a grain of salt and that future work should be properly planned. Colonies of putative monosomics may actually be diploids or aneuploids. Even if they were initially truly monosomic, they could easily have been overtaken by endoreduplications or other compensations for chromosome loss. This could happen even if a moderately sized colony was formed from an initially monosomic cell. Here, we combined the marker-based approach with genome-wide assays based on sequencing of DNA (reported above) and RNA (below) to confirm that nearly all yeast monosomics are viable.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Epistasis for fitness</title>
<p>Before studying epistasis between multiple mutations, their individual effects must be known. With respect to yeast growth rate, virtually none of the single gene deletions can increase it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sliwa and Korona, 2005</xref>). About 1/5 of them stop growth altogether and another 1/5 slow it down detectably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Giaever et al., 2002</xref>). These estimates are based on homozygous or haploid strains under optimal laboratory conditions. Heterozygous deletions, again under good conditions, often show morphological changes, but their growth rate, i.e., proliferative fitness, is rarely and only modestly affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Deutschbauer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Marek and Korona, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ohnuki and Ohya, 2018</xref>). In Materials and Methods, we explain how we selected 468 heterozygous single deletion strains as potentially (haplo)insufficient for growth on the rich medium, YPD. We performed repeated growth rate measurements for single deletion strains and compared them to a set of carefully selected control strains to make our estimates as accurate and reliable as possible. The doubling rates of individual heterozygous deletions were divided by that of the control to obtain relative doubling rates, rDRs (Datasheet 1) The frequency distribution of rDR is shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>. It shows that the negative effects of the deletions were undoubtedly present, although predictably small, a substantial fraction of them were in the range of bidirectional effects, most likely composed of phenotypic plasticity and measurement error. (The existence of phenotypic variation not attributable to gene deletions is revealed by the variation within a genetically homogeneous control).</p>

</fig>
<p>Epistasis is absent when an effect of the gene variant does not depend on the genetic content of other loci. In the case of fitness, a non-neutral mutation corresponds to a proportional change in wild-type fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Crow and Kimura, 1971</xref>). The absence of epistasis means that the fitness quotient of a given mutation remains unchanged regardless of whether it is the only one present in an individual or accompanied by other fitness-affecting mutations. Accepting this postulate is equivalent to adopting a multiplicative model of fitness structure, in which the fitness of a genotype involving <italic>n</italic> loci is the product of <italic>n</italic> respective quotients. The model is additive for log-fitness because such a transformation turns a quotient into a deviation from one and a product of quotients into a sum of such deviations. Since we are working with a (log<sub>2</sub>) transformed measure of fitness, the deviation caused by an <italic>i-</italic>th gene deletion is equal to <italic>d<sub>i</sub></italic> = <italic>rDR<sub>i</sub></italic>−1. The expected effect of multiple loci is the sum of all deviations involved, <italic>rDR</italic><sub>E</sub>=1<italic>+</italic>∑<italic>d<sub>i</sub></italic>. To predict how each of the 16 monosomic strains should perform, we summed the deviations caused by the individual deletions present on each chromosome (obtaining 16 values of <italic>rDR</italic><sub>E</sub>). We summed both negative and positive values of <italic>d</italic> to account for non-genetic variation of estimates. We then compared the predicted values of <italic>rDR</italic><sub>E</sub> with the corresponding values of <italic>rDR</italic><sub>M</sub>, that is, estimates obtained experimentally for the actual monosomic strains (Datasheet 1). <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref> shows the expected and obtained values of monosomics’ <italic>rDR</italic>, where epistasis is equal to the difference between them. The epistasis between multiple deleterious gene deletions turned out to be not only positive but also large, much larger than that observed for just pairs of deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jasnos and Korona, 2007</xref>). Most strikingly, some monosomic strains were expected to have a negative doubling rate, i.e. were predicted to be effectively lethal, but turned out to be able to proliferate. For several monosomics, and especially M4, most of the predicted mutational load was canceled out by epistasis. The contribution of epistasis to fitness seemed so large that it might be difficult to accept without a functional rationalization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Transcriptome reaction</title>
<p>Epistasis can be considered in a purely abstract way, as a deviation from additivity/multiplicity. But it must have a biological explanation. Our attempt to find it began with the isolation and quantitative analysis of mRNA from the ancestral diploid strain and eight monosomic strains. (The selection was random. It nevertheless resulted in the inclusion of strains in which the level of epistasis was low, M1 and M8, or high, M2 and M16.) The first question was obvious: was the decrease in gene dosage compensated by increased expression? <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref> shows that there was no detectable increase in the average intensity of transcription on the monosomic chromosomes. These averages depend on hundreds of genes and would therefore be largely insensitive to increased expression of important but relatively few genes. In this experiment, we knew which genes would be most rewarding to upregulate, those that were most haploinsufficient, and could focus our attention on them. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref> shows that the fitness effect of a single gene-deletion did not correlate with the expression of this gene in a monosomic strain. Thus, neither physical underrepresentation (single copy) nor functional importance (impact on growth) triggered an increase in expression of the genes on monosomic chromosomes: their mRNA level was halved on average although individual genes could show either up- or downshifts.</p>

<p>Monosomy could have altered the expression of any genes, not just those on the affected chromosomes. We aimed to find any distinct and functionally interpretable patterns of adjustment that might explain how the functioning of monosomic strains was perturbed. We found multiple statistically significant up- and downregulations in the transcriptomes of each monosomic strain analyzed (Datasheet 2). Both parallelisms and incongruencies between them were visible.</p>
<p><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref> shows the similarities. The translational apparatus of the cytosol was on average significantly and universally upregulated, as evidenced by transcripts encoding proteins that build both large (e.g. <italic>RPL28</italic>) and small (<italic>RPS29B</italic>) ribosomal subunits. Cytosolic proteolysis was downregulated (core proteasome component <italic>PRE6</italic>). In remarkable agreement, chaperones required to fold newly synthesized peptides were upregulated (<italic>SSB1/2</italic>), while those required to direct destabilized chains to degradation were downregulated (<italic>SSA1, HSP82, HSP104</italic>). Transcripts encoding mitochondrial proteins were generally less abundant, with a marked decrease in the expression of several genes encoding the electron transport chain (Datasheet 2). In parallel, the expression of the antioxidant machinery was downregulated, especially that of a major ROS scavenger (<italic>SOD2</italic>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To find transcriptomic differences, we examined groups of genes, each responding to a known signal. This increased the chances of detecting statistical significance and functional divergence. In our experiment, all strains received identical external signals. Therefore, different expression patterns would indicate different internal perturbations. Indeed, as shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>, substantial variation was detected within several regulons: cAMP-PKA (glucose-activated signaling), NCR (nitrogen catabolism repression), GAAC (general amino acid control), and Msn2up (activation by a broad range of stresses). These differences underscore the significance of the above reported uniformity in the pattern of biosynthetic upregulation and proteolytic downregulation.</p>
<p>All of the above considerations refer to the relative abundance of mRNA species. We also attempted to compare the absolute size of the transcriptome in wild-type BY and three monosomic strains: M1, M2, and M3. We added an admixture of specific external mRNA to provide a quantitative reference, or “spike”, to known total cell volumes of each strain and repeated our assays. The results are shown in <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S3</xref>. In summary, the spike represented 4.04% of total mRNA for the BY sample and 6.08, 15.6, and 24.2% for the respective monosomic strains. Thus, monosomy would be associated with a decrease in the absolute level of mRNA. A possible caveat is that the monosomic cells had an altered morphology. They were more rounded in shape and approximately 60% larger in long axis, so that their individual volumes were several times larger than wild-type. Thus, the size of the transcriptome for M1 and M2 would not be reduced but actually increased if calculated per whole cell (one nucleus). Indeed, one explanation for the observed epistasis for viability could be an ample overproduction of all transcripts, so that even those halved by monosomy are sufficiently abundant. We consider the cell volume calculations more appropriate and therefore accept that the transcripts from monosomic chromosomes were even less abundant than half of the wild strain abundances. The apparent decrease in the cellular density of the transcriptome in the cytoplasm of monosomics is not paradoxical because the RNA content, including ribosomal protein mRNAs, decreases with slowing growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">García-Martínez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Warner, 1999</xref>). However, even if one accepts that monosomic transcriptomes were expanded (per nucleus), they would still be unbalanced. Thus, if the lack of stoichiometry between proteins and the resulting low efficiency of ribosome assembly, rather than the simple scarcity of specific elements, is the major consequence of monosomy, it would remain so regardless of the absolute size of the transcriptome.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The successful derivation and maintenance of monosomic strains demonstrated that it is possible to obtain an a priori designed set of strains with hundreds of partially inactive genes, dozens of which are known to have deleterious fitness effects. It implies that the ability to remain viable despite carrying extensive mutational burdens is not limited to specific combinations of genes, but would likely apply to a wide variety of them. Viability was supported by the epistatic effect, which was of positive value and remarkable strength, but may still be underestimated in our study. It was shown that many of the single deletions with negative fitness effects had undergone compensatory evolution under recurrent replication needed to maintain the strains carrying them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Puddu et al., 2019</xref>). Since we used the same collection of deletions, it is likely that some of them were at least partially compensated. All of these effects that may have been missing in the individual deletions were present in the newly derived monosomic strains. This caveat actually strengthens our claim that the positive epistatic component can be substantial and even offset most of the total damage associated with the combined individual negative effects.</p>
<p>The advent of systems biology has raised hopes that the “statistical” and “biological” sides of epistasis can be coherently brought together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Moore and Williams, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Phillips, 2008</xref>). Indeed, a truly functional explanation of the measured growth effects would require an understanding of how the material and energetic expenditures were altered by the same mutations when they were separate or combined. Such a metabolomic interpretation could only be attempted semi-quantitatively and for much simpler systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Molenaar et al., 2009</xref>). Regarding proteome and transcriptome, the latter has the advantage of higher accuracy and repeatability, the ability to detect the products of even weakly expressed genes and, crucially for this study, to provide clear signals of major functional transitions such as fast-slow growth, anabolism-catabolism, presence-absence of stress. The relationship between the transcriptome and the proteome is not straightforward in multicellular organisms, where compensation for the perturbations introduced by aneuploidy is often observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Birchler and Veitia, 2021</xref>). In yeast, most of the changes observed in mRNA are generally reflected as corresponding shifts in both the profile of translation and the composition of mature proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Larrimore et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Pavelka et al., 2010</xref>). The relationship is not perfect as, for example, disomics have a somewhat attenuated average expression of proteins encoded on the duplicated chromosome. But even there, the result is still much closer to doubling than to parity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dephoure et al., 2014</xref>). Post-transcriptional attenuation can be more frequent and pronounced when only single genes are doubled, but this is a very different case from ours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ascencio et al., 2021</xref>). Crucially, while signs of compensation at the proteome level are found in wild aneuploids, they are much less pronounced in the laboratory strains and especially in the BY used here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Messner et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Muenzner et al., 2024</xref>). (It is tempting to suggest that the wild aneuploids represent a biased sample of aneuploid mutants, i.e., they either already possessed means of compensating for the distortions introduced by aneuploidy or were able to evolve them and thus avoid purging by selection.) In summary, although mRNA analysis does not provide a complete description of the metabolism of the laboratory-generated monosomic cells, it does provide valuable information about it.</p>
<p>The simultaneous upregulation of genes encoding ribosomal proteins (RP) and downregulation of those encoding subunits of the proteasome was observed in all monosomic strains, providing a crucial insight into the functional response of the cell to monosomy. The absence of a single chromosome meant that several genes encoding the translational machinery that resided on it were halved in dosage, while dozens of others remained unaffected. The cell could not restore the required stoichiometry by overexpressing the affected genes. Favorable environmental conditions signaled that translation needed to be intensified, but functioning ribosomes were in short supply, resulting in seemingly indiscriminate overproduction of ribosomal proteins and withholding of degradation of both them and other cytosolic proteins. The response was inadequate and costly, but it should be seen as an attempt at <italic>ad hoc</italic> rebalancing rather than a prepared (evolved) response. This interpretation, strongly suggested by the transcriptomic data, appears even more plausible when analyzing the functional diversity of the 468 genes qualified as haploinsufficient. <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows that the diversity was ample: of the one hundred Slim GO Biological Process categories, dozens could be linked to each chromosome-associated subset of deletions. However, there was a significant common motif. Processes involved in the “protein synthesis apparatus” (our term) were most frequently represented. Their predicted damage was also particularly high, typically sufficient or exceeding that required to reduce the growth rate to the levels actually observed in monosomics. The biosynthetic perturbation was thus real, and its relationship to the observed transcriptomic response was likely causal, not merely coincidental.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Some of the other adaptations seen in the monosomal transcriptomes could also be related to the dominant effect of translational inefficiency. A signal to increase biosynthesis would mobilize fermentation and reduce oxidation, which would downregulate genes encoding ROS-scavenging proteins. The Mns2-mediated and other stress responses were apparently absent, contrary to previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sheltzer et al., 2012</xref>). The hallmarks of stress responses include decreased RP production and increased proteolysis (to remove destabilized proteins). Here, these two processes were driven in opposite directions, blurring the expected patterns. The non-homogeneity of the response in other regulons analyzed - cAMP-PKA, NCR, GAAC - means that functions other than ribosome assembly were severely affected, but differently, depending on the composition of genes made insufficient by the loss of a chromosome (see also Datasheet 2). If there were so many different piecemeal responses, why was the uniform positive epistasis observed?</p>
<p>A possible answer begins with the assumption that the cell is an aggregate of multiple functional modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hartwell et al., 1999</xref>). Our monosomic strains had many different modules that were negatively affected by partially inactivating mutations. These mutations did not interact with each other directly, but rather through the modules to which they belonged. Mutations that affected the most critical module(s) suppressed the negative effect of mutations that affected other, non-limiting modules. The latter were either less damaged or less needed under current conditions. The epiphenomenon of positive epistasis for fitness reflected the fact that not all mutations exerted their negative effects, at least not to the full extent. In our case, this is not just speculation, but rather the simplest and most prudent explanation linking growth rate and transcriptomic data. Our experimental system is special in a way: a microbial cell in which several modules have been compromised but exposed to favorable conditions and thus tested for the single capacity to grow rapidly. Although peculiar, the system is also instructive. Any unicellular organism is typically tested for only a few specific condition-dependent functions defining fitness, which are very different under, e.g., growth or starvation. Similarly, the specialized cells of a complex organism are required to support only a few, and different, elements of life. The modularity of the cell helps to understand how so many partial genetic defects can be carried by so many different organisms without drastically reducing their fitness: rarely or never are all the defects really important.</p>
<p>Interactions within pairs of gene knockouts have received much attention (Costanzo et al., 2020; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Segrè et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Szappanos et al., 2011</xref>). Epistasis for fitness arising from interactions between at least several mutations has also been studied but mostly in the context of “diminished returns” of successive beneficial variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barrick et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Khan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kryazhimskiy et al., 2014</xref>). It has been proposed that the pattern may arise from interactions of mutations through a ‘global’ phenotypic interface, such as fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">MacLean et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Perfeito et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Schoustra et al., 2016</xref>). However, a similar overall effect could also be produced by “idiosyncratic” interactions without any mediating factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lyons et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Reddy and Desai, 2021</xref>). Indeed, this has been demonstrated experimentally, at least for a selected and moderately large set of mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bakerlee et al., 2022</xref>). Finally, negative epistasis of beneficial mutations has been attributed to cellular modularity by postulating that the positive contribution of each functional module to fitness must have its upper bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wei and Zhang, 2019</xref>). Given that the negative epistasis between multiple positive effects can arise from different mechanisms, we do not insist that the explanation of positive epistasis between multiple negative effects we propose is the only possible one. However, it may be particularly applicable when the deleterious mutations are truly numerous and distributed across many cellular subsystems that work as functional modules.</p>

<sec id="s4a1">
<label>1.1.</label><title>Selection of single gene deletions with a possible effect of haploinsufficiency</title>
<p>Deutschbauer <italic>et al</italic>. have assayed a complete collection of heterozygous single gene deletion strains and identified a total of 184 genes, 98 essential and 86 non-essential, as haploinsufficient for growth in rich medium, YPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Deutschbauer et al., 2005</xref>). We included this set of genes in the present study. Using a different technique, Marek <italic>et al</italic>. have tested al1 142 essential heterozygous single-gene deletions and 946 non-essential deletions selected as likely not neutral for growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Marek and Korona, 2016</xref>). We reviewed the latter study and, using a false discovery rate of 0.15, accepted up to 404 genes, 256 essential and 148 non-essential, as potentially haploinsufficient. The two sets obtained in two different studies, 184 and 404, overlapped in 112 cases. The overlap was much higher than expected, 14.3, if the two sets were just random samples from among 5,200 yeast genes. On the other hand, it was limited and suggested that new growth assays were desirable. The new assays are described below; they included all the unique strains identified in the two studies minus 5 that were not present in our current strain collections and another 3 that were dropped as superfluous for the orthogonal design of experimental blocks described below. (They were also the 3 least promising based on the earlier assays.) Datasheet 1 lists the strains.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4a2">
<label>1.2.</label><title>Control for single deletion strains</title>
<p>To correctly quantify the predictably small negative growth effects introduced by heterozygous single deletion strains, an unbiased and accurate estimate of a wild-type phenotype is required. In the present study, we attempted to achieve this by using multiple strains as controls rather than a single strain. The reason for this was that the gene deletions used here were constructed over several years by several laboratories and then treated with repeated rounds of propagation, which could lead to genetic divergence. We felt it was risky to use one strain as a control for all the others. We looked for a group of strains that were indistinguishable in terms of growth rate, suggesting that they had not acquired genetic changes that affected this trait. In the case of non-essential genes, we searched the Saccharomyces Genome Database and found 25 ORFs originally labeled “dubious”, which are currently almost certainly spurious ORFs, located between other ORFs and no closer than 100 bp to their START or STOP codons. Heterozygous strains carrying deletions of these genes were tested for doubling rate in a manner specific to this study (described below). After repeated assays, 16 deletion strains that were closest to the medium growth performance and not statistically different from each other were selected as controls. Knowing that the non-essential and essential strains differ somewhat in their origin and subsequent handling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brachmann et al., 1998</xref>), we decided to derive a separate set of control strains for the latter. We selected 32 essential genes that were in the very center of a single, strong and narrow modal peak of the frequency distribution of estimates collected for the entire collection of heterozygous essentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Marek and Korona, 2016</xref>). Again, after repeated tests of growth rate, 16 strains that were closest to the median and not different from each other were selected to serve as the final control for essential gene deletions. Control strains from both groups are listed in Datasheet 1.</p>

<title>Monosomic strains</title>
<sec id="s4b1">
<label>2.1.</label><title>Parents of monosomic strains</title>
<p>In an earlier study, we used 32 strains that had a counter-selectable marker (<italic>URA3</italic>) near the center of each of the 32 chromosome arms and a drug resistance marker (<italic>kan</italic>) near a centromere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Tutaj et al., 2022</xref>). Pairs of strains with the same centromere marker and the counter-selectable markers located on either the left or right arm of the same chromosome were mated with each other. The resulting diploids were sporulated and tetrads dissected to get triple-marked haploid genotypes, <italic>URA3-kan-URA3</italic>. The latter were mated with a standard BY haploid strain of the opposite mating type. In the final set of 16 diploid strains, each strain had one chromosome triple-marked while its homolog and the remaining 15 chromosome pairs were isogenic with the diploid strain BY4743.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4b2">
<label>2.2.</label><title>Derivation and verification of monosomic strains</title>
<p>The diploid strains with triple-marked chromosomes were grown overnight in synthetic complete medium (SC) and then 50 to 500 µl samples of the resulting cultures were plated on standard 5-FOA (5-fluoroorotic acid) plates. Emerging colonies were transferred to new 5-FOA plates and YPD plates with 200 mg/ml geneticin. The goal was to identify variants that were able to grow on the 5-FOA plates but not on the geneticin plates, indicating that all three marker genes may have been lost along with an entire chromosome. Colonies identified in this way were often of different sizes, suggesting that they were genetically heterogeneous. The next criterion was to find variants that produced colonies that were visibly smaller than those of the parental strain, but rarely, though regularly, produced colonies similar to those of the parental strain. Such strains were grown in replicate small cultures (5 to 100 µl, depending on the monosomic strain), tested for negligible frequency of cells forming large colonies, and collected in larger samples that allowed isolation of DNA in quantities sufficient for next-generation sequencing. Monosomy was considered confirmed when the number of reads for the entire length of a single and expected chromosome was halved. Although simple, this protocol required multiple attempts for some chromosomes because few colonies tended to appear on the 5-FOA plates, most of them remained resistant to geneticin, and those that passed these two criteria did not show the required reversibility, that is, the tendency to occasionally return to normal growth in an apparent step. Even when all these phenotypic criteria were met, sequencing occasionally revealed genomes other than those of pure monosomic origin, that is, with the whole and only one chromosome removed. Nevertheless, once confirmed, the monosomic strains could have been reliably propagated on rich and synthetic media, including that containing 5-FOA, as long as the recurrent appearance of fast-growing colonies was monitored and counteracted.</p>

<label>2.3.</label><title>Control for monosomic strains</title>
<p>The monosomic strains were all derived by us and the derivation involved our stock of haploid strains BY4741 and BY4742.

<sec id="s4c">
<title>Estimation of <italic>DR</italic> and <italic>rDR</italic></title>
<p>The collection of single gene deletion strains was arrayed on 6 flat-bottomed 8×12 well titration plates with 150 µl aliquots per well. Within each plate, the first and last wells contained clean YPD medium, rows 3 and 10 contained control strains, and the deletion strains occupied the remainder of the plate. Plates were filled with either essential or non-essential deletions accompanied by the 16 control strains listed above. One plate contained both essential and non-essential deletions along with 8 essential and 8 non-essential control strains. Plates were inoculated at 1-5% from thawed samples and kept non-agitated at 30°C for 48 hours until they reached approximately similar densities of stationary phase cells. Such conditioned microcultures were used to inoculate plates with fresh YPD at 0.5% and maintained at 30°C with shaking at 1,000 rpm. Cultures were analyzed for OD (600 nm) every 0.5 hours using a TECAN Infinity reader. Four independent replicates of measurements were performed, starting with independent conditionings. OD readings were used to calculate DR (doubling rate). To obtain the rDR (relative doubling rate), each DR estimate of an experimental strain was divided by the average DR of the control strains present on the same plate. In the case of the monosomic strains, the entire protocol was analogous except that all experimental and control strains were kept in one plate. Cultures of monosomic strains used in this assay were tested to contain less than 1% fast-growing cells at the time of OD measurements.</p>

<sec id="s4d">
<title>Analysis of DNA and RNA</title>
<p>The first step in preparation for both DNA and RNA analysis was to collect samples of monosomic cells that would be nearly free of the rapidly growing revertant cells. Individual monosomic strains were grown as replicate microcultures (5 to 100 µl) in YPD at 30°C to stationary phase. The latter were serially diluted and plated to test for the appearance of large colonies indicating the appearance of compensatory mutations. The microcultures in which more than 99% of the colonies were typical of a particular monosomic strain were pooled. Such tested stationary cultures of monosomic cells were directly used to extract DNA as template for high coverage sequencing (PE 150, expected read depth ~80). The resulting reads were mapped along standard yeast chromosome sequences using bowtie2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>), along standard sequences of yeast chromosomes: Ensembl release 100, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome R64-1-1. Duplicate reads were marked with MarkDuplicates (Picard Toolkit 2019. Broad Institute, GitHub). Samtools (1.15.1) was used for BAM files sorting, indexing and coverage analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Danecek et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>For RNA, purity-tested cultures of monosomic cells were transferred to fresh YPD and incubated for 4 hours at 30°C with agitation. Total RNA was then extracted using the RiboPure™ RNA Purification Kit. Three replicates of the monosomic and control BY4743 strain were prepared in this manner. Library preparation and PE 150 sequencing were performed by Novagene. Approximately 20 million read pairs were generated per sample. Quality control of the reads was performed using fastQC v0.11.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Andrew, 2010</xref>). RNA reads were aligned to the above standard sequence using Hisat2 v2.1.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). The resulting alignment files were sorted and indexed with samtools (1.9). Transcript quantification was performed using cuffquant/cuffnorm v2.2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Trapnell et al., 2012</xref>). Gene count data normalization (“TMM” method) and differential expression analysis (exact test) were performed in the EdgeR test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>For transcriptome analysis with the addition of the mRNA spike, cultures were conditioned as above. The density of the cultures was estimated by counting the cells in the Burker’s chamber. The cells were also photographed under a light microscope and the long and short axes of the cells were measured for about 50 randomly selected cells. Using the formula for ellipsoids and assuming that the two shorter axes are equal, the volumes of individual cells and their sums were calculated. Equal amounts of the mRNA spike (ERCC RNA Spike-In Mix, TermoFisher) were added to all cell samples from which RNA was extracted using hot formamide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Shedlovskiy et al., 2017</xref>). Subsequent library preparation, sequencing and analysis were performed as described above.</p>

<title>Supplementary Text 1 - Expected fitness effect of multiple mutations</title>
<p>Fitness is the number of offspring divided by the number of progenitors, <italic>w</italic>=<italic>No/Np</italic>. This can be the number of cells left by one cell (including itself in the case of budding cells) over a unit of time. Assume that an organism carries multiple mutations—α, β, … ω—which are located in heterozygous loci, their wild-type counterparts are universally marked with +. The fitness effect of a single mutation is <italic>w</italic><sub>α/+</sub>, and so on. Fitness can be converted to relative fitness, i.e., expressed as a quotient of the wild-type fitness, <italic>w</italic><sub>α/+</sub><italic>/w<sub>+/+</sub></italic>, and so on. Under the multiplicative model of mutation accumulation, an expected joint effect of multiple mutations on relative fitness is a product of individual quotients:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="532261v4_ueqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
When a population is growing continuously, a log transformation of fitness is typically applied because it equals the rate of growth. In particular, it could be the number of doublings completed in a unit of time:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="532261v4_ueqn2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
After replacing the log multiplicative formula above with its log additive equivalent, all terms of the latter can be normalized by dividing by log<sub>2</sub> fitness of the wild-type, which transforms them into relative doubling rates, for example, <italic>rDR</italic><sub>α/+</sub>=log<sub>2</sub>(<italic>w</italic><sub>α/+</sub>)/log<sub>2</sub>(<italic>w<sub>+/+</sub></italic>). The combined effect of multiple mutations is then equal to
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="532261v4_ueqn3.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
or
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="532261v4_ueqn4.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>d</italic> = <italic>rDR</italic>-1 is an individual mutation effect on the relative doubling rate (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> in the main text).</p>

For both strains, we tended to obtain urine colonies (on 5-FOA agars) that were mostly large (wild-type size), with small ones accounting for a few percent of all isolates. In the search for potential monosomics, we first concentrated on the small colonies. Out of as many as 100 isolates for each parental strain, not a single one met our criteria. Most were kanR, and none of the rest produced small and largely uniform colonies that would tend to revert to wild-type growth. Despite these discouraging signs, two of the most promising candidates were sequenced for each chromosome. These analyses revealed complex polyploidies rather than regular monosomy.</p>
<p>We then examined the dominant large Ura<sup>-</sup> colonies. They appeared at a mean frequency of 3.1E-06 and 6.3E-06 for chromosomes VII and XIII, respectively. (Number of colonies divided by the number of cells plated on 5-FOA.) For each parental strain, 108 colonies collected from several separately inoculated selective agars were randomly selected for further testing. All of these isolates grew rapidly when reseeded. Only 2 of the isolates from the strain carrying the marked chromosome VII proved to be kanR, none in the case of chromosome XIII. To interpret these results, it may be useful to recall that the <italic>URA3</italic> marker was placed in the middle of both the left and right chromosomal arms, while <italic>kan</italic> occupied one of the ORFs closest to a centromere:
<disp-formula>

</disp-formula>
Its homolog was free of all three markers. In principle, two mitotic crossovers between telomere and <italic>URA3</italic> on each arm could produce a progeny cell with two marker-free chromosomes. It would be a regular diploid and thus have a wild-type growth rate. There are two arguments against this proposal. First, double crossovers between <italic>URA3</italic> and <italic>kan</italic> would be similarly frequent, and therefore cells lacking <italic>URA3</italic> but retaining <italic>kan</italic> would not be as rare as observed here. Second, in our previous study(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Tutaj et al., 2022</xref>), we measured the frequency of crossover on the two chromosomes. Based on our estimates, two simultaneous crossovers located within the distal halves of the arms of chromosomes VII and XIII would occur at a rate of 1.1E-08 and 7.9E-09, respectively, which is about two orders of magnitude lower than observed.</p>
<p>The fast-growing and marker-free isolates were then subjected to sporulation and tetrad dissection. For each chromosome, 8 isolates were randomly selected and at least 10 tetrads were dissected. In each of the 16 strains analyzed, tetrads with four viable haploids formed a clear majority, as expected for the products of meiosis with one regular diploid cell. Two of the 8 strains analyzed in this way were further tested by high coverage DNA sequencing. No sequences of the two markers or the MX4 cassette containing them were found. The three loci in question contained only the expected wild-type sequences with a coverage typical for the rest of the genome, i.e. diploid (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, we did not find a single slow-growing monosomic strain for chromosomes VII and XIII, despite our intensive search. The regularly occurring fast growing isolates with the phenotype we were looking for were most unlikely to be the result of recombination events such as a double crossover. They were normal diploids, with the chromosomes in question carrying the phenotypic alleles and DNA sequences characteristic of the unmarked homologs. These results suggest that the marked chromosomes were lost and their unmarked homologs underwent endoreduplication.</p>
<sec id="s7b1">
<title>The unsuitability of chromosome XII for monosomy research</title>
<p>The parent strain with the triple-labeled chromosome XII tended to produce unusually numerous colonies on the selective 5-FOA agars, mostly as large as those of the regular diploid strains. We did not analyze these large colonies because we considered them likely to be produced by recombination and thus unrelated to monosomy. This chromosome contains the only yeast rDNA region that is about 1 Mb long and is known to be a strong recombination hotspot. Therefore, the quantitative arguments for excluding double crossovers developed for chromosomes VII and XIII were not applicable here. Small colonies were also more numerous than in other strains. The marker and growth rate reversibility tests were applied to several hundred of them, but failed in almost all cases. A few of the most promising isolates were sequenced and none of them showed the regular monosomy we were looking for. We decided to stop our search for M12 at this point because the presence of rDNA made it impractical.</p>

<p>The study by Korona and colleagues presents a rigorous experimental strategy for generating and maintaining a nearly complete set of monosomic yeast lines, thereby establishing a new standard for studying monosomes. Their careful approach in generating and handling monosome yeast lines, coupled with their use of high-throughput DNA sequencing and RNA sequencing, addresses concerns related to genomic instability and is commendable. However, I would like to express my concerns regarding the second part of the study, particularly the calculation of epistasis and the conclusion that vast positive epistatic effects have been observed. I believe that the conclusion of positive epistasis for fitness might be premature due to potential errors in estimating the expected fitness.</p>
<p>The method used to calculate fitness expectation (1 + sum(di), where di = rDRi - 1) may be inappropriate. The logarithm transformation mentioned by the authors is designed to transform the exponential growth curve into a linear relation for estimating doubling rate, and thus the fitness expectation should be calculated as the product of rDRi values. As an illustration, if gene A exhibits a 20% reduction in fitness when halved (A/-) and gene B exhibits a 30% reduction (B/-), the expected fitness of A/- B/- should be 56%, rather than the 50% estimated in the study. In other words, the formula used by the authors could underestimate the fitness expectation.</p>
<p>This issue is evident in Figure 2b, where negative values were obtained due to the use of an incorrect formula for estimating fitness expectations. It is worth noting that Figure 2a shows rDR values around one, indicating that no further logarithmic transformation was applied.</p>
<p>While widespread positive epistasis in yeast has been reported by other studies (e.g., doi: 10.1038/ng.524, but not to the extent reported in this study), the conclusion of the current study might not be sufficiently supported. I recommend that the authors revisit their calculation methods to provide a more convincing conclusion on the presence of positive epistasis for fitness in their dataset. Overall, I appreciate the authors' efforts in this study but believe that addressing these concerns is essential for strengthening the validity of their findings.</p>

<p>This study examines monosomies in yeast in comparison to synthetic lethals resulting from combinations of heterozygous gene deletions that individually have a detrimental effect. The survival of monosomies, albeit with detrimental growth defects, is interpreted as positive epistasis for fitness. Gene expression was examined in monosomies in an attempt to gain insight into why monosomies can survive when multiple heterozygous deletions on the respective chromosome do not. In the RNAseq experiments, many genes were interpreted to be increased in expression and some were interpreted as reduced. Those with the apparent strongest increase were the subunits of the ribosome and those with the apparent strongest decreases were subunits of the proteasome.</p>
<p>The initiation and interpretation of the results were apparently performed in a vacuum of a century of work on genomic balance. Classical work in the flowering plant Datura and in Drosophila found that changes in chromosomal dosage would modulate phenotypes in a dosage sensitive manner (for references see Birchler and Veitia, 2021, Cytogenetics and Genome Research 161: 529-550). In terms of molecular studies, the most common modulation across the genome for monosomies is an upregulation (Guo and Birchler, Science 266: 1999-2002; Shi et al. 2021, The Plant Cell 33: 917-939).</p>
<p>It was also apparently performed in a vacuum of results of evolutionary genomics that indicate the classes of genes for which dosage causes fitness consequences. It was from yeast genomics that it was realized that there is a difference in the fate of duplicate genes that are members of molecular complexes following whole genome duplications (WGD) versus small segmental duplications (SSD) with longer retention times from WGD than other genes and an underrepresentation in small scale duplications (e.g. Papp et al. 2003, Nature 424: 194-197; Hakes et al 2007, Genome Biol 8: R209). This pattern arises from negative fitness consequences of deletion of some but not all members of a complex after WGD or the overexpression of individual subunits after SSD (Defoort et al., 2019 Genome Biol Evol 11: 2292-2305; Shi et al., 2020, Mol Biol Evol 37: 2394-2413). In order for this pattern to occur, there must be a reasonably close relationship between mRNA and the respective protein levels. This pattern of retention and underrepresentation has been found throughout eukaryotes (e.g. Tasdighian et al 2017, Plant Cell 29: 2766-2785) indicating that yeast is not an outlier in its behavior.</p>
<p>In the present yeast study, not only are there apparent increases for ribosomal subunits but also for many genes in the GAAC pathway, the NCR pathway, and Msn2p. The word &quot;apparent&quot; is used because RNAseq studies can only determine relative changes in gene expression (Loven et al., 2012, Cell 151: 476-482). Because aneuploidy can change the transcriptome size in general (Yang et al., 2021, The Plant Cell 33: 1016-1041), it is possible and maybe probable that this occurs in yeast monosomies as well. If there is an increase in the general transcriptome size, then there might not be as much reduction of the proteosome subunits as claimed and the increases might be somewhat less than indicated.</p>
<p>Indeed, the authors claim that there is an increased cell volume in the monosomies. Given that cell volume correlates very well with the total transcriptome size (Loven et al., 2012, Cell 151: 476-482; Sun et al 2020, Current Biol 30: 1217-1230; Swaffer et al., 2023, Cell 186: 5254-5268), it could well be that there is an increased transcriptome size in the monosomies. Thus, the interpretation of the relative changes from RNAseq is compromised.</p>
<p>It should be noted that contrary to the claims of the cited paper of Torres et al 2007 (Science 317: 916-924), a reanalysis of the data indicated that yeast disomies have many modulated genes in trans with downregulated genes being more common (Hou et al, 2018, PNAS 115: E11321-E11330). The claim of Torres et al that there are no global modulations in trans is counter to the knowledge that transcription factors are typically dosage sensitive and have multiple targets across the genome. The inverse effect trend is also true of maize disomies (Yang et al., 2021, The Plant Cell 33: 1016-1041), maize trisomies (Shi et al., 2021), Arabidopsis trisomies (Hou et al. 2018), Drosophila trisomies (Sun et al. 2013, PNAS 110: 7383-7388; Sun et al., 2013, PNAS 110: 16514-16519; Zhang et al., 2021, Scientific Reports 11: 19679; Zhang et al., genes 12: 1606) and human trisomies (Zhang et al., 2024, genes 15: 637). Taken as a whole it would seem to suggest that there are many inverse relationships of global gene expression with chromosomal dosage in both yeast disomies and monosomies.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, the authors cite Muenzner et al 2024, Nature 630 149-157 that there is an attenuation of protein levels from aneuploid chromosomes while the mRNA levels correlate with gene dosage. This interpretation also seems to have been made in a vacuum of the evolutionary genomics data noted above and there was no consideration of transcriptome size change in the aneuploids. Also, Muenzner et al make the remarkable suggestion that there is degradation of overproduced proteins from hyperploidy, but for monosomies there is greater degradation of the proteins from the remainder of the genome.</p>
<p>To clarify the claims of this study, it would be informative to produce distributions of the various ratios of individual gene expression in monosomy versus diploid as performed by Hou et al. 2018. This will better express the trends of up and down regulation across the genome and whether there are any genes on the varied chromosome that are dosage compensated. The authors claim in the Abstract that &quot;There is no evidence of increased (compensatory) gene expression on the monosomic chromosomes&quot;, but then note after describing the increased cell volume of monosomies that this observation likely signals an increased transcriptome size: &quot;Indeed, one explanation for the observed epistasis for viability could be an ample overproduction of all transcripts, so that even those halved by monosomy are sufficiently abundant&quot;. It is not clear to this reviewer what conclusions can be made from this work other than the empirical observation that monosomy does not reflect the cumulative effect of multiple haplo-insufficiencies of individual heterozygous deletions and that there are some RELATIVE changes in gene expression, but it is unclear what the ABSOLUTE PER CELL expression is across the whole genome. Clarifying this issue would be important for understanding the nature of any epistasis and fitness consequences.</p>

<p>The current study examined 13 monosomic yeast strains that lost different individual chromosomes. By comparing the fitness of monosomic strains and several heterozygous deletion strains, the authors observed strong positive epistasis for fitness. The transcriptomes of monosomic strains indicated that general gene-dose compensation is not the reason for fitness gains. On the other hand, gene expression of ribosomal proteins was up-regulated and proteasome subunit expression was down-regulated in all tested monosomic strains. The authors speculated that overexpression in combination with decreased degradation of the insufficient proteins might explain the positive epistasis observed in monosomic strains. This study investigates an important biological question and has some interesting results. However, I have some reservations about the data interpretations listed below.</p>
<p>(1) In Figure 3b (and line 179), the authors stated that those haploinsufficient genes were not transcribed at elevated rates, but almost half of them are in reddish colors (indicating that the expression is higher than 1-fold). Obviously, many haploinsufficient genes are up-regulated in monosomic strains. What the data really show is that the level of overexpression is not correlated with the fitness effect of the deletion (since all the p values are not significant). The authors need to correct their conclusions.</p>
<p>
(2) Why are some monosomic strains removed from the transcriptomics analysis, especially when the chromosome IV and XV strains show very strong positive epistasis? The authors need to provide an explanation here.</p>
<p>
(3) The authors stated that diploidy observed in chromosome VII and XIII strains were due to endoreplication after losing the marked chromosomes (lines 97 and 117). Isn't chromosome missegregation an equally possible explanation? Since monosomic cells are generated by chromosome missegregation during mitosis, another chromosome missegregation event may occur to rescue the fitness (or viability) of monosomic cells in these strains.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Response to Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is correct that the previous explanation of the fitness calculation could be considered insufficient as it was only briefly described in Results. In the revised manuscript, in the &quot;Supplementary Materials&quot; section and then in &quot;Supplementary Text 1&quot;, we provide a full definition of the fitness of strains carrying single or multiple mutations and thus show how epistasis was calculated.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Response to Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our opinion, the reviewer's comments relate to three issues. First, our finding that the level of transcription of the monosomic chromosomes is not upregulated was not compared with the results of other studies, including those in other organisms. Indeed, we did not mention that the gene dosage distortions introduced by aneuploidy are frequently and profoundly compensated in multicellular organisms. We cite the suggested broad and recent review paper in the revised manuscript (line 247). We also removed the somewhat provocative sentence: “The relationship between transcriptome and proteome is generally fixed in yeast”. Regarding this organism, both data and opinions remain indeed conflicting when considering the work with many different yeast strains. But the standard laboratory strains stand out as those where dosage compensation is absent or weak. A paper published a year ago states flatly: &quot;... at least in the strain background used here (authors: BY, the same we use), aneuploidies are transmitted to transcriptome and proteome with a minimum of gene-dosage buffering, rendering aneuploidies discoverable by proteomics&quot; (Messner et al. 2023). A more recent paper reports: &quot;In lab-generated aneuploids, some proteins - especially subunits of protein complexes - show reduced expression, but the overall protein levels correspond to the aneuploid gene dosage&quot; (Muenzner et al. 2024). This &quot;reduced expression&quot; was seen in disomics and was achieved by upregulated proteolysis, whereas we have monosomics and downregulated proteolysis. In summary, we cannot back away from our claim that the biases introduced by monosomy were not compensated. (It is not critical to our paper, we could do it and still leave our main claim about extraordinarily high positive epistasis intact). Muezner and colleagues do report compensation, but in &quot;wild&quot; strains. Our explanation would be that the existing yeast aneuploids are not a random sample of aneuploid mutations. In particular, they could be strains, perhaps relatively rare, in which the genetic background was permissive for aneuploidy from the start or allowed rapid evolution toward tolerance of aneuploidy. Strains with rigid gene-mRNA-protein relationships suffer so much that they perish unless they are shielded from selection, as is possible in the laboratory. The reviewer will know better whether this might also apply to multicellular organisms.</p>
<p>The second concern is that we did not sufficiently report &quot;... the trends of up- and downregulation across the genome and whether there are any genes on the varied chromosome that are dosage compensated&quot;. We believe we have indeed done this, albeit mostly in a simple graphical fashion. For the whole genomes, Datasheet 2 reports the extent of down- or up-regulation for each gene in each strain and highlights those that are statistically significant. We do not analyze the distributions of these deviations because they are relative. They represent individual gene down- and up-regulations within a monosomic transcriptome compared to the corresponding genes in the diploid transcriptome, with the total size of the transcriptomes set equal. Thus, the downs and ups cancel each other out, the left and right sides of the distribution would be equal in their totals, and we have no meaningful expectations about the possible variation in the shapes of the overall distributions or their opposite sides. As for the &quot;varied chromosome&quot;, we show that there were extensive down- and up-regulations on the monosomic chromosomes, even though the mean expression for them was half that of the diploid chromosomes. This can be seen in Figure 3B as blue and red colored bars that are present on each monosomic chromosome and intermingled along its length. The purpose of these graphs is to show that even the genes in which the halving of the dose was most damaging to fitness (most negative values of rDR-1) did not tend to be upregulated on average (both blue and red colors are found among them). We consider this an important and original part of our data.</p>
<p>Finally, the reviewer is concerned that we are only dealing with the relative abundance of mRNA species. He/she suggests that &quot;... an experiment that would clarify the results would be to perform estimates of the total transcriptome size. If the general transcriptome size is indeed increased, the claims of reduced proteosome expression may need to be revised&quot;. We followed this advice and extracted transcriptomes from known amounts of yeast cells with known amounts of standard mRNA or &quot;spike&quot; added. We thus seriously considered the reviewer's suggestion, even though it was contrary to our intuition and, we believe, was not confirmed in the additional experiment. The results are reported in the last paragraph of Results and shown in Supplementary Figure S3. Our arguments are listed in that paragraph, so we will not repeat them here.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>(1) Figure 3b – both its legend and reference to it in the main text are corrected in line with suggestions made by Reviewers #1 and #3.</p>
<p>(2) We had to restrict our mRNA analysis to about a half of strains. We decided for purely random selection. It left M4 outside but nevertheless included M2, M10 or M16 representing the strains with especially high level of epistasis. See msc. lines 161-162.</p>
<p>(3) We agree, and say so in the article, that both the loss and gain of a copy of a chromosome most likely result in errors in mitosis. By &quot;endoreduplication&quot; we mean any event resulting in two chromosomes instead of one, not necessarily additional DNA replication as we now clarify. We also suggest that both loss and endoreduplication occurred in all strains, but in M7 and M13 they happened so close together that we could not isolate the rare monosomic cells from the rapidly spreading revertants (lines 86-91).</p>

<p>(1) The first sentence of this comment may be based on a misinterpretation of our main argument. We believe that the upregulation of ribosomal protein (RP) coding genes was not helpful, but harmful. It was costly because RPs are a large part of the proteome, but it did not help translation because it did not restore the stoichiometry of RPs. This unproductive investment reduced the rate of remaining metabolism, so that other impairments introduced by halving the doses of other genes were no longer critical, and this made them unobservable at the level of phenotype, i.e., produced epistasis. However, both this Reviewer and Reviewer 2 seem to suggest that an entire translational apparatus may have been expanded, compensating for its reduced efficiency (per transcript). Reviewer 2 suggested an mRNA spike as a standard, and we followed this approach as more accessible to us. (We reiterate our claim of good agreement between mRNAs and proteins in the BY strain, supported by two new important papers, line 256-257). The results are reported in the last paragraph of Results. We believe that they indicate a reduction, not an increase, in the translational apparatus (including its parts encoded on the monosomal chromosomes), so that our explanation of positive epistasis remains unchallenged.</p>
<p>(2) We re-examined the sequences and found that there were heterozygous SNPs in the same gene, <italic>RSP5</italic>, in several strains. One was a loss of a START codon (M3, M4, M6, M8, M9, M10, M14, M16), always the same. The other was a substitution, always the same, in M5, M11 and M15. There were no mutations in this gene in M1 and M2. We tested our stock haploid strains BY4741 and 4742 and found that they were not mutated. However, we also recovered the specific haploid strains used in the final crosses to construct the diploid strains used to obtain monosomics. Some had one of the two mutations, some were clean. All grew normally, the mutants were similar to the wild types, indicating that the fitness effect of the mutations, even in haploids, was at most partial, since the expected severe effects of <italic>RSP5</italic> inactivation were not visible.</p>
<p>Where do the mutations come from? In previous experiments, we subjected some BY strains to severe selection regimes. As we can now surmise, mutations in <italic>RSP5</italic> helped to resist some of them, especially those involving overexpression of selected genes. (We do not summarize here the results of our lengthy review of our notes and the literature leading this explanation to be the most plausible). Unfortunately, we used strains that went through that harsh selection in crosses serving to derive another collection of strains, those used here.</p>
<p>How critical is it? First, the mutations were heterozygous, which further reduced their apparently weak effects. Second, M1 and M2 were free of them. Third, we tried to get clean monosomics, i.e. with type homozygous for <italic>RSP5</italic>. We obtained such strains with monosomy as the only change for M9, M10 and M16. The other three attempts did not yield correct M3, M5 and M6, but complex aneuploids. This is normal, as we explain (complain) in Results. We would have to isolate a large number of potential monosomies and then sequence them to show that all exact monosomies can be derived in the absence of mutations in <italic>RSP5</italic>. We believe that after an effort comparable to that required to obtain the first set of monosomics, we would complete it. For financial and organizational reasons, this is not possible at this time. We do not consider it necessary to complete the revision. Note that of the five mutation-free straight monosomics, M2, M10 and M16 are among the most affected and thus have the highest positive epistasis. Yes, the role of point mutations cannot be excluded for other monosomics, although we strongly believe it is unlikely. But we have removed all our previous claims that our monosomies are certainly not supported by other genetic changes. Most importantly, our main claim of positive epistasis in its purely descriptive genetic sense remains unaffected. The main functional argument also holds: the indiscriminate overproduction of unbalanced RP proteins was so costly that inefficiencies introduced in functional modules other than biosynthesis become much less relevant. Thus, the main message of our work does not depend on the thinkable, in our view unlikely, role of mutations in <italic>RSP5</italic>.</p>
<p>We provided this lengthy explanation to show that we cared about the reviewer's comment and tried to deal with it in an honest way. It was a lot of pain and no gain for us, but we are still grateful for the opportunity to re-examine our main claims.</p>
<p>(3) The 16 (non-essential) plus 16 (essential) strains were replicated 3 times each. In preliminary experiments, we tested that they were not statistically different (using one-way ANOVA). We considered these 32 strains to have the same genetic background, and thus we considered the 96 estimates homogeneous, except for being influenced only by environmental variation or random error.</p>
<p>(4) We changed the description of Figure 3b to explain that a particular color shows a range (not its boundary) of log2 fold change (FC) relative to the control.</p>
<p>(5) Corrected.</p>
<p>(6) Corrected.</p>
