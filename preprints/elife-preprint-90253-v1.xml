<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Heat stress is a major threat to global crop production, and understanding its impact on plant fertility is crucial for developing climate-resilient crops. Despite the known negative effects of heat stress on plant reproduction, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the impact of elevated temperature on centromere structure and chromosome segregation during meiosis in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. Our findings reveal that heat stress causes a significant decline in fertility and leads to the formation of micronuclei in pollen mother cells, along with an extended duration of meiotic division. We also demonstrate a reduction in the amounts of centromeric histone and the kinetochore protein BMF1 at meiotic centromeres with increasing temperature. Furthermore, we show that heat stress prolongs the activity of the spindle assembly checkpoint during meiosis I, indicating impaired efficiency of the kinetochore attachments to spindle microtubules. Our analysis of mutants with reduced amounts of centromeric histone suggests that weakened centromeres sensitize plants to elevated temperature, resulting in meiotic defects and reduced fertility even at moderate temperatures. These results indicate that the structure and functionality of meiotic centromeres in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> are highly sensitive to heat stress, and suggest that centromeres and kinetochores may represent a crucial bottleneck in plant adaptation to increasing temperatures.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Global warming impacts crop productivity with more frequent and extreme heatwaves being particularly damaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bras et al., 2021</xref>). The lower yields associated with heatwaves are mainly attributed to the impairment of the plant reproductive system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lippmann et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, a fundamental understanding of how heat stress affects plant reproduction can guide breeding strategies towards generating climate change resilient crops. Heat stress impairs both male and female reproductive structures, but male gametogenesis is particularly sensitive to higher temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Zinn et al., 2010</xref>). Studies in crop and non-crop species have shown that heat stress affects pollen count, morphology, viability, dehiscence, germination and pollen tube growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">De Storme and Geelen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chaturvedi et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Acute heat stress applied at different stages of flower development has been found to have the most detrimental effect during microsporogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Pecrix et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hedhly et al., 2020</xref>). Meiosis, a reductive cell division that halves number of chromosomes in two consecutive rounds of chromosome segregation, is a crucial step of microsporogenesis. It is a relatively slow process, lasting approximately 1.5 to 2 days in Arabidopsis and barley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Armstrong et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Higgins et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Prusicki et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Valuchova et al., 2020</xref>). Prophase I, the longest phase of meiosis, is characterized by pairing and recombination of homologous chromosomes to form stable bivalents. It is followed by two chromosome segregation cycles that first divide homologous chromosomes and then the sister chromatids. Heat stress affects various aspects of plant meiosis. In prophase I, elevated temperature alters the rate and distribution of meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Higgins et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lloyd et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Modliszewski et al., 2018</xref>) and a recent study in Arabidopsis has shown that heat shock response pathway directly regulates the recombination machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kim et al., 2022</xref>). More severe heat stress can impair synapsis and pairing of homologous chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Loidl, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">De Storme and Geelen, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ning et al., 2021</xref>). This is likely due to inefficient completion of homologous recombination, which is monitored by specialized pachytene checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">De Jaeger-Braet et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Heat stress affects the later stages of meiosis as well. Elevated temperatures disturb spindle orientation during meiotic divisions and the formation of radial microtubule arrays, resulting in aberrant cytokinesis and diploid microspores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Pecrix et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">De Storme and Geelen, 2020</xref>). Furthermore, acute heat stress leads to chromosome mis-segregation and the formation of micronuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">De Storme and Geelen, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">De Jaeger-Braet et al., 2022</xref>). The meiotic micronuclei and chromosomal aberrations may arise as a consequence of abnormal repair of meiotic DNA breaks or homologous recombination intermediates in prophase I. However, they can also be caused by defects in chromosome segregation during meiotic divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fenech et al., 2011</xref>). Proper attachment of kinetochores to the spindle microtubules before anaphase is crucial for faithful chromosome partitioning to daughter cells, and this process is controlled by spindle assembly checkpoint. Therefore, micronuclei typically occur in mutants with impaired centromere/kinetochore structure or spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) when treated with spindle inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kalitsis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lermontova et al., 2011b</xref>).</p>
<p>In most eukaryotes centromeres are confined to a restricted region on each chromosome that serves as a platform for assembly of the kinetochore, a multiprotein structure that connects chromosome with the spindle. Centromeres are defined epigenetically by a specialized centromeric histone H3 variant (CENH3), which forms the foundation for the recruitment of kinetochore proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">McAinsh and Marston, 2022</xref>). In contrast to canonical histones, replicative dilution of CENH3 is not replenished immediately in S-phase, but in subsequent stages of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Stirpe and Heun, 2023</xref>). In plants, CENH3 is loaded on centromeres in G2 and persists there throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Talbert et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lermontova et al., 2006</xref>). CENH3 is a very stable component of centromeric chromatin, although its amount at centromeres gradually declines in terminally differentiated cells in plants and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lermontova et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Swartz et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we have discovered that heat stress significantly reduces the amount of CENH3 on meiotic chromosomes in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. This loss of CENH3 leads to the formation of micronuclei, which in turn contributes to the decrease in pollen formation and fertility in plants exposed to heat stress. Additionally, we have found that plants with a genetic mutation that reduces the amount of centromeric histone are more sensitive to moderately elevated temperature. These results suggest that meiotic centromeres may represent a crucial point of vulnerability for plants in adaptation to raising temperatures.</p>

<title>Pollen production and fertility decline with increasing temperature</title>
<p>In our previous work, we identified the <italic>cenh3-4</italic> allele of Arabidopsis centromeric histone <italic>CENH3</italic> that carries a mutation in the splicing donor site of the 3<sup>rd</sup> exon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Capitao et al., 2021</xref>). This leads to a 10-fold reduction in fully spliced <italic>CENH3</italic> mRNA and a decreased amount of centromeric histone. Consequently, <italic>cenh3-4</italic> plants have smaller centromeres and are sensitive to oryzalin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Capitao et al., 2021</xref>). Under standard conditions, <italic>cenh3-4</italic> mutants are barely distinguishable from wild type, but we noticed their reduced fertility when grown at an elevated temperature. To systematically assess this phenotype, we grew plants under standard conditions (21°C) until they formed four true leaves, and then continued their cultivation in growth chambers tempered to 16, 21, 26 and 30°C (Figure S1). At 16°C, plants exhibited the slowest growth, but also the highest fertility, as assessed by pollen count and silique length, which is indicative of seed yield (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Fertility slightly decreased at 21°C and further declined at 26°C. In <italic>cenh3-4</italic> mutants, we noticed a sharp decline in pollen production and fertility at 26°C (86±48 pollen per anther), whereas the fertility of the wild type was still relatively high (213±58 pollen per anther) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Both <italic>cenh3-4</italic> and wild type plants became infertile at 30°C. The heat-induced sterility was reversible and <italic>cenh3-4</italic> as well as wild type plants transferred from 30 to 21°C regained fertile flowers (Figure S1C). These data indicate that pollen production and fertility gradually decline with increasing temperature and this trend is particularly pronounced in <italic>cenh3-4</italic> mutants that have become almost sterile already at 26°C.</p>

<p>It has been reported that extreme heat stress alters chromosome segregation fidelity and the duration of Arabidopsis meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">De Jaeger-Braet et al., 2022</xref>). Temperatures of 34°C and above abolished chromosome pairing and synapsis and led to the formation of univalents. However, meiotic chromosomes are fully paired at 30°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ning et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">De Jaeger-Braet et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fu et al., 2022</xref>) indicating that the recombination defects are not primarily responsible for abortive pollen development at this temperature.</p>

<title>Heat stress delays meiotic progression and induces micronuclei</title>
<p>To assess the effect of temperature on meiotic progression and chromosome segregation at temperatures up to 30°C, we performed live imaging of meiotic divisions in the HTA10:RFP reporter line, which marks chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Valuchova et al., 2020</xref>). We measured the duration of meiotic divisions from the end of diakinesis until the formation of haploid nuclei in telophase II (Figure S2). Meiotic divisions were slowest at 16°C and lasted, on average, 441 and 459 min in wild type and <italic>cenh3-4</italic>, respectively (Movies 1 and 2, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Meiosis progressed significantly faster with increasing temperature. Wild type meiotic divisions took 169 min at 21°C and 142 min at 26°C (Movies 3 and 4). Meiotic divisions were also rapid in <italic>cenh3-4</italic> at 21°C, lasting on average 156 min, but slowed down to 238 min at 26°C (Movies 5 and 6). This contrasts with the situation in wild type, where divisions occur at the fastest rate at 26°C. Interestingly, meiotic divisions were prolonged at 30°C in both wild type and <italic>cenh3-4</italic> mutants to 286 and 264 min, respectively (Movies 7 and 8). The slowdown of meiosis at 26°C and 30°C in cenh3-4, and at 30°C in wild type coincides with the steep decline of pollen production (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B,C</xref>) and indicates problems with meiotic progression.</p>

<p>Live imaging in <italic>cenh3-4</italic> plants and, at 30°C, also in wild type showed formation of micronuclei that began to form during meiosis I and persisted till telophase II (Movies 7 and 8). We quantified the micronuclei in fixed anthers at the tetrad stage using confocal microscopy (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B,C</xref>). The micronuclei were apparent in <italic>cenh3-4</italic> mutants at all temperatures, which is consistent with partially impaired centromere function in these plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Capitao et al., 2021</xref>). Nevertheless, their occurrence substantially increased at 26°C and severe defects in chromosome segregation were observed at 30°C (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B,C</xref>; Movies 6 and 8) resulting in very few regular tetrads. Whereas we occasionally detected micronuclei at lower temperatures also in wild type, albeit at a much lower level than in <italic>cenh3-4</italic>, their incidence increased 15-fold between 26°C and 30°C (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B,C</xref>, Movies 4 and 7). In addition, we observed dyads and polyads, which is consistent with the previous study performed at a similar temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">De Storme and Geelen, 2020</xref>). These data show that temperature-induced fertility reduction coincides with increased occurrence of micronuclei.</p>
<p>Micronuclei may arise from acentric fragments and dicentric chromosomes derived from defective repair of meiotic breaks. Indeed, temperatures above 30°C were reported to cause aberrant recombination intermediates and induce pachytene checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">De Storme and Geelen, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">De Jaeger-Braet et al., 2022</xref>). In this scenario, the absence of meiotic breaks in <italic>SPO11</italic>-deficient plants should prevent the formation of temperature-induced micronuclei. Arabidopsis <italic>spo11-2</italic> mutants do not form bivalents, and homologous chromosomes segregate randomly in anaphase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Stacey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hartung et al., 2007</xref>). Cytogenetic analysis in spo11-2 plants revealed a relatively high level of micronuclei in tetrads at 21°C (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B,C</xref>). Because unpaired univalents cannot properly bi-orient at metaphase I spindle, these micronuclei are likely generated by chromosome mis-segregation. Importantly, number of the micronuclei almost doubled in spo11-2 plants grown at 30°C (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B,C</xref>) arguing that temperature has a direct effect on chromosome segregation.</p>
<p>In its natural habitats, A. <italic>thaliana</italic> usually flowers from March to early summer under average daily temperatures lower than the ones used for cultivation in laboratories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Shindo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Brachi et al., 2010</xref>). Due to the day-night cycle, they never experience sustained temperatures over 30°C. Therefore, we tested whether meiotic defects observed after continuous cultivation at 30°C could also be induced under more physiological conditions that mimic a hot day. To this end, we cultivated plants in chambers tempered to 18°C overnight and increased temperature to 34°C for 6 hrs during the day (Figure S3A). We observed a drastic reduction in fertility and pollen count, as well as an increased frequency of micronuclei compared to control plants grown under the 18°C/21°C night/day regime (Figure S3B-D). These data suggest that heatwaves occurring during flowering can have a detrimental effect on Arabidopsis meiosis.</p>

<title>Heat stress reduces the amounts of centromeric histone on meiotic centromeres</title>
<p>Our phenotypic analysis indicates that <italic>cenh3-4</italic> mutants grown at 26°C exhibit the same behavior as wild type plants grown at 30°C. Therefore, we investigated whether increasing temperature weakens the centromere structure, which could explain the temperature sensitivity of <italic>cenh3-4</italic> plants with less centromeric histone. CENH3 is present on meiotic chromosomes from early prophase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Talbert et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lermontova et al., 2006</xref>) and its signal is most visible in pachytene when homologous chromosomes are fully synapsed. To evaluate the effect of temperature on centromeres, we analyzed the CENH3 signal on pachytene chromosomes in anthers of the Arabidopsis <italic>eYFP:CENH3</italic> reporter line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Le Goff et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Demidov et al., 2022</xref>) grown at 21, 26 and 30°C. While eYFP:CENH3 was easily detectable on pachytene chromosomes at 21°C, the signal decreased significantly at 26°C and declined further at 30°C (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A,B</xref>). We observed this trend in three independent experiments (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). In contrast, the eYFP:CENH3 signal in tapetum nuclei neighboring the pollen mother cells exhibited the opposite trend and increased with elevated temperature (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A,C</xref>). This resulted in a striking difference in signal intensity at 30°C, where the tapetum exhibited a strong eYFP:CENH3 signal, whereas the signal on pachytene chromosomes in the same field of view was barely detectable (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>

<p>CENH3 acts as a platform for binding additional kinetochore and spindle assembly checkpoint proteins. BMF1 is an Arabidopsis BUB1-related protein that associates with centromeres throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Komaki and Schnittger, 2017</xref>). We generated Arabidopsis marker lines expressing <italic>BMF1::BMF1:eYFP and BMF1::BMF1:TagRFP</italic> constructs, and validated BMF1 co-localization with CENH3 from early prophase I until telophase II (Figure S4, Movie 9). Quantification of the BMF1:eYFP signal on pachytene chromosomes showed a decline at 26°C, and BMF1 was undetectable at 30°C (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D,E</xref>). These data suggest that elevated temperature reduces the amount of CENH3 and the kinetochore protein BMF1 on meiotic centromeres, potentially affecting their functionality.</p>

<title>Heat stress prolongs spindle assembly checkpoint in metaphase I</title>
<p>In our previous report, we showed that reduced amount of CENH3 and smaller centromeres prolonged the biorientation of mitotic chromosomes in <italic>cenh3-4</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Capitao et al., 2021</xref>). Biorientation is monitored by the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), and its satisfaction triggers anaphase. We hypothesized that meiotic chromosomes with heat-induced reductions in CENH3 might take longer to properly attach to the spindle and satisfy the SAC. The core SAC proteins temporarily associate with the kinetochore during spindle formation and disappear shortly before the onset of anaphase. BMF3 is one of the core components of the Arabidopsis SAC that associates with the kinetochore during prometaphase and extends this association in the presence of a spindle inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Komaki and Schnittger, 2017</xref>). To monitor SAC on meiotic chromosomes, we generated an Arabidopsis line expressing <italic>BMF3::BMF3:GFP</italic> together with the tubulin marker TagRFP:TUB4. Initially, we validated the localization of BMF3 on meiotic chromosomes by live cell imaging since BMF3 was previously only analyzed in the context of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Komaki and Schnittger, 2017</xref>). We observed the BMF3:GFP signal during prometaphase/metaphase I, it disappeared at the onset of anaphase I and reappeared again during metaphase II indicating that BMF3 is a component of the meiotic SAC (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, Movie 10). We then analyzed the effect of temperature on SAC duration. Since the signal was more prominent in metaphase I, we measured the duration of the active SAC during meiosis I. We observed that while the BMF3:GFP signal persisted, on average, for about 22.7 min at 21 and 26°C, its appearance was prolonged to 40.5 min at 30°C (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, Movies 11 and 12). This observation supports our finding that centromere structure is compromised at elevated temperatures, which may extend the time necessary for chromosome biorientation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we investigated the impact of increased temperature on fertility and meiotic progression in Arabidopsis. We observed that A. <italic>thaliana</italic> (ecotype Col-0) exhibited the highest fertility when grown at 16°C, which closely resembles the average temperature during flowering in its natural habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Brachi et al., 2010</xref>). At this temperature, meiotic divisions took more than twice as long as at 21°C. Arabidopsis grown at 17°C was reported to exhibit slower microsporogenesis, with the entire meiosis process lasting 48 hours as opposed to 32 hours at 24°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, the slower progression was found to be less detrimental for several mutations that affect microsporogenesis, indicating that a slower pace provides greater robustness. Overall, these observations suggest that the pace of meiosis in Arabidopsis is well optimized for its natural growth conditions, enabling the plants to achieve maximum fitness.</p>
<p>The process of meiosis is progressively accelerated with increasing temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">De Jaeger-Braet et al., 2022</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). However, the speed of meiotic divisions reaches its maximum at 26°C and slows down at 30°C under the conditions used in this study. At 30°C, fertility is lost and high incidence of micronuclei is observed, implying that the temperature around 30°C impairs some molecular processes involved in chromosome segregation and genome integrity. The micronuclei can represent acentric fragments derived from aberrant processing of recombination intermediates. Indeed, the impact of temperature on recombination machinery is well documented. A moderate increase in temperature leads to shift in chiasma distribution and cross-over frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Higgins et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lloyd et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Modliszewski et al., 2018</xref>). Heat stress above 30°C severely impairs recombination and synapsis, leading to univalents and chromosome segregation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">De Storme and Geelen, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ning et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">De Jaeger-Braet et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fu et al., 2022</xref>). Nevertheless, we observed an increased incidence of micronuclei also in SPO11-deficient plants that do not form meiotic DNA double-strand breaks indicating that only a portion of micronuclei is derived from aberrant recombination.</p>
<p>Micronuclei can also be formed by aberrant chromosome segregation during anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fenech et al., 2011</xref>). The accurate partitioning of chromosomes depends on the correct attachment of centromeres to the spindle microtubules. Recent reports have indicated that the stability of microtubules in plant meiocytes is compromised by heat stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">De Jaeger-Braet et al., 2022</xref>). In this study, we have demonstrated that high temperature also affects the structure and function of meiotic centromeres. Our findings suggest that elevated temperature reduces the amount of CENH3 and BMF1 on meiotic centromeres (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). These weakened centromeres may be less effective in establishing productive interactions with spindle microtubules. This is consistent with the prolonged spindle assembly checkpoint we observed through the longer residency of BMF3 on prometaphase I centromeres at 30°C (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Taken together, our data indicate that heat stress impairs centromere function, which in turn decreases the efficiency of proper attachment of chromosomes to the meiotic spindle. As a result, these chromosomes may not be transported to their intended destination in a timely manner and, therefore, not incorporated into the newly formed nuclei. This scenario also explains the increased temperature-sensitivity of <italic>cenh3-4</italic> plants, which already have smaller centromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Capitao et al., 2021</xref>); even moderately elevated temperature may further enhance this defect.</p>
<p>How elevated temperature affects the amount of CENH3 on centromeres? Studies in human cells have revealed that CENH3 nucleosomes are less stable than previously thought. The amount of CENH3 at centromeres declines over time and must be actively replenished to preserve centromere identity and proliferative potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Swartz et al., 2019</xref>). Transcription has been shown to cause the eviction of pre-existing CENH3 from the centromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Swartz et al., 2019</xref>). In Arabidopsis, depletion of CENH3 from centromeres has been observed in leaf cells with increasing age, indicating that this phenomenon also occurs in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lermontova et al., 2011a</xref>). The Arabidopsis centromeric satellite repeat CEN180 undergoes pervasive transcription, which is largely repressed by epigenetic silencing mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">May et al., 2005</xref>). However, heat stress can alleviate the repression and induce transcription of CEN180 from silent loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tittel-Elmer et al., 2010</xref>). This temperature-induced transcription can increase the eviction of CENH3 nucleosomes, potentially compromising centromere structure if not replenished. Interestingly, in contrast to pollen mother cells, tapetum cells do not exhibit CENH3 loss at elevated temperatures (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). This may be due to the different efficiency of CENH3 deposition to replenish the heat-induced loss of CENH3 in these cell types. Accordingly, Arabidopsis meiotic cells possess a specialized CENH3 loading mechanism that seems more stringent than the loading mechanism operating in mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lermontova et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ravi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Schubert et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Crosses between wild type and plants with altered CENH3 can result in postzygotic loss of one set of parental chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Ravi and Chan, 2010</xref>). This is attributed to inefficient re-loading of CENH3 on the set of parental chromosomes with the altered centromeres in hybrid embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Marimuthu et al., 2021</xref>). Recent studies showed that heat stress applied during early embryogenesis could enhance the centromere-mediated genome elimination in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ahmadli et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Jin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). This indicates that similarly to meiocytes, elevated temperature can also destabilize centromeres in embryonic cells.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study highlights the significant impact of temperature on the centromere structure and reproduction in Arabidopsis. We found that already moderate increase in temperature has a discernable effect on pollen production and silique length, and exposure to 30°C impairs the structure of centromeres and leads to plant sterility. These findings are particularly relevant in the context of climate change, where rising temperatures and more frequent weather extreme periods pose a threat to global food security by disrupting plant reproductive processes. As such, our study provides important insights into the mechanisms that contribute to the reduction of plant fertility in response to elevated temperature. Further research on molecular aspects underlying these effects may help to develop strategies to generate plants more resilient to extreme weather during their reproductive phase.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study reports how heat stress affects centromere integrity by compromising the loading of the centromere protein CENH3 and by prolonging the spindle assembly checkpoint during male meiosis in Arabidopsis thaliana. The evidence supporting the claims by live cell imaging is <bold>convincing</bold>, although deeper mechanistic insight is lacking, making the study overall somewhat preliminary in nature. This work will be of interest to a broad audience of biologists working on how chromatin states are affected by stress conditions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Khaitova and co-workers present here an analysis of centromere composition and function during elevated temperatures in the plant Arabidopsis. The work relates to the ongoing climate change during which spikes in high temperatures will be found. Hence, the paper addresses a timely subject.</p>
<p>The authors start by confirming earlier studies that high temperatures reduce the fertility of Arabidopsis plants. Interestingly, a hypomorphic mutant of the centromeric histone variant CENH3 (CENP-A), which was previously described by the authors, sensitizes plants to heat and results in a drop in viable pollen and silique length. The drop in fertility coincides with the formation of micronuclei in meiosis and an extension of meiotic progression as revealed by live cell imaging. Based on this finding, the authors then show that at high temperatures, the fluorescence intensity of a YFP:CENH3 declines in meiosis but remarkably not in the surrounding cells (tapetum cells). In addition, the amount of BMF1 (a Bub1 homolog and part of the spindle assembly checkpoint) also appears to decline on the kinetochores of meiocytes as judged by BMF1 reporter line. However, whether this is dependent on a decline of CENH3 or represents a separate pathway is not clear. Finally, the authors measure the duration of the spindle checkpoint and find that it is extended under high temperatures from which they conclude that the attachment of spindle fibers to kinetochores is compromised under heat.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This is an interesting and important paper as it links centromere organization/function to heat stress in plants. A major conclusion of the authors is that weakened centromeres, presumably by heat, may be less effective in establishing productive interactions with spindle microtubules.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The paper does not explain the molecular reason why CENH3 levels in meiocyctes are reduced or why the attachment of spindle fibers to kinetochore is less efficient at high versus low temperatures.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This work investigates how increased temperature affects pollen production and fertility of Arabidopsis thaliana plants grown at selected temperature conditions ranging from 16C to 30C. They report that pollen production and fertility decline with increasing temperature. To identify the cause of reduced pollen and fertility, they resort to living cell imaging of male meiotic cells to identify that the duration of meiosis increases with an increase in temperature. They also show that pollen sterility is associated with the increased presence of micronuclei likely originating from heat stress-induced impaired meiotic chromosome segregation. They correlate abnormal meiosis to weakened centromere caused by meiosis-specific defective loading of the centromere-specific histone H3 variant (CenH3) to the meiotic centromeres. Similar is the case with kinetochore-associated spindle assembly checkpoint(SAC) protein BMF1. Intriguingly, they observe a reverse trend of strong CENH3 presence in the somatic cells of the tapetum in contrast to reduced loading of CENH3 in male meiocytes with increasing temperature. In contrast to CENH3 and BMF1, the SAC protein BMF3 persists for longer periods than the WT control, based on which authors conclude that the heat stress prolongs the duration of SAC at metaphase I, which in turn extends the time of chromosome biorientation during meiosis I. The study provides preliminary insights into the processes that affect plant reproduction with increasing temperatures which may be relevant to develop climate-resilient cultivars.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors have mastered the live cell imaging of male meiocytes which is a technically demanding exercise, which they have successfully employed to examine the time course of meiosis in Arabidopsis thaliana plants exposed to different temperature conditions. In continuation, they also monitor the loading dynamics and resident time of fluorescently tagged centromere/kinetochore proteins and spindle assembly checkpoint proteins to precisely measure the time duration of respective proteins to study their precise dynamics and function in male meiosis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Here the authors use only one representative centromere protein CENH3, one kinetochore-associated SAC protein BMF1, and the SAC protein BMF3 to conclude that heat stress impairs centromere function and prolongs SAC with increased temperatures. Centromere and its associated protein complex the kinetochores and the SAC contain a multitude of proteins, some of which are well characterized in Arabidopsis thaliana. Hence the authors could have used additional such tagged proteins to further strengthen their claim. Though the results presented here are interesting and solid, the study lacks a deeper mechanistic understanding of what causes the defective loading of CenH3 to the centromeres, and why the SAC protein BMF3 persists only at meiotic centromeres to prolong the spindle assembly checkpoint. Also, this observation should be interpreted in light of the fact that SAC is not that robust in plants as several null mutants of plant SAC components are known to grow as healthy as wild-type plants at normal growth conditions without any vegetative and reproductive defects. One of the immediate responses to heat stress is the production of heat shock proteins(Hsps), which act as molecular chaperones to safeguard the proteome. It will be interesting to see if the expression levels of known HsPs can be correlated with their role in stabilizing the structure of SAC proteins like BMF1 to prolong its presence at the meiotic kinetochores.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Khaitova et al. report the formation of micronuclei during Arabidopsis meiosis under elevated temperatures. Micronuclei form when chromosomes are not correctly collected to the cellular poles in dividing cells. This happens when whole chromosomes or fragments are not properly attached to the kinetochore microtubules. The incidence of micronuclei formation is shown to increase at elevated temperatures in wild-type and more so in the weak centromere histone mutant cenH3-4. The number of micronuclei formed at high temperatures in the recombination mutant spo11 is like that in wild-type, indicating that the increased sensitivity of cenh3-4 is not related to the putative role of cenh3 in recombination. The abundance of CENH3-GFP at the centromere declines with higher temperature and correlates with a decline in spindle assembly checkpoint factor BMF1-GFP at the centromeres. The reduction in CENH3-GFP under heat is observed in meiocytes whereas CENH3-GFP abundance increases in the tapetum, suggesting there is a differential regulation of centromere loading in these two cell types. These observations are in line with previous reports on haploidization mutants and their hypersensitivity to heat stress.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This paper is an important contribution to our insights into the impact of heat stress on sexual reproduction in plants.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
While it is highly significant, I struggled to interpret the results because of the poor quality of the figures and the videos.</p>
