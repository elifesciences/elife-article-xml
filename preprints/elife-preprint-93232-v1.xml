<title>Abstract</title><p>Plants distribute many nutrients to chloroplasts during leaf development and maturation. When leaves senesce or experience sugar starvation, the autophagy machinery degrades chloroplast proteins to facilitate efficient nutrient reuse. Here, we report on the intracellular dynamics of an autophagy pathway responsible for piecemeal degradation of chloroplast components. Through live-cell monitoring of chloroplast morphology, we observed the formation of chloroplast budding structures in sugar-starved leaves. The buds were then released and incorporated into the vacuolar lumen as an autophagic cargo termed a Rubisco-containing body. These budding structures did not accumulate in mutants of core autophagy machinery, suggesting that autophagosome creation is required for forming chloroplast protrusions. Simultaneous tracking of chloroplast morphology and autophagosome development revealed that the isolation membranes of autophagosomes tightly interact with part of the chloroplast surface before forming chloroplast buds. Chloroplasts then protrude at the site associated with the isolation membranes, which divide synchronously with autophagosome maturation. This autophagy-related division does not require DYNAMIN-RELATED PROTEIN 5B (DRP5B), which constitutes the division ring for chloroplast proliferation in growing leaves. An unidentified division machinery may thus fragment chloroplasts for degradation in coordination with the development of the chloroplast-associated isolation membrane.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Organelle morphology changes dynamically in response to fluctuations in cell functions, developmental stages, and environmental cues. Plastids are plant-specific organelles that differentiate into chloroplasts in green tissues to perform photosynthesis. Plastids further serve as hubs for various metabolic pathways such as the biosynthesis of amino acids and plant hormones. Dynamic changes in plastid morphology also act as switches initiating biological programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Osteryoung and Pyke, 2014</xref>). For instance, chloroplasts in leaf pavement cells form stroma-filled tubular extensions termed stromules to activate programed cell death as an immune response upon perception of an invading pathogen, in a process regulated by the plant hormone salicylic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Caplan et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Leaf aging is closely associated with morphological and functional changes of plastids. At the early stage of leaf development, the undifferentiated form of plastids, termed proplastids, are converted to green chloroplasts as their population expands through active division. In Arabidopsis (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>), the coordination of cytoplasmic ring structures comprising DYNAMIN-RELATED PROTEIN 5B (DRP5B), also called ACCUMULATION AND REPLICATION OF CHLOROPLASTS 5 (ARC5), and intrachloroplastic ring structures consisting of FILAMENTING TEMPERATURE-SENSITIVE Z (FTSZ) proteins mediates chloroplast division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). In mature leaves, spherical chloroplasts occupy almost all of the cytoplasm and manifest high photosynthetic activity. When older leaves later senesce, the size and number of chloroplasts gradually decrease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Martinoia et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mae et al., 1984</xref>). Younger leaves closer to the shoot apex will sometimes shade older leaves beneath them, thus perturbing photosynthesis by decreasing the amount of light reaching those leaves and causing local sugar starvation. In such sugar-starved leaves, senescence is accelerated to facilitate the relocation of nutrients into newly developing tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Weaver and Amasino, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Ono et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Law et al., 2018</xref>). Autophagy is an intracellular degradation machinery that contributes to the decline in chloroplast volume and numbers during leaf senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wada et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Autophagy is a ubiquitous mechanism that transports cytoplasmic components to the vacuolar/lysosomal compartment for degradation in eukaryotic cells. The major autophagy pathway called macroautophagy, or simply autophagy, begins with the assembly of a membrane termed the isolation membrane (also known as a phagophore) that forms a double-membrane vesicle termed the autophagosome and sequesters a portion of the cytoplasm. Core AUTOPHAGY (ATG) proteins (ATG1–10, 12–14, 16, 18) are highly conserved among plants, yeasts, and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yoshimoto and Ohsumi, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Nakamura et al., 2021a</xref>), and are required for the initiation and elongation of the isolation membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Nakatogawa, 2020</xref>). The outer membrane of autophagosomes fuses with the vacuolar/lysosomal membrane, resulting in the formation of autophagic bodies whose cargos are digested by vacuolar/lysosomal hydrolases. Our previous studies identified two types of autophagy for chloroplast degradation in mature leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Ishida et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Nakamura and Izumi, 2018</xref>). Senescence and sugar starvation preferentially activate piecemeal degradation of chloroplast components involving a specific type of autophagic body termed a Rubisco-containing body (RCB), leading to smaller chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ishida et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wada et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Izumi et al., 2015</xref>). The second type of autophagy, termed chlorophagy, removes entire unnecessary chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Izumi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Nakamura et al., 2018</xref>), thereby modulating the number of chloroplasts in a cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wada et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Izumi et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Mitochondria are another type of energy-producing organelle derived from endosymbiosis. Dynamin-related proteins (DRPs) also mediate mitochondrial division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Giacomello et al., 2020</xref>); the involvement of DRP-mediated organelle division in mitochondrion-targeted autophagy—termed mitophagy—in mammals and budding yeast (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>) has been under debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen et al., 2022</xref>). Drp1 and Dnm1p (Dynamin-related 1) participate in mitochondrial fission in mammals and budding yeast, respectively. Previous studies have suggested that segmented mitochondria resulting from Drp1/Dnm1p-mediated fission become a target for degradation by autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Twig et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Rambold et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abeliovich et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, Drp1/Dnm1p-independent mitophagy has also been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Yamashita et al., 2016</xref>), whereby mitochondrial division occurs concomitantly with the development of the mitochondrion-associated isolation membrane, forming an autophagosome that specifically contains mitochondrial components termed the mitophagosome. A recent study identified the mitochondrial intermembrane-space protein mitofissin (also called Atg44p), required for mitochondrial fission during yeast mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fukuda et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Plant autophagic bodies and RCBs are typically around 1 µm in diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chiba et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Yoshimoto et al., 2004</xref>), which is smaller than chloroplasts. Thus, piecemeal-type chloroplast autophagy via RCBs must start with division of the chloroplast segments that are to be degraded. However, how a fragment of a chloroplast can be transported to the vacuole remains poorly understood. Here, to characterize the underlying intracellular dynamics, we performed high-resolution imaging analyses in living cells of Arabidopsis leaves. Via time-lapse microscopy observations, we visualized the segmentation of chloroplast budding structures and their transport to the vacuolar lumen. Use of multiple organelle markers revealed that the development of the chloroplast-associated isolation membrane and the formation of RCBs occur simultaneously. These morphological changes did not correspond to the emergence of stromules or to DRP5b-mediated chloroplast division. Therefore, a previously undescribed chloroplast division machinery may be in play during chloroplast autophagy.</p>

<title>Chloroplast budding structures containing stroma and envelope are released in response to sugar starvation</title>
<p>To observe the intracellular dynamics of the piecemeal-type of chloroplast autophagy, we subjected the mature leaves of Arabidopsis plants to incubation in darkness, as this treatment induces sugar starvation and accelerates leaf senescence, thus activating the RCB-mediated chloroplast autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Izumi et al., 2010</xref>). Exogenous application of concanamycin A (concA), an inhibitor of vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, allows the vacuolar accumulation of autophagic cargoes, including RCBs, facilitating their visualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Yoshimoto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ishida et al., 2008</xref>). Following the excision and incubation in darkness of leaves harboring chloroplast stroma-targeted fluorescent protein markers such as RUBISCO SMALL SUBUNIT (RBCS) fused to monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) in the presence of concA, we observed the accumulation of many small vesicles containing RBCS-mRFP signal in the vacuole, i.e., RCBs (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1–figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). Although co-incubation of dark-treated leaves with concA and mineral nutrient-rich Murashige and Skoog (MS) salts did not block the RCB accumulation, the addition of sucrose did, by rescuing the sugar-starved leaf (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1–figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). We detected no RCBs when we subjected the leaves of a mutant for the core <italic>ATG</italic> gene <italic>ATG7</italic> to dark incubation in sucrose-free solution (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1–figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). These observations indicate that RCBs are a type of autophagic cargo involved in the degradation of chloroplast fragments in response to sugar starvation. Therefore, in this study, we monitored chloroplast morphology in sugar-starved leaves resulting from their incubation in darkness in a sugar-free solution.</p>

<p>We wished to monitor the changes in the three-dimensional (3D) morphology of chloroplasts during autophagic degradation of chloroplast fragments. We thus used a two-photon excitation microscope equipped with a confocal spinning-disk unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Otomo et al., 2015</xref>), which facilitates the monitoring of changes in the 3D cellular structures of living plant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sasaki et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Nakamura et al., 2021b</xref>). Using dark-incubated leaves from transgenic plants harboring chloroplast-targeted <italic>GFP</italic> (<italic>CT-GFP</italic>) or <italic>RBCS-mRFP</italic> transgenes, we determined that mesophyll chloroplasts form a type of budding structure containing stromal components (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>, arrowheads). We observed these structures budding off from their associated chloroplasts within a few minutes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>, Videos 1 and 2). Dual detection of the chloroplast stromal marker RBCS fused to enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (RBCS-EYFP) and of chlorophyll autofluorescence confirmed that the budding vesicle specifically contains stroma material (EYFP positive) without any chlorophyll signal, a marker of thylakoid membrane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, Video 3). These time-lapse observations reveal that chloroplasts form protrusions that are released in sugar-starved leaves.</p>
<p>We then performed a simultaneous detection of three organelle markers by using conventional confocal microscopes to determine if the chloroplast buds contained membrane-bound proteins. Accordingly, we incubated leaves from plants accumulating the chloroplast outer-envelope marker TRANSLOCON AT THE OUTER MEMBRANE OF CHLOROPLASTS 64 (TOC64) fused to mRFP and the stromal marker RBCS-GFP in darkness as described above. Under these conditions, we observed TOC64-mRFP signal surrounding a chloroplast bud (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, arrowheads), indicating that the budding structures contain chloroplast envelope components. We also captured the transport of an RCB with TOC64-mRFP and RBCS-GFP signals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, Video 4). In another set of experiments, we generated transgenic plants accumulating the thylakoid membrane marker ATP synthase gamma subunit (ATPC1) fused to tagRFP and stromal RBCS-GFP. The ATPC1-tagRFP fluorescent signal fully overlapped with that of chlorophyll autofluorescence, with both originating from the thylakoid membrane (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). In the chloroplast budding structures, however, we detected no ATPC1-tagRFP signal, in contrast to the strong stromal RBCS-GFP signal (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, arrowheads). In agreement with this observation, we captured a released RCB that did not contain any ATPC1-tagRFP or chlorophyll signals, but accumulated plentiful RBCS-GFP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, Video 5). These observations support the notion that the chloroplast buds containing stromal and envelope proteins are released as RCBs without thylakoid membranes. These live-cell imaging results are consistent with an immuno-electron-microscopy study of RCBs in wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chiba et al., 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Vacuolar membrane dynamically interacts with chloroplast stromal components to incorporate those into the vacuolar lumen</title>
<p>We tracked the trafficking of RCBs in mesophyll cells further and obtained a two-dimensional (2D) sequential series of images of the release and transport of an RCB in leaves accumulating stromal CT-GFP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, Video 6). This time series included two phases during which the vesicle moved quickly (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, 24.4–34.8 sec and 73.8–90.5 sec). A tracking analysis for the RCB indicated that during the early phase (24.4–34.8 sec), the vesicle moved rather smoothly in one general direction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, Video 6); however, during the later phase (73.8–90.5 sec), the vesicle appeared to move more randomly, akin to Brownian movement (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, Video 6). Previous studies showed that autophagic bodies accumulating into the vacuolar lumen exhibit such random movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ishida et al., 2008</xref>). We conclude that the vesicle was likely released into the vacuolar lumen at around 73.8 sec (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>We postulated that the interaction between the autophagosome and the vacuolar membrane takes place before the incorporation of RCBs into the vacuole. We thus turned our attention to the dynamics of the vacuolar membrane in transgenic plants accumulating the vacuolar membrane marker VACUOLAR H<sup>+</sup>-PYROPHOSPHATASE 1 (VHP1) fused to mGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Segami et al., 2014</xref>) along with the stromal marker RBCS-mRFP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). From one of our time-lapse imaging series, we identified a still frame of an RCB present in the cytoplasm being engulfed by the vacuolar membrane (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, open arrowheads from 25.4–30.5 sec, Video 7). Later in the time series, we observed the opening of the part of the vacuolar membrane that had engulfed the RCB, resulting in the RCB being released into the vacuolar lumen (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, filled arrowheads from 47.0–52.0 sec, Video 7). We captured another instance of the dynamics of the vacuolar membrane in another time series, with the vacuolar membrane first surrounding the RCB (52.6–57.4 sec) before releasing it (65.3–72.9 sec) into the vacuolar lumen (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, Video 8). Our time-lapse imaging approach thus successfully visualized the cytoplasm-to-vacuole transport progression of chloroplast stroma material by autophagy.</p>

<title>Formation and segmentation of chloroplast buds occur simultaneously with autophagosome maturation</title>
<p>Based on the observation of protruded structures budding off from chloroplasts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>–<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), we hypothesized that these structures are formed in response to the imposed sugar starvation to be subsequently recognized and sequestered by the autophagosomal membranes. We thus expected the leaves of autophagy-deficient mutants to accumulate multiple chloroplast protrusions upon exposure to sugar starvation. This hypothesis seemed consistent with the observations of stromule-rich cells in hypocotyls or dark-incubated leaves of autophagy-deficient <italic>atg5</italic> or <italic>atg7</italic> mutants, compared with non-mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ishida et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Spitzer et al., 2015</xref>), assuming that the accumulation of chloroplast protrusions precedes stromule formation in <italic>atg</italic> mutants. To test this hypothesis, we subjected the leaves of <italic>atg5</italic> and <italic>atg7</italic> mutants, each defective in the function of a core ATG protein, to darkness-imposed sugar starvation and treatment with concA for 1 d (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). We detected no RCB in the leaves of either mutant (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>); however, in both the wild type and the mutants, we noticed fewer chloroplast protrusions in dark-incubated leaves treated with concA compared with the respective untreated control leaves, contrary to our hypothesis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>).

<p>We therefore posited that autophagosome formation might be required for the production of chloroplast buds. To test this idea, we observed the behavior of autophagosomes in transgenic plants accumulating the isolation membrane marker AUTOPHAGY8a (ATG8a) fused to GFP (as GFP-ATG8a) along with stromal RBCS-mRFP or chloroplast stroma-targeted (CT)-DsRed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Following incubation of leaves in darkness and confocal microscopy observation, we observed isolation membranes (marked by GFP-ATG8a) that were tightly associated with the chloroplast surface before any protrusion structure was visible (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>, 0 sec). Over time, however, fluorescence monitoring of the same area revealed that the isolation-membrane-associated site from the chloroplast side gradually protruded and eventually formed a vesicle containing RBCS-mRFP or CT-DsRed and surrounded by GFP-ATG8a signal, i.e., an autophagosome (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>, arrowheads; Videos 9 and 10).</p>

<p>Using the time-series data shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref> (Video 10), we evaluated the time-dependent changes of the size of the chloroplast bud and the ratio between the major axis and the minor axis of the GFP-ATG8a-labeled autophagosome (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). This ratio drops to 1 as the isolation membrane becomes a spherical autophagosome. The ratio between the major and minor axes started to decrease at around 40 sec and approached 1 at around 100 sec. The chloroplast protrusion appeared around 50 sec and gradually increased in size until around 120 sec. These data support the notion that the chloroplast protrusion appears as the isolation membrane develops and becomes a segmented RCB when the spherical autophagosome forms. We identified another example in an independent image series (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>, Video 11) where the ratio between the major and minor axes of the isolation membrane started to decrease at approximately 40 sec and the chloroplast protrusion appeared at around 50 sec. In the third set of images, we observed the formation of chloroplast buds and later of RCBs near GFP-ATG8a-associated sites on multiple chloroplasts and sequentially (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure 6–figure supplement 2</xref>, Video 12). Therefore, we conclude that the development of the chloroplast-associated isolation membrane precedes the production of chloroplast buds and of RCBs for piecemeal-type chloroplast autophagy.</p>

<title>Salicylic acid influences stromule formation in autophagy-deficient mutants</title>
<p>Our initial hypothesis was that stromules are related to RCBs: stromule-rich cells appeared because of impaired RCB production in <italic>atg</italic> mutants. However, our imaging assays above revealed that RCBs emerge from mesophyll chloroplasts in the absence of prior stromule formation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>), pointing to the existence of another factor responsible for the elevated stromule formation seen in <italic>atg</italic> mutant leaves. A previous study reported the hyperaccumulation of salicylic acid (SA) in senescing Arabidopsis <italic>atg</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Yoshimoto et al., 2009</xref>). Since SA signaling stimulates immune responses, including stromule formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Caplan et al., 2015</xref>), we speculated that SA might contribute to stromule formation in autophagy-deficient mutants. To investigate this possibility, we generated transgenic plants in the <italic>atg5</italic> mutant background accumulating stromal GFP (CT-GFP) and a construct carrying NahG, encoding a bacterial SA hydroxylase that catabolizes SA (Delaney, 1994; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Yoshimoto et al., 2009</xref>). We examined chloroplasts in guard cells, as this cell type actively forms many more stromules than the mature chloroplasts of mesophyll cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ishida and Yoshimoto, 2008</xref>). Chloroplasts in the guard cells of the <italic>atg5</italic> mutant formed more stromules than wild-type (WT) and NahG-expressing plants (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>). Importantly, the introduction of the NahG construct into the <italic>atg5</italic> mutant background (<italic>atg5</italic> NahG) largely abolished stromule formation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>).

<p>We then examined stromule formation in mesophyll chloroplasts for the same genotypes. In 20-d-old plants, we detected no stromules in any genotype (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 7–figure supplement 1</xref>). In cells from senescent leaves of 36-d-old plants, we observed stromules in 22.5% or 15.3% of chloroplasts from the <italic>atg5</italic> or <italic>atg7</italic> single mutants, respectively, but the introduction of the <italic>sid2</italic> mutation in <italic>sid2 atg5</italic> and <italic>sid2 atg7</italic> led to a decrease in the number of stromules (9.8% or 2.5% in <italic>sid2 atg5</italic> or <italic>sid2 atg7</italic>, respectively; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7F</xref>).

<title>DRP5b is not required for autophagy of chloroplast fragments</title>
<p>Simultaneous progression of autophagosome formation and organelle segmentation has been previously observed during mitophagy in mammals and budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Yamashita et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fukuda et al., 2023</xref>). This autophagy-related mitochondrial division does not require the mammalian Drp1- or yeast Dnm1p-dependent division machinery, respectively. Here, we examined whether the DRP5B-mediated chloroplast division participates in chloroplast autophagy and RCB production.</p>
<p>To this end, we generated <italic>drp5b</italic> mutant lines accumulating the stromal marker RBCS-mRFP or stromal GFP (CT-GFP). Although the mature leaves of <italic>drp5b</italic> had larger chloroplasts than WT leaves, reflective of the impaired chloroplast division during cell expansion typical of this mutant, many RCBs accumulated when the leaves were incubated in darkness in the presence of concA (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8B</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 8–figure supplement 1</xref>). We detected no RCB in the leaves of the <italic>drp5b atg5</italic> double mutant (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8–figure supplement 1</xref>). These results indicate that RCB-mediated chloroplast autophagy is active in the <italic>drp5b</italic> mutant. To obtain an independent confirmation of this result, we performed a immunoblot assay of autophagy flux, based on the detection of free mRFP derived from the vacuolar cleavage of RBCS-mRFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Ono et al., 2013</xref>). When we incubated the leaves of plants accumulating RBCS-mRFP in darkness without concA, free mRFP levels increased in leaves of WT but not <italic>atg5</italic> or <italic>atg7</italic> plants (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8D</xref>), indicating the occurrence of autophagy-dependent degradation of stromal proteins in response to sugar starvation in WT plants. The accumulation of free mRFP in the <italic>drp5b</italic> mutant was at least as high as that seen in WT plants (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>). The ratio of free mRFP to RBCS-mRFP increased in WT and <italic>drp5b</italic> plants after dark treatment (6.1 or 4.1 times higher in WT or <italic>drp5b</italic>, respectively), consistent with autophagy-mediated degradation of chloroplast fragments (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>). Confocal microscopy observations of mesophyll cells also showed the spread of mRFP signal in the vacuolar lumen in dark-treated leaves of WT and <italic>drp5b</italic> plants (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure 8–figure supplement 2</xref>). These results indicate that the autophagic degradation of chloroplast stroma is active in both genotypes. The accumulation of free mRFP was 3.2 times higher in untreated leaves of <italic>drp5b</italic> compared with untreated WT leaves (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>); therefore, the activity of chloroplast autophagy might be constitutively higher in leaves of <italic>drp5b</italic> than in those of WT plants.</p>

<title>An unidentified machinery in piecemeal-type chloroplast autophagy</title>
<p>We previously demonstrated that chloroplast components in mesophyll cells are transported to the vacuole as a type of autophagic cargo termed RCBs to facilitate amino acid recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ishida et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hirota et al., 2018</xref>). However, how a portion of chloroplasts is mobilized into the vacuolar lumen remained uncertain. In this study, high-resolution time-lapse imaging techniques allowed us to visualize the trafficking progression of chloroplast fragments from their parental chloroplasts to the vacuolar lumen. Importantly, we established that the development of the chloroplast-associated isolation membrane and the division of the chloroplast fragment occur simultaneously. This autophagy-related chloroplast division does not rely on DRP5B-mediated chloroplast division. Likewise, the formation of chloroplast buds is unlikely to be linked to the formation of stromules. Therefore, an unknown division machinery may be required for the autophagy-related division of chloroplast fragments. A similar organelle division mechanism takes place during mitophagy in mammals and budding yeast. The site of a mitochondrion that is associated with the isolation membrane protrudes and divides as the isolation membrane develops and becomes an enclosed autophagosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Yamashita et al., 2016</xref>). This type of mitochondrial division is independent of Drp1 and Dnm1p. In yeast, the mitochondrial intermembrane-space protein mitofissin/Atg44 divides the mitochondrial fragment in coordination with autophagosome maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fukuda et al., 2023</xref>). A functionally equivalent protein has not been identified in mammals.</p>
<p>Numerous studies have explored the molecular mechanisms of chloroplast division during the development of juvenile leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). For instance, in Arabidopsis plants, ARC6 and PARALOG OF ARC6 (PARC6) mediate the tethering of the FTSZ ring on the chloroplast inner envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Vitha et al., 2003</xref>). PLASTID DIVISION 1 (PDV1) and PDV2 recruit DRP5B to the division site on the chloroplast outer envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Miyagishima et al., 2006</xref>). The ARC6–PDV2 and PARC6–PDV1 complexes may control the coordination of the stromal FTSZ ring and the cytosolic DRP5B ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, the controlled division of plastids requires the cooperation of multiple protein complexes across the inner and outer envelopes. Nevertheless, whether chloroplasts divide during their piecemeal degradation has not been evaluated. It seems likely that autophagy-related division of chloroplast fragments needs to be carefully regulated, as the size of the segment has to fit into the autophagosome. Since the volume occupied by chloroplasts per cell is tightly regulated during cell expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Pyke and Leech, 1994</xref>), the decline of chloroplast volume during starvation or senescence might also be highly controlled. Further studies are needed to elucidate the molecular machinery underlying the autophagy-related division of chloroplast fragments for degradation.</p>
<p>Organelle-selective autophagy is typically controlled by receptor proteins that recognize the target organelles and act as a bridge between the organelles and isolation-membrane-anchored ATG8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Farre and Subramani, 2016</xref>). The observation of a chloroplast-associated isolation membrane suggests that the receptors for chloroplast autophagy connect the isolation membrane to the chloroplast envelope. Such interaction might facilitate the development of the isolation membrane along the chloroplast surface. In budding yeast, the accumulation of the mitophagy receptor Atg32 is required for the formation of the mitophagosome. Atg32 binds to the mitochondrial outer membrane and interacts with Atg8 and Atg11, the latter being a scaffold protein recruiting other ATG members, for autophagosome formation. In fission yeast (<italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>), Atg43 located on the mitochondrion outer membrane binds to Atg8 to stabilize the autophagosomal membrane for mitophagosome formation during starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fukuda et al., 2020</xref>). In mammalian mitophagy, five types of mitophagy receptors have been identified that bind to LC3 (light chain 3) proteins, the mammalian orthologs of ATG8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Onishi et al., 2021</xref>). Whether similar receptors work for chloroplast autophagy in mature leaves has not been established. Atg39 is the receptor for nucleophagy in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mochida et al., 2015</xref>), during which the condensation of Atg39 enables the protrusion of the nuclear membrane to be sequestered by the autophagosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mochida et al., 2022</xref>). The accumulation of receptor proteins might contribute to the morphological changes required for chloroplasts to form RCBs.</p>

<title>Roles of stromules</title>
<p>The molecular functions of stromules are not completely understood. We first predicted a functional link between stromules and RCBs such that stromules are vesiculated and become RCBs for autophagic degradation. However, our imaging assays revealed that chloroplast stromule formation is not essential for RCB formation in mesophyll cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). The use of the <italic>sid2</italic> mutant and NahG transgenic lines indicated the close association between enhanced SA signaling and the elevated stromule formation observed in <italic>atg</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). This finding is consistent with the suggested role of stromules in inducing programmed cell death as an SA-dependent immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Caplan et al., 2015</xref>). We assign the enhanced stromule formation in <italic>atg</italic> mutant leaves as a consequence of their higher SA and ROS levels, alone or in combination with the excess stromal fraction accumulating in these mutants due to impaired RCB formation.</p>
<p>In root cells, an association of the isolation membrane with stromules of non-green plastids was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Spitzer et al., 2015</xref>). Stromule formation is more common in the non-green plastids of tissues without photosynthetic activity than in the mature chloroplasts in leaf mesophyll cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hanson and Sattarzadeh, 2008</xref>). Therefore, the interaction between stromules and the isolation membrane might be important for the efficient degradation of non-green plastids by autophagy. Our study focused on the degradation mechanism of mature chloroplasts in leaves, since mature chloroplasts are rich in nutrients and amino acids and their degradation is particularly important for plant nutrient recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Makino and Osmond, 1991</xref>). There might also be differences in the degradation mechanism of plastids among cell types.</p>

<title>Intracellular dynamics for the transport of RCBs</title>
<p>Soluble <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) mediate versatile membrane fusion events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ito and Uemura, 2022</xref>). Multiple SNARE proteins participate in the fusion of the lysosomal/vacuolar membrane to the autophagosomal membrane in mammals and budding yeast. A recent study reported the involvement of the Arabidopsis SNARE proteins, VESICLE-ASSOCIATED MEMBRANE PROTEIN 724 (VAMP724) and VAMP726, in autophagosome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">He et al., 2022</xref>). In this study, we observed an interesting morphology of vacuolar membranes that incorporate RCBs into the vacuole (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). A similar phenomenon was previously observed during the transport of pexophagosomes (autophagosomes containing peroxisome components) in Arabidopsis leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Oikawa et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, the transient engulfment of an autophagosome by the vacuolar membrane might be a common phenomenon for vacuolar incorporation in leaf mesophyll cells. In mammals, two autophagosomal membrane-anchored SNAREs, Syntaxin 17 (Stx17) and Ykt6, independently contribute to the autophagosome-lysosome fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Itakura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Matsui et al., 2018</xref>). Stx17 translocates to the closed autophagosome transiently, enabling its fusion with the lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Tsuboyama et al., 2016</xref>). Such a translocation system might allow the recruitment of the vacuolar membrane for its fusion with the mature autophagosomes in plant cells.</p>
<p>The current study revealed how a type of piecemeal autophagy transports chloroplast stroma and envelope components into the vacuole for degradation in mature Arabidopsis leaves. The key event is the development of the isolation membrane along the chloroplast surface, which might lead to the protrusion and segmentation of the membrane-contact site of a chloroplast. Proteins mediating chloroplast segmentation and the interaction between the chloroplast surface and the isolation membrane remain to be uncovered. This study developed a live-cell tracking method for piecemeal-type chloroplast autophagy, which will help future studies elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the intracellular dynamics of this type of autophagy.</p>

<title>Live-cell imaging by confocal microscopy</title>
<p>The second rosette leaves of 20- to 24-d-old plants were used for time-lapse imaging of living cells. The leaves were excised, infiltrated with sugar-free solutions, and incubated in darkness for 5 to 24 h, followed by confocal microscopy observations. When the dark treatment was started at the end of the night, the incubation time was around 5–9 h. When the treatment was started during the light period, the incubation time was around 20–24 h. The sugar-free solutions contained 10 mM MES-NaOH, pH 5.5, alone or with full-strength Murashige and Skoog salts (Shiotani M. S.) or the photosynthesis inhibitor 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU).</p>
<p>Time-lapse imaging in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> was performed as previously described with a two-photon excitation confocal microscope with a spinning-disk unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Otomo et al. 2015</xref>). The GFP signal was excited by 920-nm femtosecond light pulses generated by a mode-locked titanium-sapphire laser light source (Mai Tai eHP DeepSee; Spectra Physics). The YFP, RFP, and chlorophyll signals were excited by 1040-nm femtosecond light pulses generated by an ytterbium laser light source (femtoTrain; Spectra Physics). The fluorescent signals were observed under an inverted microscope (IX-71; Olympus) equipped with a spinning-disk scanner with 100-μm-wide pinholes aligned with a Nipkow disk (CSU-MPϕ100; Yokogawa Electric) and a water-immersion lens (UPLSAPO60XW, numerical aperture [NA] = 1.20, Olympus).

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors demonstrated that carbon depletion triggers the autophagy-dependent formation of Rubisco Containing Bodies, which contain chloroplast stroma material, but exclude thylakoids. The authors show that RCBs bud directly from the main body of chloroplasts rather than from stromules and that their formation is not dependent on the chloroplast fission factor DRP5. The authors also observed a transient engulfment of the RBCs by the tonoplast during delivery to the vacuolar lumen.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors demonstrate that autophagy-related protein 8 (ATG8) co-localizes to the chloroplast demarking the place for RCB budding. The authors provide good-quality time-lapse images and co-localization of the markers corroborating previous observations that RCBs contain only stroma material and do not include thylakoid. The text is very well written and easy to follow.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
A significant portion of the results presented in the study comes across as a corroboration of the previous findings made under different stress conditions: autophagy-dependent formation of RCBs was reported by Ishida et all in 2009. Furthermore, some included results are not of particular relevance to the study's aim. For example, it is unclear what is the importance of the role of SA in the formation of stromules, which do not serve as an origin for the RCBs. Similarly, the significance of the transient engulfment of RCBs by the tonoplast remained elusive. Although it is indeed a curious observation, previously reported for peroxisomes, its presentation should include an adequate discussion maybe suggesting the involved mechanism. Finally, some conclusions are not fully supported by the data: the suggested timing of events poorly aligns between and even within experiments mostly due to high variation and low number of replicates. Most importantly, the discussion does not place the findings of this study into the context of current knowledge on chlorophagy and does not propose the significance of the piece-meal vs complete organelle sequestration into the vacuole under used conditions, and does not dwell on the early localization of ATG8 to the future budding place on the chloroplast.</p>

<p>This manuscript proposed a new link between the formation of chloroplast budding vesicles (Rubisco-containing bodies [RCBs]) and the development of chloroplast-associated autophagosomes. The authors' previous work demonstrated two types of autophagy pathways involved in chloroplast degradation, including piecemeal degradation of partial chloroplast and whole chloroplast degradation. However, the mechanisms underlying piecemeal degradation are largely unknown, particularly regarding the initiation and release of the budding structures. Here, the authors investigated the progression of piecemeal-type chloroplast trafficking by visualizing it with a high-resolution time-lapse microscope. They provide evidence that autophagosome formation is required for the initiation of chloroplast budding, and that stromule formation is not correlated with this process. In addition, the authors also demonstrated that the release of chloroplast-associated autophagosome is independent of a chloroplast division factor, DRP5b.</p>
<p>Overall, the findings are interesting, and in general, the experiments are very well executed. Although the mechanism of how Rubisco-containing bodies are processed is still unclear, this study suggests that a novel chloroplast division machinery exists to facilitate chloroplast autophagy, which will be valuable to investigate in the future.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Regulated chloroplast breakdown allows plants to modulate these energy-producing organelles, for example during leaf aging, or during changing light conditions. This manuscript investigates how chloroplasts are broken down during light-limiting conditions.</p>
<p>The authors present very nice time-lapse imaging of multiple proteins as buds form on the surface of chloroplasts and pinch away, then associate with the vacuole. They use mutant analysis and autophagy markers to demonstrate that this process requires the ATG machinery, but not dynamin-related proteins that are required for chloroplast division. The manuscript concludes with a discussion of an internally-consistent model that summarizes the results.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The main strength of the manuscript is the high-quality microscopy data. The authors use multiple markers and high-resolution time-lapse imaging to track chloroplast dynamics under light-limiting conditions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The main weakness of the manuscript is the lack of quantitative data. Quantification of multiple events is required to support the authors' claims, for example, claims about which parts of the plastid bud, about the dynamics of the events, about the colocalization between ATG8 and the plastid stroma buds, and the dynamics of this association. Without understanding how often these events occur and how frequently events follow the manner observed by the authors (in the 1 or 2 examples presented in each figure) it is difficult to appreciate the significance of these findings.</p>
