<title>Abstract</title><p>Neurons use cell-adhesion molecules (CAMs) to interact with other neurons and the extracellular environment: the combination of CAMs specifies migration patterns, neuronal morphologies, and synaptic connections across diverse neuron types. Yet little is known regarding the intracellular signaling cascade mediating the CAM recognitions at the cell surface across different neuron types. In this study, we investigated the neural developmental role of Afadin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, a cytosolic adapter protein that connects multiple CAM families to intracellular F-actin. We introduced the conditional Afadin mutant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> to an embryonic retinal Cre, Six3-Cre<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. We reported that the mutants lead to the scrambled retinal neuron distribution, including Bipolar Cells (BCs), Amacrine Cells (ACs), and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), across three cellular layers of the retina. This scrambled pattern was first reported here at neuron-type resolution. Importantly, the mutants do not display deficits for BCs, ACs, or RGCs in terms of neural fate specifications or survival. Additionally, the displayed RGC types still maintain synaptic partners with putative AC types, indicating that other molecular determinants instruct synaptic choices independent of Afadin. Lastly, there is a significant decline in visual function and mis-targeting of RGC axons to incorrect zones of the superior colliculus, one of the major retinorecipient areas. Collectively, our study uncovers a unique cellular role of Afadin in sorting retinal neuron types into proper cellular layers as the structural basis for orderly visual processing.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The central nervous system (CNS) consists of complex circuits that are established during development and fine-tuned through both activity-dependent and apoptotic mechanisms. However, how neurons form these complex circuits—and, more specifically, how cell surface molecules promote correct neuronal migration and synapse formation—is not fully resolved. Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) have been shown to be key mediators of CNS lamination and synaptogenesis. Work from ours and others focused on using the inner retina of the mouse as a developmental system to understand mechanisms regulating these developmental questions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Specifically, our past studies showed that Type II Cadherin (Cdhs), in combination, play key roles in establishing appropriate synapses between retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and bipolar cells (BCs), as well as RGCs with amacrine cells (ACs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Among the molecular machinery that composes the adherens junction (AJ) complex, β-catenin has been shown to be important in neuronal laminar organization, leading to embryonic deficits and major retinal neuron loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>While we assume that all intracellular components of cell-surface adhesion complexes are critical for retinal neuron survival and patterning, not all components of the AJ complex equally regulate the same aspects of these developmental programs. Afadin is a cytosolic adaptor protein that links Nectin, a Ca<sup>2+</sup> independent immunoglobulin-like CAM, to F-actin microfilaments in the cytoskeleton<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Afadin recruits cadherins to AJs mediated by Nectin, p120-catenin, and α-catenin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. While Afadin has multiple direct interactions with AJ proteins, it is not a core part of the cadherin–catenin complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Past genetic studies in the mouse CNS showed that loss of Afadin in both the hippocampal and cortical regions of the mouse brain leads to a decrease in dendritic spine density and number of synapses, with variable effects on dendritic arborization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Additionally, Afadin plays an important role in cortical lamination: deletion of Afadin in the mouse telencephalon leads to cellular mislocalization and a resultant double-cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Notably, the <italic>drosophila</italic> homologue of Afadin is called <italic>Canoe</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, where the mutant phenotypes in the ommatidial eye were likely closely tied to the disruption of cellular junctions or synaptic complex, though given the broad role of Afadin (Canoe), they may also be due to other cell-surface signaling pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The mouse neural retina offers a laminarly organized structure and well-characterized cellular composition across three cellular layers. During development, retinal progenitor cells span the retinal neuroepithelium via basal and apical processes, proliferate via asymmetric and symmetric divisions at the ventricular surface, and differentiate into six neuronal types via both transcriptional regulatory networks and environmental cues—these include rod and cone photoreceptors (PR), horizontal cells (HC), bipolar cells (BC), amacrine cells (AC), retinal ganglion cells (RGC), and one glial cell type, Müller glia (MGs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Thus, the distinct locations and temporal order offer a clear system to examine the roles of multifaceted molecules in every step of development, such as that for Afadin. By restricting the roles of Afadin into restricted RGC subsets or AC subsets, our recent study linked Afadin to the combinatorial Cdh complex that enables the selective RGC-AC synaptic choice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Yet it is unknown what role Afadin plays in neuronal migration, neuronal layer sorting, and brain target selection. Here, we utilized a developmental neural retina-specific Cre driver (Six3<sup>Cre</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> to generate a conditional Afadin mutant (Six3<sup>Cre</sup>; Afadin<sup>F/F</sup>). This conditional mutant allows us to characterize the role of Afadin in early development. Here, we report that the Afadin mutant significantly alters retinal neuronal migration and neuronal layer sorting, though it has little effect on cellular differentiation within the inner retina.</p>

<title>Early Afadin conditional mutant scramble retinal neuron layer organization</title>
<p>We utilized a murine conditional knockout model in which Exon 2 of Afadin was flanked by the LoxP sites (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1U</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Cre-mediated recombination results in the excision of exon 2, resulting in a frameshift mutation and a premature stop codon. These conditional alleles were crossed with Six3<sup>Cre</sup> transgenic mice to mediate gene deletion, particularly within the developing retinal neuroepithelium starting at E9 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Upon conditional knockout, Afadin mutants (hereafter referred to as Afadin-cKO<sup>Ret</sup>) displayed aberrant lamination patterning at four different postnatal time points examined: P2, P7, P14, and P60 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E-H</xref>). At P2, control retinas (Afadin<sup>F/F</sup>) exist as a singularly laminated piece of tissue resulting from the proliferation and early differentiation of early-born retinal neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, Afadin-cKO<sup>Ret</sup>, the central retina is disrupted and contains rosette-like structures with regions devoid of cells at P2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). At P7, the inner and outer plexiform layers are evident in control mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) but notably disrupted in Afadin-cKO<sup>Ret</sup>, with the OPL omitted and instead existing instead as a singular fused nuclear layer (fused INL/ONL) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). P7 and older mutants also show columns of neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>, arrow; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>) spanning the inner plexiform layer (IPL) and rosettes in the fused INL/ONL (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>, asterisks). By P14, most, if not all, retinal neuron types and Muller glial cells have been established<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. To determine whether loss of Afadin affects retinal neuron densities or cell fate differentiation in addition to cellular layer organization, we examined mouse retinas and quantified neuronal subtypes in controls and mutants at P14 using well-established molecular markers: RBPMS to label RGCs, Chx10 to label BCs, and AP2α to label ACs. We found that the densities of the three major inner retinal neuronal types did not differ significantly between controls and mutants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1T</xref>), indicating retinal neurons in Afadin- cKO<sup>Ret</sup> differentiate and proliferate via expected proportions, and Afadin is likely not involved in fate determination or cell survival regulations. When we used P14 mice to quantify the mis-localization of retinal types across three cellular layers, RGCs, ACs, and BCs were significantly scrambled across three cellular layers, compared to control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1S</xref>). Collectively, these results revealed the roles of Afadin in sorting inner retinal neurons into proper layers, likely integrating the positioning cues from the environment when specifying the layers.</p>

<title>Mis-localized neurons in Afadin-cKO<sup>Ret</sup> form an ectopic inner plexiform layer</title>
<p>In addition to scrambled neuronal locations in the wrong cellular layers, we also observed unusual outer layer “rosette” structures and IPL bridging columns in Afadin-cKO<sup>Ret</sup> that were evident as early as P2. To better characterize these substructures in our model, we utilized wholemount retina sections to obtain an <italic>en-face</italic> view of the IPL and fused INL/ONL (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2E-H</xref>). Interestingly, these rosettes retained some degree of canonical neuronal patterning (Figure S1A-F). They comprised radially arranged rod BCs projecting inwards towards ACs and RGCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I-J</xref>). The subtype identities of RGCs within the clusters were diverse, including Osteopontin (Spp1)<sup>+</sup> αRGCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, Melanopsin (Opn4)<sup>+</sup> intrinsically-photosensitive RGCs (ipRGCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, and Cartpt<sup>+</sup> ON-OFF direction-selective ganglion cells (ooDSGCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. In addition, dendrites of Carpt<sup>+</sup> ooDSGCs are projected centrally. They colocalized with starburst amacrine cell (SAC) dendrites (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2J</xref>, 2K, and S1D), reminiscent of traditional synaptic pairings at the IPL among these cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. We next quantified the number of “rosettes,” which numbered approximately 160 ± 13 (Figures S2A and S2B) across four Afadin-cKO<sup>Ret</sup> retinas in adults. This suggested that rosette formation was likely not a random occurrence but was likely a result of compensatory mechanisms of retinal lamination independent of Afadin and its CAM partners.</p>

<p>Prior work exploring the role of Afadin and N-cadherin in the mouse dorsal telencephalon revealed that loss of either led to severe defects in axonal pathfinding, in addition to neuronal mislocalization and increased progenitor cell proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. We asked whether loss of Afadin in the retina would affect RGC projections to the superior colliculus (SC), one of the primary retinorecipient areas in the mouse receiving input from more than 85% of RGCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. To delineate the contributions from the right and left eyes, we administered intravitreal injections with CTB-488 and CTB-555 to label projection neurons, i.e., RGCs from the eyes: these dyes are subsequently transported via RGC axons to the SC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>

<p>Interestingly, though RGCs did project to the SC, ipsilateral/contralateral segregation was disrupted. While most (&gt;97%*) projecting axons should cross at the midline in mice and project contralaterally, we noted an unusually high number of aberrant ipsilateral projections in Afadin-cKO<sup>Ret</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Using an AAV(Retro)-mediated axonal projection- based retrograde labeling for RGC labeling, we delivered AAV-Retro TdTomato into the brain targets. We observed retrogradely labeled RGC distributions inside the retina (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). To our surprise, the retrograde labeling also labeled RGCs displaced into the fused INL/ONL (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3C-E</xref>). Approximately 42.2±8.8% of the TdTomato labeled RGCs were mis-localized in Afadin-cKO<sup>Ret</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3F</xref>), while only a few RGCs are displaced into the INL in the control conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest that Afadin loss leads to axonal pathfinding deficits; on the other hand, the scrambled RGCs still grow their axons onto the central targets, including the SC.</p>

<title>Photoreceptor loss in Afadin-cKO<sup>Ret</sup> disrupts visual function</title>
<p>Associated with Afadin mutants in the inner retina, we inquired about the functional changes associated with such drastic anatomical changes. We observed a progressive photoreceptor loss within the same mutants. Thus, the mutants in their current form prevented us from further inquiring about functional changes associated with the inner retina physiological functions and instead, encouraged examination of how Afadin loss affected photoreceptor lamination and survival. In adult mice at P60 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A-B</xref>), we observed a close-to- complete loss of central photoreceptors; there was noted peripheral sparing, as Six3-Cre drives primarily central retinal neuroepithelium during development. Using Recoverin, which primarily labels rods and a small subset of BCs, we observed a significant loss of Recoverin<sup>+</sup> rods in Afadin-cKO<sup>Ret</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4C-J</xref>). The mechanisms leading to the loss of photoreceptors are currently unknown; however, the loss is likely due to the postnatal disruption of the organization and connectivity. Yet, the same mutants caused no major losses of BCs, ACs, and RGCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1T</xref>). Using the same set of mutants at P60, we sought to obtain a comprehensive measurement of visual function in Afadin-cKO<sup>Ret</sup> mice. Given the degree of disorganization and photoceptor loss, we noted significantly reduced scotopic and photopic ERG responses (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4M</xref>), with flattened a and b waves in scotopic conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4K</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4L</xref>). Altogether, these results indicate that loss of Afadin affects photoreceptor stability, leading to significant visual deficits.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Herein, we demonstrate that developmental loss of Afadin significantly affects normal retinal development. We observed profound disorganization of retinal neuronal layers, including RGCs, ACs, and BCs. Interestingly, we also noted the appearance of rosette-like structures containing SACs and radially directed RGC dendrites, suggesting some retention of cellular organization and perhaps indicative of other compensatory mechanisms that regulate synaptogenesis. This disorganization also affects RGC axonal projections onto the superior colliculus. The roles of Afadin in CNS development were examined in other regions of the CNS: In the hippocampus, Afadin loss leads to mislocalization of CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells; additionally, the spine density of CA1 pyramidal cells neurons is reduced, with the authors postulating that that may be a consequence of reduced cadherin puncta density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Similarly, loss of Afadin in the dorsal telencephalon leads to both the dispersion of neural progenitor cells and an increase in their total numbers. Neuronal differentiation was not significantly affected, but cells were localized to inappropriate cortical layers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Interestingly, while we also noted retinal neuron mislocalization into the wrong layers, we did not observe major differences in cell numbers among the retinal subtypes we profiled. This may speak to the varied roles of Afadin or their constituent adherent complexes in different parts of the brain and spinal cord.</p>
<p>It is being increasingly appreciated that cell adhesion complexes play a role in mediating neuronal migration, cellular layer sorting, and synaptogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Our work utilized the developing retina to elucidate some of the partners that mediate these interactions.</p>
<p>However, our current study raises several questions that remain to be explored: What other mechanisms drive synaptogenesis within the retina; additionally, what is the role of cell adhesion complexes in regulating axonal pathfinding? The rosette-like structures that retain elements of normal synaptic pairings suggest that synaptogenesis may be a layered process, largely driven by cell adhesion complexes but possibly fine-tuned by other extracellular or intracellular mechanisms, irrespective of activity. Indeed, considerable work has shown that gap junctions and the electrical synapses they facilitate are precursors to the eventual formation of chemical synapses between neuronal pairs. Moreover, through what mechanisms does the loss of Afadin disrupt RGC projections and pathfinding? In the spinal neuroepithelium, deletion of Afadin leads to miswiring of motor circuits, such that certain, typically ipsilaterally projecting neurons instead project bilaterally in the Afadin knockout, leading to loss of left-right limb<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> They propose that this is due to a duplication of the central canal that alters midline signaling within the spinal cord. Whether similar structural abnormalities exist in the superior colliculus and to what extent midline signaling is compromised remains to be examined.</p>

<p>Six AfadinF/F and six AfadincKO<sup>ret</sup> mice were dark-adapted overnight, and ERG data was collected in dim red light. Mice were first anesthetized with a combination of ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine (70/10/2 mg/kg), and proparacaine eye drops were administered as local anesthesia. Pupils were then dilated with 1% Tropicamide. The mouse was placed on a heating pad (39 °C) under a dim red light provided by the overhead lamp of the Diagnosys Celeris ERG apparatus (Diagnosys LLC). The light-guide electrodes were placed onto the corneas. For scotopic conditions, we used a white stimulus with 30 cd·s/m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> luminance intensity.

<title>Wholemount Sectioning</title>
<p>Retina section histology was described in (N. Tsai, M.R.L., X. D, manuscript in preparation). Eyes were collected and fixed in 4%PFA on ice for 30 minutes, dissected to remove the cornea and lens, and then placed back into fresh 4%PFA on ice for another 30 minutes. The sclera was peeled off from each retina, and four radial cuts were made. Retinas were then placed in 30% sucrose/PBS and kept at 4°C until the retinas equilibrated/sank. Retinas were mounted onto a 0.45μm membrane filter (MF-Millipore, HABG01300) and stretched until flat. The retina and filter paper then underwent two cycles of drying and rewetting and 30% sucrose/PBS before drying for 5 minutes. The membrane filter was then trimmed to match the retina size. The retina and filter paper were then adhered onto a stage made through mounting a block of tissue freezing medium (EMS, 72592) by mounting a block of tissue freezing medium (EMS, 72592), which was formed earlier within an embedding mold (Polysciences) onto a cryostat chuck and sectioning to form a flat stage. The retina was then quickly embedded with a thin layer of tissue-freezing medium. The chuck was placed back onto a block of dry ice to solidify the tissue freezing tissue-freezing medium. The embedded retina block with chuck was then incubated at -80 °C overnight. Following equilibration within the cryostat, the retina was cut flat by maintaining the orientation of the chuck with the cryostat blade while preparing the block and subsequent sectioning. Sections of 12um thickness were collected onto superfrost plus slides (Fisherbrand, 12-550-1).</p>

Notably, the mislocalization was very robust and apparent to multiple co-authors. 5 images were analyzed for each mouse (3 mice for control and 3 mice for KO).

<p>This study demonstrates the critical role of Afadin on the generation and maintenance of complex cellular layers in the mouse retina. The data are <bold>solid</bold>, which provides <bold>important</bold> insights into how cell-adhesion molecules contribute to retinal organization. However, further investigations are needed to clarify the mechanisms underlying the cellular disorganization phenotype in the retina and axonal projection to the brain.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors examined the role of Afadin, a key adaptor protein associated with cell-adhesion molecules, in retinal development. Using a conditional knockout mouse line (Six3-Cre; AfadinF/F), the authors successfully characterized a disorganized pattern of various neuron types in the mutant retinae. Despite these altered distributions, the retinal neurons maintained normal cell numbers and seemingly preserved some synaptic connections. Notably, tracing results indicated mistargeting of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon projections to the superior colliculus, and electroretinography (ERG) analyses suggested deficits in visual functions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This compelling study provides solid evidence addressing the important question of how cell-adhesion molecules influence neuronal development. Compared to previous research conducted in other parts of the central nervous system (CNS), the clearly defined lamination of cell types in the retina serves as a unique model for studying the aberrant neuronal localizations caused by Afadin knockout. The data suggest that cell-cell interactions are critical for retinal cellular organization and proper axon pathfinding, while aspects of cell fate determination and synaptogenesis remain less understood. This work has broad implications not only for retinal studies but also for developmental biology and regenerative medicine.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the phenotypes observed in the Afadin knockout (cKO) mice are intriguing, I would expect to see evidence confirming that Afadin is indeed knocked out in the retina through immunostaining. Specifically, is Afadin knocked out only in certain retinal regions and not others, as suggested by Figures 4A-B? Are Afadin levels different among distinct neuron types, which could mean that its knockout may have a more pronounced impact on certain cell types, such as rods compared to others?</p>
<p>The authors suggest that synapses may form between canonical synaptic partners, based on the proximity of their processes (Figure 2). However, more solid evidence is needed to verify these synapses through the use of synaptic marker staining or transsynaptic labeling before drawing further conclusions.</p>
<p>Although the Afadin cKO mice displayed dramatic phenotypes, additional experiments are necessary to clarify the details of this process. By manipulating Afadin levels in specific cell types or at different developmental time points, we could gain a better understanding of how Afadin regulates accurate retinal lamination and axonal projection.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study by Lum and colleagues reports on the role of Afadin, a cytosolic adapter protein that organizes multiple cell adhesion molecule families, in the generation and maintenance of complex cellular layers in the mouse retina. They used a conditional deletion approach, removing Afadin in retinal progenitors, and allowing them to analyze broad effects on retinal neuron development.</p>
<p>The study presents high-quality and extensive characterization of the cellular phenotypes, supporting the main conclusions of the paper. They show that Afadin loss results in significant disorganization of the retinal cellular layers and the neuropil, producing rosettes and displacement of cells away from their resident layers. The major classes of neurons in the inner retina are affected, and some neurons are, remarkably, displaced to the other side of the inner plexiform layer. Nevertheless, they mostly target their synaptic partners, including the RGCs to distant retinorecipient targets in the brain. The main conclusions are as follows. Afadin is necessary for establishing and maintaining the retinal architecture. It is not necessary for the generation of the correct numbers/densities of retinal neuron subtypes. Moreover, Afadin loss preserves associations between known synaptic partners and preserves axonal targeting to retinorecipient layers. The consequences on photoreceptor viability and visual processing are also interesting, underscoring the essential function for maintaining retinal structure and function. Overall the main conclusions describing the consequences are supported by the results.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study provides new knowledge on the requirement of Afadin in retinal development. The introduction and discussion effectively set up the rationale for this work, and place it in the context of previous studies of Afadin in other regions of the CNS.</p>
<p>The study presents high-quality and extensive characterizations of the cellular phenotypes resulting from Afadin loss. By analyzing various aspects of retinal organization - from cellular densities to axon targeting to brain - the study narrows down the role of a structure for promoting the establishment of the layers, or maintenance. The data are straightforward and convincing, and the interpretations are bounded by the data shown (though minor weakness re. survival). Another important finding is that the targeting of retinal neuron processes to synaptic partners, including retinorecipient targets in the brain, are intact.</p>
<p>The study is important as it establishes a focused requirement for Afadin to set up and preserve the overall cellular organizations within the retinal tissue. The demonstration that Afadin is needed for photoreceptor viability and overall visual function enhances impact by establishing its functional importance.</p>
<p>The manuscript is well well-written and presented. The images are attractive and compelling, and the figures are well organized.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Expanding on the developmental mechanism is beyond the scope of the study, and would not add to the main conclusions. However, the manuscript would be improved by providing more clarity on the developmental emergence of the defects. The study left me questioning whether the rosettes and cell displacements occur during earlier stages of retina development, or are progressive. For instance, do the RGCs migrate and establish within the GCL correctly at first, and then are displaced with the progressive disorganization? Or are they disorganized and delaminate en route? Images of RGC staining at P0, or earlier during their migration, would be informative. Data in Figure 1 is limited to DAPI staining at P7. Figure 4 shows an image of rod photoreceptors at P7, with their displacement in the GCL layer (and not contained within a rosette). Are the progenitors mislocalized due to delamination?</p>
<p>A few additional thoughts on how these defects compare to other mutants with rosettes might give us more context for understanding the results.</p>
<p>(2) The manuscript reports that the densities of major inner retinal classes are unaffected. There are a few details missing for this point. How were the cell densities quantified (in terms of ROI size), and normalized? This information is lacking in the methods. There is a striking thickening of the GCL in the DAPI-labeled images shown in Figure 1. What are these cells?</p>

<p>Thank you for the summary and highlights of our study. We appreciate the input from Reviewer 1 and the Editor on this study, with focus on laminar choices, synaptic choices and axonal projections.</p>

<p>Regarding the antibody confirming the Knockout, we tested the commercially available antibody from Sigma but weren’t able to confirm its specificity. There was a homemade antibody from another Japan-based laboratory, but it was not available to share at the moment when the study was conducted. Nonetheless, the original allele was derived for hippocampal and cortical studies by Louis Reichardt’s Lab (UCSF), with verified efficacies of the KO allele.</p>
<p>Regarding phenotypical penetrance, this may likely come from the mosaicism of the clone and the symmetric cell division, leading to a rosette-like structure. At this moment, we reason that Afadin KO does NOT lead to direct neuronal loss, and the selective rod loss may derive from other issues, but we lack direct evidence to validate this point.</p>
<p>In regards to the specific neuronal types and synaptic pairs, we acknowledge the limitations of the current Figure 2 in linking the mutant phenotypes to circuit changes. However, the current genetic reagents (Six3Cre) are not compatible with neuron-type specific labeling of synaptic labeling – i.e., cell type-specific Cre and additional Cre-dependent AAV tools might be desired. To do so, we will need to initiate cell-type-specific breeding of transgenic markers such as Hb9GFP for ooDSGCs, or Chat-Cre, VGlut3-Cre for starburst amacrine cells, vG3 amacrine cells, followed by retinal physiology. These experiments take multi-allelic genetic crosses for a very low breeding yield (1/16 or 1/32 Mendelian ratio). These extensive genetic tests are beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p>

<p>We chose P7 as our focus due to the lamination in controls. In the revised manuscript, we plan to include earlier time points, as suggested by the reviewer. The data in Figure 1 at P7 utilizes well-established cell type markers (RBPMS, Chx10, Ap2α) and is not limited only to DAPI. Additionally, we will revise the discussion section and place our mutant analyses in the context of other mutants with rosettes (beta-catenin, etc.) in the retina. Finally, we will address the comment on progenitor lamination by exploring earlier developmental time points.</p>

<p>We will revise the manuscript, particularly the methods section, to address these comments. Additionally, we will tackle ROI units and normalization. The cells in the thickened GCL were identified as displaced amacrine cells and bipolar cells.</p>
