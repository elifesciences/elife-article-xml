<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis is a druggable metabolic dependency of cancer cells, and chemotherapy agents targeting pyrimidine metabolism are the backbone of treatment for many cancers. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is an essential enzyme in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway that can be targeted by clinically approved inhibitors. However, despite robust preclinical anticancer efficacy, DHODH inhibitors have shown limited single-agent activity in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. Therefore, novel combination therapy strategies are necessary to realize the potential of these drugs. To search for therapeutic vulnerabilities induced by DHODH inhibition, we examined gene expression changes in cancer cells treated with the potent and selective DHODH inhibitor brequinar (BQ). This revealed that BQ treatment causes upregulation of antigen presentation pathway genes and cell surface MHC class I expression. Mechanistic studies showed that this effect is 1) strictly dependent on pyrimidine nucleotide depletion, 2) independent of canonical antigen presentation pathway transcriptional regulators, and 3) mediated by RNA polymerase II elongation control by positive transcription elongation factor B (P-TEFb). Furthermore, BQ showed impressive single-agent efficacy in the immunocompetent B16F10 melanoma model, and combination treatment with BQ and dual immune checkpoint blockade (anti-CTLA-4 plus anti-PD-1) significantly prolonged mouse survival compared to either therapy alone. Our results have important implications for the clinical development of DHODH inhibitors and provide a rationale for combination therapy with BQ and immune checkpoint blockade.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Deranged cellular metabolism is a universal feature of cancer cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. One particularly cancer-essential metabolic aberration is the hyperactive synthesis and utilization of nucleotide triphosphates; this phenotype is a critical driver of cancer cell malignant behaviors, including uncontrolled proliferation, evasion of the host immune response, metastasis to distant organs, and resistance to antineoplastic therapy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. The de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, which generates pyrimidine nucleotides from aspartate and glutamine, is consistently hyperactive in cancer cells and druggable by clinically approved inhibitors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) catalyzes the fourth step in this pathway and is essential for de novo pyrimidine synthesis. DHODH inhibitors have shown robust preclinical anticancer activity across diverse cancer types <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> and have recently entered clinical trials for multiple hematologic cancers (NCT04609826 and NCT02509052). Although there is a vast literature on DHODH inhibitors dating back to the early 1990s, and despite the ârediscoveryâ of DHODH in recent years as a critical cancer cell metabolic dependency, important questions about the cellular response to DHODH inhibition remain unanswered.</p>
<p>While combination chemotherapy is highly effective and potentially curative against certain cancers (e.g. Hodgkin lymphoma, testicular cancer, childhood leukemia, and others), many common malignancies are refractory to chemotherapy (e.g. lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, etc.) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. In some chemotherapy-refractory cancers (most prominently melanoma, mismatch repair deficient colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer), immunotherapeutic strategies have demonstrated strong efficacy and led to durable remissions in a subset of patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. The efficacy of immunotherapy agents is dependent on multiple factors, including tumor antigen presentation, limited immune cells in the tumor milieu, and T-cell activation status <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Adoptive cell therapies and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) can address the issues of limited immune cell recruitment into tumors and limited T-cell activation, respectively. However, adequate antigen presentation by tumor cells is still required for immunotherapy efficacy, which relies on T-cell-mediated adaptive immunity.</p>
<p>The antigen presentation pathway (APP) mediates the presentation of endogenous peptide antigens to CD8 T-cells via MHC class I (MHC-I). This pathway entails the degradation of cellular proteins into small peptides by the proteasome, the import of these peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum by transporter associated with antigen presentation proteins (<italic>TAP1</italic> and <italic>TAP2</italic>), and the loading of these peptides into the MHC-I complex, which consists of a heavy chain (encoded by <italic>HLA-A, HLA-B</italic>, or <italic>HLA-C</italic>) and a light chain (encoded by <italic>B2M</italic>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. APP genes are often downregulated in cancer cells, and this impedes the recognition of immunogenic MHC-I restricted cancer cell antigens by infiltrating T-cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Antigen presentation and T-cell recognition are crucial for T-cell-mediated killing of cancer cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, and forced MHC-I expression enhances immunotherapy efficacy in preclinical models <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Furthermore, high tumoral expression of MHC-I, MHC-II, and other APP genes correlates with better overall survival in patients with melanoma treated with ICB therapies <sup>28-31.</sup></p>
<p>While previous reports have shown that pyrimidine nucleotide depletion triggers the expression of innate immunity-related genes and induces an interferon-like response <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, the role of pyrimidine starvation in antigen presentation has not been reported. Herein, we report that DHODH inhibition induces the robust upregulation of APP genes and increases tumor cell antigen presentation via MHC-I. We further explored the mechanism and functional consequences of DHODH inhibitor-mediated APP induction in cancer.</p>

<title>Brequinar induces upregulation of MHC-I and antigen presentation pathway genes</title>
<p>We examined gene expression changes following transient or prolonged DHODH inhibition by culturing human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell lines S2-013 and CFPAC-1 in the presence of BQ at two different doses for 16 hours and for a two-week duration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using Hallmark and KEGG gene sets from MSigDB <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> revealed 17 gene sets that were significantly upregulated (FDR q &lt; 0.25) across both cell lines following two-week BQ exposure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). Twelve of these gene sets (highlighted in purple) are ontologically related to antigen presentation and contain MHC class I, MHC class II, and/or APP genes such as <italic>TAP1</italic> in the leading edge. Certain gene sets, such as allograft rejection (KEGG), graft versus host disease (KEGG), and antigen processing and presentation (KEGG) are composed almost entirely of APP genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). Heatmap analysis showed that APP genes were robustly upregulated in a dose- and duration-dependent manner in CFPAC-1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>) and S2-013 (Fig S1A) cells. The effect size was generally smaller for S2-013 cells, likely because they are resistant to DHODH inhibition due to efficient nucleoside salvage, as we previously reported <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Publicly available RNA-seq data from human A375 melanoma cells treated with the clinically approved DHODH inhibitor teriflunomide <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> corroborated our findings, as teriflunomide caused a rapid (within 12 hours) and duration-dependent increase in MHC-I/II and APP transcript levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>We validated these gene expression changes in CFPAC-1 cells by RT-qPCR (Fig S1B) and then performed RT-qPCR to assess the mRNA levels of genes coding for MHC-I across a panel of human cancer cell lines treated with BQ for 24 hours (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>). This confirmed that MHC-I heavy chain transcripts (<italic>HLA-A, HLA-B</italic>, and <italic>HLA-C</italic>) are consistently upregulated in response to BQ across diverse cancer types (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>). To optimize conditions for <italic>in vivo</italic> studies, we tested the long-term response and observed that two-week BQ treatment of B16F10 murine melanoma cells also caused dramatic APP gene upregulation (Fig S1C). Flow cytometry confirmed a marked increase in cell surface MHC-I levels in nonpermeabilized live CFPAC-1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref>) and B16F10 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1H</xref>) cells following a two-week BQ treatment, confirming that transcriptional upregulation of APP genes results in greater cell surface antigen presentation.</p>
<p>In parallel, we confirmed pyrimidine nucleotide depletion upon treatment with BQ at different doses by performing metabolomics analysis of CFPAC-1 and B16F10 cells following BQ treatment. The results demonstrated a rapid (8-hour treatment) and dose-dependent accumulation of dihydroorotate and N-carbamoyl-aspartate (upstream of DHODH) as well as depletion of pyrimidine nucleotides UTP and CTP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1I-J</xref>) and other pyrimidine species (Fig S1D-E). These results confirm that on-target DHODH inhibition and resultant pyrimidine nucleotide depletion correlates with the transcriptional induction of APP genes and enhanced antigen presentation via MHC-I.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>BQ-mediated APP induction depends on pyrimidine nucleotide depletion</title>
<p>To confirm that BQ-or teriflunomide-mediated APP induction was specifically caused by DHODH inhibition (i.e., on-target effect), we asked whether the effect could be reversed by restoring pyrimidine nucleotides. As we previously observed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, media supplementation with uridine rescued cell viability (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>) and pyrimidine levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>) following BQ treatment and partially rescued viability following teriflunomide treatment (Fig S2A). Uridine supplementation likewise blocked mRNA induction of MHC-I transcripts (<italic>H2-Db, H2-Kb</italic>, and <italic>B2m</italic>), as well as <italic>Nlrc5</italic> (a major MHC-I transcriptional coactivator) and <italic>Tap1</italic> (required for peptide import into the ER, a key step in MHC-I antigen presentation) by BQ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>) or teriflunomide (Fig S2B), while uridine alone had no effect (Fig S2C). This same phenotype was observed in HCT116 human colorectal cancer cells (Fig S2D). Concordantly, cell surface MHC-I upregulation by BQ or teriflunomide (24-hour treatment) was abrogated by uridine supplementation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>), while uridine alone again had no effect (Fig S2E). These results demonstrate that DHODH inhibitor-mediated APP induction is caused by pyrimidine nucleotide depletion.</p>

<p>To further validate this finding, we assessed MHC-I heavy chain mRNA levels in S2-013 cells with DHODH deletion (sgDHODH). We have previously demonstrated that these cells require exogenous uridine for viability and experience profound pyrimidine depletion (&gt;95% depletion of UTP and CTP) after 8-hour incubation in nucleoside-free media <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. After growing these cells with supplemented uridine (1 mM), we withdrew exogenous nucleosides by changing to new media containing 10% dialyzed FBS. After 72-hour exposure to nucleoside-free media, sgDHODH cells upregulated <italic>HLA-A, HLA-B</italic>, and <italic>HLA-C</italic>, and this was reversed by adding back uridine (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>). Importantly, treatment with BQ did not further increase MHC-I mRNA expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>, compare blue and red bars). Together with our other data, these results indicate that BQ-mediated APP induction is an on-target phenomenon with respect to DHODH inhibition.</p>
<p>Since uridine addback rescued BQ- and teriflunomide-mediated loss of viability (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>, S2A), we queried whether BQ-mediated APP induction was caused by pyrimidine depletion <italic>per se</italic>, or if it was the result of some nonspecific downstream consequence of pyrimidine starvation, such as DNA damage or loss of cell viability. To address this, we screened a panel of genotoxic chemotherapy agents and small molecule inhibitors for their ability to induce APP genes following 72-hour exposure at previously determined cytotoxic doses in CFPAC-1 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>). Besides interferon gamma (a positive control), BQ, teriflunomide, and GSK983 (another DHODH inhibitor), the only agent that induced APP gene transcription in this assay was mycophenolate, a clinically approved inhibitor of the <italic>de novo</italic> GTP synthesis enzymes inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IMPDH1/2). The effect of mycophenolate on APP gene expression was subsequently validated in B16F10 cells (Fig S2F), demonstrating that either purine or pyrimidine nucleotide depletion can induce cancer cell APP mRNA expression <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
<p>The other drugs screened included nucleotide synthesis inhibitors (5-fluorouracil, methotrexate, gemcitabine, and hydroxyurea), DNA damage inducers (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and cytarabine), a microtubule targeting drug (paclitaxel), a DNA methylation inhibitor (azacytidine), and other small molecule inhibitors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>). While we cannot rule out the possibility that these agents induce APP transcription in other cell lines or under other dose/duration conditions, the inertness of these compounds (with respect to APP gene expression) in our screen suggests that BQ-mediated APP induction in CFPAC-1 cells is not a general phenomenon that occurs downstream of DNA damage or some other response to therapy-induced stress.</p>

<title>BQ-mediated APP induction does not depend on canonical APP transcriptional regulators</title>
<p>To elucidate the molecular pathway leading to APP induction downstream of pyrimidine depletion, we extended our findings to HEK-293T cells, which also display rapid (within 4 hours) transcriptional induction of MHC-I upon BQ treatment (Fig S3A). Reasoning that the mechanism of this phenomenon in HEK-293T cells is less likely to involve idiosyncratic genetic aberrations than in cancer cell lines, we chose to conduct our initial mechanistic studies in this system and then extend our findings to cancer cell lines if possible.</p>
<p>We used a candidate-based chemical biology screening approach to ask if drugs targeting suspected pathways might block BQ-mediated APP induction in HEK-293T cells. We first interrogated pathways that are known to control MHC/APP expression, including IFN-JAK-STAT <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, NF-Ä¸B <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, and cGAS-STING-TBK1 <sup>41.</sup> Neither ruxolitinib (a JAK1/2 inhibitor with activity against STAT3) nor GSK8612 (a TBK1 inhibitor) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, nor TPCA-1 (an IKK2 inhibitor) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> abrogated BQ-mediated APP induction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>), despite blocking APP induction downstream of poly(dA:dT) and interferon gamma (Fig S3B) as expected.

<p>Interestingly, the IKK2 inhibitor BMS-345541 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> mostly abrogated BQ-mediated APP induction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). BMS-345541 effectively blocked BQ- and Ter-mediated APP induction at concentrations of 10 Î¼M and 40 Î¼M, but not 2.5 Î¼M (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). The effect of BMS-345541 was confirmed in B16F10 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>), CFPAC-1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>), and HCT116 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>) cells. Furthermore, BQ treatment (24 hours) of HCT116 cells caused increased cell surface expression of MHC-I, which could be reversed by either uridine supplementation or by treatment with BMS-345541; neither uridine nor BMS-345541 alone affected cell surface MHC-I expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref>).</p>
<p>Given that TPCA-1 (an established IKK2 inhibitor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>) did not block BQ-mediated APP induction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>), we suspected that this effect of BMS-345541 was independent of IKK2.

Increased APP mRNA expression was observed upon BQ, teriflunomide, or GSK983 treatment (all DHODH inhibitors) of either wild-type or <italic>IKK2</italic>-KO MiaPaCa2 cells (Fig S3C). However, while TNF-alpha stimulation induced APP and <italic>CCL5</italic> (a canonical NF-Ä¸B target gene downstream of TNF-alpha <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>) expression in wild-type cells, this was not observed in <italic>IKK2</italic>-KO cells, as expected (Fig S3C, far right). Finally, BQ-mediated APP induction in <italic>IKK2</italic>-KO cells was significantly reversed with concurrent BMS-345541 treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3G</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that IKK2 is dispensable for BQ-mediated APP induction and that the observed reversal effect of BMS-345541 is independent of IKK2.</p>

<p>One potential target that met the selection criteria was CDK9, which together with cyclin T1 or T2 forms positive transcription elongation factor B (P-TEFb). P-TEFb is required for the release of promoter-proximal paused RNA polymerase II (Pol II) into productive elongation and therefore is essential for Pol II transcription from paused promoters <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. The potent P-TEFb inhibitor flavopiridol <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> phenocopied BMS-345541 in our assays, as it blocked APP induction downstream of DHODH, IMPDH1/2 (by mycophenolate), or CTP synthase (by 3-deazauridine <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>) inhibition (Fig S4A). This suggests that APP induction downstream of nucleotide starvation requires P-TEFb-mediated paused Pol II release. It also suggests that the BMS-345541 effect of reversing BQ-induced APP upregulation is due to P-TEFb inhibition.</p>
<p>Within the list of kinases bound by BMS-345541 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>) we eliminated those that were a) not expressed by CFPAC-1 cells in our RNA-seq data, b) not bound by flavopiridol in KINOMEscan data, or c) bound by ruxolitinib in KINOMEscan data with Kd &lt; 500 nM (as 2.5 Î¼M ruxolitinib failed to reverse BQ-mediated APP induction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>)). Five candidates (besides CDK9) remained that were bound by both BMS-345541 and flavopiridol in KINOMEscan assays. Of these, three are CDKs known to play a role in transcription (CDK7, CDK13, and CDK16). Inhibition of any of these CDKs could theoretically account for the observed effects of flavopiridol and BMS-345541. However, previous studies suggest that flavopiridol inhibition of these CDKs in vivo is much less efficient than in cell-free assays because it is competitive with ATP (and thus less efficient in living cells where the ATP concentration is in the 1-10 mM range, which is much higher than in cell-free assay conditions), while its inhibition of P-TEFb is not affected by ATP concentration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Furthermore, flavopiridol and the CDK7 inhibitor THZ1 have very different (and mutually exclusive) effects on transcriptional processes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, arguing against CDK7 inhibition as the mechanism of flavopiridolâs effect.</p>
<p>To further probe whether the observed effect of flavopiridol was due to CDK9 inhibition, we tested two other CDK9 inhibitors (AT7519 and dinaciclib). Both CDK9 inhibitors phenocopied flavopiridol in our assays (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). Furthermore, a previously characterized CDK9-targeted proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC), termed PROTAC2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>, had the same effect (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). PROTAC2 consists of a CDK9-binding aminopyrazole warhead conjugated to pomalidomide, which recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cereblon (<italic>CRBN</italic>). Cereblon in turn ubiquitinates CDK9, resulting in its proteasomal degradation. Co-treatment of HEK-293 cells with PROTAC2 and pomalidomide prevents PROTAC2-mediated CDK9 degradation, as free pomalidomide competes with PROTAC2 for Cereblon binding <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. We observed that PROTAC2 (1 Î¼M) blocked BQ-mediated APP induction, and this effect was reversed by co-treatment with 10-fold excess pomalidomide (10 Î¼M); however, when we increased the concentration of PROTAC2 to 10 Î¼M (so that PROTAC2 and pomalidomide concentrations were equal), pomalidomide no longer had this effect (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). Consistently, immunoblot analysis showed that 10 Î¼M pomalidomide prevents CDK9 degradation upon 1 Î¼M but not 10 Î¼M PROTAC2 treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). When we repeated the experiment shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref> with HCT116 cells, we found that all CKD9 inhibitors reversed BQ-mediated APP induction, but PROTAC2 did not (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>). Concordantly, immunoblot analysis showed that PROTAC2 did not cause CDK9 depletion in HCT116 cells treated in parallel (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4F</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these results demonstrate that CDK9 degradation is necessary for the reversal effect of PROTAC2 and that CDK9 is required for BQ-mediated APP induction.</p>
<p>The dependence of BQ-mediated APP induction on CDK9 strongly suggests that nucleotide starvation enforces nascent transcription of APP genes, as opposed to increased mRNA stability. This is further supported by the rapid buildup of APP transcripts following DHODH inhibitor treatment (within 4 hours, Fig S3A). Additionally, ChIP-seq analysis of global Pol II occupancy following 48-hour teriflunomide treatment in A375 cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> shows increased Pol II occupancy across many APP genes, and fold change in Pol II occupancy significantly correlated with fold change in mRNA expression under the same conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4G</xref>). Overall, these results show that nucleotide starvation induces an antigen presentation gene expression program that is independent of canonical APP regulators but depends on CDK9/P-TEFb.</p>

<title>BQ suppresses tumor growth, induces MHC-I expression, and increases immunotherapy efficacy in a syngeneic melanoma model</title>
<p>Enforced MHC-I upregulation by various interventions can facilitate anticancer immunity and enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) by antibodies directed at PD-(L)1 and/or CTLA-4 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Moreover, high MHC-I expression has been proposed as a predictor of ICB response <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, and high expression of MHC-I and other APP genes, including <italic>NLRC5</italic> and <italic>TAP1</italic>, correlates with better survival in patients with melanoma (Fig S5A), for whom ICB is a first-line therapy. Therefore, we asked if BQ could improve anticancer immunity in the B16F10 melanoma immunocompetent mouse model, which is typically refractory to dual ICB (i.e., anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>.</p>

We thus addressed whether BQ could augment the efficacy of dual ICB (anti-CTLA-4 plus anti-PD-1) with the knowledge that enforced MHC-I antigen presentation has also been shown to boost the effect of ICB <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. While BQ is not an approved medication, two FDA-approved low potency DHODH inhibitors (leflunomide, teriflunomide) are effective in treating autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis and act to decrease the activity of auto-reactive T-lymphocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. It was possible that BQ treatment may actually impair the effectiveness of ICB by inhibiting T-lymphocytes despite augmented cancer cell antigen presentation. We, therefore, tested both concurrent, upfront administration of BQ plus dual ICB and sequential administration of BQ followed by dual ICB (Fig S5D).</p>
<p>Similar to its impressive activity in our first experiment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A-B</xref>), BQ monotherapy conferred marked survival benefit. This was significantly enhanced by subsequent dual ICB, while dual ICB alone conferred only marginally prolonged survival, and concurrent BQ plus dual ICB did not significantly improve survival versus BQ monotherapy (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>). This suggests that sequential (rather than concurrent) administration of DHODH inhibitor and ICB may be superior. Hypotheses that may explain these findings include: a) Concurrent BQ dampens the initial anticancer immune response generated by dual ICB, or b) cancer cell MHC-I and related genes are not maximally upregulated at the time of ICB administration with concurrent treatment. Taken together, these results show that BQ causes pyrimidine nucleotide depletion, MHC-I and APP gene transcriptional upregulation, and additive survival benefit with dual ICB in a highly aggressive and ICB-refractory mouse melanoma model.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our results demonstrate that pyrimidine nucleotide depletion by DHODH inhibition causes increased expression of APP genes and increased antigen presentation via MHC-I across a diverse panel of cancer cell lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). This effect of BQ and teriflunomide is strictly dependent on pyrimidine nucleotide depletion, as it was abrogated by restoration of pyrimidine levels with exogenous uridine (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B-D</xref> and Fig S2B-E). Furthermore, genetic deletion of <italic>DHODH</italic> recapitulated this effect, and treatment of DHODH knockout cells with BQ did not further increase MHC-I mRNA expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>). Our inhibitor reversal studies determined that BQ-mediated APP induction is independent of several canonical APP regulatory pathways, including IFN-JAK-STAT, cGAS-STING-TBK1, and NF-Ä¸B (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> and Fig S3). We showed that this effect relies on P-TEFb-mediated release of Pol II from promoter-proximal paused state to productive elongation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). These findings were extended to inhibition of IMPDH (which depletes cellular GTP) and CTPS (which depletes cellular CTP), as these effects were also reversible with P-TEFb inhibition (Fig S4A). This suggests that pharmacologic depletion of these nucleotide species also triggers APP upregulation in a P-TEFb-dependent manner.</p>
<p>Since T-cell recognition of antigens via MHC-I is required for T-cell-mediated elimination of cancer cells or virus-infected cells, these results have important implications for the development of nucleotide synthesis inhibitors as anticancer/antiviral therapies. We provide proof of concept evidence that pretreatment with DHODH inhibitors can improve the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade in a highly aggressive and ICB-refractory mouse melanoma model (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> and Fig S5). Because BQ-mediated APP induction does not require interferon signaling, this strategy may have particular relevance for clinical scenarios in which tumor antigen presentation is dampened by the loss or silencing of cancer cell interferon signaling, which has been demonstrated to confer both intrinsic <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> and acquired <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> ICB resistance in human melanoma patients.</p>
<p>Emerging evidence suggests that cancer cell MHC-I expression predicts favorable response to ICB, and several recent studies have shown that enforced cancer cell MHC-I expression enhances anticancer immunity and ICB efficacy in various mouse models. Accordingly, functional genomic screens for regulators of cancer cell MHC-I expression have recently been undertaken, and these efforts have revealed novel molecular targets to induce cancer cell APP activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. Agents shown to increase cancer cell antigen presentation include hydroxychloroquine (by autophagy inhibition) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, poly(I:C) (by NF-Ä¸B activation downstream of dsRNA sensing) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, SMAC mimetics (by NF-Ä¸B activation) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, CDK4/6 inhibitors (by activation of endogenous genomic retroviral elements) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, and others. It is very likely that many other anticancer drugs perturb cancer cell antigen presentation and/or have other immunomodulatory properties in addition to their cell-intrinsic antiproliferative activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>, and this area requires further scrutiny. In this study, we identified DHODH inhibition as a powerful inducer of antigen presentation and MHC-I expression in diverse cancer cell lines and in HEK-293T cells.</p>
<p>Previous studies have linked pyrimidine depletion with upregulation of innate immunity and interferon-stimulated genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, and this was confirmed by our transcriptomic profiling experiments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B-C</xref>). Multiple mechanistic explanations for these observations have been suggested. Lucas-Hourani et al. proposed that interferon-stimulated gene expression requires the DNA damage checkpoint kinase ATM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, while Sprenger et al. conclude that pyrimidine depletion causes accumulation of mitochondrial DNA in the cytosol, which is sensed by the cGAS-STING-TBK1 pathway to promote innate immunity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. In our models, neither ATM/ATR nor TBK1 inhibition blocked BQ-mediated APP induction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). It is possible that pyrimidine nucleotide shortage leads to APP induction by multiple redundant mechanisms, any of which may predominate based on the cellular context. We speculate that cells may have evolved multiple means of sensing acute pyrimidine shortage as a way to detect viral infection or malignant transformation, as both viral replication and uncontrolled cell proliferation avidly consume nucleotides.</p>
<p>Our focused chemical screen for MHC-I inducers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>) identified the approved IMPDH1/2 inhibitor mycophenolate, which was subsequently validated in multiple other cell types (Fig S2D, S4A). This is consistent with a recent study in which IMPDH inhibition was shown to enhance ICB efficacy by favorably altering the MHC-I peptide repertoire and increasing immunoproteasome expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. However, in this study, the cancer cells were pretreated with IMPDH inhibitor before implantation into syngeneic hosts, and so possible countervailing immunosuppression by systemic IMPDH inhibitor treatment was not addressed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> results (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref>) highlight the importance of timing/sequence when administering immunotherapy in combination with nucleotide synthesis inhibitors and suggest that upfront BQ followed by ICB may be superior to concurrent administration.</p>
<p>Thymidylate synthase inhibition was recently shown to induce MHC-I in a model of diffuse large B cell lymphoma <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. The failure of thymidylate synthase inhibitors 5-fluorouracil and methotrexate to induce MHC-I in our screen (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>) may be attributable to cell line differences (PDAC vs DLBCL), dose/duration considerations, or the use of different thymidylate synthase inhibitors than in their study (which used pemetrexed and raltitrexed). Thus, it appears that the abundance of multiple nucleotide species can exert context-dependent influence on MHC and APP gene expression, and key details of this relationship remain to be elucidated.</p>
<p>Overall, our study establishes P-TEFb and Pol II elongation control as a mechanistic link between nucleotide depletion and APP induction. We provide proof of concept evidence for combinatorial benefit of DHODH inhibition and immune checkpoint blockade in an aggressive and poorly immunogenic mouse model of melanoma. A deeper understanding of metabolic control of antigen presentation will enable rational therapy development for cancer and viral infection.</p>

<title>Cell culture and cell lines</title>
<p>The S2-013 cell line is a clonal derivative of the Suit2 cell line and was a kind gift from the Tony Hollingsworth laboratory at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. The MiaPaCa2 <italic>IKK2</italic>-KO and parental wild-type MiaPaCa2 cell lines were a kind gift from the Amar Natarajan laboratory at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. All other cell lines in this study were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). All human cell lines were authenticated by STR profiling by the Genetics Core at the University of Arizona. Cells were routinely (at the time of initial revival from liquid nitrogen storage and at least every 6 months) determined to be free of mycoplasma contamination by PCR-based methods. Cells were cultured in Dulbeccoâs modified Eagle medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with 50 IU/mL penicillin, 50[Î¼g/mL streptomycin, and incubated at 37[Â°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Cells were maintained at 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Upon reaching 70â80% confluency, cells were passaged by washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before adding 0.25% trypsin (Caisson Labs, Smithfield, UT, USA) and plating at 25% confluency.</p>

<p>For in vitro metabolomics experiments, 5 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells were seeded in 6-well plates and allowed to equilibrate overnight. At the start of each assay, the cell culture media was changed, and fresh media with desired conditions was added (to eliminate metabolite depletion from overnight equilibration as a confounding variable). Following 8-hour treatment of cancer cell lines with BQ (or in the case of <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>, 24-hour treatment with BQ +/-100Î¼M uridine), polar metabolites were extracted and quantified as previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>.

<title>Mice studies</title>
<p>All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. For tumor xenograft studies, 10<sup>4</sup> B16F10 cells in a 1:1 vol/vol ratio (100Î¼l final volume) with Matrigel were injected subcutaneously into the right flank of 10-week-old female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson labs). Tumors of live mice were serially measured in two dimensions using digital calipers, and tumor volume for <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref> was calculated as (0.5L x W<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>), where L is the long dimension and W is the short dimension. For <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B-C</xref>, tumors were harvested at necropsy, weighed on an analytical balance (for <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>), and measured in three perpendicular dimensions by calipers to generate volume measurements for <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>, which were calculated as (dimension 1 x dimension 2 x dimension 3).</p>
<p>For survival experiments (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref>), mice were monitored daily for signs of euthanasia criteria or actual demise.

<p>Samples were processed by BGI Genomics (San Jose, California, USA) according to their proprietary method. Briefly, RNA quality check was performed using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Poly-A-containing mRNA was isolated using magnetic beads and then fragmented using divalent cations under elevated temperature. cDNA synthesis was performed using reverse transcriptase and RNase H. Adapter sequences were then ligated onto cDNA fragments, purified, enriched by PCR, quantified by Qubit, and pooled to generate the final library.

<p>The manuscript by Mullen et al. investigated the gene expression changes in cancer cells treated with the DHODH inhibitor brequinar (BQ), to explore the therapeutic vulnerabilities induced by DHODH inhibition. The study found that BQ treatment causes upregulation of antigen presentation pathway (APP) genes and cell surface MHC class I expression, mechanistically which is mediated by the CDK9/PTEFb pathway triggered by pyrimidine nucleotide depletion. The combination of BQ and immune checkpoint therapy demonstrated a synergistic (or additive) anti-cancer effect against xenografted melanoma, suggesting the potential use of BQ and immune checkpoint blockade as a combination therapy in clinical therapeutics.</p>
<p>The interesting findings in the present study include demonstrating a novel cellular response in cancer cells induced by DHODH inhibition. However, whether the increased antigen presentation by DHODH inhibition actually contributed to the potentiation of the efficacy of immune-check blockade (ICB) is not directly examined is the limitation of the study. Moreover, the mechanism of the increased antigen presentation pathway by pyrimidine depletion mediated by CDK9/PTEFb was not validated by genetic KD or KO targeting by CDK9/PTEFb pathways. Finally, high concentrations of BQ have been reported to show off-target effects, sensitizing cancer cells to ferroptosis, and the authors should discuss whether the dose used in the in vivo study reached the ferroptotic sensitizing dose or not.</p>
<p>Comment on the revised version:</p>
<p>In their response letter, the authors appropriately addressed the reviewer's comments.</p>
<p>However, it is unfortunate that these comments are not reflected in the main text. Consequently, readers may encounter the same questions. Therefore, the reviewer recommends mentioning them in the discussion or limitations of the study, even if briefly, to address readers' concerns. Especially, addressing the comments such as the dosage of BQ being lower than the reported pro-ferroptotic dose (PMID 37407687), and the lack of examining potential impact of immune cell depletion on the efficacy of BQ treatment would be necessary for considering the proposed mechanism. The latter limitation is also raised by the other reviewer.</p>

<p>In their manuscript entitled &quot;DHODH inhibition enhances the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade by increasing cancer cell antigen presentation&quot;, Mullen et al. describe an interesting mechanism of inducing antigen presentation. The manuscript includes a series of experiments that demonstrate that blockade of pyrimidine synthesis with DHODH inhibitors (i.e. brequinar (BQ)) stimulates the expression of genes involved in antigen presentation. The authors provide evidence that BQ mediated induction of MHC is independent of interferon signaling. A subsequent targeted chemical screen yielded evidence that CDK9 is the critical downstream mediator that induces RNA Pol II pause release on antigen presentation genes to increase expression. Finally, the authors demonstrate that BQ elicits strong anti-tumor activity in vivo in syngeneic models, and that combination of BQ with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) results in significant lifespan extension in the B16-F10 melanoma model. Overall, the manuscript uncovers an interesting and unexpected mechanism that influences antigen presentation and provides an avenue for pharmacological manipulation of MHC genes, which is therapeutically relevant in many cancers. However, a few key experiments are needed to ensure that the proposed mechanism is indeed functional in vivo.</p>
<p>Major Points:</p>
<p>(1) According to the proposed model, BQ mediated induction of antigen presentation is a contributing factor to the efficacy of this therapeutic strategy. If this is true, then depletion of immune cells should reduce the therapeutic efficacy of BQ in vivo. The authors should perform the B16-F10 transplant experiments in either Rag null mice (if available) or with CD8/CD4 depletion. The expectation would be that T cell depletion (or MHC loss with genetic manipulation) should reduce the efficacy of BQ treatment. Absent this critical experiment, it is difficult to confidently conclude that induction of antigen presentation is a fundamental component of the in vivo response to DHODH inhibition.</p>
<p>(2) Does BQ treatment induce antigen presentation in non-malignant cells? APCs? If the induction of antigen presentation is not cancer specific and related to a pyrimidine depletion stress response, then there is a possibility that healthy tissues will also exhibit a similar phenotype, raising concerns about the specificity of a de novo immune response. The authors should examine antigen presentation genes in healthy tissues treated with BQ.</p>
<p>(3) In the title, the authors claim that DHODH enhances the efficacy of ICB. However, the experiment shown in Figure 5D does not demonstrate this. The Kaplan Meier curves reflect more of an additive response versus a synergistic combination. Furthermore, the concurrent treatment of BQ and ICB seems to inhibit the efficacy of ICB due to BQ toxicity in immune cells. When concurrently administered, the survival of the mice is the same as with brequinar alone, suggesting that the efficacy of ICB was diminished. However, if ICB is administered following an initial dose of BQ, there is an added survival benefit of a magnitude that is similar to ICB alone. This result seems to contradict the title. Furthermore, the authors should show the longitudinal growth curves of these tumors.</p>
<p>(4) Related to Point 3, the temporal separation of BQ and ICB raises the question of whether the induction of antigen presentation with BQ is persistent during the course of delayed ICB treatment. One explanation for the results is that BQ treatment reduces tumor burden, and then a subsequent course of ICB also reduces tumor burden but not that the two therapies are functioning in synergy. To address this, the authors should measure the duration of BQ mediated induction of antigen presentation after stopping treatment.</p>
<p>(5) In Figure 1, the authors show that DHODH inhibition induces expression of both MHC-I and MHC-II genes at the RNA level. However, they only validate MHC-I by flow cytometry. A simple experiment to evaluate the effect of BQ treatment on MHC-II surface expression would provide important additional mechanistic insight into the immunomodulatory effects of DHODH inhibition, especially given recent literature reinforcing the importance of MHC-II expression on epithelial cancers, including melanoma (Oliveira et al. Nature 2022).</p>
<p>Minor Points:</p>
<p>(1) The authors show ChIP-seq tracks from Tan et al. for HLA-B. However, given the pervasive effect of Ter treatment across many HLA genes, the authors should either show tracks at additional loci, or provide a heatmap of read density across more loci. This would substantiate the mechanistic claim that RNA Pol II occupancy and activity across antigen presentation genes is the major driver of response to DHODH inhibition as opposed to mRNA stabilization/increased translation.</p>
<p>(2) A compelling way to demonstrate a change in antigen presentation is through mass spectrometry based immunopeptidomics. Performing immunopeptidomic analysis of BQ treated cell lines would provide substantial mechanistic insight into the outcome of BQ treatment. While this approach may be outside the scope of the current work, the authors should speculate on how this treatment may specifically alter the antigenic landscape where future directions would include empirical immunopeptidomics measurements.</p>
<p>(3) While the signaling through CDK9 seems convincing, it still does not provide a mechanistic link between depleted pyrimidines and CDK9 activity. The authors should speculate on the mechanism that signals to CDK9.</p>
<p>(4) Related to minor point 2, the authors should consider a genetic approach to confirm the importance of CDK9. While the pharmacological approach, including multiple mechanistically distinct CDK9 inhibitors provides strong evidence, an additional experiment with genetic depletion of CDK9 (CRISPR KO, shRNA, etc) would provide compelling mechanistic confirmation.</p>
<p>(5) The authors should comment in the discussion on how this strategy may be particularly useful in patients harboring genetic or epigenetic loss of interferon signaling, a known mechanism of ICB resistance. Perhaps DHODH inhibition could rescue MHC expression in cells that are deficient in interferon sensing.</p>
<p>Overall, the paper is clearly written and presented. With the additional experiments described above, especially in vivo, this manuscript would provide a strong contribution to the field of antigen presentation in cancer. The distinct mechanisms by which DHODH inhibition induces antigen presentation will also set the stage for future exploration into alternative methods of antigen induction.</p>
<p>Comments on latest version:</p>
<p>The authors address the majority of the points raised in my previous review. However, no additional in vivo experiments were performed, which seems necessary for the major conclusions of the paper.</p>
<p>I disagree with the authors' assessment of Major Point 3 in my review. I have updated the text of Major Point 3 in my public review to further clarify my position.</p>
<p>My final assessment is that if the authors want to claim that DHODH inhibition potentiates immune checkpoint blockade, as is stated in the title, then further in vivo experimentation is needed.</p>

<p>Mullen et al present an important study describing how DHODH inhibition enhances efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade by increasing cell surface expression of MHC I in cancer cells. DHODH inhibitors have been used in the clinic for many years to treat patients with rheumatoid arthritis and there has been a growing interest in repurposing these inhibitors as anti-cancer drugs. In this manuscript, the Singh group builds on their previous work defining combinatorial strategies with DHODH inhibitors to improve efficacy. The authors identify an increased expression of genes in the antigen presentation pathway and MHC I after BQ treatment which is mediated strictly by pyrimidine depletion and CDK9/P-TEFb. The authors rationalize that increased MHC I expression induced by DHODH inhibition might favor efficacy of dual immune checkpoint blockade. In fact, this combinatorial treatment prolonged survival in an immunocompetent B16F10 melanoma model.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that DHODH inhibitors can increase expression of innate immunity-related genes but the role of DHODH and pyrimidine nucleotides in antigen presentation has not been previously reported. A strength of the manuscript is the solid in vitro mechanistic data supported by analysis in multiple cell lines. The in vivo data show compelling additive effects of DHODH inhibitors and ICB. However, more controls and experiments would be required to define the nature of these effects and to confirm that the mechanistic in vitro data is conserved in vivo.</p>
<p>This is a relevant manuscript proposing a mechanistic link between pyrimidine depletion and MHC I expression and a novel therapeutic approach combining DHODH inhibitors with dual checkpoint blockade. These results might be relevant for the clinical development of DHODH inhibitors in the treatment of solid tumors, a setting where these have not shown optimal efficacy yet.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>The authors have addressed my questions regarding validation of gene expression in other cell lines. They have also provided an explanation about why in vivo evaluations could not be performed for the experiment in Figure 5E.</p>

<p>This important study reports a novel mechanism linking DHODH inhibition-mediated pyrimidine nucleotide depletion to antigen presentation. Alternative means of inducing antigen presentation provide therapeutic opportunities to augment immune checkpoint blockade for cancer treatment. While the solid mechanistic data in vitro are compelling, in vivo assessments of the functional relevance of this mechanism are still incomplete.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Mullen et al. investigated the gene expression changes in cancer cells treated with the DHODH inhibitor brequinar (BQ), to explore the therapeutic vulnerabilities induced by DHODH inhibition. The study found that BQ treatment causes upregulation of antigen presentation pathway (APP) genes and cell surface MHC class I expression, mechanistically which is mediated by the CDK9/PTEFb pathway triggered by pyrimidine nucleotide depletion.</p>

<p>The interesting findings in the present study include demonstrating a novel cellular response in cancer cells induced by DHODH inhibition. However, whether the increased antigen presentation by DHODH inhibition actually contributed to the potentiation of the efficacy of immune-check blockade (ICB) is not directly examined is the limitation of the study.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Moreover, the mechanism of the increased antigen presentation pathway by pyrimidine depletion mediated by CDK9/PTEFb was not validated by genetic KD or KO targeting by CDK9/PTEFb pathways.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this comment, and we would like to explain why we did not pursue these approaches. According to DepMap, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of CDK9 in cancer cell lines is almost universally deleterious, scoring as âessentialâ in 99.8% (1093/1095) of all cell lines tested (see Author response image 1 below). This makes sense, as P-TEFb is required for productive RNA polymerase II elongation of most mammalian genes. As such, it was not feasible to generate cell lines with stable genetic knockout of CDK9 to test our hypothesis.</p>
<p>While knockdown of CDK9 by RNA interference could support our results, DepMap data seems to indicate that RNAi-mediated knockdown of CDK9 is generally ineffective in silencing its activity, as this perturbation scored as âessentialâ in only 6.2% (44/710) of tested cell lines. This suggests that incomplete depletion of CDK9 will likely not be sufficient to block APP induction downstream of nucleotide depletion. Furthermore, RNAi-mediated depletion of CDK9 may trigger transcriptional changes in the cell by virtue of its many documented protein-protein interactions, and it would be difficult to establish a consistent âtime zeroâ at which point CDK9 protein depletion is substantial but secondary effects of this have not yet occurred to a significant degree. These factors constitute major limitations of experiments using RNAi-mediated knockdown of CDK9.</p>

<p>At any rate, we provide evidence that three different inhibitors of CDK9 (flavopiridol, dinaciclib, and AT7519) all inhibit our effect of interest (Fig 4B). The same results were observed using a previously validated CDK9-directed proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC2), and this was reversed by addition of excess pomalidomide (Fig 4C), which correlated with the presence/absence of CDK9 on western blot under the exact same conditions (Fig 4D).</p>
<p>It is formally possible that all CDK9 inhibitors we tested are blocking BQ-mediated APP induction by some shared off-target mechanism (or perhaps by two or more different off-target mechanisms) AND this CDK9-independent target also happens to be degraded by PROTAC2. However, this would be an extraordinarily non-parsimonious explanation for our results, and so we contend that we have provided compelling evidence for the requirement of CDK9 for BQ-mediated APP induction.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Finally, high concentrations of BQ have been reported to show off-target effects, sensitizing cancer cells to ferroptosis, and the authors should discuss whether the dose used in the in vivo study reached the ferroptotic sensitizing dose or not.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are intrigued by the results shown to us by Reviewer #1 in the linked preprint (Mishima et al 2022, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2190326/v1">https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2190326/v1</ext-link>). We have also observed in our unpublished data that very high concentrations of BQ (&gt;150ÂµM) cause loss of cell viability that is not rescued by uridine supplementation and that occurs even in DHODH knockout cells. This effect of high-dose BQ must be DHODH-independent. We also agree that Mishima et al provide compelling evidence that the ferroptosis-sensitizing effect of high-dose BQ treatment is due (at least in large part) to inhibition of FSP1.</p>
<p>Although we showed that DHODH is strongly inhibited in tumor cells in vivo (Fig 5C), we did not directly measure the concentration of BQ in the tumor or plasma. Sykes et al (PMID: 27641501) found that the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) for [BQ]free following a single IP administration in C57Bl6/J mice (15mg/kg) is approximately 3ÂµM, while the Cmax for [BQ]total was around 215ÂµM. Because polar drug molecules bound to serum proteins (predominantly albumin) are not available to bind other targets, [BQ]free is the relevant parameter.</p>
<p>Given a Cmax for [BQ]free of 3ÂµM and half-life of 12.0 hours, we estimate that the steady-state [BQ]free with daily IP injections at this dose is around 4ÂµM. Since we used an administration schedule of 10mg/kg every 24 hours, we estimate that the steady-state plasma [BQ]free in our system was 2.67ÂµM (assuming initial Cmax of 2ÂµM and half-life of 12.0 hours).</p>
<p>To derive an upper-bound estimate for the Cmax of [BQ]free over the 12-day treatment period (Fig 5A-D), we will use the observed data for 15mg/kg dose, and we will assume that 1) there is no clearance of BQ whatsoever and 2) that [BQ]free increases linearly with increasing [BQ]total. This yields a maximum free BQ concentration of 12 x 3 = 36ÂµM.</p>
<p>Therefore, we consider it very unlikely that plasma concentrations of free BQ in our experiment exceeded the lower limit of the ferroptosis-sensitizing dose range reported by Mishima et al. However, without direct pharmacokinetic analysis, we cannot say for sure what the maximal [BQ]free was under our experimental conditions.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>In their manuscript entitled &quot;DHODH inhibition enhances the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade by increasing cancer cell antigen presentation&quot;, Mullen et al. describe an interesting mechanism of inducing antigen presentation. The manuscript includes a series of experiments that demonstrate that blockade of pyrimidine synthesis with DHODH inhibitors (i.e. brequinar (BQ)) stimulates the expression of genes involved in antigen presentation. The authors provide evidence that BQ mediated induction of MHC is independent of interferon signaling. A subsequent targeted chemical screen yielded evidence that CDK9 is the critical downstream mediator that induces RNA Pol II pause release on antigen presentation genes to increase expression. Finally, the authors demonstrate that BQ elicits strong anti-tumor activity in vivo in syngeneic models, and that combination of BQ with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) results in significant lifespan extension in the B16-F10 melanoma model. Overall, the manuscript uncovers an interesting and unexpected mechanism that influences antigen presentation and provides an avenue for pharmacological manipulation of MHC genes, which is therapeutically relevant in many cancers. However, a few key experiments are needed to ensure that the proposed mechanism is indeed functional in vivo.</p>
<p>The combination of DHODH inhibition with ICB reflects more of an additive response instead of a synergistic combination. Moreover, the temporal separation of BQ and ICB raises the question of whether the induction of antigen presentation with BQ is persistent during the course of delayed ICB treatment. To confidently conclude that induction of antigen presentation is a fundamental component of the in vivo response to DHODH inhibition, the authors should examine whether depletion of immune cells can reduce the therapeutic efficacy of BQ in vivo.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We concur with this assessment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Moreover, they should examine whether BQ treatment induces antigen presentation in non-malignant cells and APCs to determine the cancer specificity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although we showed that this occurs in HEK-293T cells, we appreciate that this cell line is not representative of human cells of any organ system in vivo. So, we agree it is important to determine if DHODH inhibition induces antigen presentation in human tissues and professional antigen presenting cells, and this is an excellent focus for future studies.</p>
<p>However, it should also be noted that increased antigen presentation in non-malignant host tissues would not be expected to generate an autoimmune response, because host tissues likely lack strong neoantigens, and whatever immunogenic peptides they may have would likely be presented via MHC-I at baseline (i.e. even in the absence of DHODH inhibitor treatment), since all nucleated cells express MHC-I.</p>
<p>This argument is strongly supported by clinical experience/data, as DHODH inhibitors (leflunomide and teriflunomide) are commonly used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. While the pathophysiology of these autoimmune syndromes is complex, it is thought that both diseases are driven by aberrant T-cell attack on host tissues, mediated by incorrect recognition of host antigens presented via MHC-I (as well as MHC-II) as âforeign.â</p>
<p>If increased antigen presentation in host tissues (downstream of DHODH inhibition) could lead to a de novo autoimmune response, then administration of DHODH inhibitors would be expected to exacerbate T-cell driven autoimmune disease rather than ameliorate it. Randomized controlled trials have consistently found that treatment with DHODH inhibitors leads to improvement of rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis symptoms, which is the opposite of what one would expect if DHODH inhibitors are causing de novo autoimmune reactions in human patients.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Finally, although the authors show that DHODH inhibition induces expression of both MHC-I and MHC-II genes at the RNA level, only MHC-I is validated by flow cytometry given the importance of MHC-II expression on epithelial cancers, including melanoma, MHC-II should be validated as well.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully agree with this statement. We attempted to quantify cell surface MHC-II expression by FACS using the same method as for MHC-I (Figs 1G-H, 2D, and 3F). We did not detect cell surface MHC-II in any of our cancer cell lines, despite the use of high-dose interferon gamma and other stimulants (which robustly increase MHC-II mRNA in our system) in an attempt to induce expression. However, because we did not use cells known to express MHC-II as a positive control (e.g. B-cell leukemia cell lines or primary splenocytes), we do not know if our results are due to some technical failure (perhaps related to our protocol/reagents) or if they reflect a true absence of cell surface MHC-II in our cell lines.</p>
<p>If the latter is true, that implies that either 1) MHC-II mRNA is not translated or 2) that it is translated, but our cancer cell lines lack one or more elements of the machinery required for MHC-II antigen presentation.</p>
<p>In any case, it is important to determine if DHODH inhibition increases MHC-II at the cell surface of cancer cells using appropriate positive and negative controls, as this could have important implications for cancer immunotherapy.</p>
<p>[As a minor point, melanoma is not an epithelial cancer, as it is derived from neural crest lineage cells (melanocytes)]</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Overall, the paper is clearly written and presented. With the additional experiments described above, especially in vivo, this manuscript would provide a strong contribution to the field of antigen presentation in cancer. The distinct mechanisms by which DHODH inhibition induces antigen presentation will also set the stage for future exploration into alternative methods of antigen induction.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Mullen et al present an important study describing how DHODH inhibition enhances efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade by increasing cell surface expression of MHC I in cancer cells. DHODH inhibitors have been used in the clinic for many years to treat patients with rheumatoid arthritis and there has been a growing interest in repurposing these inhibitors as anti-cancer drugs. In this manuscript, the Singh group build on their previous work defining combinatorial strategies with DHODH inhibitors to improve efficacy. The authors identify an increase in expression of genes involved in the antigen presentation pathway and MHC I after BQ treatment and they narrow the mechanism to be strictly pyrimidine and CDK9/P-TEFb dependent. The authors rationalize that increased MHC I expression induced by DHODH inhibition might favor efficacy of dual immune checkpoint blockade. This combinatorial treatment prolonged survival in an immunocompetent B16F10 melanoma model.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Previous studies have shown that DHODH inhibitors can increase expression of innate immunity-related genes but the role of DHODH and pyrimidine nucleotides in antigen presentation has not been previously reported. A strength of the manuscript is the use of multiple controls across a panel of cell lines to exclude off-target effects and to confirm that effects are exclusively dependent on pyrimidine depletion. Overall, the authors do a thorough characterization of the mechanism that mediates MHC I upregulation using multiple strategies. Furthermore, the in vivo studies provide solid evidence for combining DHODH inhibitors with immune checkpoint blockade.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>However, despite the use of multiple cell lines, most experiments are only performed in one cell line, and it is hard to understand why particular gene sets, cell lines or time points are selected for each experiment. It would be beneficial to standardize experimental conditions and confirm the most relevant findings in multiple cell lines.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this comment, and we understand how the use of various cell lines may seem puzzling. We would like to explain how our cell line panel evolved over the course of the study.
Our first indication that BQ caused APP upregulation came from transcriptomics experiments (Figs 1A-D, S1A) performed as part of a previous study investigating BQ resistance (Mullen et al, 2023 Cancer Letters). In that study, we used CFPAC-1 as a model for BQ sensitivity and S2-013 as a model for BQ resistance. We did RNA sequencing +/- BQ in these cell lines to look for gene expression patterns that might underlie resistance/sensitivity to BQ. When analyzing this data, we serendipitously discovered the APP/MHC phenomenon, which gave rise to the present study.</p>
<p>Our next step was to extend these findings to cancer cell lines of other histologies, and we prioritized cell lines derived from common cancer types for which immunotherapy (specifically ICB) are clinically approved. This is why A549 (lung adenocarcinoma), HCT116 (colorectal adenocarcinoma), A375 (cutaneous melanoma), and MDA-MB-231 (triple-negative breast cancer) cell lines were introduced.</p>
<p>Because PDAC is considered to have an especially âimmune-coldâ tumor microenvironment, we reasoned that even dramatically increasing cancer cell antigen presentation may be insufficient to elicit an effective anti-tumor immune response in vivo. So we shifted our focus towards melanoma, because a subset of melanoma patients is very responsive to ICB and loss of antigen presentation (by direct silencing or homozygous loss-of-function mutations in MHC-I components such as B2M, or by functional loss of IFN-JAK1/2-STAT signaling) has been shown to mediate ICB resistance in human melanoma patients. This is why we extended our findings to B16F10 murine melanoma cells, intending to use them for in vivo studies with syngeneic immunocompetent recipient mice.</p>
<p>The PDAC cell line MiaPaCa2 was introduced because a collaborator at our institution (Amar Natarajan) happened to have IKK2 knockout MiaPaCa2 cells, which allowed us to genetically validate our inhibitor results showing that IKK1 and IKK2 (crucial effectors for NF-kB signaling) are dispensable for our effect of interest.</p>
<p>Ultimately, realizing that our results spanned various human and murine cell lines, we chose to use HEK-293T cells to validate the general applicability of our findings to proliferating cells in 2D culture, since HEK-293T cells (compared to our cancer cell lines) have relatively few genetic idiosyncrasies and express MHC-I at baseline.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The differential in vivo survival depending on dosing schedule is interesting. However, this section could be strengthened with a more thorough evaluation of the tumors at endpoint.</p>
<p>Overall, this is an interesting manuscript proposing a mechanistic link between pyrimidine depletion and MHC I expression and a novel therapeutic strategy combining DHODH inhibitors with dual checkpoint blockade. These results might be relevant for the clinical development of DHODH inhibitors in the treatment of solid tumors, a setting where these inhibitors have not shown optimal efficacy yet.</p>
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The main issue is that it did not directly examine whether the increased antigen presentation by DHODH inhibition contributed to the potentiation of the efficacy of immune-check blockade (ICB). The additional effect of BQ in the xenograft tumor study was not examined to determine if it was due to increased antigen presentation toward the cancer cells or due to merely cell cycle arrest effect by pyrimidine depletion in the tumor cells. The different administration timing of ICB with BQ treatment (Fig 5E) would not be sufficient to answer this issue.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with this assessment and, and we believe the experiment proposed by Reviewer #2 below (comparing the efficacy of BQ in Rag-null versus immunocompetent recipients) would address this question directly. We also think that using a more immunogenic cell line for this experiment (such as B16F10 transduced with ovalbumin or some other strong neoantigen) would be useful given the poor immunogenicity and lack of any defined strong neoantigen in B16F10 cells. An orthogonal approach would be to engraft cancer cells with or without B2M knockout into immunocompetent recipient mice (+/- BQ treatment) to further implicate MHC-I and antigen presentation. These questions will be addressed in future studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Additionally, in the in vivo study, the increase in surface MHC1 in the protein level in by BQ treatment was not examined in the tumor samples, and it was not confirmed whether increased antigen presentation by BQ treatment actually promoted an anti-cancer immune response in immune cells. To support the story presented in the study, these data would be necessary.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We attempted to show this by immunohistochemistry, but unfortunately the anti-H2-Db antibody that we obtained for this purpose did not have satisfactory performance to assess this in our tissue samples harvested at necropsy.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The mechanism of the increased antigen presentation pathway by pyrimidine depletion mediated by CDK9/PTEFb was not validated by genetic KD or KO targeting by CDK9/PTEFb pathways. In general, results only by the inhibitor assay have a limitation of off-target effects.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please see our above reply to Reviewer #1 comment making this same point, where we spell out our rationale for not pursuing these experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) High concentrations of BQ (&gt; 50 uM) have been reported to show off-target effects, sensitizing cancer cells to ferroptosis, an iron-mediated lipid peroxidation-dependent cell death, independent of DHODH inhibition (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2190326/v1">https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2190326/v1</ext-link>). It would be needed to discuss whether the dose used in the in vivo study reached the ferroptotic sensitizing dose or not.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please see our above reply to Reviewer #1 comment making this same point, where we explain why we are very confident that the BQ dose administered in our animal experiments was far below the minimum reported BQ dose required to sensitize cancer cells to ferroptosis in vitro.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Major Points</p>
<p>(1) According to the proposed model, BQ mediated induction of antigen presentation is a contributing factor to the efficacy of this therapeutic strategy. If this is true, then depletion of immune cells should reduce the therapeutic efficacy of BQ in vivo. The authors should perform the B16-F10 transplant experiments in either Rag null mice (if available) or with CD8/CD4 depletion. The expectation would be that T cell depletion (or MHC loss with genetic manipulation) should reduce the efficacy of BQ treatment. Absent this critical experiment, it is difficult to confidently conclude that induction of antigen presentation is a fundamental component of the in vivo response to DHODH inhibition.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with this assessment and the proposed experiment comparing the response in Rag-null versus immunocompetent recipients. We also think that using a more immunogenic cell line for this experiment (such as B16F10 transduced with ovalbumin or some other strong neoantigen) would be useful given the poor immunogenicity and lack of any defined strong neoantigen in B16F10 cells. An orthogonal approach would be to engraft cancer cells with or without B2M knockout into immunocompetent recipient mice (+/- BQ treatment) to further implicate MHC-I and antigen presentation. These questions will be addressed in future studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Does BQ treatment induce antigen presentation in non-malignant cells? APCs? If the induction of antigen presentation is not cancer specific and related to a pyrimidine depletion stress response, then there is a possibility that healthy tissues will also exhibit a similar phenotype, raising concerns about the specificity of a de novo immune response. The authors should examine antigen presentation genes in healthy tissues treated with BQ.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree it is important to examine if our findings regarding nucleotide depletion and antigen presentation are true of APCs and other non-transformed cells, but we are not so concerned about the possibility of raising an immune response against non-malignant host tissues, as explained above. We have reproduced the relevant section below:</p>
<p>âHowever, it should also be noted that increased antigen presentation in non-malignant host tissues would not be expected to generate an autoimmune response, because host tissues likely lack strong neoantigens, and whatever immunogenic peptides they may have would likely be presented via MHC-I at baseline, since all nucleated cells express MHC-I.</p>

While the pathophysiology of these autoimmune syndromes is complex, it is thought that both diseases are driven by aberrant T-cell attack on host tissues, mediated by incorrect recognition of host antigens presented via MHC-I (as well as MHC-II) as âforeign.â</p>

Randomized controlled trials have consistently found that treatment with DHODH inhibitors leads to improvement of rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis symptoms, which is the opposite of what one would expect if DHODH inhibitors are causing de novo autoimmune reactions in human patients.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In the title, the authors claim that DHODH enhances the efficacy of ICB. However, the experiment shown in Figure 5D does not demonstrate this. The Kaplan Meier curves reflect more of an additive response versus a synergistic combination. Furthermore, the concurrent treatment of BQ and ICB seems to inhibit the efficacy of ICB due to BQ toxicity in immune cells. This result seems to contradict the title.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We do not agree with this assessment. Given that the effect of dual ICB alone was very marginal, while the effect of BQ monotherapy was quite marked, we cannot conclude from Fig 5 that BQ treatment inhibited ICB efficacy due to immune suppression.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Related to Point 3, the temporal separation of BQ and ICB raises the question of whether the induction of antigen presentation with BQ is persistent during the course of delayed ICB treatment. One explanation for the results is that BQ treatment reduces tumor burden, and then a subsequent course of ICB also reduces tumor burden but not that the two therapies are functioning in synergy. To address this, the authors should measure the duration of BQ mediated induction of antigen presentation after stopping treatment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the alternative explanation proposed by Reviewer #2 is possible and we appreciate the suggestion to test the stability of APP induction after stopping BQ treatment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) In Figure 1, the authors show that DHODH inhibition induces expression of both MHC-I and MHC-II genes at the RNA level. However, they only validate MHC-I by flow cytometry. A simple experiment to evaluate the effect of BQ treatment on MHC-II surface expression would provide important additional mechanistic insight into the immunomodulatory effects of DHODH inhibition, especially given recent literature reinforcing the importance of MHC-II expression on epithelial cancers, including melanoma (Oliveira et al. Nature 2022).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully agree with this statement. We attempted to quantify cell surface MHC-II expression by FACS using the same method as for MHC-I (Figs 1G-H, 2D, and 3F). We did not detect cell surface MHC-II in any of our cancer cell lines, despite the use of high-dose interferon gamma and other stimulants (which robustly increase MHC-II mRNA in our system) in an attempt to induce expression.

<p>[As a minor point, melanoma is not an epithelial cancer, as it is derived from neural crest lineage cells (melanocytes)]</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor Points</p>
<p>(1) The authors show ChIP-seq tracks from Tan et al. for HLA-B. However, given the pervasive effect of Ter treatment across many HLA genes, the authors should either show tracks at additional loci, or provide a heatmap of read density across more loci. This would substantiate the mechanistic claim that RNA Pol II occupancy and activity across antigen presentation genes is the major driver of response to DHODH inhibition as opposed to mRNA stabilization/increased translation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this suggestion. We have changed Fig 4 by replacing the HLA-B track (old Fig 4E) with a representation of fold change (Ter/DMSO) in Pol II occupancy versus fold change (Ter/DMSO) in mRNA abundance for 23 relevant genes (new Fig 4G); both of these datasets were obtained from the Tan et al manuscript. This new figure panel (Fig 4G) also shows linear regression analysis demonstrating that Pol II occupancy and mRNA expression are significantly correlated for APP genes. While we recognize that this data in itself is not formal proof of our hypothesis, it does strongly support the notion that increased transcription is responsible for the increased mRNA abundance of APP genes that we have observed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) A compelling way to demonstrate a change in antigen presentation is through mass spectrometry based immunopeptidomics. Performing immunopeptidomic analysis of BQ treated cell lines would provide substantial mechanistic insight into the outcome of BQ treatment. While this approach may be outside the scope of the current work, the authors should speculate on how this treatment may specifically alter the antigenic landscape where future directions would include empirical immunopeptidomics measurements.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully agree with this comment. While the abundance of cancer cell surface MHC-I is an important factor for anticancer immunity, another crucial factor is the identity of peptides that are presented. Treatments that cause presentation of more immunogenic peptides can enhance T-cell recognition even in the absence of a relative change in cell surface MHC-I abundance.</p>
<p>While we did not perform the immunopeptidomics experiments described, we can offer some speculation regarding this comment. As shown in Fig 1D-E, transcriptomics experiments suggest that immunoproteasome subunits (PSMB8, PSMB9, PSMB10) are upregulated upon DHODH inhibition. If this change in mRNA levels translates into greater immunoproteasome activity (which was not tested in our study), this would be expected to alter the repertoire of peptides available for presentation and could thereby change the immunopeptidome.</p>
<p>However, this hypothesis requires direct testing, and we hope future studies will delineate the effects of DHODH inhibition and other cancer therapies on the immunopeptidome, as this area of research will have important clinical implications.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) While the signaling through CDK9 seems convincing, it still does not provide a mechanistic link between depleted pyrimidines and CDK9 activity. The authors should speculate on the mechanism that signals to CDK9.</p>
<p>We agree with the assessment. A mechanistic link between depleted pyrimidines and CDK9 activity will be a subject of future studies.</p>
<p>(4) Related to minor point 2, the authors should consider a genetic approach to confirm the importance of CDK9. While the pharmacological approach, including multiple mechanistically distinct CDK9 inhibitors provides strong evidence, an additional experiment with genetic depletion of CDK9 (CRISPR KO, shRNA, etc) would provide compelling mechanistic confirmation.</p>

<p>Reviewer #1 raised this very same point, and we agree. Please see our reply to Reviewer #1, which details why we did not pursue this approach and argues that the evidence we present is compelling even in absence of genetic manipulation.</p>
<p>Additionally, please see the new Fig 4E and 4F, which is a repeat of Fig 4B using HCT116 cells. Figure 4E shows that, in this cell line, CDK9 inhibitors (flavopiridol, dinaciclib, and AT7519) block BQ-mediated APP induction, while PROTAC2 does not. Figure 4F shows that (for reasons we cannot fully explain) PROTAC2 does not lead to CDK9 degradation in HCT116 cells. This data strongly implicates CDK9, because it excludes a CDK9-degradation-independent effect of PROTAC2.</p>

<p>(6) The authors should comment in the discussion on how this strategy may be particularly useful in patients harboring genetic or epigenetic loss of interferon signaling, a known mechanism of ICB resistance. Perhaps DHODH inhibition could rescue MHC expression in cells that are deficient in interferon sensing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion! We have amended the Discussion section to mention this important point. Please see paragraph 2 of the revised Discussion section where we have added the following text:</p>
<p>âBecause BQ-mediated APP induction does not require interferon signaling, this strategy may have particular relevance for clinical scenarios in which tumor antigen presentation is dampened by the loss or silencing of cancer cell interferon signaling, which has been demonstrated to confer both intrinsic and acquired ICB resistance in human melanoma patients.â</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The authors present convincing evidence of the mechanism by which pyrimidine nucleotides regulate MHC I levels and about the potential of combining DHODH inhibitors with dual immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). This is an interesting paper given the clinical relevance of DHODH inhibitors. The studies raise some questions, and some points might need clarifying as below:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>In Figure 2C, why do the authors focus on these two genes in the uridine rescue? These are important genes mediating antigen presentation, but it might be more interesting to see how H2-Db and H2-Kb expression correlate with the protein data shown in Fig 2D. Fig. 2C-2D is a relevant control, so it would be important to validate in a different cancer cell line (e.g. one of the PDAC cell lines used for the RNAseq).</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this comment. Although Fig 3C shows that BQ-induced expression of H2-Db, H2-Kb, and B2m is reversed by uridine (in B16F10 cells), we recognize that this was not the best placement for this data, as it can easily be overlooked here since uridine reversal is not the main point of Fig 3C. We have left Fig 3C as is, because we think that the uridine reversal demonstrated in that panel serves as a good internal positive control for reversal of BQ-mediated APP induction in that experiment.</p>
<p>We have repeated the experiments shown in the original Fig 2C and substituted the original Fig 2C with a new Fig 2C and  Fig S2B, which show both Tap1 and Nlrc5 as well as H2-Db, H2-Kb, and B2m after treatment with either BQ (new Fig 2C) or teriflunomide (new Fig S2B). The original Fig S2B is now Fig S2C, and it shows that uridine has no effect on the expression of any of the genes assayed in the new Fig 2C or S2B.</p>
<p>The reversibility of cell surface MHC-I induction was also validated in HCT116 cells (Fig 3F). We included the uridine reversal in Fig 3F to avoid duplicating the control and BQ FACS data in multiple panels.</p>
<p>We have also added the qPCR data for HCT116 cells showing this same phenotype (at the mRNA level), which is the new Fig S2D.</p>
<p>We decided to prioritize HCT116 cells for our mechanistic studies (Figures S2D, S4A, and 4E-F) because previous reports indicate that it is diploid and therefore less genetically deranged compared to our other cancer cell lines.</p>

<list-item><p>Figure 2F shows an elegant experiment to discard off-target effects related to cell death and to confirm that the increased MHC I expression is uniquely dependent on pyrimidines. DHODH has recently been involved in ferroptosis, a highly immunogenic type of cell death. What are the authorsÂ´ thoughts on BQ-induced ferroptosis as a possible contributor to the effects of ICB? Does BQ + ferroptosis inhibitor (ferrostatin) affect cell surface MHC I and/or expression of antigen processing genes?</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>The potential role of DHODH in ferroptosis protection (Mao et al 2021) has important implications, so we are glad that multiple reviewers raised questions concerning ferroptosis. We did not directly test the effect of ferroptosis inducing agents (with or without BQ) on MHC-I/APP expression, but that is certainly a worthwhile line of investigation.</p>
<p>The DHODH/ferroptosis issue is complicated by a study pointed out by Reviewer #1 that challenges the role of DHODH inhibition in BQ-mediated ferroptosis sensitization (Mishima et al, 2022). This study argues that high-dose BQ treatment causes FSP1 inhibition, and this underlies the effect of BQ on the cellular response to ferroptosis-inducing agents.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether BQ-induced ferroptosis-sensitization is dependent on DHODH, FSP1, or some other factor, the Mao and Mishima studies agree that a relatively high dose of BQ is required to observe these effects (100-200ÂµM for most cell lines and &gt;50ÂµM even in the most ferroptosis-sensitive cell lines). As we explained above, we consider it very unlikely that the in vivo BQ exposure in our experiments (Fig 5) was high enough to cause significant ferroptosis, especially in the absence of any dedicated ferroptosis-inducing agent (which is typically required to cause ferroptosis even in the presence of high-dose BQ).</p>

<list-item><p>The authors nail down the mechanism to CDK9 (Fig 4). However, all these experiments are performed in 293T cells. I would like to see a repeat of Fig. 4B in a cancer cell line (either PDAC or B16). Also, does BQ have any effect on CDK9 expression/protein levels?</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added two figure panels that address this comment (new Fig 4E and 4F). Figure 4E (which is a repeat of Fig 4B with HCT116 cells) shows that CDK9 inhibitors (flavopiridol, AT7519, and dinaciclib) reverse BQ-mediated APP induction in HCT116 cells (this agrees with Fig S4A showing that flavopiridol reverses MHC induction by various nucleotide synthesis inhibitors in this cell line), but PROTAC2 does not. Figure 4F shows that PROTAC2 (for reasons we cannot explain) does not cause CDK9 degradation in HCT116 cells. This adds further support to our thesis that CDK9 is a critical mediator of BQ-mediated APP induction (because how else can this pattern of results be explained?). The text of the Results section has been amended to reflect this.</p>
<p>We chose to use HCT116 cells for this repeat experiment 1) to align with Fig S4A and 2) because, as previously mentioned, we consider HCT116 to be a good cell line for mechanistic studies because of its relative lack of idiosyncratic genetic features (compared to CFPAC-1, for example, which was derived from a patient with cystic fibrosis).</p>

<list-item><p>What are the differences in tumor size for the experiment shown in Figure 5E? What about tumor cell death in the ICB vs. BQ+ICB groups?</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>Because this was a survival assay, direct comparisons of tumor volumes between groups was not possible at later time points, since mice that die or have to be euthanized are removed from their experimental group, which lowers the average group tumor burden at subsequent time points. Although tumor volume was the most common euthanasia criteria reached, a subset of mice were either found dead or had to be euthanized for other reasons attributed to their tumor burden (moribund state, inability to ambulate or stand, persistent bleeding from tumor ulceration, severe loss of body mass, etc.). This confounds any comparison of endpoint measurements (such as immunohistochemical quantification of tumor cell death markers, T-cell markers, etc.).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The different response in the concurrent vs delayed treatment is very interesting. The authors suggest two possible mechanisms to explain this: &quot;1) Concurrent BQ dampens the initial anticancer immune response generated by dual ICB, or b) cancer cell MHC-I and related genes are not maximally upregulated at the time of ICB administration with concurrent treatment&quot;. However, and despite the caveat of comparing the in vitro to the in vivo setting, Fig 2D shows upregulation of MHC I already at 24h of treatment in B16 cells. Have the authors checked T cell infiltration in the concurrent and delayed treatment setting?</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>For the same reasons described in response to the preceding comment, tumors harvested upon mouse death/euthanasia from our survival experiment were not suitable for cross-cohort comparison of tumor endpoint measurements. An additional experiment in which mice are necropsied at a prespecified time point (before any mice have died or reached euthanasia criteria, as in the experiment for Fig 5A-D) would be required to answer this question.</p>

<list-item><p>Page 5, line 181 -do the authors mean &quot;nucleotide salvage inhibitors&quot; instead of &quot;synthesis&quot;?</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe the reviewer is referring to the following sentence:</p>
<p>âThe other drugs screened included nucleotide synthesis inhibitors (5-fluorouracil, methotrexate, gemcitabine, and hydroxyurea), DNA damage inducers (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and cytarabine), a microtubule targeting drug (paclitaxel), a DNA methylation inhibitor (azacytidine), and other small molecule inhibitors (Fig 2F).â</p>
<p>In this context, we believe our use of âsynthesisâ instead of âsalvageâ is correct, because methotrexate and 5-FU inhibit thymidylate synthase (which mediates de novo dTTP synthesis), while gemcitabine and hydroxyurea inhibit ribonucleotide reductase (which mediates de novo synthesis of all dNTPs).</p>
