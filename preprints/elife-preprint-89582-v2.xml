<title>Abstract</title><p>Notch signalling activity regulates hematopoiesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrates alike. Parasitoid wasp infestation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae, however, requires a timely downregulation of Notch activity to allow the formation of encapsulation-active blood cells. Here we show that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CSL transcription factor Suppressor of Hairless [Su(H)] is phosphorylated at Serine 269 in response to parasitoid wasp infestation. As this phosphorylation interferes with the DNA-binding of Su(H), it reversibly precludes its activity. Accordingly, phospho-deficient <italic>Su(H)<sup>S269A</sup></italic> mutants are immune compromised. A screen for kinases involved in Su(H) phosphorylation identified Pkc53E, required for normal hematopoiesis as well as for parasitoid immune response. Genetic and molecular interactions support the specificity of the Su(H)-Pkc53E relationship. Moreover, phorbol ester treatment inhibits Su(H) activity <italic>in vivo</italic> and in human cell culture. We conclude that Pkc53E targets Su(H) during parasitic wasp infestation, thereby remodeling the blood cell population required for wasp egg encapsulation.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>This revised version includes several changes and additional data, shown in four additional Figures and nine new supplemental Figures. The additional experiments addressed questions on larval hemocyte numbers in response to parasitoid wasp infestation, including the dynamics of Notch target gene expression. The experiments showed the epistatic relationship between Notch and Su(H)S69A in the context of crystal cell formation. Moreover, we studied the expression of Pkc53E in hemocytes, and extended the analysis of potential immune deficits in the Pkc53E△28 mutant.
We changed the focus of our model from the proposed downregulation of Notch activity to that of Su(H) induced by Pkc53E-mediated phosphorylation, in the title and throughout the text, including a thorough discussion.
In detail: addition of qRT-PCR data on expression changes in hemocytes for the Notch target NRE-GFP and for atilla in response to wasp infestation (Fig. 1G). Experiment showing that Notch is epistatic to Su(H)S269A (Fig.1_S1). Inclusion of total hemocyte counts before and after wasp infestation in the various genotypes (Fig. 1_S1; Fig. 9_S1) and data on the percentage of adults hatching from non-infested larvae and pupae (Fig. 2A, Fig. 9_S1). Experimental evidence of equal Su(H)-VP16-myc expression in HeLa cells independent of PMA or STAU treatment, as well as of STAU activity on crystal cell development in larvae (Fig. 5). Inclusion of representative pictures of the various genotypes and conditions (Fig. 1_S2; Fig. 6_S2; Fig. 7_S1; Fig. 9_S2). Analysis of Pkc53E expression in hemocytes in situ and by RT-PCR (Fig. 8, Fig. 8_S1), as well as of immune deficits in the Pkc53E△28 mutant (Fig. 9).

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> harbours a sophisticated cellular immune system to fight invaders. The larval hematopoietic system comprises a circulating and sessile compartment of embryonic origin and the developing larval lymph gland, constituting a hematopoietic organ. The circulating and sessile compartment consists primarily of macrophage-like plasmatocytes, plus a small number of crystal cells involved in wound healing and melanization responses to neutralize pathogens. Both cell types differentiate from hemocyte precursors within the lymph gland as well, and they are released during pupal stages to serve the adult with immune cells. Finally, lamellocytes represent the third blood cell type in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. While merely absent in healthy animals, their formation is induced within hours of wasp infestation or wounding (reviewed in: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Letourneau et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hultmark and Andó, 2022</xref>). In fact, parasitism by endo-parasitoid wasps represents one of the most severe naturally occurring immune challenges to <italic>Drosophila</italic>, invariably causing death if not defended off properly. Parasitoid wasps deposit their egg into the live <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva, where it develops into the next wasp generation egressing from the pupa instead of a fly. Hence, wasp infestation is a life-threatening challenge to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> host, demanding an immediate immune response to overwhelm the parasite. This involves a massive increase in circulating hemocytes, and most energy resources are devoted to fight the invader. Here, lamellocytes play a critical role: they encapsulate the wasp egg and, by expressing Prophenoloxidase, induce a melanization reaction retarding further wasp development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dudzic et al. 2015</xref>; reviewed in: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Letourneau et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hultmark and Andó, 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Wasp infestation substantially remodels the composition of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> hemocyte population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cattenoz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cho et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Tattikota et al., 2020</xref>; reviewed in: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Csordás et al., 2021</xref>). There is a vast increase in plasmatocytes and intermediate precursors in both hematopoietic compartments, from which lamellocyte differentiate. This process requires the combined regulatory input of several pathways, including JAK/STAT, JNK, Toll, Notch, EGFR and INR pathways, which in fact regulate blood cell homeostasis in general (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>; Letournau et al., 2018; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Csordás et al., 2021</xref>). Simultaneous to the massive expansion of lamellocytes, crystal cells are significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Crozatier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Krzemien et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ferguson and Martinez-Agosto, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cattenoz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cho et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Tattikota et al., 2020</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Csordás et al., 2021</xref>). Crystal cells are generated both in the larval lymph gland as well as by trans-differentiation from plasmatocytes in the sessile compartment. Their formation, differentiation and survival strictly depend on Notch signalling activity (reviewed in: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Csordás et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hultmark and Andó, 2022</xref>). Lamellocyte and crystal cell lineages are mutually exclusive. Accordingly, while promoting crystal cell fate, Notch activity inhibits differentiation of lamellocytes within the lymph gland, however, is reduced upon wasp infestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Small et al., 2014</xref>). Lamellocyte induction involves the formation and sensing of reactive oxygen species triggered by wasp egg injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Nappi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Sinenko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Small et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Louradour et al., 2017</xref>; reviewed in: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Csordás et al., 2021</xref>). The molecular mechanism underlying the simultaneous crystal cell fate inhibition, however, is less well understood. Obviously, an effective and timely downregulation of Notch activity is required to fend off parasitic wasps.</p>
<p>The Notch pathway is highly conserved between invertebrates and vertebrates, where it regulates numerous cell fate decisions. Notch signals are transduced by CSL type proteins (abbreviation of human <underline>C</underline>BF1/RBPJ, <italic>Drosophila</italic> <underline>S</underline>uppressor of Hairless [Su(H)], and worm <underline>L</underline>ag1), that bind the DNA to direct transcriptional activity of Notch target genes by help of recruited cofactors (reviewed in: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Giaimo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kopan and Ilagan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Siebel and Lendahl, 2017</xref>). In the absence of Notch signals, however, CSL together with corepressors silences Notch target genes, thereby acting as a molecular switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Borggrefe and Oswald, 2009</xref>). Hence, CSL is central to Notch pathway activity as no signal transduction can occur in its absence or in the instance of a lack of DNA-binding. Earlier, we observed Su(H) phosphorylation at Serine 269 in cultured <italic>Drosophila</italic> Schneider S2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Nagel et al., 2017</xref>). Of note, Schneider S2 cells have hemocyte characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cherbas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Schneider, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Terriente-Felix et al., 2013</xref>). As a consequence of the negative charge conferred by the phosphorylation at Serine 269, Su(H) loses its affinity to the DNA, and without its DNA-binding ability, also its function as a transcriptional regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Nagel et al., 2017</xref>). Accordingly, a phospho-mimetic <italic>Su(H)<sup>S269D</sup></italic> mutant behaved like a <italic>Su(H)</italic> loss of function mutant in all respects. In contrast, the phospho-deficient <italic>Su(H)<sup>S269A</sup></italic>variant, appeared wild type at the first glance, indicating some tissue-specificity of this regulatory mechanism. In fact, the <italic>Su(H)<sup>S269A</sup></italic>allele displayed a gain of Notch activity particularly during embryonic and larval hematopoiesis with increased numbers of crystal cells in both hematopoietic compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Frankenreiter et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, we found that the general Notch antagonist Hairless is not involved in constraining crystal cell numbers, suggesting that in the context of blood cell homeostasis Notch activity is regulated by the phosphorylation of Su(H) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Maier, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Frankenreiter et al., 2021</xref>). As the same set of genes affect blood cell maintenance and differentiation in homeostasis and upon immune challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cho et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Tattikota et al., 2020</xref>), obviously phospho-mediated downregulation of Notch activity might also occur in response to parasitoid wasp infestation, allowing the formation of encapsulation active lamellocytes at the expense of crystal cells. Briefly, phosphorylation of Su(H) is an elegant mechanism to transiently curb Notch activity in the context of immune responses.</p>
<p>In this work, we followed the hypothesis that after wasp infestation, a specific kinase might be activated to phosphorylate Su(H) thereby allowing an adequate immune response. In this case, the phospho-deficient <italic>Su(H)<sup>S269A</sup></italic> allele should be immune-compromised, as it cannot respond to phosphorylation, i.e. remaining active even upon parasitism. Indeed, <italic>Su(H)<sup>S269A</sup></italic> displayed an increased sensitivity towards parasitoid wasp infestation accompanied by an increase of crystal cells at the expense of lamellocytes. Accordingly, phosphorylation of Su(H) protein was detected in infested wild type larvae but not in the <italic>Su(H)<sup>S269A</sup></italic> mutant. In a screen for kinases regulating this process, Pkc53E, the homologue of human PKCα, was identified as an important player. In agreement with a role in blood cell homeostasis, a <italic>Pkc53E<sup>Δ28</sup></italic> null mutant displayed increased crystal cell numbers. Moreover, genetic and molecular interactions between Su(H) and Pkc53E support the specificity of their relationship. Finally, <italic>Pkc53E<sup>Δ28</sup></italic> was impaired in its immune response to wasp infestation as well. Together, these data show that Su(H) is a target of Pkc53E during parasitic wasp infestation, inducing phosphorylation and subsequent downregulation of Su(H) activity to allow the mass production of lamellocytes required for wasp defense.</p>

<title>Impaired immune response to parasitoid wasps in the phospho-deficient Su(H)<sup>S269A</sup> mutant</title>
<p>Wasp infestation alters the course of hematopoiesis, as lamellocyte differentiation is massively increased at the expense of crystal cells. This process requires a timely attenuation of Notch activity that may be implemented by the phosphorylation of Su(H) at Serine 269 (S269). To test this model, we exposed control larvae and larvae of the phospho-deficient <italic>Su(H)<sup>S269A</sup></italic> variant to the parasitoid wasp <italic>Leptopilina boulardi</italic> (<italic>L. boulardi</italic>) and analysed the consequences on blood cell homeostasis around 44 hours post-infection, i.e. before lymph gland histolysis. To exclude any influence of the engineered genomic background, we used <italic>Su(H)<sup>gwt</sup></italic> for comparison, carrying a genomic wild type construct in place of the mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Praxenthaler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Frankenreiter et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Earlier we noted an excess of crystal cells in the phospho-deficient <italic>Su(H)<sup>S269A</sup></italic> allele, which we interpret as a gain of Notch activity in consequence of the inability to be downregulated by Su(H) phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Frankenreiter et al., 2021</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A,B</xref>). In agreement with this hypothesis, RNAi-mediated downregulation of <italic>Notch</italic> in hemocytes (<italic>hml</italic>::<italic>N</italic>-RNAi) resulted in a near complete loss of crystal cells. This <italic>Notch</italic> loss of function phenotype was epistatic to the <italic>Su(H)<sup>S269A</sup></italic>phenotype, i.e. the excess of crystal cells characterizing <italic>Su(H)<sup>S269A</sup></italic>was no longer observed in the combination with <italic>N-</italic>RNAi, demonstrating that Notch acted upstream of Su(H) as expected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>_ Figure supplement 1). The slightly elevated numbers in the <italic>Su(H)<sup>S269A</sup></italic> background compared to the control, however, may be due to the enlarged anlagen in the embryo unaffected by <italic>hml</italic>::<italic>N</italic>-RNAi (Fankenreiter et al., 2021). Total hemocyte numbers were slightly, albeit not significantly increased in <italic>Su(H)<sup>S269A</sup></italic> compared to the <italic>Su(H)<sup>gwt</sup></italic>control, and correspondingly, hemocyte numbers were somewhat lowered in the <italic>Su(H)<sup>S269D</sup></italic> allele (Figure 1_Figure supplement 1). This is in line with earlier observations of unchanged plasmatocyte counts in <italic>N</italic> or <italic>Su(H)</italic> mutants relative to control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Duvic et al., 2002</xref>). In response to wasp infestations, however, crystal cell numbers should drop to allow the formation of lamellocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Small et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Csordás et al., 2021</xref>). Indeed in the <italic>Su(H)<sup>gwt</sup></italic> control, both the sessile crystal cells as well as those within the larval lymph glands were significantly lessened in response to wasp infestation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A,B</xref>). In contrast, the higher crystal cell numbers in the <italic>Su(H)<sup>S269A</sup></italic> mutant larvae dropped to control-level, demonstrating the impairment of the mutant to detect this immune challenge or to respond to it (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Total hemocyte numbers, however, were similar between the genotypes independent of wasp infestation (Figure 1_Figure supplement 1).</p>

<p>Increased abundance of lamellocytes upon wasp infestation was monitored <italic>in vivo</italic> in larval hemolymph and lymph glands, using either the L1-<italic>atilla</italic>-GFP reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Honti et al., 2009</xref>) or <italic>PPO3</italic>-Gal4::UAS-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dudzic et al., 2015</xref>), respectively. In the harvested larval hemolymph of the infested <italic>Su(H)<sup>gwt</sup></italic> control, the hemocytes contained about 15% <italic>PPO3</italic>- and 23% <italic>atilla</italic>-labelled lamellocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C,D</xref>). These numbers were significantly lower in the wasp infested <italic>Su(H)<sup>S269A</sup></italic> larvae (Figure C,D). Consistently, both lamellocyte reporters were robustly induced in the lymph glands of the infested control, but rarely in glands of the <italic>Su(H)<sup>S269A</sup></italic> mutant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E,F</xref> and Figure1_supplement 2). Obviously, the <italic>Su(H)<sup>S269A</sup></italic> mutant barely responds to the immune challenge raised by the parasitic wasp infestation.</p>
<p>In order to monitor the altered immune responses at the molecular level, we quantified Notch target gene expression in the hemolymph upon wasp infestation over time. We observed a decline in the expression of the Notch reporter NRE-GFP immediately after wasp infection in the control <italic>Su(H)<sup>gwt</sup></italic>to about half the value of the uninfected larvae, dropping even further to about 30% 24-30 hours post infection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). <italic>Su(H)<sup>S269A</sup></italic> mutant larvae, however, retained a much stronger expression level at around 60-70% of the uninfected control even at the late time point. These data reveal the downregulation of Notch activity in response to wasp infestation prior or parallel to lamellocyte formation, in agreement with our model, whereby the infestation-induced phosphorylation of Su(H) impairs transmission of Notch signalling activity. Accordingly, the lamellocyte specific marker <italic>atilla</italic> bounced up nearly two magnitudes in the wasp infected <italic>Su(H)<sup>gwt</sup></italic> control at the late time point, but not in <italic>Su(H)<sup>S269A</sup></italic>compared to the uninfected control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cattenoz et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, these data support the model that S269 in Su(H) is a molecular target for a kinase, phosphorylated upon immune challenge to allow lamellocyte formation at the expense of crystal cells.</p>

<title>The phospho-deficient Su(H)<sup>S269A</sup> allele is impaired in combating wasp infestation</title>
<p>Parasitoid wasp infestation constitutes an extreme immune challenge for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva: if not combatted by the immune system, a wasp egg, which is deposited in the larval body cavity, will develop into an adult wasp, thereby killing the larval host during the pupal stage. Indeed, depending on the wasp species used, we measured a high mortality rate with less than 5% up to about 14% of surviving flies, whereas nearly all pupae hatched to adults without wasp challenge (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). According to our working hypothesis, the phospho-deficient <italic>Su(H)<sup>S269A</sup></italic> variant should not be able to properly respond to the immune challenge.

<title>Serine 269 of Su(H) is phosphorylated upon wasp infestation</title>
<p>Next, we wanted to directly monitor Su(H) phosphorylation at S269 in response to wasp infestation. To this end, polyclonal antibodies directed against a phosphorylated peptide containing the sequence motif NRLRpSQTVSTRYLHVE were generated (⍺-pS269). Specificity was first tested by Western blot analysis using bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins containing the entire beta-trefoil domain (BTD) of Su(H), as well as with phospho-mimetic (S269D) and phospho-mutant (S269A) versions. All three variants were detected by the antisera. The S269D version, however, was strongly preferred, indicating that this antibody does preferably recognize phospho-S269 Su(H) protein (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> - Figure supplement 1). Encouraged by this result, we used this antiserum on protein extracts derived from larvae infested and not infested by <italic>L. boudardi</italic>. For this experiment we used genome engineered fly strains expressing mCherry-tagged Su(H) proteins, <italic>Su(H)<sup>S269A-mCh</sup></italic> and <italic>Su(H)<sup>gwt-mCh</sup></italic>for control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Praxenthaler et al., 2017</xref>). Su(H) proteins were trapped using RFP-nanobody coupled agarose beads, and the precipitates were then probed in Western blots with antibodies directed against mCherry and pS269. Indeed, ⍺-pS269 antibodies recognized Su(H)<sup>gwt-mCh</sup> protein in wasp infested larvae, indicating respective phosphorylation of Su(H) protein. No such signals were seen in precipitates from the non-infected larvae nor from any of the <italic>Su(H)<sup>S269A-mCh</sup></italic> mutant larvae (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). These data strongly support the notion of parasitism-induced phosphorylation of Su(H) at S269. Apparently, parasitoid wasp infestation starts a cascade of events resulting in the inhibitory S269 phosphorylation of Su(H) protein to allow lamellocyte formation. Hence, the question arose on the kinase/s involved in this process.</p>

<title>Screening of kinase candidates mediating phosphorylation of Su(H) at Serine 269</title>
<p>To identify Ser/Thr kinases involved in the phosphorylation of Su(H) at S269, we commenced with a combination of <italic>in silico</italic> and biochemical approaches aiming to generate a list of candidate kinases which can be further analysed by genetic means (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). First, by using GPS 3.0 software that encompasses a substantial database of kinases and their preferred recognition motives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Xue et al., 2011</xref>), 36 potential human kinases were predicted to recognize S269 as substrate, represented by 30 kinases in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> –Table 1 supplement). In addition, the BTD domain of Su(H) was bacterially expressed as a GST fusion protein and subjected to phospho-assays using 245 different human Ser/Thr kinases. Our reasoning for using the entire BTD domain was to ensure a normal folding of the domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kovall and Blacklow, 2010</xref>), and to reduce the number of potential phospho-sites at the same time present in full length Su(H). With this approach, we ended up with 62 human Ser/Thr kinases (25% of the tested kinases) that use the BTD of Su(H) as an <italic>in vitro</italic> substrate, corresponding to 40 different kinases in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>–Table 2 supplement). Both sets of data, biochemical and bioinformatics, were used to generate a list of 44 candidates to be analysed by genetic means. The candidates were further screened for an imbalanced hematopoiesis. We reasoned that mutants affecting a relevant kinase gene involved in the phosphorylation of Su(H) should display increased crystal cell numbers similar to what was observed in the <italic>Su(H)<sup>S269A</sup></italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Frankenreiter et al., 2021</xref>). Larvae of 13 different kinase mutants, and the progeny of 44 UAS-RNAi and/or UAS-kinase dead transgenes crossed with <italic>hml</italic>-Gal4, a blood cell-specific Gal4 driver line, were tested (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> –Table 3 supplement). To this end, the larvae were subjected to heating for a visualization and quantification of sessile crystal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Rizki, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lanot et al., 2001</xref>). About a third of the kinase mutants were similar to the control, whereas mutations in four kinases impeded crystal cell development or prevented it altogether. Unexpectedly, the majority of the tested kinase mutants exhibited elevated crystal cell numbers, however to a different degree (Figure 3_Figure supplement 1, Table 4 supplement) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Deichsel et al., 2024</xref>). Nineteen kinase mutants matched closely the <italic>Su(H)<sup>S269A</sup></italic>phenotype, making those the most promising candidates to being involved in the phosphorylation of Su(H) at S<sup>269</sup>. Six of those were within the cluster of ten candidates singled out by the <italic>in silico</italic> and the <italic>in vitro</italic> screens (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> A,B). Using commercially available, activated human kinases, we were able to test five candidates, AKT1, CAMK2D, GSK3B, S6 and PKCα in vitro by MS/MS analysis on the Su(H) peptide ALFNRLR<bold>S</bold><sup>8</sup>QTVSTRY, where Serine 8 (S8) corresponds to S269 in Su(H). Only PKCα unambiguously phosphorylated the given peptide at Serine 8. Whereas GSK3B did not phosphorylate the peptide at all, AKT1, CAMK2D and S6 piloted Threonine 10, corresponding to Threonine 271 in Su(H) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, Figure 3_Figure supplement 2). Together, these data support the idea, that PKCα corresponding to Pkc53E in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, is part of the kinase network mediating the phosphorylation of Su(H) at S269.</p>

<title>Role of Pkc53E in the phosphorylation of Su(H)<sup>S269</sup></title>
<p>Confirming the MS/MS data, human PKCα was able to phosphorylate the respective Su(H) peptide (S<sup>wt</sup>) similar to its defined pseudo-substrate PS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kochs et al., 1993</xref>), whereas the S8A mutant peptide (S<sup>SA</sup>) was accepted only half as well in an ADP-Glo<sup>TM</sup> assay, indicating that S269 is a preferred substrate (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).

<title>The PKC-agonist PMA influences Su(H) activity and blood cell homeostasis</title>
<p>Our data so far indicated that Su(H) is a phospho-target of Pkc53E which reduces its activity by affecting its DNA-binding. In this case, we might expect an influence of the general PKC-activator PMA on both, Su(H) activity as well as Notch-mediated crystal cell formation. We tested the former in a <italic>RBPJ<sup>ko</sup></italic> HeLa cell system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Wolf et al., 2019</xref>), measuring Notch-reporter gene activation by Su(H)-VP16. To this end, a Su(H)-VP16 gene fusion was cloned under HSV-TK promoter control, which is unresponsive to PMA in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Shifera and Hardin, 2009</xref>). Su(H)-VP16 protein is independent of Notch activity itself, allowing to directly monitor the influence of PMA on Su(H) activity. Indeed, Su(H)-VP16 ability to activate reporter gene transcription was reduced by more than half in the presence of PMA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). This is in agreement with a PMA-mediated activation of endogenous PKC in the transfected HeLa cells, resulting in Su(H)-VP16 phosphorylation, loss of DNA-binding activity and reduced transcriptional activation. Accordingly, repression could be reverted by the addition of kinase-inhibitor Staurosporine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Karaman et al., 2008</xref>). In fact, Staurosporine alone already increased Su(H)-VP16 transcriptional activity, suggesting that inhibitory phosphorylation of Su(H) occurs in HeLa cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Expression levels of Su(H)-VP16, however, remained unchanged by the treatments (Figure 5_Figure supplement 1).</p>

<p>Next, we assayed the effect of PMA on larval crystal cell formation. If, as expected, PMA increased Pkc53E activity, Su(H) should be inactivated by phosphorylation with decreased crystal cell numbers as a consequence. We fed PMA to <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae and assayed the numbers of sessile crystal cells. In agreement with our expectations, crystal cell numbers dropped very strongly, suggesting efficient phosphorylation and inactivation of Su(H) protein by PKCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). As predicted by the above experiments, this effect was alleviated by Staurosporine. Owing to the global inhibition of kinases by Staurosporine, however, a rise in crystal cells was expected, because many kinases restrict their numbers (see Figure 3_Figure supplement 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Deichsel et al., 2024</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Su(H)<sup>S269A</sup></italic> mutant larvae displayed an increased number of crystal cells which can be attributed to the fact that here, Su(H) can no longer be phosphorylated and hence, is overactive in this context. Feeding PMA to <italic>Su(H)<sup>S269A</sup></italic> larvae caused only a minor drop of excessive crystal cell numbers, which could be due to other kinases acting on <italic>Su(H)<sup>S269</sup></italic> or due to other Pkc53E substrates involved in crystal cell development. Again, kinase inhibition by Staurosporine largely reversed this effect (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>).

<p>In any context tested, the number of crystal cells was strongly increased matching those of the <italic>Su(H)<sup>S269A</sup></italic> mutant (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, Figure 6_supplement 2). The similar phenotypes imply that Pkc53E acts through the phosphorylation of Su(H) specifically within hemocytes to restrict crystal cell differentiation. However, as outlined above, the majority of kinase mutants displayed increased crystal cell numbers, raising the possibility of a fortuitous accordance. If the increase of crystal cell numbers in <italic>Pkc53E</italic> mutants is independent of Su(H) phosphorylation, we should expect an additive effect if we combine the two mutants. The double mutants <italic>Su(H)<sup>S269A</sup> Pkc53E<sup>Δ28</sup></italic> were generated by genetic recombination; they displayed the same range of excessive crystal cell numbers as the single mutants (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A,B</xref>, Figure 7_supplement 1). Moreover, the strongly reduced number of crystal cells observed in the <italic>Su(H)<sup>S269D</sup></italic>mutant was not increased by <italic>Pkc53E<sup>Δ28</sup></italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A,B</xref>), indicating that Pkc53E indeed acts upstream of Su(H), or directly on Su(H). If the latter is the case, we may expect the two proteins to form complexes <italic>in vivo</italic>. Indeed, we could co-precipitate Su(H)-Pkc53E protein complexes, both from <italic>Drosophila</italic> heads containing hemocytes (Sanchez <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Bosch et al., 2019</xref>), as well as from the larval hemolymph (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C,D</xref>). Specific co-precipitation was eased by using fly strains expressing m-Cherry tagged Su(H) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Praxenthaler et al., 2017</xref>) and HA-tagged Pkc53E, respectively. Together, these data demonstrate that <italic>Pkc53E</italic> has an important role in blood cell homeostasis that can be largely explained by its activity to phosphorylate Su(H), thereby regulating the activity of Notch target genes during hemocyte and lymph gland development.</p>

<title>Pkc53E mutants are immune compromised</title>
<p>According to our hypothesis, Pkc53E phosphorylates Su(H) in response to an immune challenge by parasitic wasp infestation. In fact, a Pkc53E-eGFP fusion protein expressed from the <italic>Pkc53E</italic> locus via protein trap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lee et al., 2018</xref>) was observed in the cytoplasm of all blood cell types independent of wasp infestation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Pkc53E</italic> mRNA was expressed of Pkc53E function should affect the ability of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae to fight wasp infestations similarly to the <italic>Su(H)<sup>S269A</sup></italic> mutant. This was indeed the case. Firstly, the <italic>Pkc53E<sup>τι28</sup></italic> null mutant was likewise impaired in fighting an infestation with the wasp <italic>A. japonica</italic> as was the <italic>Su(H)<sup>S269A</sup></italic>mutant or the double mutant <italic>Su(H)<sup>S269A</sup> Pkc53E<sup>τι28</sup></italic> with only about 4% surviving flies versus 14% in the control (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref>). In contrast to <italic>Su(H)<sup>S269A</sup></italic>, however, the <italic>Pkc53E<sup>τι28</sup></italic> mutant larvae contained significantly lower hemocyte numbers independent of infestation, perhaps partly explaining the poor immune response (Figure 9_supplement S1) (McGonigle et al., 2022). Without infestation, however, <italic>Pkc53E<sup>τι28</sup></italic> mutant larvae developed normally to adulthood (Figure 9_supplement S1). Moreover, when <italic>Pkc53E<sup>τι28</sup></italic> was infested with the parasitic wasp <italic>L. boulardi</italic>, lamellocyte numbers in the hemolymph did not reach wild type levels, and they were almost absent from the larval lymph glands (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B,C</xref>). Apparently, the <italic>Pkc53E<sup>τι28</sup></italic> null mutant is impaired in recognizing parasitic wasp infestation or is hampered responding to it, for example by the phosphorylation of Su(H), demonstrating the involvement of this kinase in the immune response of <italic>Drosophila</italic> to parasitoid wasp infestation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The Notch pathway is highly conserved between invertebrates and vertebrates, with regard to both the underlying molecular principles as well as the biological processes it is involved, including hematopoiesis and immune defence. During mammalian hematopoiesis, Notch plays a fundamental role in stem cell maintenance and proliferation as well as in the differentiation of blood cell precursors, notably in T-cell development. Accordingly, aberrant Notch signalling activity has profound consequences for blood cell homeostasis that may result in leukemia (reviewed in: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Radtke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Siebel and Lendahl, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gallenstein et al., 2023</xref>). Hence, the principles of the regulation of Notch signalling activity are of great interest.</p>
<p>Notch signals are transduced by CSL-type DNA-binding proteins that are pivotal to Notch pathway activity, as no signal transduction could occur in their absence or in the instance of a lack of DNA-binding. CSL proteins are extremely well conserved. They act as a molecular switch, either activating or repressing Notch target genes, depending on the recruited cofactors. Upon ligand binding, the Notch receptor is cleaved, and the biologically active Notch intracellular domain assembles an activator complex with CSL and further co-factors. In the absence of Notch receptor activation, however, CSL recruits co-repressors for gene silencing; in <italic>Drosophila</italic> repressor complex formation is mediated by Hairless (reviewed in: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Maier, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Borggrefe and Oswald, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kovall and Blacklow, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bray, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Giaimo et al., 2021</xref>). Accordingly, a loss of DNA-binding by CSL is expected to affect both, the activation of Notch targets in the presence, as well as their repression in the absence of Notch signals. This dual effect was observed the context of wing development in cells homozygous for the DNA-binding defective <italic>Su(H)<sup>S269D</sup></italic>variant: a failure of Notch target gene expression in areas of high Notch activity, as well as a de-repression of Notch target genes in areas outside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Frankenreiter et al., 2021</xref>). Phosphorylation of Su(H) hence entails not only the inhibition of Notch activity, but likewise a de-regulation of genes silenced by Su(H)-repressor complexes. Previously, we have shown that the regulation of Notch activity during hemocyte differentiation is independent of Hairless, but rather relies on the phosphorylation of Su(H) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Frankenreiter et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, Notch activity needs to be downregulated before lamellocyte formation during parasitism, arguing for an inhibition of Notch activity rather than a de-repression of Notch target genes resulting from Su(H) phosphorylation during wasp parasitism.</p>
<p>Studies of <italic>Drosophila</italic> hematopoiesis have uncovered a pleiotropic role of Notch in all the hematopoietic compartments, where Notch activity needs to be precisely regulated to ensure blood cell homeostasis (reviewed in: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Csordás et al., 2021</xref>). During blood cell formation, Notch directs the crystal cell lineage. Accordingly, a downregulation of Notch activity causes a loss of crystal cells, whereas a gain of Notch activity results in increased numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Duvic et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lebestky et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Terriente-Felix et al., 2013</xref>; Gosh et al., 2015; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Frankenreiter et al., 2021</xref>). In our earlier work, we have shown that the phosphorylation at S269 in the beta-trefoil domain of Su(H) impairs DNA-binding activity, and hence the capability of Su(H) to act as a transcriptional regulator in the context of blood cell development, without affecting Su(H) protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Nagel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Frankenreiter et al., 2021</xref>). Accordingly, phospho-deficient <italic>Su(H)<sup>S269A</sup></italic> mutants develop an excess of crystal cells. Now we provide evidence that Su(H) phosphorylation is likewise involved in parasitoid wasp defense, pointing to a dual use of the Notch pathway in blood cell homeostasis as well as in stress response, which is typical for the myeloid system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>The primary cellular immune response of <italic>Drosophila</italic> to fight parasitoid wasp infestation is an encapsulation of the parasite egg to terminate its further development. Albeit metabolically extremely costly, <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae have to remodel their entire hematopoietic system to generate the masses of lamellocytes required for the encapsulation (reviewed in Letournau et al., 2016; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kim-Jo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Csordás et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hultmark &amp; Andó, 2022</xref>). There are two major sources for the lamellocytes. One is the transdifferentiation of circulating plasmatocytes, released from the sessile compartment and proliferating upon immune challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Márkus et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Honti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Stofanko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Vanha-Aho et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anderl et al., 2016</xref>). Second is a massive expansion of prohemocytes in the lymph gland followed by a differentiation to lamellocytes and their release due to the premature disintegration of the gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lanot et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Sorrentino et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Louradour et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cho et al., 2020</xref>). Wasp infestation hence provokes a biased commitment to the lamellocyte lineage at the expense of crystal cells, as the two lineages are mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Krzemien et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Tattikota et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cho et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cattenoz et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>The processes underlying the <italic>Drosophila</italic> immune response to wasp parasitism are well-understood, sharing many molecular details with the inflammatory responses of vertebrates (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Letourneau et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kim-Jo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kharrat et al., 2022</xref>). Interestingly, sterile injury of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae initiates a likewise immune response covering all aspects of wasp-mediated immune challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Evans et al., 2022</xref>). The epidermal penetration by the wasp ovipositor causes a burst of hydrogen peroxide at the injury site via the activation of the NADPH oxidase DUOX. The oxidative stress then induces a systemic activation of Toll/NF-κB and JNK-signalling within circulating hemocytes as well as within the cells of the posterior signalling center of the lymph gland. Following cytokine release, JAK/STAT and EGFR signalling pathways are activated non-cell autonomously driving the (trans-)differentiation of (pro-)hemocytes to lamellocyte fate and lymph gland dispersal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Nappi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Schlenke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Sinenko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gueguen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Razzell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Louradour et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chakrabarti and Visweswariah, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Evans et al., 2022</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Letourneau et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>). Whereas the switch to lamellocyte fate is well elaborated, less is known about the processes underlying the simultaneous suppression of crystal cell fate. Obviously, this step requires a downregulation of Notch signalling activity, as the Notch pathway is instrumental to crystal cell fate in all the hematopoietic compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Duvic et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lebestky et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Schlenke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Small et al., 2014</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>). Our work now reveals that a parasitoid wasp attack causes a phosphorylation of Su(H) on S269 as means of an efficient and reversible way to inhibit Notch activity. This idea is consistent with earlier observations, whereby wasp parasitism quenched the expression of a Su(H)-lacZ reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Small et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, we provide evidence that Pkc53E is involved in Su(H) phosphorylation during blood cell development as well as during parasitoid wasp-defense in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Moreover, the involvement of PKCs in wasp defense is not completely unexpected given their well-documented role in the immune responses of mammals and <italic>Drosophila</italic> alike. For example, <italic>Drosophila</italic> flies ensure a healthy gut-microbiota homeostasis by modulating DUOX activity as a pathogen-specific defense line (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kim and Lee, 2014</xref>). DUOX activation and ROS production, induced by gut pathogens was shown to be mediated by Pkc53E and Ca<sup>2+</sup> via phospholipase Cβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Ha et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). Sterile wounding of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo triggers an instantaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> flash followed by hydrogen peroxide production (Razzel et al., 2013). It is conceivable that the epidermal breach by the wasp’s sting similarly induces a Ca<sup>2+</sup> flash that may spark Pkc53E activation as a result. However, PKCs may be activated directly by oxidative modification even in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Moreover, they may promote endogenous ROS production in a positive feedback loop (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cosentino-Gomes et al., 2012</xref>), that could support the systemic response in the larval lymph gland.</p>
<p>The role of PKCs in the mammalian hematopoietic and immune systems is well documented. PKCs in this context act redundantly, and presumably, this holds also true for <italic>Drosophila</italic> where several PKCs exist. Upon activation, PKCs may translocate into the nuclear compartment, where they can directly influence gene expression programs, for example by piloting chromatin factors as substrates, pivotal for regulating immune cell differentiation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Lim et al., 2015</xref>). Whereas <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pkc53E appears primarily cytoplasmic, its nuclear presence in some hemocytes is consistent with acting directly on Su(H) once activated (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). Phosphorylation, however, may occur also at the membrane or in the cytoplasm, since Su(H) is imported into the nucleus together with its co-regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Wolf et al., 2019</xref>). PKCs, including PKCα, are present in CD34+ long-term hematopoietic stem cells. Moreover, specific roles in both the myeloid and the multilymphoid lineages are known. Notably, some PKC isoforms including PKCα may play a role in Notch-dependent T-cell development. Notch pathway activity is indispensable for T-cell lineage commitment of early thymic progenitors, however, is rapidly downregulated after the β-selection phase. As treatment with phorbol ester upregulates the transcription of TCRα and β chains, a role of PKC in Notch-dependent commitment of αβ T-cells has been proposed (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Altman and Kong, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Yui and Rothenberg, 2014</xref>). During initial T-cell development, Notch1 signalling increases in intensity, however,is abruptly downregulated at the transcriptional level following β-selection. This rapid downregulation is mediated by the inhibition of the E proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Yashiro-Ohtani et al., 2009</xref>), however, might in addition involve the phosphorylation of CSL by PKCα. Cell fate in more mature thymocytes is then fixed by the silencing of Notch target genes through chromatin modulators (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Yui and Rothenberg, 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Appropriate silencing of Notch signalling activity in the course of T-cell development is of utmost importance, as prolonged Notch activity during β-selection predisposes the T-cells to leukemic transformation. Phosphorylation of CSL proteins by PKCα kinase offers a way for a timely and reversible deactivation of Notch signals not only in <italic>Drosophila</italic> but also in the mammalian system. In fact, the amino acid sequences harbouring the respective Serine residue in the CSL beta-trefoil domain are completely conserved between vertebrates and invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Wilson and Kovall, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Nagel et al., 2017</xref>), raising the possibility of a likewise regulatory mechanism in mammalian hematopoiesis and immunity. Indeed, respective phosphorylation of the human CSL protein at the homologous position S195 was observed in human embryonic stem cells, where differentiation was induced by phorbol ester treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Rigbolt et al., 2011</xref>), consistent with an involvement of PKCs in this context as well. In conclusion, our work uncovers an important role for PKC-mediated downregulation of CSL activity, thereby ensuring blood cell homeostasis and an appropriate immune response to parasitoid wasp infestation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Future work may uncover, whether similar mechanisms apply to mammalian hematopoiesis and immunity as well.</p>

A fourth of the hemolymph was distributed in six Pap-pen wells of about 2 mm diameter. To ease staging and to avoid overcrowding, 4 h egg collections were used, and larvae developed in batches of about 100 animals at 25°C until wandering third instar larval stage (ca. 120 h after egg laying (AEL)). In case of wasp challenge, staged early L3 larvae were infested (ca. 90 h AEL) and bled 20-32 h thereafter to determine total hemocyte numbers. Only larvae containing wasp eggs were examined. GFP-positive hemocytes were visualized by epi-fluorescence microscopy on an Axioskop II (Zeiss, Jena), pictured with an EOS 700D camera (Canon, Japan).

<p>The authors previously showed in cell culture that Su(H), the transcription factor mediating Notch pathway activity in Drosophila, was phosphorylated on S269 and they found that a phospho-deficient Su(H) allele behaves as a moderate gain of Notch activity in flies, notably during blood cell development. Since downregulation of Notch signaling is important for the production of specialized blood cell types (lamellocytes) in response to wasp parasitism, the authors hypothesized that Su(H) phosphorylation might be involved in this cellular immune response.</p>
<p>
Consistent with their hypothesis, the authors now show that Su(H)S269A knock-in flies display a reduced response to wasp parasitism and that Su(H) is phosphorylated upon infestation. Using in vitro kinase assays and a genetic screen, they identify the PKCa family member Pkc53E as the putative kinase involved in Su(H) phosphorylation and they show that Pkc53E can bind Su(H). They further show that Pkc53E deficit or its knock-down in larval blood cells results in similar blood cell phenotypes as Su(H)S269A and their epistatic analyses indicate that Pkc53E acts upstream of Su(H). Finally, they show that Pkc53E mutants aslo display a compromised immune response to wasp parasitism.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>The manuscript is well presented and the experiments are sound, with a good combination of genetic and biochemical approaches and several clear phenotypes backing the main conclusions. Notably Su(H)S269A mutation strongly reduces lamellocyte production. Moreover, the epistatic data are convincing, notably concerning the relationship between Notch/Su(H) and Pkc53E for crystal cell production.</p>
<p>
Even though it is not fully established, the overall model is credible and interesting. In addition, it opens further avenues of research to study the activation of Pkc in response to an immune challenge.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>Apparently, the hypothesis that Pkc53E is required for Su(H) phosphorylation in vivo could not be directly tested due to the lack of an appropriate tool (the specificity and sensitivity of the current anti-pS269 antibody was insufficient).</p>
<p>
Also, the poor immune response of Pkc53E mutant might rather be linked to their constitutively reduced circulating blood cell number than to a deficit in Notch/Su(H) down-regulation following wasp infestation.</p>

<p>The current draft by Deischel et.al., describes the role of Pkc53E in the phosphorylation of Su(H) to down regulate its transcriptional activity to mount a successful immune response upon parasitic wasp-infection. Overall, I find the study interesting and relevant especially the identification of Pkc53E in phosphorylation of Su(H) is very nice. The authors have proved the central idea linking phosphorylation of Su(H) via Pkc53E to implying its modulation of Notch activity to mount a robust immune response is now well addressed in its entirety and I find the paper indeed very interesting.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>The authors have addressed all pending concerns and I have no further comments. I indeed complement the authors for their wonderful piece of work.</p>

<p>Diechsel et al. provide important and valuable insights into how Notch signaling is shut down in response to parasitic wasp infestation in order to suppress crystal cell fate and favor lamellocyte production. The study shows that CSL transcription factor Su(H) is phosphorylated at S269A in response to parasitic wasp infestation and this inhibitory phosphorylation is critical for shutting down Notch. The authors go on to perform a screen for kinases responsible for this phosphorylation and have identified Pkc53E as the specific kinase acting on Su(H) at S269A. Using analysis of mutants, RNAi and biochemistry-based approaches the authors convincingly show how Pkc53E-Su(H) interaction is critical for remodeling hematopoiesis upon wasp challenge. I find the study interesting, and the data presented supports the overall conclusions made by the authors. The authors have addressed all my comments satisfactorily in the revised submission.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is well presented, and the conclusions made are backed by genetic, biochemical and molecular biology-based approaches. Overall, the authors convincingly demonstrate how Pkc53E mediated phosphorylated of Su(H) shuts down Notch signaling during wasp infestation in Drosophila.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The exact molecular trigger for activation of Pkc53E is still uncharacterized and it would be interesting to know how Pkc53E gets activated during wasp infestation and whether Pkc53E gets activated turning down Notch in other stress induced scenarios.</p>
<p>The authors have addressed comments satisfactorily. Overall, I think the findings are interesting and would be useful to the field of developmental biology and immunology and address an important gap in the field. The most significant conclusion from the work is how Notch acts as a molecular switch during parasitic wasp infestation.</p>

Since a downregulation of Notch signaling was proposed to be important for the production of a specialized blood cell types (lamellocytes) in response to wasp parasitism, the authors hypothesized that Su(H) phosphorylation might be involved in this cellular immune response.</p>
<p>Consistent with their hypothesis, the authors show that Su(H)S269A knock-in flies display a reduced response to wasp parasitism and that Su(H) is phosphorylated upon infestation. Using in vitro kinase assays and a genetic screen, they identify the PKCa family member Pkc53E as the putative kinase involved in Su(H) phosphorylation and they show that Pkc53E can bind Su(H). They further show that Pkc53E deficit or its knock-down in larval blood cells results in similar blood cell phenotypes as Su(H)S269A, including a reduced response to wasp parasitism, and their epistatic analyses indicate that Pkc53E acts upstream of Su(H).</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>The manuscript is well presented and the experiments are sound, with a good combination of genetic and biochemical approaches and several clear phenotypes which back the main conclusions. Notably Su(H)S269A mutation or Pkc53E deficiency strongly reduces lamellocyte production and the epistatic data are convincing.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>The phenotypic analysis of larval blood cells remains rather superficial. Looking at melanized cells is a crude surrogate to quantify crystal cell numbers as it is biased toward sessile cells (with specific location) and does not bring information concerning the percentage of blood cells differentiated along this lineage.</p>
<p>In Su(H)S269A knock-in or Pkc53E zygotic mutants, the increase in crystal cells in uninfected conditions and the decreased capacity to induce lamellocytes following infection could have many origins which are not investigated. For instance, premature blood cell differentiation could promote crystal cell differentiation and reduce the pool of lamellocytes progenitors. These mutations could also affect the development and function of the posterior signaling center in the lymph gland, which plays a key role in lamellocyte induction.</p>
<p>Similarly, the mild decrease on resistance to wasp infestation (Fig. 2A) could reflect a constitutive reduction in blood cell numbers in Su(H)S269A larvae rather than a defective down-regulation of Notch activity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully agree with the reviewer that sessile crystal cells counts are a coarse approach to capture hemocytes. However, they allowed the screening of numerous genotypes in the course of our kinase candidate screen. We recorded the hemocyte numbers in the various genetic backgrounds and with regard to wasp infestation. There was no significant difference between Su(H)S269A and Su(H)gwt control, independent of infection. This is in agreement with earlier observations of unchanged plasmatocyte numbers in <italic>N</italic> or <italic>Su(H)</italic> mutants compared to the wild type (Duvic et al., 2002). We noted, however, a small drop in hemocyte numbers in Su(H)S269D and a strong one in Pkc53ED28 mutants in both conditions relative to control. Presumably, Pkc53E has a more general role in blood cell development, which we have not further analysed. The results were included in new Figure 1_S1 and Figure 9_S1 supplements. Based on the link between hemocyte numbers and wasp resistance (e.g. McGonigle et al., 2017), we cannot exclude that the lowered resistance of Pkc53ED28 mutants regarding wasp attacks is partly due to reduced hemocyte numbers, albeit we did not see significant differences between either Su(H)S269A, nor Pkc53ED28 nor the double mutant. We have included this notion in the text.</p>
<p>Lamellocytes arise in response to external challenges like parasitoid wasp infestation by trans-differentiation from larval plasmatocytes, and by maturation of lamellocyte precursors in the lymph gland, yet barely in the Su(H)S269A and Pkc53ED28 mutants.</p>
<p>We find it hard to envisage, however, that a premature differentiation of plasmatocytes into crystal cells in our case could deplete the pool of lamellocyte progenitors in the hemolymph. (Is there a precedent?). Crystal cells make up about 5% of the hemocyte pool; they are increased max. 2 fold in the Su(H)S269A and Pkc53E mutants. Even if these extra crystal cells (now  ̴10%) had arisen by premature differentiation, there should be still enough plasmatocytes (̴ 80%) remaining with a potential to further divide and transdifferentiate into lamellocytes.</p>
<p>Indeed, we cannot exclude an effect of the Su(H)S269A mutant on the development and function of the posterior signaling center of the lymph gland. We noted, however, a slight but significant enlargement of the PS in the Su(H)S269A mutant, that to our understanding cannot explain the reduced lamellocyte numbers.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Whereas the authors also present targeted-knock down/inhibition of Pkc53E suggesting that this enzyme is required in blood cells to control crystal cell fate (Fig. 6), it is somehow misleading to use lz-GAL4 as a driver in the lymph gland and hml-GAL4 in circulating hemocytes as these two drivers do not target the same blood cell populations/steps in the crystal cell development process.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully agree with the reviewer that the two driver lines target different blood cell populations/ steps in hematopoiesis. The <italic>hml</italic>-Gal4 driver is regarded pan-hemocyte, common to both plasmatocytes and pre-crystal cells (e.g. Tattikota et al., 2020). It has been reported to drive specifically within differentiated hemocytes prior to or at the stage of crystal cells commitment (Mukherjee et al., 2011). Hence, <italic>hml</italic>-Gal4 appeared suitable to hit sessile and circulating hemocytes prior to final differentiation into crystal cells or lamellocytes, respectively.</p>
<p>In the lymph gland, however, <italic>hml</italic> is expressed within the cortical zone, where it appears specific to the plasmatocytes lineage, and not present in the crystal cell precursors (Blanco-Obregon et al., 2020). In contrast, <italic>lz</italic>-Gal4 is specific to the differentiating crystal cells in both lineages, i.e. in circulating and sessile hemocytes and in the lymph gland. Hence, we choose <italic>lz</italic>-Gal4 instead of <italic>hml</italic>-Gal4 at the risk of driving markedly later in the course of crystal cell differentiation. We included the reasoning in the text. Overall, we feel that this choice does not limit our conclusions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In addition, the authors do not present evidence that Pkc55E function (and Su(H) phosphorylation) is required specifically in blood cells to promote lamellocyte production in response to infestation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have tried to address this interesting question by several means. Firstly, we show that Pkc53E is indeed expressed in the various cell types of larval hemocytes, shown in a new Figure 8 and Figure 8_S1 supplement. I.e., there is the potential of Pkc53E to promote lamellocyte formation. Moreover, RNAi-mediated downregulation of Pkc53E within hemocytes affected crystal cell formation similar to the Pkc53ED28 mutant, in agreement with a specific requirement within blood cells (Figure 6). Finally, we show a major drop in Notch target gene transcription (NRE-GFP) in response to wasp infestation within isolated hemocytes from Su(H)gwt in contrast to Su(H)S269A larvae (see new Figure 1 G). These data show that Su(H)-mediated Notch activity must be downregulated in hemocytes prior to lamellocyte formation in agreement with our hypothesis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Finally, the conclusion that Pkc53E is (directly) responsible for Su(H) phosophorylation needs to be strengthened. Most importantly, the authors do not demonstrate that Pkc53E is required for Su(H) phosphorylation in vivo (i.e. that Su(H) is not phosphorylated in the absence of Pkc53E following infestation).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would very much like to show respective results. Unfortunately, the low affinity of our pS269 antibody does not allow any in situ or in vivo experiments. We very much hope to obtain a more specific phosphoS269-Su(H) antibody allowing us further in situ studies, and show, for example co-localization with Pkc53E.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In addition, the in vitro kinase assays with bacterially purified Pkc53E (in the presence of PMA or using an activated variant of Pkc53E) only reveal a weak activity on a Su(H) peptide encompassing S269 (Fig. 4).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer correctly notes the poor activity of our purified Pkc53EEDDD kinase. This low activity also holds true for the standard peptide (PS), which in fact is even less well accepted than the Swt substrate. Indeed, the commercially available PKCα is a magnitude more active. Whether this reflects the poor quality of our isolated protein compared to the commercial PKCα, or whether it reflects a true biochemical property of Pkc53E remains to be shown in the future. We noted this observation in the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Moreover, while the authors show a coIP between an overexpressed Pkc53E and endogenous Su(H) (Fig. 7) (in the absence of infestation), it has recently been reported that Pkc53E is a cytoplasmic protein in the eye (Shieh et al. 2023), calling for a direct assessment of Pkc53E expression and localization in larval blood cells under normal conditions and upon infestation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, it is interesting that a Pkc53E-GFP fusion protein is cytoplasmic in the eye. The construct reported by Shieh et al. however, i.e. the B-isoform, is preferentially expressed in photoreceptors, where it regulates the de-polymerization of the actin cytoskeleton.</p>
<p>Due to the eye-specific expression, we unfortunately cannot use the Pkc53E-B-GFP construct to test for Pkc53E’s distribution in other tissues.</p>
<p>As this construct is of little use for studying hematopoiesis, we have instead used Pck53E-GFP (BL59413) derived from a protein trap: again, GFP is primarily seen in the cytoplasm of hemocytes, including lamellocytes of infected larvae. However, in a small number of hemocytes, GFP appears to be also nuclear (Fig. 8A), leaving the possibility that activated Pkc53E may localize to the nucleus, eventually phosphorylating Su(H) and downregulating Notch activity. As Su(H) enters the nucleus piggy-back with NICD, however, phosphorylation may as well occur at the membrane or within the cytoplasm. We note, however, that these hypotheses require a much more detailed analysis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Furthermore, the effect of the PKCa agonist PMA on Su(H)-induced reporter gene expression in cell culture and crystal cell number in vivo is somehow consistent with the authors hypothesis, but some controls are missing (notably western blots to show that PMA/Staurosporine treatment does not affect Su(H)-VP16 level) and it is unclear why STAU treatment alone promotes Su(H)-VP16 activity (in their previous reports, the authors found no difference between Su(H)S269A-VP16 and Su(H)-VP16) or why PMA treatment still has a strong impact on crystal cell number in Su(H)S269A larvae.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added a Western blot showing that the treatment does not affect Su(H)-VP16 expression levels (Figure 5_supplement 1). As STAU is a general kinase inhibitor, it may obviate any inhibitory phosphorylation of Su(H)-VP16 in the HeLa cells, e.g. that by Akt1, CAMK2D or S6K which pilot T271, phosphorylation of which is expected to affect the DNA-binding of Su(H) as well (Figure 3_supplement 2). Moreover, in the previous report, we used different constructs with regard to the promoter, and we used RBPJ instead of Su(H), which may explain some of the discrepancies. As PMA is not specific to just Pkc53E, the altered crystal cell numbers may result from the influence on other kinases involved in blood cell homeostasis, as predicted by our genetic screen (Figure 3_supplement 1).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The authors should provide a more elaborate examination of larval blood cell types and blood cell counts under normal conditions and following infestation in the different zygotic mutants as well as upon Pkc53 knock-down. A thorough examination of PSC integrity should be performed and the maintenance of core blood cell progenitors examined. The authors should also clarify when after infestation the LG and larval bleeds are analyzed.</p>
<p>- a more elaborate examination of larval blood cell types:</p>
<p>- examination of larval blood cell counts under normal conditions: hemocyte # in gwt, SA, SD, &amp; Pkc</p>
<p>- examination of larval blood cell counts after infestation: hemocyte # in gwt, SA, SD, &amp; Pkc</p>
<p>- thorough examination  of PSC integrity: in gwt, SA, SD, &amp; Pkc</p>
<p>- thorough examination of blood cell progenitors: in gwt, SA, SD, &amp; Pkc</p>
<p>- clarify timing</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Hemocyte numbers of the various genotypes and conditions were recorded and are presented in Figure 1_S1 and Figure 9_S1. Timing was elaborated in the text and the Methods section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors should clarify why they use lz-GAL4 or hml-GAL4 and what we can infer from using these different drivers.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>See above. The reasoning was included in the text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The percentage of hatching of Su(H)S269A and Su(H)gwt flies in the absence of infestation should also be scored; a small decrease in Su(H)S269A viability might explain the observed differences in survival to wasp infestation. Absolute blood cell numbers (in the absence of infestation) have also been correlated with survival to infection and should be checked.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Percentage of the emerging flies and hemocyte numbers in the absence of infestation were recorded and included in Figure 2, Figure 1_S1, Figure 9_S1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Whereas the impact of Su(H)S269A or Pkc53E mutation on lamellocytes production is clear, there is still a substantial reduction in crystal cell production following infestation. So I wouldn't conclude that the Su(H) larvae are &quot;unable&quot; to detect this immune challenge or respond to it (line 116).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the hint, we corrected the text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The expression and localization of Pkc53E in larval blood cells should be investigated, for instance using the Pkc53E-GFP line recently published by Shieh et al. (or at least at the RNA level).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Firstly, we confirmed expression of Pkc53E in hemocytes by RT-PCR (Figure 8_S1 supplement). Secondly, expression of Pkc53E-GFP was monitored in hemocytes (Figure 8). To this end, we used the protein trap (BL59413), since the one published by Shieh et al., 2023 is restricted to photoreceptors.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) It would be interesting to test the anti-pS269 antibody in immunostaining (using Su(H)S269A as negative control).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Unfortunately, the pS269 antiserum does not work in situ at all.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) The authors must perform a western blot with anti-pS269 in Pkc53e mutant to show that Su(H) is not phosphorylated anymore after wasp infestation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The blot gives a negative result.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) It is surprising that no signal is seen in the absence of infestation with anti-pS269: the fact that Su(H)S269A have more crystal cells suggest that there is a constitutive level of phosphorylation of Su(H).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully agree: In the ideal world, we would expect a low level of S269 phosphorylation in the wild type as well. However, given the lousy specificity of our antibody, we were happy to see phospho-Su(H) in infected larvae. We are currently working hard to get a better antibody.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) The authors should check Su(H)-VP16 levels and phosphorylation status after PMA and/or staurosporine treatment. Some clarifications are also needed to explain the impact of PMA in Su(H)S269 larvae (this clearly suggests that PKC has other substrates implicated in crystal cell development).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Su(H)-VP16 expression levels were monitored by Western blot and were not altered conspicuously (Figure 5_1 supplement). Presumably, Pkc53E is not the only kinase involved in Su(H) phosphorylation or the transduction of stress signals. Moreover, PMA may have a more general effect on larval development and hematopoiesis affecting both genotypes. We included this reasoning in the text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) Concerning the redaction, the authors forgot to mention and discuss the work of Cattenoz et al. (EMBO J 2020). The presentation of the screen for kinase candidates could be streamlined and better illustrated (notably supplement table 4, which would be easier to grasp as a figure/graph). The discussion could be shortened (notably the part on T cells), and I don't really understand lines 374-376 (why is it consistent?).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are sorry for omitting Cattenoz et al. 2020, which we have now included. We fully agree that this paper is of utmost importance to our work. We streamlined the screen and included a new figure in addition to table 4 summarizing the results graphically (Figure 3_S1 supplement). We cut on the T cell part and omitted the strange lines.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The current draft by Deischel et.al., entitled &quot;Inhibition of Notch activity by phosphorylation of CSL in response to parasitization in Drosophila&quot; decribes the role of Pkc53E in the phosphorylation of Su(H) to downregulate its transcriptional activity to mount a successful immune response upon parasitic wasp-infection. Overall, I find the study interesting and relevant especially the identification of Pkc53E in phosphorylation of Su(H) is very nice. However, I have a number of concerns with the manuscript which are central to the idea that link the phosphorylation of Su(H) via Pkc53E to implying its modulation of Notch activity. I enlist them one by one subsequently.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>I find the study interesting and relevant especially because of the following:</p>
<p>(1) The identification of Pkc53E in phosphorylation of Su(H) is very interesting.</p>
<p>(2) The role of this interaction in modulating Notch signaling and thereafter its requirement in mounting a strong immune response to wasp infection is also another strong highlight of this study.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Epistatic interaction with Notch is needed: In the entire draft, the authors claim Pkc53E role in the phosphorylation of Su(H) is down-stream of notch activity. Given the paper title also invokes Notch, I would suggest authors show this in a direct epistatic interaction using a Notch condition. If loss of Notch function makes many more lamellocytes and GOF makes less, then would modulating Pkc53E (and SuH)) in this manifest any change? In homeostasis as well, given gain of Notch function leads to increased crystal cells the same genetic combinations in homeostasis will be nice to see.</p>
<p>While I understand that Su(H) functions downstream of Notch, but it is now increasingly evident that Su(H) also functions independent of Notch. An epistatic relationship between Notch and Pkc will clarify if this phosphorylation event of Su(H) via Pkc is part of the canonical interaction being proposed in the manuscript and not a non-canoncial/Notch pathway independent role of Su(H).</p>
<p>This is important, as I worry that in the current state, while the data are all discussed inlight of Notch activity, any direct data to show this affirmatively is missing. In our hands we do find Notch independent Su(H) function in immune cells, hence this is a suggestion that stems from our own personal experience.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The role of Notch in <italic>Drosophila</italic> hematopoiesis, notably during crystal cell development in both hematopoietic compartments is well established; likewise the role of Su(H) as integral signal transducer in this context (e.g. Duvic et al., 2002). Not only promotes Notch activity crystal cell fate by upregulating target genes, at the same time it prevents adopting the alternative plasmatocyte fate (e.g. Terriente-Felix et al., 2013). We could confirm the downregulation of Notch target gene expression in response to wasp infestation by qRT-PCR, which was discovered earlier by Small et al. (2014). This is clearly in favor of a repression of Notch activity rather than a relief of inhibition by Su(H). A ligand-independent activation of Notch signaling has been uncovered in the context of crystal cell maintenance in the lymph gland involving Sima/Hif-α, including Su(H) as transcriptional mediator (Mukherjee et al., 2011). However, we are unaware of a respective Su(H) activity independent of Notch.</p>
<p>Certainly, Su(H) acts independently of Notch in terms of gene repression. Here, Su(H) forms a repressor complex together with H and co-repressors Groucho and CtBP to silence Notch target genes. Accordingly, loss of Su(H) or H may induce the upregulation of respective gene expression independent of Notch activity. This has been demonstrated, for example, during wing and heart development (Klein et al., 2000; Kölzer, Klein, 2006; Panta et al., 2020). Moreover, during axis formation of the early embryo, global repression is brought about by Su(H) and relieved by activated Notch (Koromila, Stathopolous, 2019). In all these instances, Su(H) is thought to act as a molecular switch, and the activation of Notch causes a strong expression of the respective genes. Likewise, the loss of DNA-binding resulting from the phosphorylation of Su(H) allows the upregulation of repressed Notch target genes in wing imaginal discs, e.g. <italic>dpn</italic>, as we have demonstrated before with overexpression and clonal analyses (Nagel et al. 2017; Frankenreiter et al., 2021). However, H does not contribute to crystal cell homeostasis, i.e. de-repression of Notch target genes does not appear to be a major driver in this context, asking for additional mechanisms to downregulate Notch activity. Our work provides evidence that these inhibitory mechanisms involves the phosphorylation of Su(H) by Pkc53E. Formally, we cannot exclude alternative mechanisms. Hence, we have tried to avoid the direct link between Su(H) phosphorylation and the inhibition of Notch activity throughout the text, including the title. Moreover, we have discussed the possible consequences of Su(H) lack of DNA binding, interfering either with the activation of Notch target genes or abrogating their repression.</p>
<p>In addition, we have performed new experiments addressing the epistasis between Notch and Su(H) during crystal cell formation (Figure 1_supplement 1). To this end, we knocked down Notch activity in hemocytes by RNAi (hml::N-RNAi) in the Su(H)gwt and Su(H)S269A background, respectively. Indeed, Notch downregulation strongly impairs crystal cell development independent of the genetic background as expected if Notch were epistatic to Su(H). We attribute the slightly elevated crystal cell numbers observed in the Su(H)S269A background to the increase in the embryonic precursors (see Fig. 4; Frankenreiter et al. 2021). Of note, the Notch gain of function allele Ncos479 also displayed a likewise increase in embryonic crystal cell precursors as well as in crystal cells within the lymph gland (Frankenreiter et al. 2021).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Temporal regulation of Notch activity in response to wasp-infection and its overlapping dynamics of Su(H) phosphorylation via Pkc is needed:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>First, I suggest the authors to show how Notch activity post infection in a time course dependent manner is altered. A RT-PCR profile of Notch target genes in hemocytes from infected animals at 6, 12, 24, 48 HPI, to gauge an understanding of dynamics in Notch activity will set the tone for when and how it is being modulated. In parallel, this response in phospho mutant of Su(H) will be good to see and will support the requirement for phosphorylation of Su(H) to manifest a strong immune response.</p>
<p>Indeed, it would be extremely nice to follow the entire processes in every detail, ideally at the cellular level. The challenge, however, is quantities. The mRNA isolated from hemocytes could be barely quantified, although the subsequent ct-values were ok. We quantified NRE-GFP expression, introduced into Su(H)gwt and Su(H)S269A, as well as atilla expression. We were able to generate data for two time slots, 0-6 h and 24-30 h post infection. The data are provided in the extended Figure 1G, and show a strong drop of NRE-GFP in the infected Su(H)gwt control compared to the uninfected animals, whereas expression in Su(H)S269A plateaus at around 60%-70% of the infected Su(H)gwt control. Atilla expression jumps up in the control, but stays low in Su(H)S269A hemocytes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Second, is the dynamics of phosphorylation in a time course experiment is missing. While the increased phosphorylation of Su(H) in response to wasp-infestation shown in Fig.2B is using whole animal, this implies a global down-regulation of Su(H)/Notch activity. The authors need to show this response specifically in immune cells. The reader is left to the assumption that this is also true in immune cells. Given the authors have a good antibody, characterizing this same in circulating immune cells in response to infection will be needed. A time course of the phosphorylation state at 6, 12, 24, 48 HPI, to guage an understanding of this dynamics is needed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We really would love to do these experiments. Unfortunately, our pS269 antibody is rather lousy. It does not allow to detect Su(H) protein in tissue or cells, nor does it work on protein extracts in Westerns or for IP. Hence, we have no way so far to demonstrate cell or tissue specificity of Su(H) phosphorylation. So far, we were lucky to detect mCherry-tagged Su(H) proteins pulled down in rather large amounts with the highly specific nano-bodies. We have tried very hard to repeat the experiment with hemolymph and lymph glands only, but we have failed so far. Hence, we have to state that our antibody is neither suitable for in vivo analyses, nor for a detection of phospho-Su(H) at lower levels.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors suggest, this mechanism may be a quick way to down-regulate Notch, hence a side by side comparison of the dynamics of Notch down-regulation (such as by doing RT-PCR of Notch target genes following different time point post infection) alongside the levels of pS269 will strengthen the central point being proposed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully agree and hope to address these issues in the future by improving our tools.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Last, in Fig7. the authors show Co-immuno-precipitation of Pkc53EHA with Su(H)gwt-mCh 994 protein from Hml-gal4 hemocytes. I understand this is in homeostasis but since this interaction is proposed to be sensitive to infection, then a Co-IP of the two in immune cells, upon infection should be incorporated to strengthen their point.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We do not fully agree with the reviewer. Although we also think that the interaction between Pkc53E and Su(H) might occur more frequently upon infection, we propose that this is a transient process occurring in several but not all hemocytes at a given time. Moreover, in the described experiment, Pkc53E-HA was expressed in hemocytes via the UAS/Gal4 system. We cannot exclude that this approach causes an overexpression. Hence, we would not expect considerable differences between unchallenged and infested animals.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In Fig 5B, the authors show the change in crystal cell numbers as read out of PMA induced activation of Pkc53E and subsequent inhibition of Su(H) transcriptional activity, I would suggest the authors use more direct measures of this read out. RT-PCR of Su(H) target genes, in circulating immune cells, will strengthen this point. Formation of crystal cells is not just limited to Notch, I am not convinced that this treatment or the conditions have other affect on immune cells, such as any impact on Hif expression may also lead to lowering of CC numbers. Hence, the authors need to strengthen this point by showing that effects are direct to Notch and Su(H) and not non-specific to any other pathway also shown to be important for CC development.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the Reviewer that the rather general influence of PMA on PKCs might present a systemic stress to the animal. For example, we observed a slight drop of crystal cell numbers also in Su(H)S269A, suggesting other kinases apart from Pkc53E were affected that are involved in crystal cell homeostasis. We have included this notion in the text. To provide more conclusive evidence we also fed Staurosporine to the larvae which reversed the PMA effect. In addition, we assayed the expression of NRE-GFP in hemocytes of infected animals by qRT-PCR, and observed a strong drop in the infected versus uninfected control but less so in Su(H)S269A. The new data are provided in extended Figures 1G and 5B.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In addition to the above mentioned points, the data needs to be strengthened to further support the main conclusions of the manuscript. I would suggest the authors present the infection response with details on the timing of the immune response. Characterization of the immune responses at respective time points (as above or at least 24 and 48 HPI, as norms in the field) will be important. Also, any change in overall cell numbers, other immune cells, plasmatocytes or CC post infection is missing and is needed to present the specificity of the impact. The addition of these will present the data with more rigor in their analysis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Total hemocyte numbers of the various genotypes, i.e. control, Su(H)S269A, Su(H)S269D, and Pkc53ED28 were included before and after wasp infestation in supplemental Figures 1_S1 and 9_S1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Finally, what is the view of the authors on what leads to activation of Pkc53E, any upstream input is not presented. It will be good to see if wasp infection leads to increased Pkc53 kinase activity.</p>

<p>The analysis of the full process is an ongoing project. We propose that ROS is produced upon the wasps’ sting, which is to trigger the subsequent cascade of events. These have to end with activation of Pkc53E in the presumptive pre-lamellocyte pool of both lineages, i.e. in plasmatocyte of the hemolymph, presumably in the sessile compartment (Tattikotta et al., 2021) and at the same time in the lymph gland cortex harboring the LM precursors (Blanco-Obregon et al., 2020). One of the known upstream kinases, Pdk1 has a similar impact on crystal cell development as Pkc53E, making its involvement likely. Moreover, we think that other PKCs influence the process as well.</p>
<p>Without a good read out, e.g. a functional pSu(H) antiserum working in situ or a Pkc-activity reporter, it will be quite difficult to follow up this question. However, we already know that Pkc53E is expressed in hemocytes of all types independent of wasp infestation, in agreement with a role during lamellocyte differentiation. We hope to unravel the process in more of it in the future.</p>

<p>Overall, I think the findings in the current state are interesting and fill an important gap, but the authors will need to strengthen the point with more detailed analysis that includes generating new data and also presenting the current data with more rigor in their approach. The data have to showcase the relationship with Notch pathway modulation upon phosphorylation of CSL in a much more comprehensive way, both in homeostasis and in response to infection which is entirely missing in the current draft.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Diechsel et al. provide important and valuable insights into how Notch signalling is shut down in response to parasitic wasp infestation in order to suppress crystal cell fate and favour lamellocyte production. The study shows that CSL transcription factor Su(H) is phosphorylated at S269A in response to parasitic wasp infestation and this inhibitory phosphorylation is critical for shutting down Notch. The authors go on to perform a screen for kinases responsible for this phosphorylation and have identified Pkc53E as the specific kinase acting on Su(H) at S269A. Using analysis of mutants, RNAi and biochemistry-based approaches the authors convincingly show how Pkc53E-Su(H) interaction is critical for remodelling hematopoiesis upon wasp challenge. The data presented supports the overall conclusions made by the authors. There are a few points below that need to be addressed by the authors to strengthen the conclusions:</p>
<p>(1) The authors should check melanized crystal cells in Su(H)gwt and Su(H)S269A in presence of PMA and Staurosporine?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the suggestion. We included the results of PMA + Staurosporine feeding into an extended Fig. 5B; they match those from the HeLa cells. Unfortunately, Staurosporine alone was lethal for the larvae at various concentrations, presumably owing to the overarching inhibition of kinase activity. This global effect also explains the high crystal cell numbers in the control fed with PMA + STAU compared to the untreated animals, as the downregulation of many kinases results in higher crystal cell numbers, a fact uncovered in our genetic screen.</p>

<p>(2) Data for number of dead pupae, flies eclosed, wasps emerged post infestation should be monitored for the following genotypes and should be included:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Pkc53EΔ28_, Su(H)S269A,_ Pkc53EΔ28 Su(H)S269A, Su(H)S269D, Su(H)S269D Pkc53EΔ28</p>
<p>We extended the data with and without infection. The respective data are shown in a new Fig. 9 and an extended Fig. 2,  except for the Su(H)S269D allele. Su(H)S269D is larval lethal, i.e. dies too early for wasp development, and hence could not be included in the assay. Overall, Pkc53EΔ28 matched Su(H)S269A_._</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The exact molecular trigger for activation of Pkc53E upon wasp infestation is not clear.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, and we would love to know! Perhaps, the generation of Ca2+ by the wasp’s breach of the larval cuticle results in Pkc53E activation. The generation of ROS could be involved as well. At this point, we can only speculate. We hope to be able in the future to obtain direct experimental evidence for the one or the other hypothesis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors should check if activating ROS alone or induction of Calcium pulses/DUOX activation can mimic this condition and can trigger activation of Pkc53E and thereby cause phosphorylation of Su(H) at S269</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer’s suggestions open up a new field of investigations, and are hence beyond of the scope of this article. However, we want to pursue the research in this direction, albeit we realize that counting crystal cells is too coarse but to give a first impression, and that lamellocytes may form already by breaching the larval cuticle. A major challenge shall be direct measurements of Pkc53E activation. To date, we have no tools for this, but ideally, we would like to have a direct, biochemical read out. Although we have been unsuccessful in the past, we want to develop a strong and specific phospho-S269 antibody that is also working in situ. Alternatively, we think of developing a PS-phosphorylation reporter, to allow reasonably addressing these questions.</p>

<p>(5) Does Pkc53E get activated during sterile inflammation?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are in the process of addressing this issue, however, feel that his topic is beyond the scope of this paper. Our preliminary experiments, however, support the notion of a phospho-dependent regulation of Su(H) also in this context.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The authors provide a graphical representation of major phenotypes that form the basis of their investigation and conclusions but have not supplemented the quantitation with images that represent these phenotypes. The authors need to include the following data to strengthen their conclusions:</p>
<p>(1) The authors should include representative images for each of the genotypes/conditions (in presence and absence of wasp infestation) based on which corresponding plots have been made in Figure 1. Please include this for both circulating lamellocytes in the hemolymph and in the lymph glands since this is one of the main figures presenting the key findings.</p>
