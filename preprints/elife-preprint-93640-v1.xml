<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Chimerism happens rarely among most mammals but is common in marmosets and tamarins, a result of fraternal twin or triplet birth patterns in which <italic>in utero</italic> connected circulatory systems (through which stem cells transit) lead to persistent blood chimerism (12-80%) throughout life. The presence of Y-chromosome DNA sequences in other organs of female marmosets has long suggested that chimerism might also affect these organs. However, a longstanding question is whether this chimerism is driven by blood-derived cells or involves contributions from other cell types. To address this question, we analyzed single-cell RNA-seq data from blood, liver, kidney and multiple brain regions across a number of marmosets, using transcribed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to identify cells with the sibling’s genome in various cell types within these tissues. Sibling-derived chimerism in all tissues arose entirely from cells of hematopoietic origin (i.e., myeloid and lymphoid lineages). In brain tissue this was reflected as sibling-derived chimerism among microglia (20-52%) and macrophages (18-64%) but not among other resident cell types (i.e., neurons, glia or ependymal cells). The percentage of microglia that were sibling-derived showed significant variation across brain regions, even within individual animals, likely reflecting distinct responses by siblings’ microglia to local recruitment or proliferation cues or, potentially, distinct clonal expansion histories in different brain areas. In the animals and tissues we analyzed, microglial gene expression profiles bore a much stronger relationship to local/host context than to sibling genetic differences. Naturally occurring marmoset chimerism will provide new ways to understand the effects of genes, mutations and brain contexts on microglial biology and to distinguish between effects of microglia and other cell types on brain phenotypes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chimerism, in which an organism contains cells from genetically distinct animals, happens rarely among mammals. Chimerism is common, however, among marmosets and their close relatives the tamarins: in these primate species, animals usually give birth to dizygotic twins or trizygotic triplets whose blood contains cells from siblings. During development, the siblings share circulation <italic>in utero</italic>, allowing the exchange of hematopoietic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Gengozian et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Wislocki, 1939</xref>). Most marmosets then exhibit blood chimerism throughout life: their blood-derived DNA is a mixture of both twins’ genomes, with the twin’s genome contributing 12% to 80% of the DNA in the blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Niblack et al., 1977</xref>; The Marmoset Genome Sequencing and Analysis Consortium, 2014). This indicates that the twins’ hematopoietic stem cells establish permanent residency in one another’s bodies and contribute to blood cell populations throughout life.</p>
<p>A longstanding mystery involves whether other tissues and organisms also harbor chimerism. Beyond the blood, Y-chromosome DNA has been detected in the brain and other organs of female marmosets with male twins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ross et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Sweeney et al., 2012</xref>), eliciting much speculation about how chimerism might have shaped behavior and natural selection in marmosets. However, it is still not known what cell types harbor this sibling DNA; such observations could in principle be explained by the presence of blood cells within these organs.</p>
<p>Here, we analyze chimerism in the marmoset brain, liver, kidney and blood, using single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) to infer cell types and using combinations of transcribed SNPs (visible in the snRNA-seq data) to determine which marmoset sibling is the source of each cell. This approach makes it possible to determine whether chimerism arises from blood cells, resident immune cells, or other cell types, and to explore what chimerism can teach us about cellular migrations and population dynamics.</p>

<title>Marmoset chimerism can be characterized at single-cell resolution</title>
<p>To identify which individual cells have the genome of the host marmoset, and which have the genome of the host’s birth sibling, we used combinations of many transcribed SNPs that were visible in the snRNA-seq data for each nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Wells et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>We first determined whether marmosets have sufficient sequence variation to enable the distinction between host and sibling cells. From whole-genome sequences of 123 marmosets, we identified 13 million polymorphic bi-allelic SNPs in the marmoset genome, with individual marmosets harboring 2.3 to 3.8 million (average 3.4 million) heterozygous sites – comparable to levels of heterozygosity in humans. For sibling comparisons, we detected a large number of sites at which any two siblings’ genomes differed, ranging from 2.0 to 3.7 million sites (average 2.9 million sites) across 96 sibling comparisons (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>). To determine how many of these sites were visible in snRNA-seq data, we analyzed snRNA-seq data for several marmoset tissues. The results varied by cell type, reflecting that different cell types’ nuclei harbored different quantities of RNA. The hundreds of transcribed variant sites that differed between siblings (median&gt;311 per nucleus) suggested ample power to distinguish between siblings in all cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Wells et al., 2023</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>We next evaluated whether the genome variation visible in snRNA-seq reads was sufficient to distinguish between host and sibling cells. For this we used Dropulation, which identifies the donors of individual cells (from a set of genome-sequenced candidate donors) by using combinations of the transcribed SNPs visible on the snRNA-seq reads of the individual cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Wells et al., 2023</xref>). We first analyzed the blood cells by snRNA-seq of a marmoset (CJ028) born with two birth siblings and used Dropulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Wells et al., 2023</xref>) to assign individual cells to the correct sibling (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref></bold>). The relative likelihoods of the siblings could be strongly differentiated (relative likelihoods of 10<sup>3</sup> to 10<sup>23</sup>) for &gt;99% of the nuclei (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref></bold>). We found a high level of chimerism: 84% of all nuclei sampled in this marmoset’s blood appeared to contain the genome of one (67% - sibling #1) or the other (17% - sibling #2) of its two birth siblings (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref></bold>), consistent with the wide range of chimerism found in previous studies: 4-82% in marmoset T cells and B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Niblack et al., 1977</xref>); 13-37% in marmoset whole blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">“The Marmoset Genome Sequencing and Analysis Consortium”, 2014</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Apparent liver and kidney chimerism arises from infiltrating monocytes</title>
<p>Earlier studies have identified Y-chromosome-derived DNA sequences in the organs of female marmosets with male birth siblings, suggesting that these organs harbor chimerism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Sweeney et al., 2012</xref>). However, such observations could also in principle arise from blood or from blood-derived immune cells that are present in those organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Sweeney et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>We performed snRNA-seq analysis of the blood (1,741 nuclei), liver (10,877 nuclei) and kidney (9,262 nuclei) of a marmoset (CJ026) with one birth sibling (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref></bold>). The snRNA-seq profiles clustered into groups that were readily recognized (based on the RNAs expressed) as the principal cell types of each organ; we determined the identity of each cluster using scType, a cell-type identification tool that uses a database of known marker genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Ianevski et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>In kidney and liver, the only clearly twin-derived cells were cells of hematopoietic origin: the resident macrophages in liver (Kupffer cells), lymphocytes in liver, and lymphocytes in kidney (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E,F</xref></bold>). All non-hematopoietic cell types in liver and kidney appeared to contain only the host marmoset’s own genome. Chimerism levels for the two chimeric liver immune cell types appeared to diverge, with sibling-derived cells accounting for 15% of Kupffer cells and just 4% of lymphocytes (5/122 vs 57/383; Chi-square test <italic>P</italic>-value=0.003). In the blood, chimerism levels varied across the various cell types: the most abundant cell types, the Naive B cells and Naive CD8+ T cells, were respectively 29% and 32% sibling-derived, while the less-abundant CD8+ NKT-like cells were 15% sibling-derived (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref></bold>, Chi-square test <italic>P</italic>-value=0.01).</p>
<p>These results indicate that, in this animal’s liver and kidney, apparent DNA chimerism likely arose from infiltrating immune cells rather than other cell types. These results also indicate that cells with siblings’ genomes can differ in their tendency to acquire specific hematopoietic cell fates and in their tendency to infiltrate into organs.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Marmoset brain microglia and macrophages exhibit abundant chimerism</title>
<p>To characterize chimerism in the marmoset brain, we utilized a large snRNA-seq data set being generated for a marmoset brain cell atlas (Krienen et al., 2022). We first analyzed 497,000 single-nucleus RNA-expression profiles from the neocortex, thalamus, striatum, hippocampus, basal forebrain, hypothalamus and amygdala of an adult marmoset with two birth siblings (marmoset CJ028). We clustered the cell types using gene expression similarities (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref></bold>) and identified brain cell types as in earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Krienen et al., 2020</xref>), identifying neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, ependymal cells, endothelial cells, microglia and macrophages (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref></bold>). Microglia (which expressed markers <italic>TREM2</italic>, <italic>LAPTM5</italic> and <italic>C3</italic>) and macrophages (which expressed <italic>LYVE1</italic> and <italic>F13A1</italic>) were a small fraction of all nuclei analyzed (about 3.6%), but due to the large number of nuclei we profiled (53 brain tissue dissections, 497,000 nuclei), we were able to ascertain sufficient numbers of microglia (18,175 nuclei) and to a lesser extent macrophages (172 nuclei) for many downstream analyses. We found microglia and macrophages in snRNA-seq data from 10 additional marmosets with different genetic backgrounds from 3 different colonies (sample information for 11 marmosets in <bold><xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref></bold>; a total of eleven marmoset brains were analyzed and all are unrelated except for CJ006 and CJ007 which are birth siblings, and CJ025 and CJ026 which are (non-birth) siblings; only CJ026 was assessed for liver and kidney, and 3 marmosets were assessed for blood: CJ026, CJ027 and CJ028). Brain snRNA-seq of all 11 marmosets showed consistently the presence of these two myeloid cell types in the brain (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref></bold>; number of microglia and macrophages in <bold><xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 2</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>Donor-of-origin analysis of snRNA-seq data from 2.2 million nuclei sampled from 137 brain tissue samples from these 11 marmosets showed a clear and consistent pattern: microglia and macrophages, but not neurons, glia or endothelial cells, harbored chimerism (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref></bold>). Microglia exhibited abundant chimerism – across the 11 marmosets, the total fraction of cells with the sibling’s genome ranged from 20% to 52% (for triplets, sum of two siblings; <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref></bold>). Macrophages exhibited a similarly wide range of sibling fractions across marmosets (18% to 64%, <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>The quantitative extent of microglial chimerism varied across individuals (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3A</xref></bold>; test of heterogeneity <italic>P</italic>-value&lt;2.2×10<sup>−16</sup>), as did that of macrophage chimerism (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3B</xref></bold>; test of heterogeneity <italic>P</italic>-value=1×10<sup>−4</sup>). We asked whether microglial and macrophage chimerism were correlated. Intriguingly, only a modest correlation of chimerism levels across 14 host-sibling pairs was observed between the microglia and macrophages (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref></bold>; Pearson correlation 0.31), suggesting that in addition to the cell’s genome, other factors such as local host environment play a role in differential recruitment or survival of sibling cells. Neither of these two myeloid cell types showed consistently higher chimerism than the other cell type did (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref></bold>).</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Sibling contributions in blood vs. brain</title>

<title>Microglia chimerism fraction varies across brain regions</title>
<p>Sibling contributions to the microglial population could in principle be shaped by effects that are local to specific brain areas, including differential response of sibling microglia to local recruitment or proliferation cues. To evaluate whether the sibling contribution to the microglial population varied across brain areas within individual marmosets, we performed chimerism analysis for each of the brain regions profiled in the snRNA-seq datasets: neocortex, thalamus, striatum, hippocampus, basal forebrain, hypothalamus and amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Krienen et al., 2020</xref>, 2022). Within each marmoset, the fraction of microglia with a sibling’s genome diverged across a marmoset’s brain regions (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref></bold>). For example, in marmoset CJ025, sibling contributions to microglial populations ranged from 11% (21/193) in the thalamus to 56% (174/310) in the striatum (<italic>P</italic>-value=1.1×10<sup>−23,</sup> Chi-square test of thalamus vs striatum; <italic>P</italic>-value=1.5×10<sup>−40</sup>, Chi-square test across all 4 brain regions).

<title>Brain context vs. genetic differences as determinants of microglial gene expression</title>
<p>Chimerism presents interesting opportunities to distinguish between cell-autonomous and contextual effects on biology, and to compare the magnitudes of such effects.</p>
<p>We first considered the difference in contexts provided by pairs of brain areas by analyzing snRNA-seq data from the neocortex and striatum of marmoset CJ027; the resident microglial populations with different genomes make it possible to compare contextual to genetic effects on microglial gene expression (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref></bold>). Genetic effects appeared to elicit very many small-magnitude gene-expression differences; these differences were shared between cortical and striatal microglia (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref></bold>). Brain-area context elicited much larger-magnitude gene-expression differences, which were experienced in common by microglia with both genotypes (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref></bold>). We obtained similar results for all pairs of brain areas analyzed (52 context vs genetic effect from brain snRNA-seq of 6 marmosets with at least 60 cells available for analysis in each context; <bold><xref rid="tbls4" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 4</xref></bold>; <bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>We next considered the difference in contexts provided by the same brain area in different marmosets. Two of the marmosets profiled, CJ006 and CJ007, were birth siblings who passed away as neonates (the only birth siblings in our dataset), and thus provided the additional opportunity to distinguish genetic from contextual effects by analyzing the two sibling microglial populations in the cortex, striatum and hippocampus of both marmosets (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref></bold>). The effects of context (host marmoset) in microglia from all three brain areas appeared to be far larger than the cell-autonomous effects of genetic differences (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H,I</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A longstanding debate concerns the extent of chimerism in marmosets and tamarins. Chimerism in these species has been detected in diverse organs but arises from unknown cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ross et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Sweeney et al., 2012</xref>). Here we found that chimerism in the brain, liver and kidney is present but appears to arise entirely from cells of the myeloid and lymphoid lineages, including infiltrating macrophages, monocytes, and microglia.</p>
<p>Cells of the myeloid and lymphoid lineages derive developmentally from hematopoietic stem cells. We found no strong evidence of chimerism among 2.2 million non-hematopoietic cells in the liver (from one marmoset), kidney (from one marmoset) or brain (from 11 marmosets). Thus, while marmosets share a circulation <italic>in utero</italic>, we found no evidence that non-hematopoietic stem cells or progenitors had been shared via this route in any appreciable number. However, we found that in the marmoset brain, the microglia and macrophages, which also derive from this lineage, routinely harbor abundant chimerism, with 10-50% of a marmoset’s microglia containing the genome(s) of birth sibling(s).</p>
<p>Organs in the same marmoset (liver, kidney, brain) differed markedly in the sibling contribution to resident macrophage and monocyte populations, with microglial chimerism fraction (the fraction of cells contributed by siblings) varying by as much as 40 percentage points across a marmoset’s brain areas. This phenomenon has more than one potential explanation. First, cells from the host and sibling could in principle respond differently to recruitment or proliferation cues that vary spatially; if this is the case, marmoset chimerism could provide a model for studying the effects of mutations and natural sequence variation on cell migration and recruitment. (Although we found that genetic effects were smaller than contextual effects in shaping microglial gene expression at any moment in time, genetic effects were clear (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref></bold>), and even small effects on proliferation rates would tend to have effects that increase exponentially over time.) Second, beyond such recruitment effects, it is also possible that these differences suggest a substantial role of clonal expansions and population bottlenecks in shaping local microglial and macrophage populations.</p>
<p>We found that the cellular contribution of birth siblings to myeloid cell populations was significantly different in blood than in brain in the modest number of marmosets analyzed (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref></bold>). Unlike the differences among brain areas, the blood-brain differences tended to be directional, with more-modest sibling contributions in the brain than in the blood. Though this would need to be confirmed in many more marmosets to be definitive on its own, it is plausibly connected to this aspect of marmoset fetal development: sharing of a blood circulation between the two fetuses occurs during a temporal window that is more temporally extended than the waves of colonization of the brain by microglia, potentially allowing for greater exchange in the centers of blood hematopoiesis (the liver and then the bone marrow). In microglia and macrophages, due to the defined waves of hematopoiesis in the yolk sac and migration patterns of microglia and macrophages to the developing brain, the opportunity for a progenitor cell from a twin to colonize a host’s brain may need to occur during a more-restricted temporal window.</p>
<p>Comparisons of gene expression between microglial cells with host and sibling genomes in a shared brain context may provide many future opportunities to distinguish the cell-autonomous from the non-cell autonomous genetic effects of genetic differences and engineered mutations. Such analyses could become especially useful scientifically as genome editing increasingly enables the utilization of marmosets as a model organism in translational neuroscience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aida &amp; Feng, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Feng et al., 2020</xref>). Our pilot analysis of host-sibling microglial gene expression differences in the brains of two co-twins revealed a large role of animal context (relative to genetic differences) in shaping microglial gene expression. This result points to an important principle: the ability to isolate the effects of a mutation will be greatly strengthened by the ability to make within-animal (rather than just between-animal) comparisons of cells with different genotypes.</p>
<p>A long history of innovation in genetics involves elaborate ways to create mosaics in mice, <italic>C. elegans</italic> and other laboratory organisms in order to distinguish cell-autonomous from non-cell autonomous genetic effects. Natural chimerism in marmosets may enable many straightforward ways to pursue such kinds of studies. Natural chimerism may also make it possible to determine when microglia or macrophages, as opposed to other cell types, mediate the effect of a mutation on an animal’s phenotype.</p>
<p>Microglia perform essential roles in the development and regulation of the central nervous system (CNS), including by sculpting or “pruning” neuronal circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Hammond et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Schafer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Schafer &amp; Stevens, 2015</xref>), and are implicated in or hypothesized to contribute to a wide range of brain disorders and diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia. Marmoset microglial chimerism will enable many new ways of studying microglia and the effects of genes and alleles upon brain biology.</p>

To generate chimerism-free reference genotypes, we cultured fibroblasts and performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) on the resulting DNA. We found that the difference in likelihoods between host and sibling increase with the number of UMI of the cell, and hence we imposed a minimum number of UMI for each marmoset’s cells (<bold><xref rid="tbls5" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 5</xref></bold>). We also performed doublet detection using Dropulation’s <monospace>DetectDoublets</monospace> to obtain a likelihood of a cell having a mix of transcripts from the host and sibling(s).

The asymmetry could arise from neuronal cells mis-classified as microglia or macrophages.

<p>Illumina libraries from fibroblast, blood, brain and buccal cells (<bold><xref rid="tbls6" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 6</xref></bold>) were created as follows. An aliquot of genomic DNA (150ng in 50μL) is used as the input into DNA fragmentation (aka shearing). Shearing is performed acoustically using a Covaris focused-ultrasonicator, targeting 385bp fragments. Following fragmentation, additional size selection is performed using a SPRI cleanup. Library preparation is performed using a commercially available kit provided by KAPA Biosystems (KAPA Hyper Prep with Library Amplification Primer Mix, product KK8504), and with palindromic forked adapters using unique 8-base index sequences embedded within the adapter (purchased from Roche). The libraries are then amplified by 10 cycles of PCR. Following sample preparation, libraries are quantified using quantitative PCR (kit purchased from KAPA Biosystems) with probes specific to the ends of the adapters. This assay is automated using Agilent’s Bravo liquid handling platform. Based on qPCR quantification, libraries are normalized to 2.2nM and pooled into 24-plexes. Sample pools are combined with NovaSeq Cluster Amp Reagents DPX1, DPX2 and DPX3 and loaded into single lanes of a NovaSeq 6000 S4 flowcell cell using the Hamilton Starlet Liquid Handling system. Cluster amplification and sequencing occur on NovaSeq 6000 Instruments utilizing sequencing-by-synthesis kits to produce 151bp paired-end reads. Output from Illumina software is processed by the Picard data-processing pipeline to yield CRAM or BAM files containing demultiplexed, aggregated aligned reads.

Using a method that quantifies chimerism from whole genome sequencing data (Census-seq; software available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/broadinstitute/Drop-seq">https://github.com/broadinstitute/Drop-seq</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Mitchell et al., 2020</xref>), we estimated the chimerism fraction in buccal cells as follows: CJ106: 10%, CJ104: 24%, CJ105: 24% and CJ103: 9%. Thus, the genotypes we obtained for these marmosets will include errors and those genotyping errors could subsequently affect Dropulation (donor-of-origin) analysis that was used to estimate chimerism. To empirically estimate how sibling genotypes obtained from a chimeric tissue affect Dropulation analysis, we selected a host-sibling pair whose genome sequencing were both obtained from fibroblast cultures: CJ027 and its birth sibling CJ140. To simulate DNA contamination, we fixed the sequencing coverage of CJ140 to 40X, and replaced between 1% to 60% of the reads from CJ027’s sequencing reads (random subsampling using ‘<monospace>samtools view -s</monospace>’). We genotyped CJ140’s “chimeric” bam files using GATK’s “genotype given alleles” mode and compared the genotypes with CJ140’s true genotypes from its pure fibroblast WGS. We found that the sensitivity at heterozygous sites remains constant with different contamination levels, while the false positive rate increases. The false positive calls at heterozygous sites come from homozygous sites incorrectly genotyped as heterozygous (<bold><xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 8A-F</xref></bold>). Next, we re-analyzed donor-of-origin on brain snRNA-seq of CJ027 sibling (CJ140) genotypes from simulated contaminated DNA (300,000 nuclei; CJ027 genotypes from pure fibroblast WGS, CJ140 genotypes from WGS with various contamination levels). We found that chimerism in CJ140’s WGS resulted in doublets being assigned to the twin (<bold><xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 8G-L</xref></bold>), which subsequently causes a slight increase in chimerism estimates (<bold><xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 8M-U</xref></bold>). The contamination levels in buccal cells were from 9% to 24%, which we estimate will result in an overestimation in microglia chimerism of up to 3.5 percentage points and 4.5 percentage points in macrophage chimerism. Our results will not be affected by this over-estimation of chimerism in 4 marmosets since the conclusions were made from the analysis of all 11 marmosets (including 7 marmosets whose siblings were genotyped from fibroblast cultures).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Del Rosario et al characterized the extent and cell types of sibling chimerism in marmosets. To do so, they took advantage of the thousands of SNPs that are transcribed in single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) data to identify the sibling genotype of origin for all sequenced cells across 4 tissues (blood, liver, kidney, and brain) from many marmosets. They found that chimerism is prevalent and widespread across tissues in marmosets, which has previously been shown. However, their snRNA-seq approach allowed them to identify precisely which cells were of sibling origin, and which were not. In doing so they definitively show that sibling chimerism across tissues is limited to cells of myeloid and lymphoid lineages. The authors then focus on a large sample of microglia sequenced across many brain regions to quantify: (1) variation in chimerism across brain regions in the same individual, and (2) the relative importance of genetic vs. environmental context on microglia function/identity.</p>
<p>(1) Much like across different tissues in the same individual, they found that the proportion of chimeric microglia varies across brain regions collected from the same individuals (as well as differing from the proportion of sibling cells found in the blood of the same animals), suggesting that cells from different genetic backgrounds may differ in their recruitment and/or proliferation across regions and local tissue contexts, or that this may be linked to stochastic bottleneck effects during brain development.</p>
<p>(2) Their (admittedly smaller sample size) analyses of host-sibling gene expression showed that the local environment dominates genotype.</p>
<p>All told, this thoughtful and thorough manuscript accomplishes two important goals. First, it all but closes a previously open question on the extent and cell origins of sibling chimerism. Second, it sets the stage for using this unique model system to examine, in a natural context, how genetic variation in microglia may impact brain development, function, and disease.</p>
<p>The conclusions of this paper are well supported by the data, and the authors exert appropriate care when extrapolating their results that come from smaller samples. However, there are a few concerns that should be addressed.</p>
<p>The &quot;modest correlation&quot; mentioned in lines 170-172 does not take into account the uncertainty in estimates of each chimeric cell proportion (although the plot shows those estimates nicely). This is particularly important for the macrophages, which are far less abundant. Perhaps a more appropriate way to model this would be in a binomial framework (with a random effect for individuals of origin). Here, you could model the sibling identity of each macrophage as a function of the proportion of sibling-origin microglia and then directly estimate the percent variance explained.</p>
<p>A similar (albeit more complicated because of the number of regions being compared) approach could be applied to more rigorously quantify the variation in chimerism across brain regions (L198-215; Figure 4). This would also help to answer the question of whether specific brain regions are more &quot;amenable&quot; to microglia chimerism than others.</p>
<p>While the sample size is small, it would be exciting to see if any microglia eQTL are driven by sibling chimerism across the marmosets.</p>
<p>L290-292: The authors should propose ways in which they could test the two different explanations proposed in this paragraph. For instance, a simulation-based modeling approach could potentially differentiate more stochastic bottleneck effects from recruitment-like effects.</p>
<p>While intriguing, the gene expression comparison (Figure 5) is extremely underpowered. It would be helpful to clarify this and note the statistical thresholds used for identifying DEGs (the black points in the figure).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript reports a novel and quite important study of chimerism among common marmosets. As the authors discuss, it has been known for years that marmosets display chimerism across a number of tissues. However, as the authors also recognize, the scope and details of this chimerism have been controversial. Some prior publications have suggested that the chimerism only involves cells derived from hematopoietic stem cells, while other publications have suggested more cell types can also be chimeric, including a wide range of cell types present in multiple organs. The present authors address this question and several other important issues by using snRNA-seq to track the expression of host and sibling-derived mRNAs across multiple tissues and cell types. The results are clear and provide strong evidence that all chimeric cells are derived from hematopoietic cell lineages.</p>
<p>This work will have an impact on studies using marmosets to investigate various biological questions but will have the biggest impact on neuroscience and studies of cellular function within the brain. The demonstration that microglia and macrophages from different siblings from a single pregnancy, with different genomes expressing different transcriptomes, are commonly present within specific brain structures of a single individual opens a number of new opportunities to study microglia and macrophage function as well as interactions between microglia, macrophages, and other cell types.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The paper has a number of important strengths. This analysis employs the first unambiguous approach providing a clear answer to the question of whether sibling-derived chimeric cells arise only from hematopoietic lineages or from a wider array of embryonic sources. That is a long-standing open question and these snRNA-seq data seem to provide a clear answer, at least for the brain, liver, and kidney. In addition, the present authors investigate quantitative variation in chimeric cell proportions across several dimensions, comparing the proportion of chimeric cells across individual marmosets, across organs within an individual, and across brain regions within an individual. All these are significant questions, and the answers have important implications for multiple research areas. Marmosets are increasingly being used for a range of neuroscience studies, and a better understanding of the process that leads to the chimerism of microglia and macrophages in the marmoset brain is a valuable and timely contribution. But this work also has implications for other lines of study. Third, the snRNA-seq data will be made available through the Brain Initiative NeMO portal and the software used to quantify host vs. sibling cell proportions in different biosamples will be available through GitHub.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I find no major weaknesses, but several minor ones. First, the main text of the manuscript provides no information about the specific animals used in this study, other than sex. Some basic information about the sources of animals and their ages at the time of study would be useful within the main paper, even though more information will be available in the supplementary material. Second, it is not clear why only 14 pairs of animals were used for estimating the correlation of chimerism levels in microglia and macrophages. Is this lower than the total number of pairwise comparisons possible in order to avoid using non-independent samples? Some explanation would be helpful. Finally, I think more analysis of the consistency and variability of gene expression in microglia across different regions of the brain would be valuable. Are there genetic pathways expressed similarly in host and sibling microglia, regardless of region of the brain? Are there pathways that are consistently expressed differently in host vs sibling microglia regardless of brain region?</p>
