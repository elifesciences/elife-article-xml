<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Axon regrowth is a key determinant of the restoration of the biological function of the nervous system after trauma. However, mature mammalian neurons have limited capacity for axon regeneration. We have previously demonstrated that neuronal axon growth both in the central and the peripheral nervous systems is markedly enhanced when non-muscle myosin II (NMII) is inhibited with blebbistatin. The activity of NMII is primarily regulated by MLCK and MLCP <italic>via</italic> the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of its light chain, respectively; however, the functional roles of MLCK and MLCP in mammalian axonal regeneration remain unknown. In the present study, we provide strong evidence that the inhibition of MLCK activity significantly blocks axon regeneration in the mouse. Conversely, inhibition of MLCP promotes axon regrowth of both peripheral and central nervous system. Our findings further indicate that the MLCK/MLCP regulates axon regeneration via the reorganization of F-actin distribution in the growth cone, and this result suggests that direct regulation of the growth cone machinery is a potential strategy to promote axon regeneration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The coordinated regulation of growth cone cytoskeleton components is essential for axon growth. Additionally, cytoskeletal proteins in the growth cone are converging targets of extracellular inhibitory molecules. It is now recognized that extracellular inhibitory molecules, such as myelin-based inhibitors and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) in glial scars are a major hurdle for successful axon regeneration. These extracellular inhibitory molecules typically trigger the activation of the RhoA/ROCK pathway, leading to the phosphorylation and, consequently, the deactivation of cofilin, a protein that severs actin filaments and promotes their depolymerization. Cofilin deactivation results in the stabilization of the growth cone actin cytoskeleton protein, and, subsequently, growth cone collapse. Accordingly, in order to overcome those inhibitory substrates and promote axonal outgrowth, several recent studies have focused on manipulating growth cone cytoskeleton dynamics, and have obtained promising results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Here, we hypothesized that the appropriate spatiotemporal regulation of the local cytoskeletal machinery in the growth cone can provide an alternative and effective approach for enhancing axon regeneration.</p>
<p>We have previously shown that the inhibition of non-muscle myosin II (NMII) activity can promotes axonal growth over inhibitory substrates, such as CSPGs and myelin, in both the central and peripheral nervous systems (CNS and PNS, respectively)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Furthermore, this growth-promoting effect is achieved <italic>via</italic> the reorganization of microtubules (MTs) in the growth cone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Myosin proteins constitute a superfamily of ATP-dependent motor proteins known primarily for their role in muscle contraction. In the nervous system, however, myosin II usually drives actin retrograde flow in the growth cone, while the actin cytoskeleton powers directional growth cone motility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. An increasing number of studies have shown that the actin cytoskeleton and its regulators also play a critical role in axon elongation and guidance. Myosin II is typically activated <italic>via</italic> the phosphorylation of the N-terminus of its light chain by myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and deactivated through dephosphorylation by myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP). An early study reported that the expression of MLCK, a calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase, is increased during axonal outgrowth in goldfish retinal ganglion cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. The overexpression of constitutively active MLCK in Drosophila CNS neurons increases myosin II activity and leads to impaired axonal outgrowth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Zhang <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that MLCK inhibition attenuates 5-HT-dependent neurite outgrowth in bag cell neurons of the mollusk Aplysia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Additionally, the activation of MLCP/MLC signaling in PC12 cells was also shown to promote neurite outgrowth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Together, these reports suggested that the MLCK/MLCP regulates axon growth in non-mammalian organisms. However, to our knowledge, the functional roles of MLCK and MLCP during mammalian axon regeneration remain unknown.</p>
<p>In the present study, we found that sciatic nerve injury elevated MLCK protein expression, leading to increased levels of MLC phosphorylation in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Furthermore, the pharmacological inhibition or genetic silencing of MLCK blocked axon regeneration in the PNS and CNS both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, whereas the pharmacological inhibition or transcriptional silencing of MLCP dramatically promotes axon regeneration. We further found that the MLCK/MLCP activity also affects F-actin redistribution in the growth cone. Taken together, our results indicated that MLCK and MLCP may regulate axon regeneration <italic>via</italic> the redistribution of F-actin in the growth cone, and the direct manipulation of cytoskeleton proteins in the growth cone may be a promising strategy for enhancing mammalian axon regeneration.</p>

<title>Animals and reagents</title>
<p>Adult ICR (8–10 weeks old, 20–30 g) were used. BDA (D1956) and CTB labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (CTB-488, C34775) were obtained from Life Technologies. ML-7 hydrochloride (110448-33-4) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. PDBu (P1269) was acquired from Sigma-Aldrich. Blebbistatin (S7099) was obtained from Selleck Chemicals. Antibodies against βIII-tubulin (TUJ1, T8578), MLCK (SAB1300116), and GFAP (G3893) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Antibodies against β-actin (#4970) and p-MLC (#3675) were acquired from Cell Signaling Technology. Actin-stain 555 phalloidin (Cat<sup>#</sup> PHDH1) was purchased from Cytoskeleton, Inc. siRNAs designed to target mouse MLCK (siMLCK) (5′-GGCAAATACACCTGTGAAG-3′, 5′-TGGTCAAAGAAGGGCAGAT-3′, 5′-AGCCAAAGGGAGTCAACAT-3′, and 5′-TCACGACGGGAATGAGATT-3′) and mouse MYPT1 (siMYPT1) (5′-CTGTGGATATCTCGATATTGC-3′) were obtained from GenePharma (Shanghai, China).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Cell culture</title>
<p>Adult DRG neurons were dissociated from 8 to 10-week-old ICR mice and cultured in Minimal Essential Medium (MEM) containing 5% (<italic>v</italic>/<italic>v</italic>) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine/uridine (20 μM), and penicillin/streptomycin. Embryonic cortical neurons (from E14.5 embryos) and hippocampal neurons (from E18.5 embryos) were cultured in neurobasal medium supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin, GlutaMAX, and B27 supplement. To investigate axonal growth on inhibitory substrates, glass coverslips were first coated with poly-D-lysine (100 μg/mL) for 2 h, and then coated again with myelin or 10 μg/mL CSPGs for 2 h, as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>For the cell replating experiment, DRG neurons were cultured for 3 days, resuspended in culture medium, replated on new coverslips, and finally re-cultured for a further 18 h to allow new axons to grow, as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Briefly, in treatments denoted as “before replating”, neurons were first grown in the presence of 10 μM ML-7 during the initial 3-day culture period, and, after washing out the ML-7, they were replated and grown in the absence of drug(s) for 18 h. Treatments denoted as “after replating” refer to procedures in which neurons were first grown in the absence of a drug or drugs during the initial 3-day culture period, after which 10 μM ML-7 was added immediately after replating, followed by 18 h of culture in the presence of drug(s).</p>

<title>Sciatic nerve axotomy</title>
<p>The sciatic nerve was transected at the sciatic notch using ophthalmic scissors. After surgery, the wound was closed, and the mice were allowed to recover. The mice were then euthanized and L4–L5 DRGs were isolated for cell culture, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR), and western blotting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>siRNA transfection</title>
<p>Cells were transfected with siRNA by electroporation in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, dissociated neurons were suspended in 80-µL solutions of Amaxa electroporation buffer containing siRNAs (2–3 nmol) and/or an EGFP-expressing plasmid (5 mg). The cells were then transferred to a 2-mm cuvette and electroporated using an Amaxa Nucleofector apparatus. After electroporation, the cells were immediately transferred to 500 µL of prewarmed culture medium and cultured on glass coverslips coated with 100 mg/mL poly-D-lysine. After 4 h, when the neurons had fully attached to the coverslips, the remaining electroporation buffer was discarded, and fresh culture medium (500 mL) was added.</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title>qRT-PCR and western blotting</title>
<p>Total RNA was isolated using Trizol Reagent and assessed for integrity and concentration in a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer. Each sample was then reverse transcribed using Maxima H Minus Reverse Transcriptase. Real-time qPCR was performed using SYBR Premix ExTaq II in a CFX96 Real-Time qPCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (<italic>Gapdh</italic>) was used as the internal control. The sequences of the forward and reverse primers were MLCK: 5′-AGAAGTCAAGGAGGTAAAGAATGATGT-3′ and 5′-CGGGTCGCTTTTCATTGC-3′, respectively; and GAPDH: 5′-AGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATTTG-3′ and 5′-TGTAGACCATGTAGTTGAGGTCA-3′, respectively.</p>
<p>For western blotting, samples were homogenized in RIPA buffer. After boiling for 5 min, equal amounts of extracted protein (20 µg/sample) were separated using 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and electro-transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore). After blocking with 0.01 M PBS containing 5% (<italic>w</italic>/<italic>v</italic>) skimmed milk overnight, the membranes were incubated first with primary antibodies and then with the appropriate secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibodies. Protein bands were developed using ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent and subsequently quantified using Image Lab software. An anti-β-actin antibody was used as a loading control.</p>

<title>Immunohistostaining</title>
<p>Mice were deeply anesthetized and transcardiacally perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). L4–L5 DRG tissues were isolated, further fixed in 4% PFA, cryosectioned into 12-μm slices, and blocked with 5% FBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100. The sections were then incubated with the indicated primary antibody (monoclonal anti-βIII-tubulin antibody and/or polyclonal anti-MLCK antibody). Immunoreactivity was visualized using the appropriate fluorescently labeled secondary antibody. Alternatively, cultured DRG neurons were fixed in 4% PFA, blocked with 2% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100, and then stained as described above. To visualize F-actin in the growth cones, <italic>in vitro</italic>-cultured neurons were stained with actin-stain 555 phalloidin following the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>

<title>Axonal growth and growth cone quantification</title>
<p>All images were acquired at 1388 × 1040-pixel resolution using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope with AxioVision 4.7 software (Carl Zeiss Micro Imaging, Inc.) equipped with a 10× or a 20× objective. For axon length quantification, the longest axon from 100 neurons for each condition was measured using the curve tool in AxioVision 4.7. Meanwhile, growth cone size and F-actin area were measured using the outline tool in AxioVision 4.7. The size of the growth cone was ascertained from the neck of the microtubule to the edge of the axon tip and the F-actin area was determined from the hillock to the most distant edge of the growth cone.</p>

<title><italic>In vivo</italic> electroporation of DRGs and sciatic nerve crush</title>
<p><italic>In vivo</italic> electroporation of adult mouse DRGs was performed as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Briefly, each mouse was anesthetized <italic>via</italic> an intraperitoneal injection of a ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) solution. The transverse process of L4 and L5 was carefully removed to expose the DRG tissue. The siRNA of interest (1 μL) was then microinjected into the L4–L5 DRG tissue using a Picospritzer II Microcellular Injection Unit followed by electroporation using a BTX ECM830 Electro Square Porator (five 15-ms pulses, 35 V, 900-ms interval). Following this, the muscle and skin were carefully sutured using 5-0 nylon sutures. The mouse was placed on a heated blanket (35°C) until it had completely recovered from anesthesia. Two days after electroporation, the sciatic nerves were crushed with forceps #5 and the crush sites were marked with an 11-0 nylon epineuria suture. After 3 more days, the mice were euthanized by perfusion of 4% PFA. The whole sciatic nerve was then dissected from the animal and the length of the EGFP-labeled axon was measured from the crush site to the axon tip.</p>

<sec id="s2i">
<title>Optic nerve injury</title>
<p>The optic nerves of adult C57BL/6 mice were carefully exposed and crushed with a jeweler’s forceps #5 just behind the eyeball for 1 s. A small piece of gelatin sponge fully soaked with PBS or 50 μM PDBu was placed at the lesion site; alternatively, 2 μL of PDBu (50 μM) was intravitreally injected into the vitreous body. Simultaneously, 2 μL of CTB-488 was injected into the vitreous body of each animal after the optic nerve had been crushed. All microinjections were performed using the Picospritzer II Microcellular Injection Unit (Paker Ins.; pressure: 15 psi, duration: 6 ms). After 3 days, the optic nerves were dissected out, fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4°C, and cut into a series of 12-μm longitudinal sections. The numbers of CTB-labeled axon fibers were counted at distances of 50 and 100 μm from the injury site. The length of the longest CTB-labeled axon fiber of each nerve was also measured.</p>

<title>Spinal cord crush injury and PDBu injection</title>
<p>The T8 spinal cord was exposed under a microscope, the whole spinal cord was crushed for 2 s with a modified jeweler’s forceps #5 as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, and the muscle and skin were separately sutured. A 100-µL volume of PDBu (50 μM) or DMSO was administered every 4 days by intrathecal injection. After 14 days, to trace and visualize the corticospinal tract axon, 1.6 μL of 10% BDA was injected into 4 sites of the sensorimotor cortex (1.0 mm lateral; 0.5 mm deep into the cortex; 1.0, 0.5, −0.5, and −1.0 posterior to bregma) with a 5 μL Hamilton syringe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Fourteen days after BDA injection, mice were transcardically perfused with 4% PFA. The whole spinal cord was isolated from each mouse and post-fixed in 4% PFA for 6 h at 4°C. After dehydration using an increasing gradient of sucrose concentrations, the spinal cord was cut into 25-μm-thick sagittal sections, which were then stained with Cy3-streptavidin for 3 h following the manufacturer’s protocol. The lengths of regenerating axons were determined by measuring the distance from the lesion site to the tip of the BDA-labeled axon tip. The final axon length was the average calculated from 5 sections for each spinal cord. Five mice were used for each condition.</p>

<title>The MLCK expression increased in adult sensory neurons following peripheral axotomy</title>
<p>Following injury, the expression of axon regeneration-related genes is usually upregulated. Thus, we first measured MLCK protein levels in DRG neurons following sciatic nerve transection. Compared with naive neurons, MLCK protein expression was significantly increased in DRG neurons 3 days after sciatic nerve transection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, B</xref>). The mRNA levels of MLCK in DRG neurons were also increased on days 1, 3, and 7 after axotomy, with the highest expression being observed on day 3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Given that MLCK phosphorylates MLC, we subsequently assessed the level of MLC phosphorylation and found that it was higher in DRG neurons following nerve injury than in control DRG neurons, likely due to the increase in MLCK expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, D, E</xref>). Immunohistochemical staining further confirmed that both MLCK expression and the levels of phosphorylated MLC (p-MLC) increased in DRG neurons following sciatic nerve axotomy (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F, G</xref>). Taken together, these results indicated that MLCK is activated in DRG sensory neurons following peripheral axotomy, which leads to an increase in MLC phosphorylation.</p>

<title>The inhibition of MLCK impaired axon regeneration in peripheral sensory DRG neurons</title>
<p>Next, to explore the functional role of MLCK during peripheral axon regeneration, ML-7 (10 μM), a specific pharmacological inhibitor of MLCK, was added to DRG neuron cultures for 3 days. The results showed that ML-7 administration led to a significant reduction in MLC phosphorylation levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A, B</xref>) and impaired axonal growth in sensory neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C, D</xref>), and these effects were dose-dependent (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). The proportion of neurons with axons also decreased after ML-7 treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Furthermore, the transfection of a small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting MLCK (siMLCK) into dissociated DRG neurons significantly inhibited MLCK expression and reduced p-MLC levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E, F</xref>), while concomitantly blocking axon growth in adult DRG sensory neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G, H</xref>). Next, using our previously described <italic>in vivo</italic> DRG electroporation technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, we further explored the functional role of MLCK in sciatic nerve axon regeneration <italic>in vivo</italic>.

<title>The inhibition of MLCP promoted peripheral axon growth over inhibitory substrates</title>
<p>It is well known that the opposite role of MLCK and MLCP to regulate the MLC phosphorylation status. Consequently, we also investigated the functional role of MLCP during axon regeneration. It has been reported that phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) can block MLCP activity, which leads to an increase in MLC phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Here, the results demonstrated that PDBu treatment (20 µM) significantly increased the p-MLC level in cultured DRG neurons (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S2A, B</xref>). Importantly, we found that this occurred in parallel with greatly enhanced axonal growth in DRG neurons cultured on permissive substrates, such as poly-D-lysine (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S2C, D</xref>). A key reason why CNS neurons cannot spontaneously regenerate axons after injury is due to the inhibitory local microenvironment. Myelin and CSPGs are well-characterized CNS-based inhibitory substrates that block axon regeneration. Therefore, we next examined whether inhibition of MLCP activity with PDBu promoted axon regeneration in the presence of these potential CNS-based inhibitory substrates. When dissociated adult DRG neurons were cultured on myelin extracts or CSPGs, sensory neuronal axon growth was significantly suppressed (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S2C, D</xref>). Interestingly, however, when PDBu was added to the culture medium, axon growth was significantly enhanced on either substrate (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S2C, D</xref>). This result indicated that PDBu treatment relieved the inhibitory effect of myelin and CSPGs on axonal growth in DRG neurons. MLCP is a phosphatase complex comprising PP1δ, MYPT1, and M20<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. In this study, a siRNA specifically targeting MYPT1 (siMYPY1) was found to markedly increase MLC phosphorylation in cultured DRG neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, B</xref>). In line with the results obtained with the pharmacological inhibitor, siMYPT1 also significantly stimulated axonal growth in DRG sensory neurons cultured on myelin or CSPGs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C, D</xref>). Furthermore, the transfection of siMYPT1 into L4–L5 DRGs of adult mice by electroporation also significantly promoted sciatic nerve axon regeneration <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E, F</xref>).

<title>MLCK/MLCP activity regulated axon growth in the embryonic CNS</title>
<p>Compared with neurons of the PNS, those of the CNS have intrinsically poor axonal growth capability, which also helps explain why CNS neurons cannot spontaneously regenerate axons after injury. Therefore, we next examined the role of MLCK/MLCP on CNS axon regeneration using cortical and hippocampal neurons from embryonic day (E)14.5 and E18.5 mice, respectively. To block MLCK activity, the neurons were treated with 10 µM ML-7 for 3 days. The results showed that the MLC phosphorylation levels were markedly inhibited with ML-7 treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>); simultaneously, the mean axon length of ML-7-treated E14.5 cortical neurons was significantly reduced compared with that of the control neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C, D</xref>). Furthermore, consistent with the pharmacological results, the siRNA-mediated suppression of MLCK expression in E14.5 cortical neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>) significantly inhibited their axonal growth (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E, F</xref>). Conversely, the blockade of MLCP activity with PDBu (20 µM; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>) notably augmented cortical neuronal axonal growth (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C, D</xref>).

<title>The local inhibition of MLCP activity at an injury site promoted optic nerve regeneration</title>
<p>Given the promising axon growth-promoting effects observed <italic>in vitro</italic>, we wondered whether inhibiting MLCP activity could stimulate <italic>in vivo</italic> CNS axon regeneration. The optic nerve forms part of the CNS and, like other neurons of the CNS, also has weak intrinsic axon-regenerating ability (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). To test this, the right optic nerve of adult mice was crushed, and PBS or PDBu (50 μM) was applied locally to the lesion site using a gelatin sponge; alternatively, 2 μL of PDBu (50 μM) was microinjected into the vitreous body of another mice. Subsequently, 2 μL of Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) was injected into the vitreous body to anterogradely label regenerating axons. After 3 days, the whole optic nerve was harvested, and CTB-labeled axon regeneration was assessed. The local administration of PDBu using a gelatin sponge resulted in numerous CTB-labeled axon fibers growing over the injury site, the longest being approximately 400 μm long (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-C</xref>). In contrast, local PBS administration at the injury site or intravitreal PDBu injection induced little axon regeneration beyond the lesion site (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-C</xref>). This implied that only the local inhibition of MLCP activity at the injury site boosted optic nerve regeneration.</p>

<title>Local F-actin distribution in the growth cone is regulated by MLCK and MLCP</title>

However, no effect was observed on axonal growth when ML-7 was administrated before cell replating (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A, C</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we demonstrated that peripheral axotomy increases MLCK and MLC phosphorylation levels in adult DRG neurons subsequently. Thus, when MLCK activity was suppressed in mature DRG neurons <italic>via</italic> ML-7- or specific siRNA, axonal growth was blocked in treated neurons both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Conversely, an inhibit in MLCP activity <italic>via</italic> the knockdown of MYPT1 significantly promoted axonal growth in both PNS and CNS neurons. We further found that the MLCK and MLCP primarily regulates F-actin redistribution in the growth cone during the axon regeneration process.</p>
<p>Axon injury leads to disconnection between neurons and their targets, thereby destroying functional circuits and behavioral outputs. This implies that for the successful restoration of impaired nervous system function, injured axons must regenerate to their original targets and reconstruct functional circuits. Interestingly, it has been reported that the coordinated regulation of the neuronal cytoskeleton dynamics is essential for axon shaft extension <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Among them, the microtubule and actin are two of major component of neuronal cytoskeleton that involves axonal extension. For example, Athamneh et al. found that the speed of axon elongation is highly correlated with the bulk forward translocation rate of microtubules <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. In addition, it also has been reported that the axon extension depends on actin assembly and microtubule-actin interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Unsurprisingly given these observations, increasing attention has been paid to promoting axon regeneration <italic>via</italic> the modulation of local cytoskeletal dynamics in the growth cone. Myosin II is a key cytoskeleton protein, which activated through the MLCK-mediated phosphorylation of its light chain and deactivated <italic>via</italic> the dephosphorylation of the N-terminus of its light chain by MLCP. Here, we found that the MLCK expression and phosphorylation level of MLC was increased in adult DRG neurons after sciatic nerve injury, while the inhibition of MLCK blocked axon regeneration. These results indicate that activated MLCK is required for mammalian axon regeneration. If thus, increase of MLCK expression will activate myosin II during axon regeneration. However, in our previous study, we found that pharmacological blockade of myosin II activity with blebbistatin stimulated axon growth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, which suggested that myosin II plays an inhibitory role in this process. This apparent contradiction might be attributed to blebbistatin being a specific inhibitor of non-muscle myosin II ATPase activity and may not affect MLCK activity or the phosphorylation status of MLC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Indeed, blebbistatin treatment did not influence MLC phosphorylation levels in our study, in line with a previous report in which it was found that blebbistatin does not alter the phosphorylation status of MLC in sensory neurons <italic>in vitro</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Additionally, our results demonstrated that blebbistatin treatment could not rescue the inhibitory effect of ML-7 on axon regeneration. These data suggest that the regulatory effect of MLCK on axonal growth may be exerted through different molecular mechanisms. Interestingly, it has been reported that MLCK regulates cell migration not by MLC phosphorylation, but possible MLCK may serve as an F-actin-binding protein stabilizing the F-actin/myosin II network of the membrane cytoskeleton<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Additionally, recent study also identified multiple noncanonical targets of MLCK through CRISPR-Cas9/phosphoproteomics method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, thus it is also possible that MLCK regulates axon growth its noncanonical targets or unknown mechanism. They also found that MLCK plays an important role in vasopressin-induced actin depolymerization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, adult sensory neurons express different isoforms of myosin II, which also exert distinct effects on axonal regeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. For example, the knockdown of myosin IIA enhances axonal growth, while the knockdown of myosin IIB increases F-action retrograde flow and inhibits axon growth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. A study in Neuro-2A cells also revealed that myosin IIA is involved in axon retraction, whereas myosin IIB was reported to contribute to axon extension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Under physiological conditions, MLCP is activated by PKC, and it has been reported that the PKC-mediated activation of myosin II is restricted to the T zone of growth cones; the results of the present study suggest that growth cones require low-to-moderate levels of myosin II activity and F-actin for best growth rates. This observation emphasizes the complexity of the role of myosin II in axonal growth, the precise molecular mechanisms of which require further in-depth investigation.</p>
<p>The inability of neurons in the CNS to regenerate their axons after injury is attributable, at least in part, to the presence of inhibitory molecules at the injury site, including CSPGs and myelin. Here, we found that the inhibition of MLCP activity with PDBu or the siRNA-mediated knockdown of MYPT1 promoted axonal growth in adult sensory neurons over both CSPG and myelin substrates. Our findings also further indicated that the local inhibition of MLCP by PDBu not only induces axon regeneration in peripheral sensory neurons but also promotes axon regeneration in the optic nerve. Studies have shown that MLCK possesses several actin-binding domains to which F-actin can bind and form bundles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> and that directional growth cone motility during axon growth is controlled by actin-based machinery. Growth cone movement during axon growth is achieved through protrusion towards attractive guidance cues and retraction from repulsive ones in an actin-dependent manner. In the classic molecular clutch model, strong mechanical coupling between the F-actin cytoskeleton and the substrate, mediated by cell adhesion complexes, transmits the forces generated by the cytoskeleton into rearward traction forces, enabling the forward movement of the growth cone. Our results indicated that treating DRG neurons with ML-7 induces the increases F-actin content in the growth cone. Conversely, the inhibition of MLCP following PDBu administration resulted in decreased F-actin content. Our findings are consistent with the results of a previous study on Helisoma, in which treatment with ML-7 increased F-actin content at the C/P-domain interface, thus inhibiting axonal regeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. This suggests that MLCK or MLCP may control mammalian axonal regeneration by regulating growth cone F-actin distribution. Together, our findings indicate that directly targeting growth cone cytoskeleton components may be a promising strategy for promoting mammalian axon regeneration.</p>

<p>This paper examines the role of MLCK (myosin light chain kinase) and MLCP (myosin light chain phosphatase) in axon regeneration. Using loss-of-function approaches based on small molecule inhibitors and siRNA knockdown, the authors explore axon regeneration in cell culture and in animal models. Their evidence shows that MLCK activity facilitates axon extension/regeneration, while MLCP prevents it.</p>
<p>Major concern:</p>
<p>A global inconsistency in the conclusions of the authors is evident when trying to understand the role of NMII in axon growth and to understand the present results in light of previous reports by the authors and many others on the role of NMII in axon extension. The discussion of the matter fails to acknowledge a vast literature on how NMII activity is regulated. The authors study enzymes responsible for the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of NMII, referring to something that is strongly proven elsewhere, that phosphorylation activates NMII and dephosphorylation deactivates it. The authors mention their own previous evidence using inhibitors of NMII ATPase activity (blebbistatin, Bleb for short) and inhibitors of a kinase that phosphorylates NMII (ROCK), highlighting that Bleb increases axon growth. Since Bleb inhibits the ATPase activity of NMII, it follows that NMII is in itself an inhibitor of axon growth, and hence when NMII is inhibited, the inhibition on axon growth is relieved, and axonal growth takes place (REF1). It is known that NMII exists in an inactive folded state, and ser19 phosphorylation (by MLCK or ROCK) extends the protein, allowing NMII filament formation, ATPase activity, and force generation on actin filaments (REF2). From this, it is derived that if MLCK is inhibited, then there is no NMII phosphorylation, and hence no NMII activity, and, according to their previous work, this should promote axon growth. On the contrary, the authors show the opposite effect: in the lack of phospho-MLC, authors show axon growth inhibition.</p>
<p>Reporting evidence challenging previous conclusions is common business in scientific endeavors, but the problem with the current manuscript is that it fails to point to and appropriately discuss this contradiction. Instead, the authors refer to the fact that MLCK and Bleb inhibit NMII in different steps of the activation process. While this is true, this explanation does not solve the contradiction. There are many options to accommodate the information, but it is not the purpose of this revision to provide them. Since the manuscript is focused solely on phosphorylation states of MLC and axon extension, the claims are simply at odds with the current literature, and this important finding, if true, is not properly discussed.</p>
<p>What follows is a discussion of the merits and limitations of different claims of the manuscript in light of the evidence presented.</p>
<p>(1) Using western blot and immunohistochemical analyses, authors first show that MLCK expression is increased in DRG sensory neurons following peripheral axotomy, concomitant to an increase in MLC phosphorylation, suggesting a causal effect (Figure 1). The authors claim that it is common that axon growth-promoting genes are upregulated. It would have been interesting at this point to study in this scenario the regulation of MLCP, which is a main subject in this work, and expect its downregulation.</p>
<p>(2) Using DRG cultures and sciatic nerve crush in the context of MLCK inhibition and down-regulation, authors conclude that MLCK activity is required for mammalian peripheral axon regeneration both in vitro and in vivo (Figure 2).</p>
<p>The in vitro evidence is of standard methods and convincing. However, here, as well as in all other experiments using siRNAs, it is not clear what the control is about (the identity of the plasmids and sequences, if any).</p>
<p>Related to this, it is not helpful to show the same exact picture as a control example in Figures 2 and 3 (panels J and E, respectively). Either because they should not have received the same control treatment, or simply because it raises concern that there are no other control examples worth showing. In these images, it is not also clear where and how the crush site is determined in the GFP channel. This is of major importance since the axonal length is measured from the presumed crush site. Apart from providing further details in the text, the authors should include convincing images.</p>
<p>(3) The authors then examined the role of the phosphatase MLCP in axon growth during regeneration. The authors first use a known MLCP blocker, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), to show that is able to increase the levels of p-MLC, with a concomitant increase in the extent of axon regrowth of DRG neurons, both in permissive as well as non-permissive. The authors repeat the experiments using the knockdown of MYPT1, a key component of the MLC-phosphatase, and again can observe a growth-promoting effect (Figure 3).</p>
<p>The authors further show evidence for the growth-enhancing effect in vivo, in nerve crush experiments. The evidence in vivo deserves more evidence and experimental details (see comment 2). Some key weaknesses of the data were mentioned previously (unclear RNAi controls and duplication of shown images), but in this case, it is also not clear if there is a change only in the extent of growth, or also in the number of axons that are able to regenerate.</p>
<p>(4) In the next set of experiments (presented in Figure 4) authors extend the previous observations in primary cultures from the CNS. For that, they use cortical and hippocampal cultures, and pharmacological and genetic loss-of-function using the above-mentioned strategies. The expected results were obtained in both CNS neurons: inhibition or knockdown of the kinase decreases axon growth, whereas inhibition or knockdown of the phosphatase increases growth. A main weakness in this set is that it is not indicated when (at what day in vitro, DIV) the treatments are performed. This is important to correctly interpret the results, since in the first days in vitro these neurons follow well-characterized stages of development, with characteristic cellular events with relevance to what is being evaluated. Importantly, this would be of value to understand whether the treatments affect axonal specification and/or axonal extension. Although these events are correlated, they imply a different set of molecular events.</p>
<p>The title of this section is misleading: line 241 &quot;MLCK/MLCP activity regulated axon growth in the embryonic CNS&quot;... the title (and the conclusion) implies that the experiments were performed in situ, looking at axons in the developing brain. The most accurate title and conclusion should mention that the evidence was collected in CNS primary cultures derived from embryos.</p>
<p>(5) Performing nerve crush injury in CNS nerves (optic nerve and spinal cord), and the local application of PBDu, the author shows contrasting results (Figure 5). In the ON nerve, they can see axons extending beyond the lesion site due to PBDu. On the contrary, the authors fail to observe so in the corticospinal tract present in the spinal cord. The authors fail to discuss this matter in detail. Also, they accommodate the interpretation of the evidence in light of a process known as axon retraction, and its prevention by MLCP inhibition. Since the whole paper is on axon extension, and it is known that mechanistically axon retraction is not merely the opposite of axon extension, the claim needs far more evidence.</p>
<p>In panel 5F and the supplementary data, the authors mention the occurrence of retraction bulbs, but the images are too small to support the claim, and it is not clear how these numbers were normalized to the number of axons labeled in each condition.</p>
<p>(6) The author combines MLCK and MLCP inhibitors with Bleb, trying to verify if both pairs of inhibitors act on the same target/pathway (Figure 6). The rationale is wrong for at least two reasons.</p>
<p>
a- Because both lines of evidence point to contrasting actions of NMII on axon growth, one approach could never &quot;rescue&quot; the other.</p>
<p>
b- Because the approaches target different steps on NMII activation, one could never &quot;prevent&quot; or rescue the other. For example, for Bleb to provide a phenotype, it should find any p-MLC, because it is only that form of MLC that is capable of inhibiting its ATPase site. In light of this, it is not surprising that Bleb is unable to exert any action in a situation where there is no p-MLC (ML-7, which by inhibiting the kinase drives the levels of p-MLC to zero, Figure 4A). Hence, the results are not possible to validate in the current general interpretation of the authors. (See 'major concern').</p>
<p>(7) In Figure 7, the authors argue that the scheme of replating and using ML7 before or after replating is evidence for a local cytoskeletal action of the drug. However, an alternative simpler explanation is that the drug acts acutely on its target, and that, as such, does not &quot;survive&quot; the replating procedure. Hence, the conclusion raised by the evidence shown is not supported.</p>
<p>(8) In Figure 8, the authors show that the inhibitory treatments on MLCK and MLCP (ML7 and PRBu) alter the morphology of growth cones. However, it is not clear how this is correlated with axon growth. The authors also mention in various parts of the text that a local change in the growth cone is evidence for a local action/activity of the drug or enzyme. However the local change&lt;-&gt;local action is not a logical truth. It can well be that MLCK and MLCP activity trigger molecular events that ultimately have an effect elsewhere, and by looking at &quot;elsewhere&quot; one observes of course a local effect, but is not because the direct action of MLCK or MLCP are localized. To prove true localized effects there are numerous efforts that can be made, starting from live imaging, fluorescent sensors, and compartmentalized cultures, just to mention a few.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Saijilafu et al. demonstrate that MLCK/MLCP proteins promote axonal regeneration in both the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) using primary cultures of adult DRG neurons, hippocampal and cortical neurons, as well as in vivo experiments involving sciatic nerve injury, spinal cord injury, and optic nerve crush. The authors show that axon regrowth is possible across different contexts through genetic and pharmacological manipulation of these proteins. Additionally, they propose that MLCK/MLCP may regulate F-actin reorganization in the growth cone, which is significant as it suggests a novel strategy for promoting axonal regeneration.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This manuscript presents a comprehensive array of experimental models, addressing the biological question in a broad manner. Particularly noteworthy is the use of multiple in vivo models, which significantly strengthens the overall validity of the study.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The following aspects apply:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript initially references prior research by the authors suggesting that NMII inhibition enhances axonal growth and that MLCK activates NMII. However, the study introduces a contradiction by demonstrating that MLCK inhibition (via ML-7 or siMLCK) inhibits axonal growth. This inconsistency is not adequately addressed or discussed in the manuscript.</p>
<p>(2) While the study proposes that MLCK/MLCP regulates F-actin redistribution in the growth cone, the mechanism is not explored in depth. The only figure showing how pharmacological manipulation affects the growth cone suggests that not only F-actin but also the microtubule cytoskeleton might be affected, indicating that the mechanism may not be specific. A deeper exploration of this relationship in DRG neurons, in addition to cortical neurons, as shown in the study, would be beneficial.</p>
<p>(3) In the sciatic nerve injury experiments, it would be crucial to include additional controls that clearly demonstrate that siMYPT1 treatment increases MLCP in the L4-L5 ganglia. Additionally, although the manuscript mentions quantifying axons expressing EGFP, the Materials and Methods section only discusses siMYPT1 electroporation, which could lead to confusion.</p>
<p>(4) In some panels, it is difficult to differentiate the somas from the background (Figures 3, 4, 7). In conditions where images with shorter axonal lengths are represented, it is unclear whether this is due to fewer cells or reduced axonal growth (Figures 2, 4, 6).</p>
