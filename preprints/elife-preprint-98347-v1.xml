<abstract>
<p>Animal behavior is adapted to the sensory environment in which it evolved, while also being constrained by physical limits, evolutionary history, and developmental trajectories. The hunting behavior of larval zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>), a cyprinid native to streams in Eastern India, has been well characterized. However, it is unknown if the complement and sequence of movements employed during prey capture by zebrafish is universal across freshwater teleosts. Here, we explore the syntax of prey capture behavior in larval fish belonging to the clade <italic>Percomorpha</italic>, whose last common ancestor with cyprinids lived ∼240 million years ago. We compared the behavior of four cichlid species endemic to deep benthic parts of Lake Tanganyika (<italic>Lepidiolamprologus attenuatus</italic>, <italic>Lamprologus ocellatus</italic>, and <italic>Neolamprologus multifasciatus</italic>) or inhabiting rivers around that same lake (<italic>Astatotilapia burtoni</italic>) with that of medaka (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>), a fish found in rice paddies in East Asia. Using high speed videography and neural networks, we tracked eye movements and extracted swim kinematics during hunting from these five species. Notably, we found that the repertoire of hunting movements of the cichlids is broader than that of zebrafish, but shares basic features, such as eye convergence, positioning of prey centrally in the binocular visual field, and discrete prey capture bouts, including two kinds of capture strikes. In contrast, medaka swim continuously, track the prey monocularly without eye convergence, and position prey laterally before capturing them with a side swing. This configuration of kinematic motifs suggests that medaka may judge distance to prey by motion parallax, while cichlids and zebrafish may use binocular visual cues. Together, our study documents the diversification of locomotor and oculomotor adaptations among hunting teleost larvae.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In recent decades, biologists have increasingly relied on a handful of genetically tractable species to study questions related to behavioral mechanisms and their underlying neural circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Devineni &amp; Scaplen, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Piggott et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Zhu &amp; Goodhill, 2023</xref>). However, it is often not clear to what extent these findings in model organisms can be generalized to other taxa or even closely related species. For example, recent comparative behavioral studies in drosophilids that diverged less than 40 mya found differences in both locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">York et al., 2022</xref>) and sequencing of spontaneous behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hernández et al., 2021</xref>). For vertebrates, the zebrafish larva has become a dominant model for understanding the neuronal circuits and pathways controlling innate behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Baier &amp; Scott, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Friedrich et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gahtan &amp; Baier, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Orger &amp; de Polavieja, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Portugues &amp; Engert, 2011</xref>). While many aspects of the visuomotor transformations serving hunting behavior (i. e., search, pursuit, and capture of prey) have been revealed in this species (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Zhu &amp; Goodhill, 2023</xref>), it is not known if strategies employed by zebrafish are representative of those across larval teleosts or if they constitute a derived adaptation to the zebrafish’s specific ecological niche. Such knowledge would allow a search for conservation, or divergence, of neural circuit implementations across species.</p>
<p>Here, we applied advances in computational ethology, such as automated tracking with deep neural networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Mathis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Pereira et al., 2019</xref>) and unsupervised analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Berman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Marques et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mearns et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Wiltschko et al., 2015</xref>) to compare hunting behavior of zebrafish to the Japanese rice fish, medaka (<italic>O. latipes</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Mano &amp; Tanaka, 2012</xref>) and four cichlids from Lake Tanganyika (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">El Taher et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Higham et al., 2007</xref>). Medaka and cichlids belong to a diverse clade of teleosts known as percomorphs, whose last common ancestor with ostariophysi, such as zebrafish, goldfish, and Mexican cavefish, lived ∼240 mya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Betancur-R et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). While medaka and cichlids are only distantly related (∼100 mya; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Betancur-R et al., 2017</xref>), the haplochromine species and the three lamprologine species studied here diverged recently, within the past 3 million years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ronco et al., 2021</xref>). We discovered that swim kinematics and the use of eye movements differ qualitatively and quantitatively between these species. This divergence may be driven, in part, by differences in the sensorineural mechanisms underlying prey detection.</p>

<title>Artificial neural networks track swimming behavior and eye movements in percomorph larvae</title>
<p>At five to seven days post fertilization (dpf), zebrafish larvae robustly feed on paramecia. At 12 dpf, they are able to eat the larger and more nutritious artemia. To stage-match larvae of different species to zebrafish, we determined the age at which they clearly pursued prey (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). When placed into a dish, cichlid larvae started feeding later than zebrafish, from 12-14 dpf, and could be fed artemia right away. Medaka started feeding at approximately 10 dpf, a stage where they are unable to eat artemia, due to their small size. We adapted an experimental paradigm used to study prey capture in zebrafish to these other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mearns et al., 2020</xref>). Individual larvae were placed in chambers with prey items (either artemia for cichlids or paramecia for medaka). We recorded each animal for 15 minutes using a high-speed camera (<bold>Suppl. Videos 1-5</bold>, <bold>Methods</bold>). We then used neural networks to extract tail pose, eye movements, and prey locations from videos (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Turning to neural networks allowed us to train models to efficiently and accurately track the tail pose and eye movements in species characterized by varying morphological features (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref><bold>; Suppl. Video 6</bold>). We trained a 12-point SLEAP model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Pereira et al., 2022</xref>) to track the tail, and a 7-point model to track the eyes of larvae (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E, F</xref>). We tracked prey position using YOLO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Redmon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). We subsequently used these estimated pose dynamics and prey location information to compare hunting and swimming across species.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Larvae of different species have diverse swim patterns</title>
<p>At the first-feeding stage, zebrafish larvae swim in discrete, discontinuous bouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Budick &amp; O’Malley, 2000</xref>), which merge into continuous swimming at the juvenile stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Westphal &amp; O’Malley, 2013</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Danionella cerebrum</italic>, a close relative of zebrafish, exhibits slow continuous swimming already as larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Rajan et al., 2022</xref>). It is not known how larval swimming patterns differ between more distantly related species.</p>
<p>We found marked variation in the continuity of swimming in early percomorph larvae (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref><bold>; Suppl. Fig. 1</bold>). On one extreme, medaka (OL) and <italic>A. burtoni</italic> (AB) swam with a “motorboating” style characterized by sustained, uninterrupted tail undulations over many seconds with only short breaks between swimming episodes, similar to <italic>Danionella</italic>. On the other extreme, <italic>L. ocellatus</italic> (LO) and <italic>N. multifasciatus</italic> (NM) had an intermittent swimming style, often resting at the bottom of the chamber for minutes at a time with quiescent periods interrupted by short, rapid bursts of activity. <italic>L. attenuatus</italic> (LA) showed a behavior intermediate to these extremes, alternating between rapid tail beating and quiescence, each lasting on the order of a few seconds, a discontinuous style similar to zebrafish.</p>
<p>Analyses across the animal kingdom suggest that behavior is organized into sub-second kinematic motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Berman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Stephens et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Tinbergen, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Wiltschko et al., 2015</xref>). Inspecting periods of swimming across percomorph species revealed significant substructure within swimming episodes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref><bold>; Suppl. Fig. 1</bold>). We segmented continuous tail traces into discrete bouts using a change detection algorithm adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mearns et al., 2020</xref> (see <bold>Methods</bold>), which revealed changes in swim kinematics occuring on the order of tens to hundreds of milliseconds (median seconds: 0.33, LO; 0.29, NM; 0.38, LA; 0.36, AB; 0.49, OL). Furthermore, medaka exhibited significantly longer swims than cichlids (p &lt; 0.001, KS test) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). These results highlight differences in how fish larvae pattern their swim episodes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Larvae of different species use diverse strategies to hunt prey</title>
<p>Zebrafish larvae converge their eyes at the onset of hunting episodes, and keep their eyes converged over the course of prey capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bianco et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Patterson et al., 2013</xref>). Eye convergence aids prey capture by bringing prey into a binocular zone in the central visual field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gahtan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gebhardt et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>During pursuit of prey, cichlids exhibited eye convergence similar to zebrafish. We did not observe a hunting episode in any of the four cichlid species in which eyes were not converged. In striking contrast, medaka did not converge their eyes. We plotted the distributions of eye convergence angles for each species and found that two peaks in the distribution of eye convergence angles were visible in LA. Other cichlids also spent significant time with their eyes converged, more than 50 degrees (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). To test whether two eye convergence states also existed in these species, we fitted Gaussian mixture models to the eye convergence data of each species with one or two components. For all species except medaka, modeling the data using two underlying distributions provided a better fit than a single distribution (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). The unimodal distribution of eye vergence angles in medaka was also present when we plotted the joint distribution of left and right eye angles (<bold>Suppl. Fig. 2</bold>), indicating that this species does not perform eye convergence in our behavioral assay. Taken together, these results are in line with our observations that cichlids converge their eyes during hunting, while medaka do not, and justify the use of eye convergence to identify hunting events in the four cichlid species.</p>

</fig>
<p>The correlation of eye convergence and prey pursuit enabled us to measure the frequency and duration of hunting episodes in the four cichlids (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). This analysis could not be extended to medaka on a sufficient scale, due to their lack of eye convergence and the poor visibility of paramecia in our setup. We determined that LO, NM, and AB spent less than 10% of the time hunting (median proportions: 0.064, LO; 0.036, NM; 0.096, AB). LA, on the other hand, spent about a quarter of the time actively engaged in prey capture, with all individuals tested spending at least 10% of their time and one individual spending over 40% of the time hunting (median: 0.25, p-values &lt; 0.05 comparing LA to all other species, Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction).</p>
<p>Surprisingly, although LO, NM and AB all spent comparable total time engaged in prey capture, AB initiated hunts at a much higher rate, similar to LA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) (median hunts/min: 2.45, LO; 1.98, NM; 6.85, LA; 8.49, AB; p-values &lt; 0.05 comparing either LO or NM to LA or AB, Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction). AB hunts were also shorter than other species, while LA hunts tended to be longer (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E-F</xref>). LO and NM individual hunt durations were similar to each other and intermediate to the other species (medians across fish (seconds): 1.12, LO; 1.14, NM; 1.77, LA; 0.73, AB). Despite these differences in time engaged in prey capture, species consumed prey at similar rates of approximately one artemia per minute (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, our results highlight differences among closely related cichlids in hunting behavior, at least in our setup and at the stages examined. LA are the most persistent hunters, initiating prey capture often and spending a longer time engaged in the behavior once initiated (<bold>Suppl. Video 1</bold>). In contrast, AB prey capture dynamics are characterized by a high rate of short-duration hunting episodes (<bold>Suppl. Video 4</bold>). Both LA and AB actively hunt in our behavioral assay, while LO and NM initiate prey capture rarely, spending much time resting at the bottom of the chamber and moving only occasionally when they dart towards prey (<bold>Suppl. Videos 2&amp;3</bold>).</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Cichlids center prey within a strike zone</title>
<p>Zebrafish larvae strike at prey once it is localized in the center of their binocular visual field and ∼0.5 mm away (the “strike zone”) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mearns et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Patterson et al., 2013</xref>). This centering behavior is impaired when animals are blinded in one eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mearns et al., 2020</xref>). To test whether cichlids similarly center prey within a strike zone, we identified the most likely targeted artemia during each hunting episode and studied how the prey moved through the visual field as hunting sequences progressed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, see <bold>Methods</bold>) (number of events: 176 for LO; 361 for NM; 756 for LA). This revealed that, within each prey capture sequence, prey became increasingly localized to the near central visual field over time. Computing kernel density estimates of prey distributions at the beginning, middle, and end of each hunting episode revealed that cichlids initiate prey capture at a wide range of distances and that they center prey in the visual field in the early stages of a hunting sequence (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). For instance, the azimuthal angle of prey only decreased over the start of the hunting episode (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>) (p-value &gt; 0.05, bootstrap test difference between medians at middle and end of prey capture). They then subsequently close the distance between themselves and their prey over the latter half of a hunt sequence (p-value &lt; 0.001, bootstrap test difference between medians). On average, the cichlids’ eyes converged when prey were ∼5 mm away (median distance, mm: 5.43, LO; 3.98, NM; 4.17, LA). However, LO, NM, and LA could detect prey up to 15 mm away (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). LA often initiated prey capture when artemia were already in the center of the visual field (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A, B</xref><bold> &amp; D</bold>).</p>

<p>In all cichlid species analyzed, prey were highly localized to a central strike zone ∼1-2 mm away at the end of prey capture (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-C</xref>). In NM, we observed a second peak in prey distance at double the length (∼3 mm) of the most frequently used distance. This peak corresponds to events where NM aborted prey capture prior to the strike. The tails of the distributions in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref> are, similarly, due to a significant number of aborted hunting events. Together, these results demonstrate that cichlids are able to detect prey at a large distance and possess the fine sensorimotor control required to localize prey to a strike zone.</p>

<title>Fish larvae of different species share a common pose space</title>
<p>Zebrafish larvae have a unique swim repertoire during prey capture, which is distinct from exploratory swim bouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Borla et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">McElligott &amp; O’Malley, 2005</xref>). During prey capture, these swims each mediate distinct transformations of the visual scene: J-turns center prey in the visual field, approach swims bring prey to the strike zone, and strikes are deployed to capture prey. A limited repertoire of pose positions allows for the capture of variation in tail shape over time with a greatly reduced number of dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Johnson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Marques et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mearns et al., 2020</xref>).

The first three PCs were similar across species (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>), suggesting that animals that share a common body plan exhibit similar low-dimensional pose-spaces.</p>

<title>Hunting sequences in cichlids share kinematic motifs with zebrafish but are more complex</title>
<p>A common low-dimensional pose space in drosophilids has aided with the identification of evolutionary trajectories in behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">York et al., 2022</xref>). We therefore wanted to investigate the trajectories through pose space of cichlids and medaka to understand if they share common behaviors during hunting, or if their behaviors have diverged over evolution. For each species, we projected the time series of rostrocaudal tail angles for each distinct bout onto the first three principal components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mearns et al., 2020</xref>). We then performed affinity propagation to identify clusters corresponding to different swim types and performed t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (TSNE) to visualize these clusters in a low-dimensional embedding (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D, E</xref><bold>, Suppl. Fig. 3</bold>). We found between 11 (LO) and 32 (AB) behavioral clusters per species. AB and LA held the richest behavioral repertoires, reflecting the more elaborate prey pursuit behaviors in these species (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref><bold>, Suppl. Fig. 3</bold>). The number of clusters we find is on par with or greater than the bout types that have been found in zebrafish larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Marques et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mearns et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar to zebrafish, we found that cichlids have specific kinematic motifs for prey capture (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). Some of these swims share characteristics with hunting bouts previously described in zebrafish, such as J-turns and approach swims, but we also identify new types that do not have clear analogs in zebrafish (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). For example, cichlid larvae often “hover” in place, oscillating their tail without any forward movement (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). Such behaviors tend to be longer lasting than approach swims. During hunting, cichlids will alternate between approaches and these hover swims. Another feature of cichlid hunting behavior not present in zebrafish is tail coiling. Here, the tail coils into an S-shape over many hundreds of milliseconds leading up to a strike. The coil is released in a spring-loaded attack to capture prey (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I</xref>). In addition to such capture springs, we have also observed suction captures and ram-like attack swims in cichlids.</p>
<p>Following the strike, cichlids exhibit a range of behavioral maneuvers not present in zebrafish. In cases where capture strikes miss, cichlid larvae may swim backwards to recenter prey in the visual field and initiate a second strike (<bold>Suppl. Video 8</bold>). We also observed that, after a successful capture, cichlid larvae may expel prey from their mouth (<bold>Suppl. Video 7</bold>). Such “spitting” behavior often triggered another attempt to capture the same prey and was particularly common in LA. Repeated attempts at capturing the same prey explain the high incidence of hunt initiations when prey are already in the central visual field in this species (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A, B</xref><bold> &amp; D</bold>). The function of spitting is not clear, and it might indicate that the prey are slightly too large for LA to swallow. Alternatively, such a behavior may possibly be adaptive, providing already sated animals the opportunity to practice hunting without overeating. We also find that cichlid captures often occur in two phases, with the prey first being caught by the pharyngeal jaws (a second, internal set of jaws present in cichlids; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Liem 1973</xref>) before being ingested. Together, these results reveal a richer behavioral repertoire for pursuing, capturing, and reorienting towards missed prey in cichlids than in zebrafish.</p>

<title>Cichlids share two common capture strikes that are distinct from medaka side-swing strikes</title>
<p>Studies in invertebrates have demonstrated that behavior can evolve through changing the kinematics of a behavior performed in a given sensory context (Ding et al., 2016), changing which sensory cues drive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Seeholzer et al., 2018</xref>), or changing the transition frequencies between a common set of kinematic motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hernández et al., 2021</xref>). It is not known to what extent these factors play a role in the evolution of vertebrate behaviors, nor the evolutionary timescales over which behaviors diverge to the point of becoming distinct. To address this question, we focused on the capture strike kinematics of cichlids and medaka. The capture strike of zebrafish larvae has been extensively characterized, consisting of two distinct types: the attack swim and S-strike. These strikes are deployed variably, dependent on experience and different prey distances (Lagogiannis et al., 2020; McClenahan et al., 2012; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mearns et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Patterson et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Medaka swimming is nearly continuous, and their eyes do not converge during prey capture. Nevertheless, medaka may still perform different behaviors during spontaneous swimming and prey capture. Investigating clusters of behavior in medaka revealed types of swim that are similar to prey capture bouts of cichlids and zebrafish. These included J-turns, approach swims, and slow swims (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>). The presence of these swims suggests that medaka, like other species studied, may also have a separate suite of behaviors reserved for prey capture. Remarkably, we found that medaka did not strike at prey in the central visual but rather captured prey in the lateral visual field with a unique side-swing behavior (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H-J</xref>). Although the eyes do not converge, there is sometimes a slight nasalward rotation of the ipsilateral eye leading up to and during the side swing (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I</xref>).</p>
<p>To confirm that side-swing behavior was unique to medaka, we clustered capture strikes of cichlids and medaka after projecting their tail kinematics into the common pose space, setting the number of clusters to the number of species (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). We reasoned that if bouts were similar within each species but different between species, cluster identity would correlate with species identity. In contrast, if species shared similar kinematic motifs, clusters would contain bouts from all species. We found that strikes from all cichlid species were similar to each other, while the medaka side-swing strike was unique (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4K</xref>).</p>
<p>This analysis uncovered at least two kinematically distinct capture strikes in cichlids. The slower of these behaviors is similar to the zebrafish attack swim, characterized by a symmetric undulation of the tail about the midline which propels the fish towards the prey, while the faster corresponds to the capture spring. The S-shape of the tail leading up to the capture spring shares structural similarities with the S-strike of zebrafish larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mearns et al., 2020</xref>), differing primarily in the time course over which they occur. The S-strike of zebrafish may represent an accelerated form of the capture spring, forming and releasing over tens of milliseconds rather than hundreds of milliseconds seen in cichlids or, vice versa, the capture spring may represent an augmentation of the S-strike.</p>

<title>Different prey capture strategies may reflect different sensorineural solutions to prey detection</title>
<p>Centralized prey and converged eyes in cichlids suggest that the mechanism they use to determine the distance to prey could be similar to that of zebrafish. One possibility is that these species use binocular disparity to judge depth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Qian, 1997</xref>). In contrast, we hypothesized that medaka might use a different, monocular strategy to judge the distance to prey, such as motion parallax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Yoonessi &amp; Baker, 2011</xref>). These two mechanisms of depth perception make different predictions about how larvae should approach prey to make best use of visual cues (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4M</xref>). To investigate these possibilities, we computed the change in heading leading up to a strike as a proxy for the change in visual angle of the prey for cichlids and medaka (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4N</xref>). We found that the rate of change in heading was greater in medaka than in cichlids (median degrees/second: -13.4, LA; -34.1, OL; p &lt; 0.001, Mann-Whitney U-test). These results are consistent with cichlids using binocular cues, such as binocular disparity, to determine distance to prey, while medaka may employ a monocular strategy.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have found that zebrafish and cichlids share the same general hunting strategy: striking at prey localized to a binocular strike zone while the eyes are converged, with two distinct capture bout types. The similarities are remarkable, given these species diverged 240 million years ago (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). In contrast, medaka, which are phylogenetically intermediate to zebrafish and cichlids, deploy a different hunting strategy: striking at prey laterally in the monocular visual field with a side-swing behavior. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> provides a schematic summary of similarities and differences among the teleost larvae investigated. Characterization of prey capture behavior in a wider range of species could reveal whether the similarities between zebrafish and cichlids represent conservation of an ancestral hunting strategy or convergent evolution.</p>

<caption><p>Schematic of hunting strategies in teleost larvae. Top: prey capture in zebrafish larvae (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) begins with eye convergence and a J-turn to orient towards the prey. The prey is then approached with a series of low amplitude approach swims. Once in range in the central visual field, the prey is captured with an attack swim or an S-strike. Middle: prey capture in cichlids (represented by <italic>L. attenuatus</italic>) also begins with eye convergence and a J-turn. Prey is approached with a wide variety of tail movements. The prey is captured when it is in the central visual field with either an attack swim, or a capture spring, during which the tail coils over several hundreds of milliseconds. Bottom: prey capture in medaka begins with reorienting J-like turns, but these do not centralize prey in the visual field. Instead, the prey is kept lateral in the visual field and is captured with a side swing.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>What sensorineural mechanisms might underlie these two different hunting strategies? The side swing of medaka is reminiscent of hunting in (adult) blind cavefish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lloyd et al., 2018</xref>), which position prey laterally prior to strikes using their mechanosensory lateral line. Adult cichlids are known to use their lateral line for prey capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Schwalbe et al., 2016</xref>), and some percomorph species exhibit both an S-shaped and a sideways capture strategy as adults. Therefore, it is conceivable that medaka larvae do not rely on vision to the same extent for hunting, but use their lateral line instead. However, lateral-line use is not uncoupled from eye convergence across the teleost clade. Zebrafish larvae can still hunt in the dark, as do blind zebrafish <italic>lakritz</italic> mutants, albeit with greatly reduced efficacy, and with their eyes converged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gahtan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mearns et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Patterson et al., 2013</xref>). Early-stage cave fish, which evolved from sighted surface ancestors and are completely blind, exhibit vestigial eye convergence movements during prey capture before their eyes fully degenerate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Espinasa et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Espinasa &amp; Lewis, 2023</xref>). This comparative evidence suggests that the teleost brain employs cues from both sensory modalities, if available, to locate prey, but that eye movements are a poor predictor of the dominance of vision.</p>
<p>On the other hand, species that attack centrally located prey could be using different visual cues to judge prey distance than those that use a side swing to ingest food: binocular disparity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Qian, 1997</xref>) vs. motion parallax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Yoonessi &amp; Baker, 2011</xref>). Zebrafish use binocular information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gahtan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gebhardt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Henriques et al., 2019</xref>) and stationary differences such as brightness and contrast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Khan et al., 2023</xref>) to estimate depth and distance. Here we have shown that cichlid larvae also likely use binocular cues, while medaka’s approach to prey conforms to a monocular strategy (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4M, N</xref>). Strikingly, cichlid and zebrafish larvae swim in bouts with intermittent pauses. We speculate that the pauses may serve to sample the distance to the prey by comparing its position across the two eyes. In contrast, to sample motion cues, it is advantageous to perform continuous glides (“motorboating”) and swim lateral to the prey up until it is close enough for a sideways strike. Thus, natural selection may have favored specific locomotor (bouts vs. glides) and oculomotor (convergent vs. divergent) adaptations of behavioral control depending on the dominant distance measurement mechanism (binocular vs. monocular) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). While the behavioral evidence for this conjunction is still circumstantial and calls for further comparative work, this scenario makes testable predictions about its neurobiological and genetic implementation.</p>
<p>We have demonstrated that eye convergence is not always a hallmark of prey capture in fish larvae, and that multiple, kinematically distinct capture swims exist at these early stages in different species. We speculate that ocular vergence angles and swim kinematics for prey capture might co-evolve, with S-shaped captures and attack swims being associated with convergent eyes and side-swing captures occuring in the absence of eye convergence. These two strategies may have been present in a common ancestor of teleosts, with one or the other becoming dominant in certain lineages. Comparing neural circuitry across these (now) experimentally tractable animals could help pinpoint evolvable synaptic network nodes (“hotspots” of evolutionary change; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Roberts et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Seeholzer et al., 2018</xref>) and genetic loci that underlie prey localization strategies and swim kinematics in fishes.</p>

<p>To track the tail and eyes we trained neural networks using SLEAP (Social Leap Estimates Animal Poses) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Pereira et al., 2022</xref>). We designed a 12-point skeleton to track the tail (left eye center, right eye center, rostral tip, swim bladder and eight points along the tail), and a 7-point skeleton to track the eyes (swim bladder, and a nasal, central and temporal point on the perimeter of each eye).</p>

Convergence phases coincided with hunting events. For medaka (<italic>O. latipes</italic>), a two-mixture model performed marginally worse than the single distribution model.</p>

<title>Identification of hunting episodes</title>
<p>To identify periods of hunting in cichlids, we computed the probability of eye convergence in each frame as the probability it belonged to the Gaussian mixture with the higher mean. This yielded a time series of eye convergence probability, which we smoothed with a 200 ms rolling mean. We defined a hunting episode as any continuous period where the probability of eye convergence was above 50%, with the additional condition that that convergence probability was above 80% for at least half this period.</p>

<title>Tail kinematic analysis</title>
<p>We tracked eight equally spaced points from the tail base to the tail tip in each frame using the whole body SLEAP model (see above). In each frame, we represented the shape of a tail as a seven-dimensional vector, computed by calculating the angle between a line through each consecutive pair of tail points and the heading vector (from the swimbladder to the midpoint between the eyes).</p>
<sec id="s4g1">
<title>Principal component analysis (PCA) and data curation</title>
<p>To reduce the dimensionality of pose data, we performed PCA as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mearns et al., 2020</xref>). We concatenated the seven-dimensional tail vectors in time (all animals pooled, grouped by species, or for all species combined). We z-scored the data matrix prior to PCA by subtracting the mean angle at each point and dividing by the standard deviation. This ensures equal weighting of all points of the tail during PCA, since otherwise loadings in the principal components would be biased towards points closer to the tail tip, potentially missing subtle but important curvature in the rostral trunk.</p>
<p>PCA provides a set of principal components (PCs; orthogonal vectors, representing some loading across the input dimensions), each associated with an eigenvalue (variance in the data captured by that component). Each principal component can be represented as an “eigenfish” by mapping the raw loadings multiplied by some scalar back into the original space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mearns et al., 2020</xref>). In all cases, we found that three components were sufficient to capture over 90% of the variance in the data, and so for subsequent analyses we represented tail kinematics by a time varying three-dimensional vector representing the projection of the tail shape onto the first three PCs in each frame.</p>
<p>Since we were unable to track every tail point in every frame of our data, we performed some interpolation to fill in missing frames in our tracking. For any period where there was a gap of four or fewer frames (≤ 10 ms) of missing tracking data, we inferred the tail shape using a cubic spline interpolation in each PC dimension. Gaps greater than four frames were excluded from our analyses. We found that tracking errors were easiest to detect by inspecting the weight of the third PC in each frame. Therefore, we excluded frames where the absolute value of this PC exceeded 10 standard deviations (or 5, in the case of <italic>A. burtoni</italic>). We linearly interpolated tail kinematics so that all trials had a common sample rate in cases where the frame rates of videos did not match.</p>

<title>Segmentation</title>
<p>We adapted our previously published bout detection algorithm for zebrafish larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mearns et al., 2020</xref>) to segment the more continuous swimming behavior of the larval species used in this study. This algorithm involves five steps:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The tail is represented as a single-dimensional time series by computing the L2 norm in PC space for each frame.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The absolute value of the derivative of this trace was convolved with a Gaussian kernel (St. Dev: 40 ms). This produces a smooth trace with peaks whenever the shape of the tail is changing rapidly in a non-cyclic manner (i.e., at transitions between behaviors).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A threshold was automatically computed by performing a kernel density estimation across all values of this trace (bandwidths: 0.005, NM, AB &amp; OL; 0.01, LA; 0.02, LO). If this generated a bimodal distribution, we set the threshold to the antimode (local minimum) of this distribution; otherwise, we set the threshold to the first inflexion point after the mode.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Peaks in the traces (step 2) that were above the threshold (step 3) were detected (scipy.signal.find_peaks function). Bouts were segmented at local minima between these peaks.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>We performed a round of cleaning to exclude noisy bouts. For each bout, we computed the standard deviation in each PC dimension (low standard deviations in every dimension suggest no tail movement but rather noise in tracking). We then fit a Gaussian mixture model to the three-dimensional space of these standard deviations, and excluded bouts predicted to belong to the mixture with the smallest standard deviation across PC dimensions. For each species we manually set the number of mixture components to exclude most noisy bouts while keeping real movement in the dataset.</p></list-item>
</list>
This pipeline identified the following numbers of bouts in each species: 2,067 (LO); 11,237 (NM); 10,445 (LA); 9,796 (AB); 3,437 (OL).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4g3">
<title>Alignment</title>
<p>Having segmented behavior into individual bouts, we sought to align these bouts for clustering and embedding. Our segmentation algorithm produced bouts of varying duration; however, we reasoned that the most important features of a bout that would distinguish it from others would occur when the tail is in the “most extreme” or characteristic position, so we aligned all bouts to their peak distance in PC space (see segmentation step 1). Then, we truncated or zero-padded the aligned bouts such that we fully encompassed 80% of bout starts (before the peak) and 80% of bout ends (after the peak).</p>
<p>To aid the identification of behavioral clusters we chose to ignore the left/right orientation of bouts. Therefore, we flipped bouts such that at their peaks the tail was always oriented in the same direction. We performed an initial clustering step using ward hierarchical clustering with 30 clusters. For this clustering step, we included each bout and its mirror image to produce symmetric clusters. To determine the directionality of a bout, we computed the mean value of the first PC at the peak of each cluster and used either the original or mirrored version of the bout accordingly. We found flipping bouts based on cluster was more robust than flipping each bout individually, since in many instances the value of the first PC is close to zero at the bout peak, and we wanted to ensure all similar bouts were oriented in the same direction to aid embedding and subsequent clustering.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4g4">
<title>Clustering</title>
<p>To identify behavioral clusters, we performed affinity propagation on the aligned, flipped kinematic motifs. We treated each motif as a single vector, concatenating the time series for each PC. Affinity propagation computes a set of clusters (represented by “exemplar” data points) for a given dataset at a given preference value. Lower preference values produce fewer clusters, so we used the minimum similarity between data points, which is a standard metric for computing a preference value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Frey &amp; Dueck, 2007</xref>). This approach yielded between 11 and 32 clusters per species (11, LO; 23, NM; 29, LA; 32, AB; 17, OL), which is a reasonable number to expect in these data, being the same order as the number of behaviors that have been identified in zebrafish larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Marques et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4g5">
<title>Embedding</title>
<p>To visualize behavior maps, we embedded motifs in a two-dimensional space using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (TSNE) (Maaten &amp; Hinton, 2008), concatenating the time series for each PC such that each motif was represented by a single vector.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4g6">
<title>Prey capture bouts</title>
<p>To assign bouts a prey capture score, we computed the probability of eye convergence (see <italic>eye convergence analysis</italic>, above) at the peak of each bout. We then averaged these probabilities over all bouts belonging to a given cluster to compute the prey capture score for that cluster. Thus, a prey capture score of zero signifies zero probability of eye convergence for all bouts within a cluster, and a prey capture score of one indicates a 100% probability of eye convergence for all bouts within a cluster.</p>

<title>Capture strike analysis</title>
<sec id="s4h1">
<title>Identifying putative strikes</title>
<p>To identify putative capture strikes in cichlids, we found all bouts whose peak coincided with the end of a hunting episode (see <italic>eye convergence analysis</italic>, above), allowing the peak to occur up to 100 ms before and up to 200 ms after the detected end of eye convergence. Since we could not use eye convergence to detect prey capture in medaka, we manually inspected clusters obtained from analyzing tail movements, and found that one of these clusters corresponded to a strike behavior (side swing). For cross-species comparisons, all data were interpolated to a common frame rate of 400 fps. We performed an initial round of clustering on these putative strike bouts (Ward hierarchical clustering with n clusters = 8) and removed small clusters containing fewer than 20 bouts. After this filtering, we had 341 putative strike bouts (16, LO; 31, NM; 191, LA; 59, AB; 44, OL).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4h2">
<title>Clustering strikes</title>
<p>To only consider tail kinematics around the moment of the strike, we truncated bouts to a 150 frame window (375 ms) around the peak. We then clustered these bouts with Ward hierarchical clustering, with the number of clusters set to five (same as the number of species). To determine whether each species had its own unique strike behavior, or whether the same behaviors were shared across species, we computed the confusion matrix using the cluster labels and species identity labels. Two clusters corresponded to abort behaviors in cichlids, two clusters corresponded to cichlid capture strikes (attack swim and capture spring), and one cluster corresponded to medaka side swings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4h3">
<title>Change in heading during prey capture</title>
<p>To compute the change in heading leading up to a strike, we considered a 200 ms window before the peak of each strike bout. So as to not bias our analysis to the rapid changes in heading at the moment of the medaka side swing, we only analyzed heading changes up to 25 ms before the peak of each bout. We virtually rotated and mirrored all capture sequences such that the heading 25 ms before the bout peak was zero, and the mean heading prior to this moment was positive. For each event, we then computed the slope of a regression line (least squares fit).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors used video tracking of 4 larval cichlid species and medaka to quantify prey-capture behaviors.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Comparing these behaviors is in principle an interesting question, and helps to address the typicality of the much better-understood zebrafish model. The authors make a good effort to analyze their data quantitatively.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The overall conclusion, as summarized in the abstract as &quot;Together, our study documents the diversification of locomotor and oculomotor adaptations among hunting teleost larvae&quot; is not that compelling. What would be much more interesting would be to directly relate these differences to different ecological niches (e.g. different types of natural prey, visual scene conditions, height in water column etc), and/or differences in neural circuit mechanisms. While I appreciate that this paper provides a first step on this path, by itself it seems on the verge of stamp collecting, i.e. collecting and cataloging observations without a clear, overarching hypothesis or theoretical framework.</p>
<p>(2) The data to support some of the claims is either weak or lacking entirely.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is a fascinating study about the behavioral kinematics of prey capture in larvae of several fish species (zebrafish, four cichlid species, and medaka). The authors describe in great detail swimming kinematics, hunting movement, eye movement as well as prey capture kinematics across these species. One striking finding is that cichlids and zebrafish use binocular vision to hunt for prey whereas medaka uses a monocular hunting style with a sideways motion to capture prey. The behavioral variation described in this study forms a strong foundation for future studies on the mechanisms underlying variation in hunting styles.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>In general, the paper is well-written and documents very interesting data. The authors used sophisticated analyses that help appreciate the complexity of the behaviors examined. The discussion attempts to place the paper in a broader, comparative context. Overall, this paper reveals novel insight into an important behavior across different teleost species and lays a foundation for future studies on the neural and genetic basis of these distinct swimming and hunting behaviors.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The paper is rather descriptive in nature, although more context is provided in the discussion. Most figures are great, but I think the authors could add a couple of visual aids in certain places to explain how certain components were measured.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper uses 2D pose estimation and quantitative behavioral analyses to compare patterns of prey capture behavior used by six species of freshwater larval fish, including zebrafish, medaka, and four cichlids. The convincing comparison of tail and eye kinematics during hunts reveals that cichlids and zebrafish use binocular vision and similar hunting strategies, but that cichlids make use of an expanded set of action types. The authors also provide convincing evidence that medaka instead use monocular vision during hunts. This finding has important implications for the evolution of distinct distance estimation algorithms used by larval teleost fish species during prey capture.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The quality of the behavioral data is solid and the high frame rate allowed for careful quantification and comparison of eye and tail dynamics during hunts. The statistical approach to assess eye vergence states (Figure 2B) is elegant, the cross-species comparison of prey location throughout each hunt phase is well done (Figure 3B-D), and the demonstration that swim bout tail kinematics from diverse species can be embedded in a shared &quot;canonical&quot; principal component space to explain most of the variance in 2D postural dynamics for each species (Figure 4A-C) provides a simple and powerful framework for future studies of behavioral diversification across fish species.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>More evidence is needed to assess the types of visual monocular depth cues used by medaka fish to estimate prey location, but that is beyond the scope of this compelling paper. For example, medaka may estimate depth through knowledge of expected prey size, accommodation, defocus blur, ocular parallax, and/or other possible algorithms to complement cues from motion parallax.</p>
