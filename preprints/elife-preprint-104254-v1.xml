<title>Abstract</title><p>The hippocampus is known to encode spatial information and reactivate experienced trajectories during sharp-wave ripple events. These events are thought to be key time-points at which information about learned trajectories is transferred to the neocortex for long-term storage. It is unclear, however, how this information may be transferred and integrated in downstream cortical regions. In this study, we performed high-density probe recordings across the full depth of the medial prefrontal cortex and in the hippocampus simultaneously in rats while they were performing a task of spatial navigation. We find that neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex encode spatial information and reliably predict upcoming choice on a maze, and we find that a subset of neurons in the mPFC is modulated by hippocampal sharp-wave ripples. However, the neurons that are involved in predicting upcoming choice are not the neurons that are modulated by hippocampal sharp-wave ripples. This indicates that the integration of spatial information requires the collaboration of different specialized populations of neurons.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The hippocampus is known to be important for spatial navigation. This is largely attributed to the spatially specific firing patterns of place cells, which fire sequentially as animals navigate through an environment in the timeframe of theta frequency (∼8Hz) oscillations. These sequential firing patterns are often repeated or ‘’replayed’’ during short high frequency oscillations called sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) while the animal is in a state of behavioral immobility or sleep. The function of these SWRs and replay patterns is still somewhat under debate, but during awake immobility periods they have been proposed to either predict immediate future behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, or reflect specific past experience<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, and adapt to reward<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> and task demand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, while during sleep, they are thought to be important for memory consolidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>A running hypothesis is that the hippocampus transfers information to neocortical areas during these SWR events and this is thought to be a crucial mechanism to facilitate spatial learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Congruently, it has been shown that a subset of neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex shows modulated firing patterns following SWRs in the hippocampus, where some neurons show an increase and others a decrease of firing rate, both in a 200 millisecond window following SWR onset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Disrupting this window of activity in the mPFC slowed the acquisition of a spatial rule reversal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The mPFC can be divided into three regions: the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the prelimbic cortex (PLC) and the infralimbic cortex (ILC), which have been shown to have distinct functions in the context of fear-related memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, cognitive flexibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> and preparatory attention and error-related events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. However, due to practical limitations related to the anatomical layout of the region, it has been challenging to study electrophysiological differences between all three subregions simultaneously with sufficient single cell data to draw meaningful conclusions about functional specializations. Some authors argue that the mPFC subregions are not distinguishable as three separate subunits, but rather function as a continuum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Especially the function of the PLC is under debate, and a recent study suggested to divide the PLC further into a dorsal and ventral section, where the dorsal PLC was found to be more related to ACC firing patterns, and the ventral PLC more closely resembled the ILC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The response to SWRs in the medial prefrontal cortex has been found to be specific to the place cell activity in the hippocampus during the SWR, where non-local replay events in the hippocampus are followed by a higher firing rate modulation in the medial prefrontal cortex, and this preference is predictive of future behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. The modulation to SWRs also seems to be stronger when the SWRs occur during behavioral immobility or rest, compared to sleep SWRs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, potentially indicating a different mechanism underlying the two states.</p>
<p>Cells in the mPFC that are modulated by SWRs, are more likely to be phase-locked to the hippocampal theta rhythm seen mostly while the animal is actively exploring an environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Ripple and theta oscillations are independent brain states, occurring primarily during rest and active exploration, respectively. Therefore it is interesting that mPFC neurons are modulated by both states, which suggests a network of prefrontal-hippocampal activity that is co-modulated during both rest and active exploration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Although the spatial specificity is lower in mPFC neurons compared to the hippocampus, some papers have reported replay trajectory events to occur in the mPFC as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. The coordination with replay events in the hippocampus remains unclear, where one study reports coordinated replay trajectory events between the hippocampus and mPFC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, while another study found that mPFC replay occurs independently of hippocampal replay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. During sleep it has been found that trajectory replay events in the mPFC do occur time locked to SWRs in the hippocampus, but only when a spatial rule in the maze had been learned<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, indicating that this interaction may be selective depending on the context in which it occurs. It has also been found that the mPFC engages in replay events particularly after error trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, which may reflect a mechanism of negative feedback during learning. Finally, cells in the mPFC that are modulated by SWRs in the hippocampus have been shown to be less tuned to space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, and therefore perhaps this modulation of cellular activity is not necessarily (only) a reflection of spatial replay trajectories, but may reflect another non-spatial mechanism instead.</p>
<p>In this study, we performed high-density probe recordings across the full depth of the mPFC and in the hippocampus simultaneously while animals are performing a behavioral task of spatial navigation, to shed light on firing properties of SWR-modulated and unmodulated cells in the dorsal and ventral mPFC. We find that mPFC cells that are not modulated by hippocampal SWRs are the ones that seem to be active at key time points in spatial decision making. Our data suggests two populations of mPFC neurons; one that is linked to spatial tuning in the hippocampus and another that is involved in encoding spatial information necessary for effective spatial decision making.</p>

<title>Chronic Neuropixels probe recordings across mPFC subregions</title>
<p>Adult Long Evans rats were implanted with either two Neuropixels 1.0 probes (mPFC and hippocampus; N=5 animals) or a single probe (mPFC; N=1 animal; see Methods and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a-b</xref> and Supplementary Table 1). Signals from the mPFC were classified as originating from the dorsal or ventral subregion based on the implantation depth of the electrodes and the histological verification of the probe track (see Methods and Supplementary Fig. S1). Both subregions showed ample spiking activity (for example see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). In five animals, data from both dorsal and ventral mPFC was obtained and in one animal only data for the dorsal mPFC was included (due to the probe implantation being too posterior; see Supplementary Fig. S1). Spikes were assigned to a cluster (putative neuron) using automated spike sorting followed by manual curation (see Methods), and up to 203 neurons were isolated from a single subregion per session (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref> and Supplementary Table 1). For all analyses presented here, data was averaged per session, so that sessions with a high number of neurons did not skew the results. Due to the light-weight and compact design of the implant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, animals were able to move freely on an elevated track. While we recorded neural activity, the animals performed a spatial rule switching task in which they learned 4 different rules over the course of multiple days (see Methods and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Rules were based on either allocentric (“go North” or “go South”) or cue-based (“go to illuminated arm” or “go to dark arm”) strategies, which were to be deducted by the animals through trial and error.</p>

<title>A subset of neurons in the mPFC is modulated by hippocampal SWRs and theta phase</title>
<p>The mPFC is known to contain functionally distinct cell populations that differ in the modulation of their activity by hippocampal SWRs and theta oscillations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Both SWR-excited and SWR-inhibited cell populations (but not SWR unmodulated cells) are phase-locked to hippocampal theta oscillations and they are more likely to co-fire with cell members of their own group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Here we test if these cell populations are equally present across the dorsal-ventral extent of the mPFC.</p>
<p>We first confirmed the presence of SWR and theta-modulated subpopulations of mPFC neurons while animals were on the maze. Following hippocampal SWR onset, 13.96% of all mPFC neurons significantly increased their firing rate (SWR-excited) and 5.46% of neurons decreased their firing rate (SWR-inhibited). The majority of neurons were not modulated by hippocampal SWRs (80.59%; SWR- unmodulated, see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a-d</xref>). These neurons had a lower overall firing rate than SWR modulated neurons (mean firing rates in Hertz, SWR-excited: M=6.25, SEM=0.49, SWR-inhibited: M=9.31, SEM=1.00, SWR-unmodulated: M=3.87, SEM=0.33, ANOVA: F(142)=19.57, p&lt;.001, see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). Cells that changed their firing rate following hippocampal SWRs also were more likely to be phase-locked to the hippocampal theta oscillation. Overall, 38.46% of cells in the mPFC and 79.42% of cells in the hippocampus showed significant theta phase locking, similarly to previously reported percentages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Theta phase-locking was more prevalent among the population of SWR-modulated mPFC cells (M=55.40%, SEM=4.50) than the population of SWR-unmodulated cells (M=33.53%, SEM=1.94, Mann-Whitney U test: U(104)=1993, p&lt;.001; see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f-g</xref>). These data are consistent with the idea that SWR- and theta-modulated cells form a functional subpopulation in the mPFC.</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, we tested if and how the SWR- and theta-modulated cell populations vary in the dorsal and ventral subregions of the mPFC. We observed similar percentages of SWR-excited and SWR-inhibited neurons in both subregions. However, the activity of SWR-excited and SWR-inhibited neurons in ventral mPFC was more strongly modulated by SWRs than the activity of neurons in the dorsal mPFC (mean modulation absolute z-score, dorsal: M=0.09, SEM=0.01, ventral: M=0.20, SEM=0.05; independent samples t-test: t(86)=-2.11, p=.038; see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). The theta-modulated cells were also similarly distributed in the dorsal and ventral mPFC (percent of theta modulated neurons, dorsal: M=36.67%, SEM=3.07, ventral: M=42.88%, SEM=3.18; Mann-Whitney U test: U(104)=1139, p=.117, see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). The preference for the hippocampal theta phase, however, was different between the dorsal and ventral subregions. Phase-locked neurons in the dorsal mPFC had a bias for firing just before the peak of the oscillation, while phase-locked neurons in the ventral mPFC were more likely to fire around the trough of the oscillation (theta phase locking dorsal mPFC versus ventral mPFC, Kolmogorov-Smirnov difference in distributions, SWR-modulated neurons: K=0.8, p&lt;.001; SWR- unmodulated neurons: K=0.5, p=.012; see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h</xref>).</p>

<title>SWR-unmodulated neurons are spatially tuned, directionally selective and show theta cycle skipping</title>
<p>Previous research has demonstrated that neurons in the mPFC encode spatial information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, and suggested that SWR-unmodulated neurons show lower spatial coverage than SWR-excited and SWR- inhibited neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. It has also been found that the dorsal mPFC has higher spatial tuning properties than the ventral mPFC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, from which the authors concluded that spatial tuning in the mPFC is only partly dependent on direct input from the hippocampus. Here we were interested to see whether we see similar results in our data when comparing the dorsal and ventral mPFC in SWR-modulated and unmodulated neurons. We calculated the spatial specificity score for each cluster (see Methods) and found a higher spatial tuning score in the hippocampus (spatial information in bits/spike, M=0.64, SEM=0.06) than in the mPFC neurons (M=0.31, SEM=0.01, Mann-Whitney U test: U(106)=2129, p&lt;.001; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a-b</xref>). In contrast to the latter study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, we did not observe differences between spatial tuning properties of neurons in the dorsal and ventral mPFC (spatial information in bits/spike, dorsal: M=0.32, SEM=0.01, ventral: M=0.34, SEM=0.02; Mann-Whitney U test: U(121)=1969, p=.639). We did, however, find that SWR-unmodulated mPFC neurons showed a higher spatial tuning score (M=0.33, SEM=0.02) compared to SWR-excited (M=0.22, SEM=0.01) and SWR-inhibited neurons (M=0.11, SEM=0.01; Kruskal-Wallis: H(142)=70.52, p&lt;.001; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). This effect is robust and was seen for both the dorsal and ventral subregions.</p>

<p>Cells that fire selectively during particular head directions have been found in a variety of brain regions as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. We next investigated whether neurons in the mPFC are linked to certain head directions and whether there is also a differential involvement of SWR-modulated and unmodulated neurons in head direction selective firing patterns. We categorized the animals’ head directions at the start of the maze in three categories (towards future choice or alternative choice, towards North or South, and towards left or right, see Methods and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). First, we determined for each neuron whether it spiked significantly more for one direction compared to its opposite counter part (e.g. future choice versus alternative choice). In the hippocampus 31.35% of clusters (SEM=4.20) showed significant directional selectivity, compared to 24.78% of clusters in the mPFC (SEM=1.52, Mann-Whitney U test: U(103)=1505, p=.176; chance level is 15%; see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). Next, for each neuron a directional selectivity index was calculated, where the difference between the firing rates within one category were subtracted from the summed firing rate of that category (e.g. the difference between firing rates during head directions towards the future choice and alternative choice, divided by the sum of both direction; see Methods). This index thus indicates the preference of each neuron to fire selectively during one type of head direction. For all three head direction categories (future versus alternative, North versus South, and left versus right), the SWR-unmodulated neurons showed significantly higher directional selectivity scores than the SWR-excited and SWR-inhibited neurons (maximum absolute directional selectivity index, SWR-excited: M=0.37, SEM=0.02, SWR-inhibited: M=0.27, SEM=0.02, SWR-unmodulated: M=0.48, SEM=0.02; Kruskal-Wallis: H(138)=41.26, p&lt;.001, see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>). On a population level, there was no preference for any one of the categories over another (see Supplementary Fig. S3b).</p>
<p>Furthermore, both the mPFC and hippocampus are known to encode information about upcoming trajectories in alternating cycles of theta oscillations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. A subset of cells in the hippocampus and mPFC are found to skip every other cycle within the theta rhythm, and neurons in the mPFC are thereby thought to favor the true upcoming trajectory over alternative choices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Here we were interested to see whether we observe differences in theta cycle skipping properties in SWR- modulated and unmodulated neurons in the dorsal and ventral mPFC. For each neuron we determined whether or not it showed cycle skipping properties by looking at the probability of spiking at 125 ms (one theta cycle) and 250 ms (two theta cycles) in the spike time autocorrelation (see methods and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). A subset of neurons in the hippocampus (M=42.03%, SEM=4.70) and in the mPFC (M=25.69%, SEM=1.87) showed theta cycle skipping properties. The percentage of neurons showing theta cycle skipping properties was significantly higher for SWR-unmodulated neurons, compared to SWR-excited and SWR-inhibited neurons (percentage of neurons showing theta cycle skipping properties, SWR- excited: M=22.72, SEM=2.01, SWR-inhibited: M=12.39, SEM=3.04, SWR-unmodulated: M=28.94, SEM=1.99; Kruskal-Wallis: H(140)=31.25, p&lt;.001, see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref> and Supplementary Fig. S3c).</p>
<p>Together these results indicate that the population of SWR-unmodulated neurons seem to have distinct functions in terms of spatial mapping, head direction selectivity, and cycle skipping properties, with a stronger involvement compared to neurons that are either excited or inhibited by hippocampal SWRs.</p>

<title>Non-local representations in the mPFC are predictive of the animals’ choice</title>
<p>Previous research has shown that the ensemble firing patterns in the mPFC can be used to decode spatial locations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Furthermore, decoded position data from the mPFC has been found to contain excursions to non-local positions in the maze, which are thought to be related to the neurons’ encoding of choice and reward<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. We were interested to see whether non-local representations in the mPFC could be linked to the future arm choice of the animals in our data, and whether or not there is a link with hippocampal SWRs and SWR-modulated firing patterns. We decoded spatial information from spiking activity along the depth of the mPFC, using a Bayesian decoding model to associate spike features with the location in the maze at which the spikes occurred (see Methods). Using these decoding models, we were able to decode the current location of the animal based on spiking activity in the mPFC accurately (median cross-validated decoding error less than 20 cm) for a total of 40 sessions from 5 different animals. We decoded the spatial information at a theta time scale (50 ms bins with 80% overlap), and observed, aside from the local representations of the current arm, segments of representations of the other arms of the maze, that were either predictive of the upcoming choice, or of the alternative choice on the other side of the maze (see methods and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Using the difference between the sum of decoded probabilities of the segments predictive of the upcoming choice and the segments predictive of the alternative choice, we obtained a prediction index between 1 and −1 corresponding to the direction the animal did and did not turn, respectively. These scores could accurately predict the turning direction of the animals, while the rule was still being learned as well as when it was already well known (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we asked if the predicted directions based on decoded non-local representations either preceded or followed the change in behavior. For this, we overlayed the learning curves of the animals with curves made from the predicted directions based on the non-local representations in the mPFC and performed cross-correlations between the two curves (see Methods and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). It was seen that the highest correlation between the two curves was found on average at a lag of −8 trials for the allocentric rule (M=-8.0, SEM=3.78, deviation from zero Wilcoxon one sample test: W(5)=0, p=.043) and −6 trials for the cue-based rule (M=-5.52, SEM=2.29, Wilcoxon one sample test: W(30)=96, p=.015), indicating that the decoded directions precede the real directions over the course of learning (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to compare these findings with hippocampal spatial mapping, we decoded spatial activity in the hippocampus and obtained representations of upcoming and alternative choices in the same way as in the mPFC (see methods and Supplementary Fig. S4). Due to more limited multi-unit activity recorded from the hippocampus, we were only able to reliably decode hippocampal activity from N=12 sessions from 3 different animals, but the turning direction could still be predicted reliably based on the non-local representations in this region when the animals were in the process of learning a spatial rule (Supplementary Fig. S4b). An overlap of representations of the upcoming choice, but not the alternative choice, was observed between the two brain regions (representations in the hippocampus during mPFC future choice representations; M=10.61% upcoming choice, M=3.06% alternative choice, Mann-Whitney U test: U(20)=9, p&lt;.001; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d-e</xref>).</p>

<p>Similarly, we obtained a histogram of hippocampal theta phase at which each segment of representations of upcoming and alternative choices occurred.

<p>In order to compare these findings with non-local representations in the hippocampus, we obtained a histogram of SWR occurrence in temporal proximity to the start of each non-local representation in the hippocampus.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we propose two populations of mPFC neurons that are important for spatial learning and decision making. The first is more strongly influenced by hippocampal events, showing firing patterns linked to hippocampal SWRs, hippocampal theta oscillations and hippocampal non-local representations of upcoming choice. A second population of mPFC neurons is less modulated by hippocampal events. These neurons have higher spatial tuning properties, fire more selectively during certain head movements, and are linked to non-local representations in the mPFC that are predictive of the upcoming choice.</p>
<p>We first showed that neurons in the mPFC are modulated by SWRs in the hippocampus, and this modulation was stronger for the ventral mPFC than the dorsal section of the mPFC. The hippocampus and ventral mPFC are connected through several pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. The connection with the dorsal mPFC, on the other hand, is much less established. One study has reported a monosynaptic prefrontal cortex projection from the ACC to the hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, but no direct projection from the hippocampus to the ACC. The more dense connections with the ventral mPFC could explain the stronger SWR modulation seen in the ventral compared to the dorsal mPFC.</p>
<p>Congruent to previous research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, we next showed that mPFC neurons that were modulated by hippocampal SWRs, were also phase locked to the hippocampal theta rhythm, suggesting a network of hippocampal spatial mapping and mPFC firing patterns that is co-modulated during both running and resting periods. We showed that these findings hold up for both the dorsal and ventral mPFC, although the preferred phase of the hippocampal theta cycle was different. In the dorsal mPFC, neurons fired more at the peak of the oscillation, while neurons in ventral mPFC fired more just before the trough of the oscillation. An influential paper published in 2009 by Lubenov and Siapas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> has shown that theta oscillations are organized topographically across the hippocampus, indicating that a segment of space, rather than a point, is represented across the hippocampus at any given point in time. This concept of a ‘traveling wave’ of theta oscillations might translate to the downstream cortical regions as well, as our data suggests that cells in the mPFC are phase locked to later phases of the hippocampal theta cycle in the more ventral regions.</p>
<p>We further showed that spatial locations could be reliably decoded based on spiking activity in the mPFC, and that the non-local representations at the start of the maze predicted the future choice of the animal. Moreover, following a rule switch, the mPFC decoded probabilities changed a few trials before the behavioral switch, which points to a leading role of the mPFC in spatial rule switching. There was an overlap between the non-local representations in the mPFC and the hippocampus for the representations of the upcoming choice, but not of the alternative choice. This indicates a potential coordination between the two regions when engaging in the planning of future trajectories, but not when representing alternative choices.</p>
<p>Previous research has shown that spatial mapping in the hippocampus is linked to theta oscillations during running<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, and spatial reactivations are frequently known to occur during SWRs while resting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Here we showed several pieces of evidence that suggest that spatial mapping in the mPFC occurs at least partially independently from SWRs and theta phase in the hippocampus. First, neurons in the mPFC that were not modulated by hippocampal SWRs, showed higher spatial tuning scores, head direction selectivity and theta cycle skipping properties. The spatial tuning scores and head direction selectivity indicate that these SWR-unmodulated neurons are important for spatially mapping the environment, and theta cycle skipping properties in the mPFC have in the past been linked to signaling upcoming choice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. The increased involvement of SWR-unmodulated neurons in these functions was robust and consistent across subregions. Second, non-local representations in the mPFC that were predictive of the animals’ upcoming choice, were not linked to hippocampal SWRs and theta phase. In contrast, non-local representations in the hippocampus showed a much higher phase locking score to hippocampal theta oscillations, and these predictive segments were time-locked to SWR events. Finally, SWR-unmodulated neurons in the mPFC fired more during predictive segments in the mPFC than SWR-modulated neurons, suggesting a role for signaling upcoming choice for those neurons that are not linked to hippocampal SWRs. In contrast, SWR-modulated neurons were linked to non-local representations in the hippocampus, with firing rate modulations that were homologous to their modulation during SWRs (SWR-excited neurons fired more during hippocampal representations of upcoming choice and SWR-inhibited neurons fired less during hippocampal representations of upcoming choice).</p>
<p>These findings are not directly intuitive, given the running hypothesis that that the hippocampus transfers information to the cortex during SWR events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, which could lead one to hypothesize that neurons in the cortex that respond to hippocampal SWRs are responsible for integrating spatial information and creating a spatial map necessary for effective spatial decision making. This hypothesis supported by several previous findings. For one, a recent paper has shown that spatial maps in several cortical areas become less well defined following hippocampal lesions, indicating that cortical regions rely on input from the hippocampus in order to create a spatial map<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. A recent paper from our lab further showed that disrupting the mPFC during the 200 ms following SWR onset, slowed learning of a new rule in a spatial alternation task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, indicating that the input from the hippocampus is indeed necessary for adaptive learning in response to changing reward contingencies. However, none of these findings stipulate that the neurons that respond to hippocampal SWRs should be the same neurons that integrate the spatial map and are involved in establishing a behavioral strategy. Neurons in the mPFC that are modulated by hippocampal SWRs have been shown to be selectively modulated by specific reactivation patterns or replay sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Therefore, we hypothesize that the population of neurons that is modulated by SWRs is important for signaling which hippocampal reactivation patterns are important, after which another population of mPFC neurons alters its spatial map accordingly and signals the behavioral strategy adapted to the obtained feedback about external rewards and task demands.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Suggestions for future research</title>
<p>Together, these findings raise some interesting questions about the function of SWR-modulated and SWR-unmodulated neurons in spatial learning. We hypothesize that SWR-modulated and SWR- unmodulated neurons work together by respectively integrating information from the hippocampus and altering the spatial map necessary for effective spatial decision making. To test this hypothesis, a future study could detect SWRs in the hippocampus and inhibit mPFC activity, while also performing high-density probe recordings in the mPFC to obtain information about single cell firing patterns. If the SWR-linked inhibition of the mPFC alters mPFC spatial coding, by lowering the prediction index of the non-local representations for example, this would support the aforementioned hypothesis. Finally, subregion specific disruptions of the dorsal and ventral mPFC, using optogenetics for example, could test whether there is a differential involvement of the two regions in the spatial decision making process. A task with more structured time points of decision making would be recommended to disentangle the times at which this information is encoded in the different subregions.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, SWR-modulated neurons are likely important for integrating information from the hippocampus, but are not necessarily spatially tuned themselves. This data suggests two populations of mPFC neurons. One population is modulated by hippocampal SWRs and theta phase. A second population is not modulated by hippocampal SWRs, and these neurons are active at key time points in spatial decision making. It is possible that these two populations interact by respectively integrating information from the hippocampus and altering the spatial map necessary for effective spatial decision making.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>Six male Long Evans rats were used in this study, weighing between 300 and 400 grams. The animals were allowed at least one week to acclimatize upon arrival, during which time they were housed in pairs and had unlimited access to food and water. During the course of the experiment, the rats were single housed and kept at a mild food restriction schedule, maintaining over 85% of their initial body weight.</p>

<title>Apparatus</title>
<p>The experiments were conducted in a room of 2.9 by 4.2 meters, with in the center a plus shaped maze that was elevated 50 cm above the ground. The four arms of the maze were 60 cm each, with at the end a platform of 20 by 20 cm holding a reward container, and in the center a piece of 38 by 38 cm.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4c">
<title>Pre-training</title>
<p>Pre-training was performed with a protocol adapted from previous literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, and consisted of four stages during which the animals slowly got acclimatized to the maze and learned to forage for food reward pellets (chocolate covered rice cereal). First, the rats were familiarized with the maze during 5 minutes of free exploration. Next, the day after, 10 reward pellets were spread across the maze and the animals were allowed to forage for 15 minutes. On the third day, three reward pellets were placed in each of the four reward containers and the animal was again allowed to forage for 15 minutes. After this, on all consecutive days, only one reward pellet was placed in each reward container, and the animal had to empty all four reward containers in order for them to be refilled. The maze familiarization was completed when the animal consumed all four rewards at least four times within 15 minutes. The animals took on average 8 days to complete the pre-training.</p>

<title>Allocentric and cue-based rule learning on the plus maze</title>
<p>Animals had to learn allocentric and cue-based rules in the maze, which were to be deducted through trial and error over the course of multiple days. Each day started with a 20-minute period of rest in a dark resting box. After this, the animal was placed by the experimenter pseudo-randomly on either the East or the West arm of the maze and it had to learn to go (1) to the North arm, (2) to the South arm, (3) to the illuminated arm (either South or North) or (4) to the non-illuminated (South or North) arm. The order of the rules was counterbalanced between animals, and the illumination of the arm was always present (also during allocentric learning) and was pseudo-randomly determined for each trial. After the animal made its choice, it was picked up by the experimenter, and placed back in the dark resting box for 30-60 seconds before continuing with the next trial. The animals were trained for a maximum of 1.5 hours or 60 trials per day. At the end of the session, animals were placed back in the dark resting box for up to 60 minutes. After reaching the learning criterium (more than 80% of trials correct on three consecutive days), the animals underwent probe implantation surgery (see below). After surgery, the same rule was reinstated until learning criterium. After reinstatement, the rule was switched, either within the same strategy (i.e., rule reversal – from North to South), or to a different strategy (i.e. attentional Set-shift – from North to Illuminated arm), without any indication for the animal. Throughout learning, one of two sounds was played every time the animal passed a sensor halfway through the end arm (at 90 cm along the track). The sounds, a high and low buzz, were associated with correct and incorrect trials. They therefore provided feedback to the animals about whether a reward would be obtained, a few seconds before actually receiving it. Which sound was played to indicate the outcome was counterbalanced across animals but remained constant for each animal during learning. The recordings were completed once the animals had learned all four rules.</p>

<title>Implant preparation</title>
<p>To record electrophysiological signals from the hippocampus and mPFC simultaneously while the animals were freely moving in the maze, a dual probe implant was used, designed to hold two 1.0 Neuropixels probes (Imec, Leuven, Belgium) at a distance of 6.28 cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. For one of the six animals, there was no probe implanted in the hippocampus, so this animal was excluded from the SWR-related analyses. Prior to implantation, the implant was assembled containing the two probes. The probes were aligned in the stereotaxic frame to be as parallel to each other as possible and perpendicular to the base of the implant. Two holes at the base of the implant were covered in a mixture of bone wax and mineral oil, and the whole surface was cleaned with Baytril (50 mg/ml). The probes were dipped in isopropanol for sterilization, and then in DiI (DIIC18(3) orange/red carbocyanine dye 549/565 nm, VWR, Radnor, Pa, USA) for visualization of the probe tracks later on.</p>

<title>Surgical procedures</title>
<p>Surgery was performed under full anesthesia, using isoflurane (1-2%) administered via a nose cap and adjusted according to the vital signs of the animal (measured with PhysioSuite monitoring system, Kent Scientific, Torrington, CT, USA). A stereotaxic frame with ear bars kept the head in position and the eyes were covered with eye ointment and aluminum foil for protection. After shaving and disinfecting the area, a midline incision was made from the eyes to the ears, exposing both the lambda and bregma on the skull. Craniotomies were drilled above the right hemisphere at the coordinates 2.0 ML and −3.4 AP for the hippocampus and 0.4 ML and +2.7 AP for the mPFC. After carefully removing the dura in both craniotomies, the probes were inserted with a micromanipulator at a speed of 20 µm/s to a depth of maximum 7 mm.</p>
<p>The implant was anchored with 8 self-tapping bone screws (1.19 x 4.8 mm self-tapping bone screws, 19010-00, Fine Science Tools, Foster City, CA, USA) placed in a semi-circle in the scull around the implant. One of the posterior screws was connected to grounding wire which in turn connected to the ground of both probes. The implant was fixed using C&amp;B Metabond (Parkell, Edgewood, NM, USA) covering all the bone screws and the exposed part of the scull. After this, the isoflurane level was lowered to 0% and the animal was carefully monitored while regaining consciousness. Post-operative care included subcutaneous injections of 0.35 ml Metacam as an analgesic and topical application of antibacterial cream (Picri-Baume) and an anesthetic cream (lidocaine) immediately after surgery and on the three days following.</p>

Consecutively, they were perfused transcardially with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), followed by a 4% formaldehyde solution. The brain was removed and stored in a cold room (4°C). After 24 hours, it was transferred to a 30% sucrose solution where it was left for at least three days, until it sank to the bottom of the tube. Brains were sectioned using a vibratome (VT1000 S, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) at 100 µm thickness, after which they were left to dry overnight. Brain sections were stained with a fluorescent Nissl stain (NeuroTrace 530/615 Red Fluorescent Nissl Stain, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA), and the probe tracks were visualized with a fluorescent microscope (MVX10, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). In order to define the subregions of the mPFC, the probe tracks were reconstructed and mapped using a rat brain atlas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. To get the most accurate estimation, information was used from the histological images, together with the known insertion depth during surgery, and the electrophysical signatures in the hippocampus (depth at which SWRs occurred). For one animal only the dorsal mPFC was included, and for the other five animals we recorded from both subregions (see Supplementary Fig. S1).</p>

<title>Data acquisition</title>
<p>Neural data was acquired at 30 kHz using a PXIe acquisition module (National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) and SpikeGLX software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://billkarsh.github.io/SpikeGLX/">https://billkarsh.github.io/SpikeGLX/</ext-link>) and video data was acquired at 50 Hz via an overhead camera and recorded with Cheetah software (Neuralynx, Bozeman, MT, USA). An Arduino Uno (Arduino, Turin, Italy) was used to send pulses at fixed intervals but varying durations to the ongoing neural data and video acquisitions, to facilitate the time alignment of the two streams later on (see below).</p>

<sec id="s4i1">
<title>Position data</title>
<p>Position data was determined using DeepLabCut<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, a deep neural network algorithm designed for animal behavior tracking. 1084 frames were labelled manually indicating a red and blue LED at the top of the implant, and the tail base of the animal. The model was trained for 500,000 iterations, and the obtained position data was then smoothed, removing any spurious position detections outside of the maze area and position jumps of more than 20 pixels. The positions were linearized in a range from 0 to 240 cm, where positions 0-60 and 120-180 were the two start arms (West and East), and positions 60-120 and 180-240 corresponded to the two goal arms (South and North respectively). For decoding, the position data was binned into 5 cm bins and smoothed with a Gaussian kernel (SD = 5 cm).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4i2">
<title>Time synchronization</title>
<p>A time alignment function was created for each session in order to associate the neural signals with the positions in the maze at which they occurred. The time alignment was based on the duration of pulses sent to both systems (neural- and position data) generated by an Arduino Uno. For each timepoint in the analysis, the corresponding timestamp of the other system was extrapolated using a cross-correlation of the pulse durations.</p>

<sec id="s4i3">
<title>Spike sorting</title>
<p>Data was pre-processed using CatGT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://billkarsh.github.io/SpikeGLX/#catgt">https://billkarsh.github.io/SpikeGLX/#catgt</ext-link>) with a local common average reference (CAR), using the average between rows 2 and 8 from each electrode as a reference. The pre-processed data was then sorted using Kilosort 2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/MouseLand/Kilosort/releases/tag/v2.0">https://github.com/MouseLand/Kilosort/releases/tag/v2.0</ext-link>), with a detection threshold of 5 and a lower frequency limit of 150 Hz. The output for each session was manually curated using Phy2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/cortex-lab/phy">https://github.com/cortex-lab/phy</ext-link>), and clusters (putative single cells) were selected based on their waveform, principal component features and conformity to the refractory period. After manual curation, the selected clusters (N=11657) underwent an objective quality assessment using spike interface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, where only the clusters that were compliant with the neural refractory period (an inter-spike-interval violation score of less than 0.1, corresponding to less than 10% of contaminating spikes) were included for further analysis. This step eliminated 2798 clusters. Then, putative fast-spiking interneurons were detected based on the shape of the waveform and the overall firing rate of the neuron (spike half-width &lt; 0.15 ms and firing rate &gt; 17 Hz)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, which eliminated an additional 189 clusters. Finally, clusters that showed very low spiking in the SWR modulation windows (less than 50 spikes; N=2727) were also excluded from analysis, as this could lead to spurious SWR modulation classifications. These procedures led to a total of 5943 remaining clusters to include for analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4i4">
<title>SWR detection</title>
<p>For each animal with a probe in the hippocampus (N=5), one channel was selected from the top layer of dorsal CA1. This signal was filtered between 160 and 225 Hertz, and a contrast frequency signal was calculated by subtracting the average power of the neighboring frequency bands (100-140 Hertz and 250-400 Hertz), in order to eliminate potential spurious detections due to bursts of high frequency oscillations that are not restricted to the ripple frequency range (e.g. chewing artefacts). A threshold for detection was determined by taking the median amplitude of the computed contrast frequency signal, plus 9 times the median absolute deviation (MAD). A low threshold of the median amplitude plus 0.5 times the MAD was used for determining the start and end times. SWRs were only included if they were longer than or equal to 30 milliseconds in duration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4i5">
<title>SWR modulation</title>
<p>Spike rates from sorted neurons in the mPFC were obtained and normalized to the pre-ripple window (from 1 until 0 seconds before SWR onset). For each cluster, SWR modulation was calculated by averaging the spike rates over all the SWRs of that session. Neurons were considered SWR-modulated if the absolute peak of the z-score in the first 200 milliseconds after SWR onset was significantly higher than the shuffled population. The shuffled population was obtained by taking the spike rates of the cluster around all SWRs of that session, shuffling along the time axis, and calculating the peak z-score for each of the N=250 shuffles. Statistical significance was determined by using a Monte-Carlo <italic>p-</italic>value considering an alpha of .05.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4i6">
<title>Theta phase locking</title>
<p>Theta epochs were selected based on a running speed of more than 5 cm/s and the absence of SWRs in the hippocampus. The theta phase was then calculated by filtering the hippocampal LFP between 9 and 12 Hertz and taking the angle of the Hilbert transformed signal. A Rayleigh’s Z score with associated <italic>p-</italic>value was calculated for each cluster and theta phase-locking was determined based on the obtained <italic>p</italic>-value considering an alpha of .05.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4i7">
<title>Spatial tuning</title>
<p>To calculate a spatial tuning score for each sorted cluster, the maze was segmented into bins of 5 cm. To avoid SWR-modulated spiking from biasing the data, spike rates during SWR windows (0 to 200 ms after the onset of SWRs) were not included in this analysis. The spike rate in each maze bin was calculated by taking the number of spikes recorded in that bin divided by the time spent there over the course of a session. Then the spatial tuning score was calculated using a method described in previous literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, where the normalized spike count per maze bin is multiplied by the base-2 logarithm of the normalized spike rate, and the output is summed over all maze bins. This gives a spatial index score expressed in bits per spike, which indicates how much spatial information each spike carries. The spatial information score was only calculated for a cluster if there were at least 50 spikes in the maze during the session (more than 2 times the number of bins).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4i8">
<title>Head direction selectivity</title>
<p>For each position at the start of the maze, the head direction of the animals was determined based on the two LEDs on top of the animals’ head. Head direction angles were divided in 4 equal quadrants based on the orientation of the maze. The head directions towards the goal arms were then categorized in each of three categories: towards future choice or alternative choice, towards North or South and towards left or right. The spike rates during each head direction were calculated for each neuron, and a neuron was labeled directionally selective if the firing rate was significantly higher during one of the head directions compared to its opposite counterpart (e.g. significantly higher during head directions towards the upcoming choice compared to the alternative choice). Statistical significance was determined by comparing the spike rates to a population of 250 shuffles, where the spike rates per trial were swapped randomly. A directional selectivity index was then calculated by subtracting the overall firing rate during one direction from the firing rate during the other direction and dividing by the sum of both firing rates for each direction category. Thus, this resulted in three scores between −1 (the neuron fired only during head directions towards the alternative choice, towards the South arm, or towards right respectively) and 1 (the neuron fired only during head direction towards the upcoming choice, towards the North arm, or towards left). Head directions in the other two quadrants (forward and backwards) were not taken into account. Since the head direction selectivity was stronger in the SWR-unmodulated neurons for each of the six directions (see Supplementary Fig. S3), the overall absolute directional selectivity index was calculated by obtaining the absolute maximum score out of each of the three categories per neuron.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4i9">
<title>Theta cycle skipping</title>
<p>To determine the theta cycle skipping properties for each cluster, spikes were extracted from periods where the animals were at the start platform, arm and center of the maze. For each of the four possible trajectories on the maze (East-North, East-South, West-North, West-South), an autocorrelation of spike times was obtained to determine the rhythmicity of firing from one spike to the next. The average histogram of spike times was smoothed, and two peaks were extracted: one at around 125 ms and one at 250 ms, corresponding to one and two theta cycles of 8 Hz. The theta cycle skipping index was calculated by subtracting the height of the first peak from the height of the second and normalizing to the maximum height of both peaks. The highest cycle skipping index was selected out of the autocorrelations from the four trajectories. The obtained theta cycle skipping index was then compared to a population of N=250 shuffled scores, which were obtained by a shuffling procedure designed to shuffle the spike times while keeping the existing periodicity of the theta cycle (125 ms) intact.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4i10">
<title>Decoding</title>
<p>To decode spatial information from the hippocampus and mPFC, spikes were detected from the CatGT pre-processed data using an amplitude threshold of −50 µV on the high frequency (300-6000 Hertz) filtered signal. Five features were obtained from each detected spike: depth of the channel, spike amplitude, slope of the waveform, height of the positive peak and latency to the positive peak. A Bayesian decoding algorithm was built, associating the spike features with the position in the maze at which they occurred<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Periods where the running speed was less than 15 cm/s were excluded from the model. A median cross-validated decoding error of less than 20 cm was used as an inclusion criterium, which resulted in 40 sessions from 5 different animals for the mPFC decoding and 12 sessions from 3 different animals for the decoding of the data from the hippocampus.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4i11">
<title>Prediction index</title>
<p>To predict turning directions based on the signal from the mPFC, trials were decoded with a bin of 50 ms and 80% overlap, such that every 130 ms was consecutively decoded, corresponding to roughly one theta cycle (at 8 Hz). The decoded probabilities were summed for each maze segment (the two start arms, the center and the two goal arms), and segments of local representations, upcoming choice and alternative choice were obtained by grouping probabilities together in time that had a summed probability of more than P=0.5 per maze segment. The prediction index per trial was calculated by subtracting the summed probabilities of the non-taken goal arm from the summed probabilities of the taken goal arm and normalizing to the total summed probabilities of both categories. In this way, a score of −1 corresponds to a trial that only contains probabilities of the non-taken goal arm, and a score of 1 corresponds to a trial where all the non-local probabilities are of the taken goal arm. The prediction indices were separated by whether the spatial rule had or had not been learned, and which spatial rule was in place at the time (allocentric or cue-based). For determining the statistical significance of the prediction index, the posterior probabilities were randomized by shuffling the positions in the two goal arms for each time bin in the start, arm and center of the maze. The prediction index was calculated in the same way for the shuffled data as for the real posterior probabilities, and statistical significance was determined by comparing the real and shuffled data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4i12">
<title>Prediction accuracy versus learning</title>
<p>To determine whether the prediction accuracy per trial was leading or lagging with respect to the behavior, learning curves were obtained with a moving average of N=10, and overlaid with curves made from the predicted direction based on the non-local representations in the mPFC. The correlation between the two curves (Pearson’s r) was calculated for each trial lag of −N/2 to N/2 (N denotes the total number of trials), such that a peak of correlations at a negative lag indicates that the real direction is lagging behind the predicted direction and a peak of correlations at a positive lag indicates that the real direction is leading the predicted direction.</p>

<sec id="s4i13">
<title>Statistics</title>
<p>All statistical tests were performed using the SciPy library for python<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. All comparisons were done on the means per session, so that sessions with a very high number of neurons in a certain subregion did not skew the results for that subregion. For every comparison, the assumptions of normality and heteroscedasticity were tested and non-parametric tests were chosen if the assumptions were violated. The difference between firing rates of SWR-modulated and SWR- unmodulated neurons was calculated using an ANOVA or Kruskall-Wallis test (non-parametric). For comparisons between two groups, independent samples t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests (non-parametric) were used.</p>

<p>This <bold>useful</bold> study reports analyses of Neuropixel recordings in the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of rats in a spatial navigation trial, focusing on classifying prefrontal neurons based on SWR modulation and anatomical location. However, the evidence for claims of a clear link between SWR modulation and neuronal encoding, and the evidence for anatomical organization, is currently <bold>incomplete</bold>. Further analyses might strengthen the evidence for some conclusions, and some of the strong claims of the paper should likely be moderated.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors used high-density probe recordings in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus during a rodent spatial memory task to examine functional sub-populations of PFC neurons that are modulated vs. unmodulated by hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs), an important physiological biomarker that is thought to have a role in mediating information transfer across hippocampal-cortical networks for memory processes. SWRs are associated with the reactivation of representations of previous experiences, and associated reactivation in hippocampal and cortical regions has been proposed to have a role in memory formation, retrieval, planning, and memory-guided behavior. This study focuses on awake SWRs that are prevalent during immobility periods during pauses in behavior. Previous studies have reported strong modulation of a subset of prefrontal neurons during hippocampal SWRs, with some studies reporting prefrontal reactivation during SWRs that have a role in spatial memory processes. The study seeks to extend these findings by examining the activity of SWR-modulated vs. unmodulated neurons across PFC sub-regions, and whether there is a functional distinction between these two kinds of neuronal populations with respect to representing spatial information and supporting memory-guided decision-making.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The major strength of the study is the use of Neuropixels 1.0 probes to monitor activity throughout the dorsal-ventral extent of the rodent medial prefrontal cortex, permitting an investigation of functional distinction in neuronal populations across PFC sub-regions. They are able to show that SWR-unmodulated neurons, in addition to having stronger spatial tuning than SWR-modulated neurons as previously reported, also show stronger directional selectivity and theta-cycle skipping properties.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) While the study is able to extend previous findings that SWR-modulated PFC neurons have significantly lower spatial tuning that SWR-unmodulated neurons, the evidence presented does not support the main conclusion of the paper that only the unmodulated neurons are involved in spatial tuning and signaling upcoming choice, implying that SWR-modulated neurons are not involved in predicting upcoming choice, as stated in the abstract. This conclusion makes a categorical distinction between two neuronal populations, that SWR-modulated neurons are involved and SWR-unmodulated are not involved in predicting upcoming choice, which requires evidence that clearly shows this absolute distinction. However, in the analyses showing non-local population decoding in PFC for predicting upcoming choice, the results show that SWR-unmodulated neurons have higher firing rates than SWR-modulated neurons, which is not a categorical distinction. Higher firing rates do not imply that only SWR-unmodulated neurons are contributing to the non-local decoding. They may contribute more than SWR-modulated neurons, but there are no follow-up analyses to assess the contribution of the two sub-populations to non-local decoding.</p>
<p>(2) Further, the results show that during non-local representations of the hippocampus of the upcoming options, SWR-excited PFC neurons were more active during hippocampal representations of the upcoming choice, and SWR-inhibited PFC neurons were less active during hippocampal representations of the alternative choice. This clearly suggests that SWR-modulated neurons are involved in signaling upcoming choice, at least during hippocampal non-local representations, which contradicts the main conclusion of the paper.</p>
<p>(3) Similarly, one of the analyses shows that PFC nonlocal representations show no preference for hippocampal SWRs or hippocampal theta phase. However, the examples shown for non-local representations clearly show that these decodes occur prior to the start of the trajectory, or during running on the central zone or start arm. The time period of immobility prior to the start arm running will have a higher prevalence of SWRs and that during running will have a higher prevalence of theta oscillations and theta sequences, so non-local decoded representations have to sub-divided according to these known local-field potential phenomena for this analysis, which is not followed.</p>
<p>(4) The primary phenomenon that the manuscript relies on is the modulation of PFC neurons by hippocampal SWRs, so it is necessary to perform the PFC population decoding analyses during SWRs (or examine non-local decoding that occurs specifically during SWRs), as reported in previous studies of PFC reactivation during SWRs, to see if there is any distinction between modulated and unmodulated neurons in this reactivation. Even in the case of independent PFC reactivation as reported by one study, this PFC reactivation was still reported to occur during hippocampal SWRs, therefore decoding during SWRs has to be examined. Similarly, the phenomenon of theta cycle skipping is related to theta sequence representations, so decoding during PFC and hippocampal theta sequences has to be examined before coming to any conclusions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work by den Bakker and Kloosterman contributes to the vast body of research exploring the dynamics governing the communication between the hippocampus (HPC) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during spatial learning and navigation. Previous research showed that population activity of mPFC neurons is replayed during HPC sharp-wave ripple events (SWRs), which may therefore correspond to privileged windows for the transfer of learned navigation information from the HPC, where initial learning occurs, to the mPFC, which is thought to store this information long term. Indeed, it was also previously shown that the activity of mPFC neurons contains task-related information that can inform about the location of an animal in a maze, which can predict the animals' navigational choices. Here, the authors aim to show that the mPFC neurons that are modulated by HPC activity (SWRs and theta rhythms) are distinct from those &quot;encoding&quot; spatial information. This result could suggest that the integration of spatial information originating from the HPC within the mPFC may require the cooperation of separate sets of neurons.</p>
<p>This observation may be useful to further extend our understanding of the dynamics regulating the exchange of information between the HPC and mPFC during learning. However, my understanding is that this finding is mainly based upon a negative result, which cannot be statistically proven by the failure to reject the null hypothesis. Moreover, in my reading, the rest of the paper mainly replicates phenomena that have already been described, with the original reports not correctly cited. My opinion is that the novel elements should be precisely identified and discussed, while the current phrasing in the manuscript, in most cases, leads readers to think that these results are new. Detailed comments are provided below.</p>
<p>Major concerns:</p>
<p>(1) The main claim of the manuscript is that the neurons involved in predicting upcoming choices are not the neurons modulated by the HPC. This is based upon the evidence provided in Figure 5, which is a negative result that the authors employ to claim that predictive non-local representations in the mPFC are not linked to hippocampal SWRs and theta phase. However, it is important to remember that in a statistical test, the failure to reject the null hypothesis does not prove that the null hypothesis is true. Since this claim is so central in this work, the authors should use appropriate statistics to demonstrate that the null hypothesis is true. This can be accomplished by showing that there is no effect above some size that is so small that it would make the effect meaningless (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1177/070674370304801108">https://doi.org/10.1177/070674370304801108</ext-link>).</p>
<p>(2) The main claim of the work is also based on Figure 3, where the authors show that SWRs-unmodulated mPFC neurons have higher spatial tuning, and higher directional selectivity scores, and a higher percentage of these neurons show theta skipping. This is used to support the claim that SWRs-unmodulated cells encode spatial information. However, it must be noted that in this kind of task, it is not possible to disentangle space and specific task variables involving separate cognitive processes from processing spatial information such as decision-making, attention, motor control, etc., which always happen at specific locations of the maze. Therefore, the results shown in Figure 3 may relate to other specific processes rather than encoding of space and it cannot be unequivocally claimed that mPFC neurons &quot;encode spatial information&quot;. This limitation is presented by Mashoori et al (2018), an article that appears to be a major inspiration for this work. Can the authors provide a control analysis/experiment that supports their claim? Otherwise, this claim should be tempered. Also, the authors say that Jadhav et al. (2016) showed that mPFC neurons unmodulated by SWRs are less tuned to space. How do they reconcile it with their results?</p>
<p>(3) My reading is that the rest of the paper mainly consists of replications or incremental observations of already known phenomena with some not necessarily surprising new observations:</p>
<p>
a) Figure 2 shows that a subset of mPFC neurons is modulated by HPC SWRs and theta (already known), that vmPFC neurons are more strongly modulated by SWRs (not surprising given anatomy), and that theta phase preference is different between vmPFC and dmPFC (not surprising given the fact that theta is a travelling wave).</p>
<p>
b) Figure 4 shows that non-local representations in mPFC are predictive of the animal's choice. This is mostly an increment to the work of Mashoori et al (2018). My understanding is that in addition to what had already been shown by Mashoori et al here it is shown how the upcoming choice can be predicted. The author may want to emphasize this novel aspect.</p>
<p>
c) Figure 6 shows that prospective activity in the HPC is linked to SWRs and theta oscillations. This has been described in various forms since at least the works of Johnson and Redish in 2007, Pastalkova et al 2008, and Dragoi and Tonegawa (2011 and 2013), as well as in earlier literature on splitter cells. These foundational papers on this topic are not even cited in the current manuscript.</p>
<p>
Although some previous work is cited, the current narrative of the results section may lead the reader to think that these results are new, which I think is unfair. Previous evidence of the same phenomena should be cited all along the results and what is new and/or different from previous results should be clearly stated and discussed. Pure replications of previous works may actually just be supplementary figures. It is not fair that the titles of paragraphs and main figures correspond to notions that are well established in the literature (e.g., Figure 2, 2nd paragraph of results, etc.).</p>
<p>
d) My opinion is that, overall, the paper gives the impression of being somewhat rushed and lacking attention to detail. Many figure panels are difficult to understand due to incomplete legends and visualizations with tiny, indistinguishable details. Moreover, some previous works are not correctly cited. I tried to make a list of everything I spotted below.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewers for their thoughtful feedback. Below we provide an initial response to the central concerns that they have raised. In general, as part of our revisions, we plan to perform additional analyses to strengthen our conclusions, tone down more speculative interpretations, and clarify the novel contributions of our work. A full, point-by-point reply will follow alongside the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Briefly, the reviewers’ central concerns are that some of the conclusions are not sufficiently supported by the experimental evidence, specifically (1) the involvement of sharp-wave ripple (SWR)-unmodulated PFC neurons in signaling upcoming choice and (2) the absence of SWR time-locking of PFC non-local representations. They further suggest that (3) the spatial tuning in the PFC may reflect other cognitive processes rather than encoding spatial information; and (4) the manuscript is ambiguous as to which results are novel or corroborating previous work.</p>
<p>(1) SWR-unmodulated PFC neurons signaling upcoming choice</p>
<p>Reviewer 1 suggests that our finding that SWR-modulated neurons relate to hippocampal non-local representations contradicts the manuscript’s main conclusion. However, in our view, there is no contradiction and the finding highlights the distinction between the two sub-populations, namely the SWR-modulated neurons linked to hippocampal non-local representations, and the SWR-unmodulated neurons that are more active during prefrontal non-local representations.</p>
<p>We do agree with the reviewer that the observation of higher firing rates of SWR-unmodulated neurons in the expression of non-local representations does not mean that these neurons are the sole or even main contributors to the non-local decoding. To address both comments, we will perform additional analyses to further disentangle the contributions of SWR-modulated and SWR-unmodulated PFC neurons to the non-local representations of upcoming choice.</p>
<p>(2) Time-locking of PFC non-local representations to hippocampal SWRs</p>
<p>Reviewer 1 comments that in the analysis of time-locking to hippocampal SWRs and theta phase, the behavior of the animals needs to be taken into account (i.e., immobility or running). We confirm that this was indeed done in our analysis and we will clarify this point in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>The reviewer further requested that PFC decoding during SWRs be performed at shorter timescales as in previous studies. We like to point out that (1) we found no increase in non-local decoding in the PFC around SWR onset (see Fig 5a), and (2) most of the non-local representations in the PFC occurred during the expression of local representations in the hippocampus (see Fig 4d). These data suggest that the non-local representations in both brain regions are expressed independently. To further strengthen this idea, we plan to (1) include the result of decoding PFC activity during SWRs at fine timescales as the reviewer suggested, and (2) look at the firing rates of PFC neurons during non-local representations exclusively when the hippocampus is encoding the actual (local) position.</p>
<p>Following a suggestion by reviewer 2, we will also add a statistical assessment of how strongly the data supports the absence of time-locking.</p>
<p>(3) Spatial tuning in the mPFC</p>
<p>Reviewer 2 points out that the spatial tuning in the prefrontal cortex may be related to cognitive processes (e.g., attention or decision-making) rather than spatial encoding. However, our results show that decoded mPFC activity reliably differentiates between the two start and goal arms (Fig 4a), rate maps show little evidence of mirroring (Fig 3a), and the activity predicts turns in the cue-based task during which goal arms switch pseudo-randomly (meaning that the non-local representations encode the North and South arm alternatingly and correctly, rather than encoding a general rewarded goal arm; Fig. 4b). While it is likely that mPFC encodes several task-related variables, our data suggest that it also encodes distinct locations.</p>
<p>The reviewer further claims that the results of Jadhav et al. (2016) contradict our findings because they supposedly showed that mPFC neurons unmodulated by SWRs are less tuned to space. However, this is incorrect, as Jadhav et al. (2016) showed that SWR-unmodulated PFC neurons have lower spatial coverage and consequentially are more spatially selective, which is consistent with our observations. We will rephrase this in the text to improve clarity.</p>
<p>(4) Novelty</p>
<p>We thank reviewer 2 for pointing out the significance of several novel findings in our work that deserve to be highlighted. This includes the dorsal-ventral profile of SWR-modulation and theta phase locking in the PFC and our observation that the neural representations in the PFC precede the behavioral switch in reversal learning. In our revised manuscript, we will rewrite the text to better emphasize our novel contributions, clearly distinguish new findings from confirmatory observations, and add missing citations where appropriate.</p>
