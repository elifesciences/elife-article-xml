<title>Summary</title>
<p>Endometriosis is a common and debilitating neuro-inflammatory disorder that is associated with chronic pain. Definitive diagnosis is based on the presence of endometrial-like tissue (lesions) in sites outside the uterus. Kynurenine monooxygenase (KMO) is a mitochondrial enzyme of tryptophan metabolism that regulates inflammation and immunity. Here, we show that KMO is expressed in epithelial cells in human endometriosis tissue lesions and in corresponding lesions in a mouse model of endometriosis. In mice, oral treatment with the potent KMO inhibitor KNS898 induced a biochemical state of KMO blockade with accumulation of kynurenine, diversion to kynurenic acid and ablation of 3-hydroxykynurenine production. In the mouse model of endometriosis, KMO inhibition improved histological outcomes and endometriosis pain-like behaviours, even when KNS898 treatment commenced one week after initiation of lesions. Taken together, these results suggest that KMO blockade is a promising new non-hormonal therapeutic modality for endometriosis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Endometriosis is a life-altering condition that affects approximately 10% of females. It is an oestrogen-dependent neuroinflammatory disorder associated with debilitating pelvic pain, excessive fatigue, gastrointestinal and urinary symptoms, and infertility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Worldwide, 200 million prevalent cases are forecast by 2026. Endometriosis is defined by the presence of endometrial-like tissue (‘lesions’) outside the uterus. Physiological hormonal fluctuations in women induce cyclical episodes of cell proliferation, inflammation, injury, and repair within lesions that favour fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation and fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. We and others have identified metabolic dysfunction in cells associated with development of endometriosis lesions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. At present, therapeutic options are largely limited to surgery (that often needs to be repeated) or medical therapies that target hormonal activity with resultant side effects (block conception, menopausal symptoms)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Patient surveys consistently show frustration with the lack of available treatments that can give long term relief from symptoms including pain, low mood and bloating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Analysis of recent clinical trials directed at endometriosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> has highlighted an unmet need for new, non-hormonal approaches to symptom relief. The studies in the current paper have addressed this need by focusing on an enzyme that is known to play a key role in inflammatory processes that are implicated in the aetiology of endometriosis, but which has not previously been investigated as a target.</p>
<p>Our proposed solution to this unmet medical need is by targeting the enzyme kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO). KMO is a critical regulator of inflammation at multiple organ sites that acts by altering metabolic flux through the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. KMO is known to be expressed in non-pathological endometrium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, but whether KMO is over-expressed in endometriosis lesions and linked to the severity of inflammation remains to be determined. KMO has been identified as a critical step in converting kynurenine to the cytotoxic metabolite, 3-HK, that is an oxidative stressor, causes protein cross-linking, and regulates the immune-metabolic interface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Although there is no specific information about a direct role of KMO in endometriosis, there is evidence of dysregulated tryptophan metabolism in a recent study using a preclinical non-human primate model of endometriosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, and increased kynurenine pathway flux at the immune-metabolic interface between stromal cells and NK immune cells in endometriosis lesions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>At present, there is a scientific rationale for KMO inhibition in endometriosis, but it remains to be shown in preclinical experiments whether KMO inhibition is efficacious in decreasing lesion volume or behavioural symptoms which are used as a surrogate for pain responses in model systems. KNS898 is a highly specific small molecule KMO inhibitor with potential for use by women with endometriosis, based on favourable characteristics for oral development in terms of bioavailability and predicted half-life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. KNS898 is a competitive inhibitor of kynurenine substrate at the active site of KMO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. We propose that KMO inhibition is a novel therapeutic strategy for endometriosis and, if successful, we will make a significant positive impact for women with this painful, disabling condition. The aim of this project was to obtain proof-of-concept for KMO inhibition as a novel therapy for endometriosis. Specifically, we sought to define the expression of KMO in biobanked human endometrial and endometriosis lesion tissues and correlate KMO expression with clinical features of inflammation (specifically hyperalgia and altered cage behaviour), confirm target inhibition of KMO by KNS898 in mice, and define the preclinical efficacy of KNS898 in reducing inflammation, endometriosis lesion volume and pain behaviours in a experimental mouse model of endometriosis.</p>

<title>KMO is expressed in human eutopic endometrium and human endometriosis tissue lesions</title>
<p>To explore whether we could detect variations between expression of KMO in endometrium (eutopic) within the uterus and a variety of lesions obtained from patients, we conducted detailed immunohistochemistry with a primary antibody specific for KMO. On fixed tissue sections of normal human endometrium KMO expression was most striking in epithelial cells lining the glands (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>, insert B) with lower levels in the luminal layer (insert C). Notably expression in the glands was not uniform (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). KMO was also strongly immunopositive in human peritoneal endometriosis lesions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref><bold> to </bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref>), and evidently mostly localised to the epithelial tissues surrounding the distended endometrial gland-like structures (DEGLS) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref>). Expression in the stromal compartment appeared variable. In human ovarian endometriosis lesions, KMO was present at low expression levels in the mesothelial layers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1i</xref>). Duplex immunohistochemistry with cell phenotype markers CD68 (macrophages) did not show KMO colocalising with these immune cells (data not shown)</p>

<title>Oral KNS898 inhibits KMO in mice</title>
<p>Next, we established that oral dosing of KNS898 by gavage in mice resulted in inhibition of KMO. Using n=3 mice per group, we administered KNS898 at 0.01 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, and 25 mg/kg twice daily (b.d.) in vehicle for seven days, as described. Plasma drug levels and metabolite concentrations are shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>. KNS898 dosed at 0.01 mg/kg b.d. resulted in a mean (± S.E.M.) plasma drug level of 0.18 ± 0.01 ng/mL, 5 mg/kg resulted in 88.8 ± 22.6 μg/mL, and 25 mg/kg gave 483.9 ± 84.0 μg/mL. The difference between groups was statistically significant by one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey’s test (P = 0.001) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2a</xref>). KMO blockade with KNS898 was clearly measurable. A backlog in the KMO substrate KYN was evident: KNS898 dosed at 0.01 mg/kg b.d. resulted in a mean (± S.E.M.) plasma level of KYN of 339 ± 39 ng/mL, 5 mg/kg resulted in 4940 ± 483 ng/mL, and 25 mg/kg gave 3682 ± 634 ng/mL. The difference between groups was statistically significant by one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey’s test (P = 0.001). The increase in KYN at maximal inhibition was approximately 14-fold compared to the level seen after KNS898 0.01 mg/kg (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2b</xref>). Excess KYN was metabolised to KA by kynurenine aminotransferase: KNS898 dosed at 0.01 mg/kg b.d. resulted in a mean (± S.E.M.) plasma level of KA of 629 ± 103 ng/mL, 5 mg/kg resulted in 14399 ± 3394 ng/mL, and 25 mg/kg gave 15965 ± 789 ng/mL. The difference between groups was statistically significant by one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey’s test (P = 0.001). The fold increase in KA at maximal inhibition was approximately 25-fold compared to the level seen after KNS898 0.01 mg/kg (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2c</xref>). KMO blockade resulted in a statistically-significant reduction of 3HK in plasma: KNS898 dosed at 0.01 mg/kg b.d. resulted in a mean (± S.E.M.) plasma level of 3HK of 27.7 ± 7.2 ng/mL, 5 mg/kg resulted in 4.2 ± 0.3 ng/mL, and 25 mg/kg gave 0.9 ± 0.4 ng/mL. The difference between groups was statistically significant by one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey’s test (P = 0.001). The fold decrease in 3HK at maximal inhibition was approximately 30-fold compared to the level seen after KNS898 0.01 mg/kg (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2d</xref>). Overall, there was a clear dose response to KNS898 administration leading to maximal KMO blockade at 25 mg/kg b.d. This dose was therefore selected for efficacy experiments going forward.</p>

<title>KMO blockade reduces endometrial gland-like lesion burden in experimental endometriosis in mice</title>
<p>The experimental design for the mouse model of endometriosis is shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>. The pharmacological effect of KNS898 therapy showed appropriate levels of KNS898 detected in plasma (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3b</xref>), with accumulation of kynurenine (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>), blockade of 3HK production (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>) and diverted metabolism of accumulated kynurenine to kynurenic acid (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). All recipient mice inoculated with donor tissue (groups G3, G4, and G5) developed distended endometrial gland-like structures (DEGLS). The incidence of DEGLS formation was enumerated at autopsy, and the axial length of each DEGLS was measured after excision from the surrounding tissue. In G3 (endometriosis + vehicle), 8 of 15 (53%) of the inoculated animals had developed DEGLS. In KNS898-treated group G4 (endometriosis + treatment from Day 19), DEGLS formed in 4 of 15 mice (26.7%) and in G5 (Endo + treatment start on Day 26) in 6 of 15 mice (40%) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>). As expected, no DEGLS were formed in the non-inoculated control and sham groups. The total number of DEGLS per animal in each group was highest in G3 with an average of 4.0 per animal with DEGLS (total = 32 DEGLS in 8 mice in G3). Mice with endometriosis receiving KNS898 from the time of inoculation (G4) had an average of 2.0 DEGLS per animal with DEGLS (total = 8 DEGLS in 4 mice in G4) and those receiving KNS898 1 week after inoculation (G5) had an average of 1.8 DEGLS per animal (total = 11 DEGLS in 6 mice in G5) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3g</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3h</xref>). Statistical analysis by ANOVA showed a significant difference in endometriosis DEGLS burden between groups (P = 0.0295 for DEGLS per animal; P = 0.004 for DEGLS per group). DEGLS axial length and derived volume did not differ between groups (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 1a and b</bold>).

<p>Histological examination of DEGLS identified them as containing cystic structures lined with epithelial layers identifiable as columnar epithelium, pseudostratified epithelium, squamous epithelium, and cuboidal epithelium, with goblet cells.

<title>KMO inhibition rescues impaired cage exploration behaviour and mobility in mice with endometriosis</title>
<p>HCA peripheral moving speed, time at cage edge, and illness behaviour, including temperature, motility and cage exploration behaviour was quantified using Home Cage Analysis (HCA). Baseline HCA was recorded before inoculation and at the end of the experiment. Mice with endometriosis without treatment showed an overall reduction in activity in moving distance and moving speed relative to baseline, and compared to non-operated and sham-operated control groups, indicating a negative effect on behaviour due to endometriosis. Importantly, mice with endometriosis treated with KNS898 showed marked improvement in motility and cage exploration behaviour compared to untreated endometriosis mice, and although this difference between groups was statistically significant by Welch’s one-way ANOVA, post hoc testing (Dunnet’s T3) was not significant between groups. This qualitative difference of time spent exploring the periphery of the cage being lower for mice with endometriosis treated with vehicle control was seen in both the day and night phases (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5c</xref><bold> and 5d</bold>). Together, these data indicate that KMO inhibition with KNS898 results in an improvement in well-being evidenced by improved cage exploration behaviour in addition to improved objective histological measures of endometriosis disease burden.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we set out to investigate the potential for KMO inhibition as a non-hormonal therapy for endometriosis. First, we confirmed that KMO was expressed in human endometrium by immunohistochemistry, and then showed that KMO was clearly expressed in the epithelial cells in human endometriosis lesions. Next, we demonstrated that the highly specific KMO inhibitor KNS898 was orally bioavailable when given twice daily by gavage in mice, and clearly blocked KMO activity in a dose-dependent manner at a dose of 25mg/kg. We therefore used that dose to test the efficacy of KMO blockade with KNS898 in mice with experimentally-induced endometriosis. One important finding of this project is that KMO blockade resulted in a reduction in endometriosis severity compared to untreated mice with endometriosis, specifically in terms of reducing i) the number of mice that developed endometriosis tissue lesions, and ii) the number of lesions per mouse in those that did develop lesions. The histopathology of the experimental endometriosis lesions was sufficiently similar macroscopically to that seen in the examined human DEGLS, and KMO was evidently highly expressed in the same tissue distribution in model lesions compared to human disease. KMO blockade also decreased lesion KMO expression. Critically, and importantly from a translational perspective, therapeutic blockade of KMO improved visceral hyperalgia measured by reduced mechanical allodynia and restored normal cage exploration behaviour and mobility in treated mice compared to untreated mice with endometriosis. Together, these data show that KMO is expressed in human and mouse endometriosis tissue lesions and that therapeutic KMO blockade reduces the number of endometriosis lesions and improves holistic metrics of disease behaviour in mice.</p>
<p>The model of endometriosis, using inoculation of endometrial tissue of ovariectomized donor mice, reliably induced the pathophysiological symptoms indicative of endometriosis in recipient mice. Test groups inoculated with endometrial tissue (G3-G5) showed significant growth of ectopic endometrial tissue. Groups treated with test article experienced significantly less DEGLS development (significantly fewer DEGLS were noted in treated groups when compared to vehicle treated groups). Disease burden in the treatment group that had treatment starting immediately after inoculation was lower than that of the vehicle-only treated group. It is not clear why mean cystic size and cystic volume in treated animals was not smaller in treated animals. We can only speculate that KMO blockade may potentiate rapid involution of cysts, but this cannot be proven mechanistically here.</p>
<p>Mice that received inoculated endometrial tissue showed a measurable and increased visceral hyperalgic pain response (lower mechanical threshold) as measured by bladder response to von Frey filament testing, and improvement in a surrogate marker of central sensitisation to pain measured by hind paw Von Frey filament testing when compared to control mice. The mechanical threshold of both treatment groups trended higher compared to the vehicle treated group. One interpretation of these data is that KMO inhibition reduced responses to pain caused by the presence of endometriosis, i.e. improving visceral hyperalgia.</p>
<p>Home cage behaviour using HCA indicated a reduced overall activity in endo-inoculated mice when compared to control mice. It should also be noted that test article-treated animals in both groups showed more locomotor behaviour and a seemingly better quality of life within the home cage environment when the home-cage dynamics were monitored. This supports the notion that treated mice exhibit less propensity for behaviours that are, at times, typical of depressive and anxiety-like behaviour in home-cage, group housed conditions.</p>
<p>Under the experimental conditions imposed, treatment with KNS898 on two dosing schedules provided a significant reduction in DEGLS formation within the inoculated mice, as well as a seemingly higher pain threshold. This attenuation of pain response was coupled with increased activity levels in the home cage. Taken together, these data suggest a therapeutic effect to alleviation of certain salient symptoms of endometriosis, as well as a reduction in the number and size of DEGLS.</p>
<p>Non-pathological endometrium is a site of high KMO expression. Because endometriosis lesions in women are ‘endometrial-like’ tissue rather than normal endometrium, we tested, and demonstrated expression of KMO in the epithelial layers of endometriosis lesions sampled from women undergoing surgery for endometriosis. First-line medical treatment for endometriosis is the contraceptive pill or other ovarian steroid hormone suppressive drugs. Treatment failures are frequent, side effects are common, all approaches are contraceptive. Many women opt for invasive surgery to remove or ablate the endometriosis lesions.</p>
<p>In conclusion, KMO is expressed in human endometriosis tissue lesions and in a mouse model of endometriosis in the epithelial layers of distended endometrial gland-like structures. Oral KNS898 reliably induced a biochemical state of KMO blockade with accumulation of kynurenine, diversion to kynurenic acid and ablation of 3-hydroxykynurenine production. KMO blockade improved histological and symptomatic behavioural endometriosis disease features with an overall benefit, even when treatment commenced one week after establishment of the disease. KMO blockade is therefore a promising avenue for a new non-hormonal therapeutic modality for endometriosis.</p>

Normally distributed data were analysed by one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Dunnett’s T3 for multiple groups. Data comparing treatment group effects at multiple time-points were analysed by two-way ANOVA. Data comparing multiple groups with unequal variances were analyzed with Welch’s ANOVA. Data not following the Normal distribution were analysed with non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test. Categorical and proportions data were analysed by Fisher’s exact test. Data were visualised with GraphPad Prism.</p>

<p>The findings presented by the authors are <bold>useful</bold> within the focused scope of endometriosis treatment, providing a potential new therapeutic approach. The strength of the evidence is, however, <bold>incomplete</bold>, as the main claims are only partially supported by the authors' data. The research nevertheless offers promising initial evidence for KMO inhibition as a novel non-hormonal therapy for endometriosis, but further studies are needed to confirm efficacy and address any potential side effects.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study explores the therapeutic potential of KMO inhibition in endometriosis, a condition with limited treatment options.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>KNS898 is a novel specific KMO inhibitor and is orally bioavailable, providing a convenient and non-hormonal treatment option for endometriosis. The promising efficacy of KNS898 was demonstrated in a relevant preclinical mouse model of endometriosis with pathological and behavioural assessments performed.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The expression of KMO in human normal endometrium and endometrial lesions was not quantified. Western blot or quantification of IHC images will provide valuable insight. If KMO is not overexpressed in diseased tissues ie it may have homeostatic roles, and inhibition of KMO may have consequences on general human health and wellbeing. In addition, KMO expression in control mice was not shown or quantified. Images of KMO expression in endometriosis mice with treatments should be shown in Figure 4. The images showing quantification analysis (Figure 4A-F) can be moved to supplementary material.</p>
<p>(2) Figure 1 only showed representative images from a few patients. A description of whether KMO expression varies between patients and whether it correlates with AFS stages/disease severity will be helpful. Images from additional patients can be provided in supplementary material.</p>
<p>(3) For Home Cage Analysis, different measurements were performed as stated in methods including total moving distance, total moving time, moving speed, isolation/separation distance, isolated time, peripheral time, peripheral distance, in centre zones time, in centre zones distance, climbing time, and body temperature. However, only the finding for peripheral distance was reported in the manuscript.</p>
<p>(4) The rationale for choosing the different dose levels of KNS898 - 0.01-25mg/kg was not provided. What is the IC50 of a drug?</p>
<p>(5) Statistical significance:</p>
<p>
(a) Were stats performed for Fig 3B-E?</p>
<p>
(b) Line 141 - 'P = 0.004 for DEGLS per group'</p>
<p>
However, statistics were not shown in the figure.</p>
<p>
(c) Line 166 - 'the mechanical allodynia threshold in the hind paw was statistically significantly lower compared to baseline for the group'</p>
<p>
However, statistics were not shown in the figure.</p>
<p>
(d) Line 170 - 'Two-way ANOVA, Group effect P = 0.003, time effect P &lt; 0.0001' The stats need to be annotated appropriately in Figure 5A as two separate symbols.</p>
<p>
(e) Figure 5B - multiple comparisons of two-way ANOVA are needed. G4 does not look different to G3 at D42.</p>
<p>
(f) Line 565 - 'non-significant improvement in KNS898 treated groups'. However, ** was annotated in Figure 5A.</p>
<p>(6) Discussion is very light. No reference to previous publications was made in the discussion. Discussion on potential mechanistic pathways of KYR/KMO in the pathogenesis of endometriosis will be helpful, as the expression and function of KMO and/or other metabolites in endometrial-related conditions.</p>
<p>The findings in this study generally support the conclusion although some key data which strengthen the conclusion eg quantification of KMO in normal and diseased tissue is lacking. Before KMO inhibitors can be used for endometriosis, the function of KMO in the context of endometriosis should be explored eg KMO knockout mice should be studied.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors aim to address the clinical challenge of treating endometriosis, a debilitating condition with limited and often ineffective treatment options. They propose that inhibiting KMO could be a novel non-hormonal therapeutic approach. Their study focuses on:</p>
<p>
• Characterising KMO expression in human and mouse endometriosis tissues.</p>
<p>
• Investigating the effects of KMO inhibitor KNS898 on inflammation, lesion volume, and pain in a mouse model of endometriosis.</p>
<p>
• Demonstrating the efficacy of KMO blockade in improving histological and symptomatic features of endometriosis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>• Novelty and Relevance: The study addresses a significant clinical need for better endometriosis treatments and explores a novel therapeutic target.</p>
<p>
• Comprehensive Approach: The authors use both human biobanked tissues and a mouse model to study KMO expression and the effects of its inhibition.</p>
<p>
• Clear Biochemical Outcomes: The administration of KNS898 reliably induced KMO blockade, leading to measurable biochemical changes (increased kynurenine, increased kynurenic acid, reduced 3-hydroxykynurenine).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>• Limited Mechanistic Insight: The study does not thoroughly investigate the mechanistic pathways through which KNS898 affects endometriosis. Specifically, the local vs. systemic effects of KMO inhibition are not well differentiated.</p>
<p>
• Statistical Analysis Issues: The choice of statistical tests (e.g., two-way ANOVA instead of repeated measures ANOVA for behavioral data) may not be the most appropriate, potentially impacting the validity of the results.</p>
<p>
• Quantification and Comparisons: There is insufficient quantitative comparison of KMO expression levels between normal endometrium and endometriosis lesions, and the systemic effects of KNS898 are not fully explored or quantified in various tissues.</p>
<p>
• Potential Side Effects: The systemic accumulation of kynurenine pathway metabolites raises concerns about potential side effects, which are not addressed in the study.</p>
<p>Achievement of Aims:</p>
<p>• The authors successfully demonstrated that KMO is expressed in endometriosis lesions and that KNS898 can induce KMO blockade, leading to biochemical changes and improvements in endometriosis symptoms in a mouse model.</p>
<p>Support of Conclusions:</p>
<p>• While the data supports the potential of KMO inhibition as a therapeutic strategy, the conclusions are somewhat overextended given the limitations in mechanistic insights and statistical analysis. The study provides promising initial evidence but requires further exploration to firmly establish the efficacy and safety of KNS898 for endometriosis treatment.</p>
<p>Impact on the Field:</p>
<p>• The study introduces a novel therapeutic target for endometriosis, potentially leading to non-hormonal treatment options. If validated, KMO inhibition could significantly impact the management of endometriosis.</p>
<p>Utility of Methods and Data:</p>
<p>• The methods used provide a foundation for further research, although they require refinement. The data, while promising, need more rigorous statistical analysis and deeper mechanistic exploration to be fully convincing and useful to the community.</p>
