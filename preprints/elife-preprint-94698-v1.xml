<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), a prevalent inflammatory skin disease, is elicited upon repeated skin contact with protein-reactive chemicals through a complex and poorly characterized cellular network between immune cells and skin resident cells. Here, single-cell transcriptomic analysis of the murine hapten-elicited model of ACD reveals that upon elicitation of ACD, infiltrated CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes were primarily the IFNγ-producing type 1 effector phenotype. In contrast, type 2 cytokines (IL4 and IL13) were dominantly expressed by basophils, IL17A was primarily expressed by δγ T cells, and IL1β was identified as the primary cytokine expressed by activated neutrophils and macrophages. Furthermore, analysis of skin resident cells identified a sub-cluster of dermal fibroblasts with preadipocyte signature as a prominent target for IFNγ<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes and dermal source for key T cell chemokines CXCL9/10. IFNγ treatment shifted dermal fibroblasts from collagen-producing to CXCL9/10-producing, which promoted T cell polarization toward the type-1 phenotype through a CXCR3-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, targeted deletion of <italic>Ifngr1</italic> in dermal fibroblasts in mice reduced <italic>Cxcl9/10</italic> expression, dermal infiltration of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell, and alleviated ACD inflammation in mice. Finally, we showed that IFNγ<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and CXCL10-producing dermal fibroblasts co-enriched in the dermis of human ACD skin. Together, our results define the cell type-specific immune responses in ACD, and recognize an indispensable role of dermal fibroblasts in shaping the development of type-1 skin inflammation through the IFNGR-CXCR3 signaling circuit during ACD pathogenesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), one of the most common skin inflammatory diseases, is affecting 15–20% of the world population(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Vocanson, Hennino, Rozieres, Poyet, &amp; Nicolas, 2009</xref>). It is a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction triggered by repeated skin contact with protein-reactive chemicals with low molecular weight, such as haptens. A typical hapten-induced ACD reaction involves a sensitization phase, followed by an elicitation phase. In the sensitization phase, high doses of low-molecular-weight haptens (&lt;500 Da) penetrate through the skin stratum corneum and are captured by Langerhans cells and dendritic cells, which process these antigens and present them to naïve T cells in the skin-draining lymph nodes, priming and clonally expanding the hapten-specific T cells systemically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Kaplan, Igyarto, &amp; Gaspari, 2012</xref>). In the elicitation phase, skin re-exposure to haptens (even at low doses) triggers the activation of hapten-specific T cells and a cascade of inflammatory reactions, generally, 24 to 72 hours after exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Manresa, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Hapten-triggered innate immune response involves the release of a panel of proinflammatory cytokines and/or chemokines, such as IL1β, TNFα, CXCL9/10, CCL17, and CCL20, which contribute to T cell trafficking to the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Dufour et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Kaplan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Meller et al., 2007</xref>). Most of the T cells are recruited by chemokines in an antigen-non-specific manner, but when the recruited T cells encounter specific antigen, T cells proliferate and are activated locally, initiating the inflammatory cascade and promoting the influx and/or activation of cytotoxic cells (CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and natural killer T cells), mast cells (MCs) and M1-polarized inflammatory macrophages (MACs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Chai et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Dufour et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Vocanson et al., 2009</xref>). Both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are involved in inflammatory responses, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are considered the main effector cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Chai et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Vocanson et al., 2006</xref>). Recruited lymphocytes secrete a panel of inflammatory cytokines, such as IFNγ, IL4, IL13 and IL17, which act on skin-resident cells such as keratinocytes, upregulating the expression of adhesion molecules and cytokines/chemokines, thereby recruiting more T cells, macrophages, mast cells to the affected site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Kaplan et al., 2012</xref>). However, the cell type-specific immune response driving ACD pathology still remains poorly defined.</p>
<p>Dermal fibroblasts (dFBs), the main resident cell type in skin dermis, are highly heterogeneous, and can be classified based on their anatomical location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Huang et al., 2022</xref>). By single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), we have recently classified dFBs into distinct non-adipogenic and adipogenic sub-groups, and defined several dermal adipocyte lineage cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Sun et al., 2023</xref>). The primary function of dFBs is to provide structural support for the skin by producing extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules, such as collagen and proteoglycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Huang et al., 2022</xref>), and emerging new studies have recognized that dFBs also have important innate immune functions. We have shown that adipogenic dFBs fight against bacterial infections by producing antimicrobial peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, a recent study identified a dFB subset that is involved in activating cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells during vitiligo pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Xu et al., 2022</xref>). However, how dFBs are involved in the inflammatory circuit with lymphocytes during ACD pathogenesis remains largely unexplored.</p>
<p>In this study, ACD was induced in mice by sequential application of 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB), and this is the most commonly used murine model for ACD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Karsak et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Manresa, 2021</xref>; T. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Miyake et al., 2022</xref>). In-depth scRNA-seq analysis was performed to characterize of how cytokines associated with ACD were differentially expressed by various immune or skin resident cells. In addition to immune cells, we performed in-depth analysis of the immune response of dFBs. Furthermore, the interaction between dFBs and T cells was investigated by in vitro and in vivo approaches. Finally, human ACD skin samples were analyzed to validate the clinical relevance of our observations in mice. Results from this study provide a better understanding of the cell-type specific immune responses underlying ACD pathogenesis, and unravel the previously unknown role of dFBs in shaping the type 1 immune response in ACD.</p>

<p>To characterize the cell type-specific immune responses in this DNFB-elicited mouse ACD model, we performed scRNA-seq of control and ACD ear skin samples, and identified up to 30 cell clusters (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), which were grouped into several cell types, including chondrocytes, dermal fibroblasts, keratinocytes, T cells, myeloid cells (basophils/BFs, mast cells/MCs, macrophages/MACs, neutrophils/NEUs) and other skin resident cells based on marker gene expression shown by bubble (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) or tSNE plots (Figure 1-figure supplement 1D). Furthermore, differential cell distribution plots (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) showed that lymphocytes and myeloid cells were the main cell types recruited to the skin after elicitation of ACD (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>ACD is an inflammatory skin disease, driven by a complicated cell-cell network mediated by several T cell-associated cytokines, including Th1 cytokine IFNγ, Th2 cytokines IL4, IL13, and Th17 cytokine IL17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Howie et al., 1996</xref>). In addition, IL10 participates in skewing of the Th2 response in a murine model of ACD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Laouini et al., 2003</xref>), and IL1β is induced in ACD and potentiates the immune response from both T cells and resident cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Terui, Kimura, Fujimura, &amp; Aiba, 2021</xref>). First, we confirmed that the expression of these cytokines was significantly elevated in ACD compared to that in the control skin samples (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1f</xref> and Figure 1-figure supplement 1E and 1F). scRNA-seq gene expression plots revealed that <italic>Ifng</italic>, <italic>Il17</italic> and <italic>Il10</italic> were primarily expressed by T cell sub-clusters as expected; to our surprise, <italic>Il4</italic> and <italic>Il13</italic> were primarily produced by basophils, and <italic>Il1b</italic> was detected at the highest levels in neutrophils and at intermediate levels in other myeloid cells, including basophils and macrophages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>, Figure 1-figure supplement 1G).</p>

<title>T cells are primarily polarized to the IFNγ-producing type-1 inflammatory phenotype in ACD</title>
<p>To further define the T cell-specific immune response in ACD, T cell clusters were re-grouped into eight clusters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), which were defined as CD4<sup>+</sup>, Treg, CD8<sup>+</sup>, δγT, NKT, NK/ILC1, and ILC2, based on marker gene expression (Figure 2-figure supplement 1A and B). ACD led to a notable increase in the percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup>, Treg, CD8<sup>+</sup>, and NK/ILC1, but not in that of δγT and ILC2 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Furthermore, gene expression plots (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C-D</xref> and Figure 2-figure supplement 1C) showed that <italic>Ifng</italic> was robustly induced in CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>, and NK/ILC1 T cell clusters, whereas <italic>Il10</italic> and <italic>Il17a</italic> were moderately induced only in the Treg and δγT cell clusters, respectively. In contrast, <italic>Il4</italic> was barely detectable in all T cell subsets. The expression of <italic>Ifng</italic>, <italic>Il17a,</italic> and <italic>Il10</italic> aligned well with that of key T cell lineage transcription factors (TFs), including <italic>Tbx21</italic> (for Th1), <italic>Rorc</italic> (for Th17), and <italic>Foxp3</italic> (for Treg), respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 1C and D).</p>

<p>GO pathway analysis of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell clusters revealed that chemokine signaling and type II interferon signaling pathways were among the top upregulated, and TGFβ and PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling were among the top downregulated pathways in ACD compared control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Volcano plot of differentially expressed genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>) showed that <italic>Ifng</italic> and several IFN-JAK-STAT-related genes (including <italic>Ifitm1/2/3</italic> and <italic>Stat1</italic>) were among the top upregulated genes in ACD, and genes with reported inhibitory functions for T cell activation and/or Th1 polarization, including <italic>Fos</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Xiao, Deng, Liu, Ge, &amp; Liu, 2012</xref>), <italic>Zfp36</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Moore et al., 2018</xref>), and <italic>Klf4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">An et al., 2011</xref>), were among the top downregulated genes in ACD, compared to those in the control.</p>
<p>Next, we aimed to validate the expression of IFNγ in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in ACD. First, a time-dependent increase in <italic>Cd4, Cd8</italic> and <italic>Ifng</italic> transcript levels was observed in the DNFB-elicited ACD skin (Figure 2-figure supplement 1E). FACS analysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 1G-I) showed that DNFB-elicited ACD resulted in a rapid increase in both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, in which IFNγ expression was significantly induced, whereas IL4/IL13 and/or IL17 expression was inhibited. Together, these results indicate that T cells are primarily polarized to the IFNγ-producing type-1 inflammatory phenotype in DNFB-elicited ACD.</p>

<p>Basophils and mast cells have similar functions and developmental processes, and both cell types express the high-affinity Fc receptor for IgE (FceR1a), the activation of which triggers degranulation and release of proteases, histamine, and a panel of proinflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Hamey et al., 2021</xref>). Volcano plots of genes expressed by mast cells (<italic>Cd11b<sup>-</sup>Cma1<sup>+</sup>Fcer1a<sup>+</sup></italic>) and basophils (<italic>Cd11b<sup>+</sup>Mcpt8<sup>+</sup>Fcer1a<sup>+</sup></italic>) showed that, in comparison, basophils expressed higher levels of cytokines/chemokines, such as <italic>Il4</italic>, <italic>Il13</italic>, and <italic>Il6</italic>, and mast cells expressed higher levels of <italic>Ccl2</italic> and <italic>Ccl7</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>), revealing their differential immune responses in ACD.</p>
<p>Next, we aimed to validate the involvement of BFs and MCs in the DNFB-elicited type 2 immune response. First, the expression levels of <italic>Mcpt8</italic> (BF marker) and <italic>Cma1</italic> (MC marker) were elevated in a time-dependent manner upon ACD-elicitation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). FACS analysis of BFs and MCs, based on the surface expression of CD11B and FcεR1a (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref> and Figure 3-figure supplement 1B), showed that ACD triggered a rapid increase in the percentage of IL4/IL13-producing CD11B<sup>+</sup> FcεR1a<sup>+</sup> BFs as early as 24 hours post-elicitation. In contrast, there was only a moderate and delayed increase in IL4/IL13-producing CD11B<sup>-</sup> FcεR1a<sup>+</sup> MCs after ACD-elicitation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">F</xref>). In addition, immunostaining analysis showed that elicitation of ACD led to dermal infiltration of both FcεR1a<sup>+</sup> TPSB<sup>-</sup> BFs and FcεR1a<sup>+</sup> TPSB<sup>+</sup> MCs, in which Th2 cytokines were primarily co-localized (Figure 3-figure supplement 1C).</p>

<p>Time-dependent induction of Il1b and recruitment of CD68<sup>+</sup> MAC and Ly6G<sup>+</sup> NEU (MAC marker) after ACD elicitation was confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). Sc-RNAseq revealed that <italic>S100a8/9</italic>, <italic>Il1b</italic>, and <italic>Cxcl2</italic> were among the most highly expressed genes in <italic>Ly6g<sup>+</sup></italic>neutrophils (Figure 3-figure supplement 1D), and <italic>Il1b</italic> was among the top inducible genes in <italic>Cd68<sup>+</sup></italic> MACs after ACD elicitation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). Interestingly, genes associated with immunosuppressive or M2 MACs (<italic>Cd74</italic>, <italic>H2-Ab</italic>, and <italic>Ccl24</italic>) were among the most downregulated genes in MACs after ACD elicitation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). Furthermore, GO pathway analysis identified “cellular response to IFNγ” as the top upregulated pathway, and “lipid metabolic” and “actin cytoskeleton organization” as the top downregulated pathways in MACs after elicitation of ACD (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>). Anti-inflammatory function of M2 MACs is fueled by fatty acid oxidation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Batista-Gonzalez, Vidal, Criollo, &amp; Carreno, 2019</xref>), and changes in actin organization and cell shape are hallmarks of MAC activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">McWhorter, Wang, Nguyen, Chung, &amp; Liu, 2013</xref>). These results provide insights into the mechanisms underlying myeloid activation in ACD. FACS analysis of NEUs and MACs confirmed that elicitation of ACD led to a time-dependent increase in NEU recruitment and a shift of MACs from a resting (Ly6C<sup>lo</sup>) to an inflammatory (Ly6C<sup>hi</sup>) state (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J-K</xref> and Figure 3-figure supplement 1E and F) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Rahman et al., 2017</xref>). Together, these data suggest that IL1β may be a key effector molecule executing the proinflammatory function of NEUs and MACs, and that IFNγ may play a role in activating MACs during ACD pathogenesis.</p>

<p>Bubble plots and violin plots showed that ACD elicitation led to an increase of the expression of a panel of IFN-inducible genes (<italic>Cxcl9, Cxcl10, Stat1</italic>), accompanied with a loss of the expression of pAd signature genes (<italic>Lpl, Apoe</italic>) and a panel of ECM genes (<italic>Col1a1, Col3a1</italic>) in the r5 pAd cluster (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> and Figure 4-figure supplement 1C and D). In addition, scenic TF analysis revealed that the dFB_r5 cluster was specifically enriched with several TFs downstream of the interferon pathway (<italic>Stat1, Irf1</italic>, and <italic>Irf7</italic>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Furthermore, GO pathway analysis of dFB_r5 cells showed that pathways including response to virus, cellular response to IFNγ, and positive regulation of T cell-mediated cytotoxicity were among the top upregulated pathways, whereas ECM organization was among the top downregulated pathways in ACD compared to control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Accordingly, volcano gene expression plots of dFB_r5 cluster showed that <italic>Cxcl9, Cxcl10, Ccl2, Stat1,</italic> and other antiviral genes were the top upregulated genes, whereas ECM genes were the top downregulated genes in ACD compared to control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>).</p>
<p>Violin plots of major skin and immune cell types showed that inflammatory genes related to the IFNGR pathway (<italic>Stat1</italic>, <italic>Cxcl9</italic>, <italic>Cxcl10</italic>) were expressed at highest levels in the dFB_r5 cluster, whereas <italic>Ifng</italic> and <italic>Cxcr3</italic> (receptor for CXCL9/10 ligands) was mainly expressed by T cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref> and Figure 4-figure supplement 1E). qRT-PCR validated the time-dependent induction of chemokines after ACD elicitation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>-figure supplement 1F). Co-immunostaining analyses showed that CXCL9<sup>+</sup> or CXCL10<sup>+</sup> cells co-expressed PDGFRA in the dermis of ACD skin sample (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H-J</xref> and Figure 4-figure supplement 1G), supporting that dFB is the major cell source for CXCL9/10 in ACD. In addition, phosphor-STAT1 (pSTAT1), a key signaling molecule activated by IFNγ, was detected primarily in PDGFRA<sup>+</sup>Ly6A<sup>+</sup> pAds located around the lower reticular dermis and dermal fat area (Figure 4-figure supplement 1H and I). Together, we have identified a cluster of dFB with pAd signature as a cellular source of T cell chemokines CXCL9/10 in ACD, suggesting that dFBs may play a role in the development of type-1 immune response by interacting with T cells.</p>

<p>To define the IFNγ-dependent immune response in dFBs and to determine how dFBs respond differently to IFNγ compared to other T cell-derived cytokines, primary dFBs were stimulated with IFNγ, IL4, or IL17A. Transcriptomic venn diagram analysis showed that IFNγ uniquely upregulated the expression of a large pool of genes, including several antiviral- or IFNγ pathway-related genes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">C</xref>). Time course analysis showed that IFNγ treatment robustly induced the expression of <italic>Cxcl9, Cxcl10, Stat1,</italic> and <italic>Ccl2</italic> as early as 8 hours post-treatment, and suppressed the expression of lipogenesis (<italic>Apoe</italic>) and ECM (<italic>Col1a1</italic>) genes in a delayed manner (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref> and Figure 5-figure supplement 1A). These in vitro changes in dFBs highly correlated with the transcriptomic change of the r5_dFB cluster upon ACD elicitation. Additionally, <italic>Cxcr3</italic> was specifically induced in T cells in ACD (Figure 5-figure supplement 1B), suggesting that IFNGR-dependent activation of dFBs may in turn promotes T cell recruitment/activation by producing CXCL9/10, which act on T cells via CXCR3.</p>
<p>Next, to determine whether IFNγ-primed dFBs can directly promote T cell activation through the CXCL9/10-CXCR3 axis, we established an in vitro co-culture system between primary dFBs and naïve lymphocytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). ELISA confirmed that IFNγ-primed dFBs secreted high level of CXCL10 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>), and conditioned medium from unstimulated control or IFNγ-primed dFBs (dFB<sup>ctrl</sup>-CM or dFB<sup>IFNγ</sup>-CM) was then added to primary lymphocytes with or without CD3/CD28-antibody costimulation. We found that in the absence of CD3/CD28 antibody, dFB<sup>IFNγ</sup>-CM significantly enhanced IFNγ production from naïve T cells, and blocking CXCR3 signaling by adding a CXCR3 neutralizing antibody inhibited this effect (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). Interestingly, in the presence of CD3/CD28 antibody, we found that compared to blank DMEM, dFB<sup>ctrl</sup>-CM inhibited IFNγ expression and promoted T cell polarization towards the IL4-producing type-2 phenotype, whereas dFB<sup>IFNγ</sup>-CM downregulated IL4 expression and restored the ability of stimulated T cells to produce IFNγ (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5H</xref> and Figure 5-figure supplement 1C). In addition, the effect dFB<sup>IFNγ</sup>-CM was partially reversed by adding a CXCR3 neutralizing antibody (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref> and Figure 5-figure supplement 1C). These results indicate that IFNγ-primed dFBs are capable to shift the T1/T2 polarization balance towards type-1 effector phenotype by activating the CXCR3 pathway during T cell activation.</p>

<p>We have shown that ACD led to decrease collagen expression in dFBs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In contrast to other inflammatory skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis (mainly involving a Th2 immune response) and psoriasis (mainly involving a Th17 immune response), ACD results from a complex but poorly defined inter-connected network between the Th1, Th2, and Th17 pathways. In this study, we provide a comprehensive single cell analysis of the cellular interaction network of key T cell cytokines and/or chemokines in a DNFB-induced mouse model of ACD. We found that CD4<sup>+</sup>and CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes are primarily polarized towards the IFNγ-producing type 1 effector phenotype. In contrast, type 2 cytokines (IL4 and IL13) are primarily produced by basophils. Interestingly, our study identified a cluster of dermal fibroblasts with pAd signature as a dermal source for key T cell chemokines CXCL9/10. Targeted deletion of <italic>Ifngr1</italic> in dermal fibroblasts reduced DNFB-induced infiltration of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell to the skin, the expression of <italic>Cxcl9, Cxcl10</italic> and <italic>Ifng</italic>, and alleviated the development of ACD in mice. The results unravel a previously unrecognized role of dFBs/pAds in regulating type-1 skin inflammation.</p>
<p>In line with our findings, targeting type-1 immune response has emerged as effective therapeutic approach against allergic skin diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Liu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wongchang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). Interferon signaling, including IFNγ signaling, has been identified as a highly enriched pathway during nickel-induced contact allergy in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Wisgrill et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, comparisons between sodium lauryl sulfate-irritated and nickel-sensitized skin samples revealed that nickel-sensitized samples were uniquely enriched with pathways related to T-cell activation, including JAK-STAT signaling, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity and T cell receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Wisgrill et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Ifng</italic> knockout mice failed to elicit contact hypersensitivity to urushiol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Wakabayashi et al., 2005</xref>), supporting that IFNγ plays a pivotal role in ACD pathogenesis.</p>
<p>CXCL9, CXCL10 and interferon-related pathways are recognized as potential major hallmarks that distinguish allergic-induced from irritant-induced skin inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Lefevre et al., 2021</xref>). A study investigating the differential involvement of chemokines in chemical-induced allergic skin responses compared to irritant skin responses showed that CXCL9 and CXCL10 were among the top five chemokines that were uniquely upregulated in hapten-induced skin allergic inflammation but were absent in inflammation triggered by irritants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Meller et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>Cxcl10</italic> knockout mice display an impaired contact hypersensitivity response, characterized by reduced inflammatory cell infiltrates in the skin and reduced T cell activation and proliferative response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Dufour et al., 2002</xref>). CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells showed a dose-dependent migration response to CXCL10 in vitro, and adoptive transfer of CXCL10-primed leukocytes isolated from hapten-sensitized mice increased skin inflammation after hapten challenge in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Meller et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The role of dermal fibroblasts in ACD is poorly understood. Our results identified a cluster of CXCL9/10-producing dFBs/pAds in ACD, and showed that targeted deletion of <italic>Ifngr1</italic> in PDGFRA<sup>+</sup> dFB not only reduced DNFB-induced <italic>Cxcl9/10</italic> production but also reduced trafficking of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to affected skin sites. These results suggest that an inflammatory amplification circuit may exist between T cells and dFBs through the IFNγ–IFNGR and CXCL9/10-CXCR3 signaling network, providing a better understanding of the mechanism of action underlying IFNγ- and/or CXCL9/10-driven allergic skin inflammation. In line with our results, a recent study by Prof. Chen’s group revealed the emerging roles of dFBs in the development of autoimmune diseases. They identified a subset of IFNγ-responsive dFBs which are required to recruit and activate CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cells during the pathogenesis of vitiligo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Xu et al., 2022</xref>). In response to paracrine IFNγ signaling, dFBs orchestrate autoimmune CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells through secreted chemokines, including CXCL9 and CXCL10. Furthermore, the authors showed that anatomically distinct fibroblast subsets with differential IFNγ responses are the key determinants of body-level patterns of lesions in vitiligo, highlighting dFB subpopulations as therapeutic targets for vitiligo and other autoimmune diseases. While our results reveal that the cellular interaction between lymphocytes and dFBs promotes ACD pathology, a recent study shows that the innate δγ T cells interact with CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells through the IFNγ – IFNGR pathway to restrain the proliferative and effector potential of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Munoz-Ruiz et al., 2023</xref>), suggesting that activation of IFNGR signaling may either promote or inhibit type-1 effector immune response in a cell-type specific manner.</p>
<p>Infiltration of basophils into inflammatory sites has been demonstrated in several allergic diseases, including atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis and asthma (K. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Miyake &amp; Karasuyama, 2017</xref>); however, basophils are often regarded as minor relatives of mast cells and have long been neglected in immunological studies. Using several independent approaches, including scRNA-seq, FACS and immunostaining, we showed that basophils rapidly infiltrated the skin dermis and were the primary source of Th2 cytokines (IL4 and IL13) in DNFB-elicited ACD skin. In line with our report, a recently published scRNA-seq study of an ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized murine skin model also unexpectedly found that mast cells/basophils, rather than T cells, are the major source of IL4 and IL13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Xu et al., 2022</xref>). Another recent study showed that basophil-mediated type-2 immune response is mediated by IL3-produced by T cells in the hapten-induced ACD mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Hachem et al., 2023</xref>). Future studies investigating cellular interactions between basophils and dFBs will advance our understanding of the basophil chemotaxis mechanism and the role of basophils in skin allergic inflammation.</p>
<p>Taken together, our findings highlight a central role of type-1 immune response in driving ACD-like skin inflammation in both mice and human, and indicate that dermal fibroblasts are not just structural cells but also play a viscous role in amplifying type-1 inflammation in skin dermis. The interaction between T cells and dFBs may be potential therapeutic targets for allergic skin reactions. Furthermore, because IFNγ plays a central role in host defense, anti-tumor immunity, and autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Kwon, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Pollard, Cauvi, Toomey, Morris, &amp; Kono, 2013</xref>), results from our study suggest that tissue-resident fibroblasts may play a role in shaping the development of type-1 immune response in other diseases, such as infectious diseases (such as herpes simplex), cancer, and autoimmune disorders, such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus.</p>

<title>DNFB-induced mouse model of ACD</title>
<p>DNFB-induced ACD mouse model was carried out according to published protocol(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Manresa, 2021</xref>). For sensitization, the dorsal skin of 7∼8 weeks old male ICR mice (n=8) was first painted with 25 μL 1.0% DNFB (dissolved in 4:1 mixture of acetone and olive oil) (Xilongs, Shenzhen, China). Six days after sensitization, to elicit ACD, 20 μL 0.2% DNFB was painted to each ear, and ear skin samples were collected at 24 hours or 60 hours post-elicitation for analysis. For treatments, 250 μL undiluted birch sap extract (BSE) was topically applied to ear skin from 12 hours post-elicitation, 3 times a day, and ear skin samples were collected at 60 hours post-elicitation. 1% Hydrocortisone (HC) ointment (Aveeno, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Maidenhead, Berkshire, UK) was used as the positive group, and dH<sub>2</sub>O was used as the vehicle control.</p>

<title>Single cell RNA library preparation, sequencing and data process</title>
<p>Ear skin biopsies were collected from control or DNFB-elicited skin, and skin biopsies were minced and digested with collagenase D and DNase1 to isolate single skin cells as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Sun et al., 2023</xref>). Dead cells were removed using DeadCell Removal kit (Miltenyi Biotic,130-090-101) according to manufacturer’s instruction. Live cells were counted using a hemocytometer and resuspended in 2% BSA at a concentration of 3,000 cells/uL. All three samples were loaded on a 10x Genomics GemCode Single-cell instrument that generates single-cell Gel Bead-In-EMlusion (GEMs. Barcoded, full-length cDNAs were reverse-transcribed from polyadenylated mRNA. Silane magnetic beads were used to remove leftover biochemical reagents and primers from post GEM reaction mixture. Next, libraries were generated and sequenced from the cDNAs with Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3’ Reagent Kits v 2. cDNA libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Novaseq6000 platform (Illumina). The raw sequencing data was demultiplexed and aligned to the reference genome mm10-1.2.0 using Cell Ranger v3.0.2 pipiline(10x Genomics). The generated raw gene expression matrix was converted into Seurat objects using the R package Seurat v2.0. To remove doublets and poor-quality cells, we utilized the following procedures to control for cell quality: &gt;200 genes/cell, &lt;5000 genes/cell; &gt;25,000 unique molecular identifiers(UMIs) ; and &lt;8% mitochondrial gene expression. Low quality cells and outliers were discarded, and only ∼ 18,241 viable cells were used for downstream analysis. These included ∼9,871 cells – control; ∼8,370 cells – DNFB-elicited ACD. Unsupervised clustering and gene expression were visualized with the Seurat 2.0 on R studio, and assignment of cell clusters was based on expression of validated marker genes.

<title>Cell-chat signaling network analysis</title>
<p>R package CellChat 1.3.0(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Jin et al., 2021</xref>) was used to evaluate the potential cell-cell communication between dFB subclusters and other cell types, especially immune cells, during ACD pathogenesis. The scRNA-seq data was imported to implement CellChat platform in R software. The process includes projecting the gene expression data onto protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, then assigning a probability value to infer biological cell-cell communication network, and calculating the centrality indicator of interacting network to identify the role / contribution of each cell population in distinct signaling pathways. The number and strength of identified cell-cell communication is displayed through hierarchical graphs, circle charts, heatmaps, etc. to visualize single or multiple signaling pathways.</p>

<p>FACS procedure of dermal fibroblasts and immune cells was modified from previously established or reported methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Sun et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Skin tissues were digested with collagenase D (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and Dnase 1 (Solarbio, Beijing, China) to prepare single cell suspension. Cell mixture was then filtered through 30 μm filter and treated with red blood cell lysis buffer. For analyzing cytokine expression in skin-derived T cells, isolated skin cells were first cultured in vitro in the presence of PMA (50ng/ml) (yeasen, Shanghai, China) and lonomycin (500ng/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 2 hours and Golgi-plug (1:1000) (BD biosciences, California, USA) for additional 1 hour prior to being subjected to FACS analysis. Briefly, freshly isolated mouse skin cells were first stained with zombie violet viability dye (BioLegend, #423114) to label dead cells. Cells were then blocked with anti-mouse CD16/32 (eBioscience, #14016185), followed by staining with an antibody cocktail for T cells containing PECy7-CD45 (BioLegend, #147704), PerCP-Cy5.5-CD8 (eBioscience, #45-0081-82), and APC-CD4 (BioLegend, #100516), an antibody cocktail for basophils and mast cells containing PECy7-CD11B (Biolegend, #101216), PE-FcεR1α (BioLegend, #134307) and APC-c-kit (BioLegend, #135108), or an antibody cocktail for immune cells containing FITC-Ly6G (eBioscience, #11593182), PE-F4/80 (eBioscience, #12480182), APC-CD11C (BioLegend, #117310), AF700-MHCII (eBioscience, #56532182), PerCP-Cy5.5-Ly6C (BioLegend, #128012), PECy7-CD11B (Biolegend, #101216), APC-Cy7-CD3 (BioLegend, #100222).

Next generation sequencing library preparations were constructed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina). The poly(A) mRNA isolation was performed using NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (NEB). The mRNA fragmentation and priming were performed using NEBNext First Strand Synthesis Reaction Buffer and NEBNext Random Primers. First strand cDNA was synthesized using ProtoScript II Reverse Transcriptase and the second-strand cDNA was synthesized using Second Strand Synthesis Enzyme Mix. The purified double-stranded cDNA was then treated with End Prep Enzyme Mix to repair both ends and add a dA-tailing in one reaction, followed by a T-A ligation to add adaptors to both ends. Size selection of Adaptor-ligated DNA was then performed using AxyPrep Mag PCR Clean-up (Axygen), and fragments of ∼420bp (with the approximate insert size of 300 bp) were recovered. Each sample was then amplified by PCR. The PCR products were cleaned up using AxyPrep Mag PCR Clean-up (Axygen), validated using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies), and quantified by Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Invitrogen). Then libraries with different indexs were multiplexed and loaded on an Illumina Navoseq instrument for sequencing using a 2x150 paired-end (PE) configuration according to manufacturer’s instructions.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Liu et al. used scRNA-seq to characterize cell type-specific responses during allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) in a mouse model, specifically the hapten-induced DNFB model. Using the scRNA-seq data, they deconvolved the cell types responsible for the expression of major inflammatory cytokines such as IFNG (from CD4 and CD8 T cells), IL4/13 (from basophils), IL17A (from gd T cells), and IL1B from neutrophils and macrophages. They found the highest upregulation of a type 1 inflammatory response, centering around IFNG produced by CD4 and CD8 T cells. They further identified a subpopulation of dermal fibroblasts that upregulate CXCL9/10 during ACD and provided functional genetic evidence in their mouse model that disrupting IFNG signaling to fibroblasts decreases CD8 T cell infiltration and overall inflammation. They identify an increase in IFNG-expressing CD8 T cells in human patient samples of ACD vs. healthy control skin and co-localization of CD8 T cells with PDGFRA+ fibroblasts, which suggests this mechanism is relevant to human ACD. This mechanism is reminiscent of recent work (Xu et al., Nature 2022) showing that IFNG signaling in dermal fibroblasts upregulates CXCL9/10 to recruit CD8 T cells in a mouse model of vitiligo. Overall, this is a very well-presented, clear, and comprehensive manuscript. The conclusions of the study are mostly well supported by data, but some aspects of the work could be improved by additional clarification of the identity of the cell types shown to be involved, including the exact subpopulation discovered by scRNA-seq and the subtype of CD8 T cell involved. The study was limited by its use of one ACD model (DNFB), which prevents an assessment of how broadly relevant this axis is. The human sample validation is slightly circumstantial and limited by the multiplexing capacity of immunofluorescence markers.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Through deep characterization of the in vivo ACD model, the authors were able to determine which cell types were expressing the major cytokines involved in ACD inflammation, such as IFNG, IL4/13, IL17A, and IL1B. These analyses are well-presented and thoughtful, showing first that the response is IFNG-dominant, then focusing on deeper characterization of lymphocytes, myeloid cells, and fibroblasts, which are also validated and complemented by FACS experiments using canonical markers of these cell types as well as IF staining. Crosstalk analyses from the scRNA-seq data led the authors to focus on IFNG signaling fibroblasts, and in vitro experiments demonstrate that CXCL9 and CXCL10 are expressed by fibroblasts stimulated by IFNG. In vivo functional genetic evidence demonstrates an important role for IFNG signaling in fibroblasts, as KO of Ifngr1 using Pdgfra-Cre Ifngr1 fl/fl mice, showed a reduction in inflammation and CD8 T cell recruitment.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The use of one model limits an understanding of how broad this fibroblast-T cell axis is during ACD. However, the authors chose the most commonly employed model and cited additional work in a vitiligo model (another type 1 immune response). The identity of the involved fibroblasts and T cells in the mouse model is difficult to assess as scRNA-seq identified subpopulations of these cell types, but most work in the Pdgfra-Cre Ifngr1 fl/fl mice used broad markers for these cell types as opposed to matched subpopulation markers from their scRNA-seq data. Human patient samples of ACD were co-stained with two markers at a time, demonstrating the presence of CD8+IFNG+ T cells, PDGFRA+CXCL10+ fibroblasts, and co-localization of PDGFRA+ fibroblasts and CD8+ T cells. However, no IF staining demonstrates co-expression of all 4 markers at once; thus, the human validation of co-localization of CD8+IFNG+ T cells and PDGFRA+CXCL10+ fibroblasts is ultimately indirect, although not a huge leap of faith. Although n=3 samples of healthy control and ACD samples are used, there is no quantification of any results to demonstrate the robustness of differences.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The investigators apply scRNA seq and bioinformatics to identify biomarkers associated with DNFB-induced contact dermatitis in mice. The bioinformatics component of the study appears reasonable and may provide new insights regarding TH1-driven immune reactions in ACD in mice. However, the IF data and images of tissue sections are not clear and should be improved to validate the model.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The bioinformatics analysis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The IF data presented in 4H, 6H, 7E and 7F are not convincing and need to be correlated with routine staining on histology and different IF markers for PDGFR. Some of the IF staining data demonstrates a pattern inconsistent with its target.</p>
