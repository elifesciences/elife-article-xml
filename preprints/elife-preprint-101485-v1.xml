<abstract>
<p>Cells can adapt to various environments by changing their biomolecular profiles while maintaining physiological homeostasis. What organizational principles in cells enable the simultaneous realization of adaptability and homeostasis? To address this question, we measure Raman scattering light from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells under diverse conditions, whose spectral patterns convey their comprehensive molecular composition. We reveal that dimension-reduced Raman spectra can predict condition-dependent proteome profiles. Quantitative analysis of the Raman-proteome correspondence characterizes a low-dimensional hierarchical stoichiometry-conserving proteome structure. The network centrality of each gene in the stoichiometry conservation relations correlates with its essentiality and evolutionary conservation, and these correlations are preserved from bacteria to human cells. Furthermore, stoichiometry-conserving core components obey growth law and ensure homeostasis across conditions, whereas peripheral stoichiometry-conserving components enable adaptation to specific conditions. Mathematical analysis reveals that the stoichiometrically constrained architecture is reflected in major changes in Raman spectral patterns. These results uncover coordination of global stoichiometric balance in cells and demonstrate that vibrational spectroscopy can decipher such biological constraints beyond statistical or machine-learning inference of cellular states.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Biological cells can change their gene expression and metabolic profiles globally to adapt to thier biological contexts and external conditions, while maintaining the homeostasis of their core physiological states. The simultaneous realization of adaptability and homeostasis is a hallmark of biological systems and is assumed to be a system-level property of gene expression profiles in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). However, understanding the underlying organizational principles in comprehensive gene expression profiles remains to be a fundamental problem in biology.</p>
<p>Vibrational spectroscopy such as Raman spectroscopy might help us investigate such principles in gene expression profiles. Raman spectroscopy is a light scattering technique that measures energy shifts of light caused by interaction with sample molecules. Raman spectra are obtainable non-destructively even from biological samples such as individual cells. In principle, cellular Raman spectra are optical signatures conveying comprehensive molecular composition of targeted cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Furthermore, no prior treatments, such as staining and tagging, are necessary to obtain cellular Raman spectra. However, although some biomolecules have separable and intense Raman signal peaks, Raman spectra of most biomolecules overlap and are masked by signals of other molecules due to the diversity and complexity of molecular compositions of cells. Therefore, it is impractical to comprehensively determine the amounts of biomolecules by spectral decomposition.</p>
<p>Despite the intractability of spectral decomposition, reconstruction of comprehensive molecular profiles may be achievable by analyzing detectable global spectral patterns (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) thanks to effective low dimensionality of changes in molecular profile of targeted cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>)(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and Fig. S1). Indeed, it has been demonstrated that condition-dependent global transcriptome profiles of cells can be inferred from cellular Raman spectra based on their statistical correspondence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Importantly, this Raman-spectroscopic transcriptome inference was possible from dimension-reduced Raman spectra. Therefore, dominant changes in global Raman spectral patterns may contain vital information about the constraints on the molecular profiles in cells; an inspection of their correspondence might give us insights into architectural principles of omics profiles and biological foundation for global omics inference from spectral patterns (Fig. S1).</p>

<caption><title>Cellular physiological state differences detected by Raman spectral global patterns and gene expression profiles.</title>
<p><bold>(A)</bold> Condition-dependent cellular Raman spectral patterns. Raman spectra obtained from cells reflect their molecular profiles. Therefore, systematic differences in global spectral patterns may indicate their physiological states. A Raman spectrum from each cell can be represented as a vector and a point in a high-dimensional Raman space. If condition-dependent differences exist in the spectral patterns, appropriate dimensional reduction methods allow us to classify the spectra and detect cellular physiological states in a low-dimensional space. <bold>(B)</bold> Condition-dependent gene expression profiles. Global gene expression profiles (proteomes and transcriptomes) are also dependent on conditions. For each gene, we can consider a high-dimensional vector whose elements represent expression levels under different conditions. It has been suggested that these expression-level vectors are constrained to some low-dimensional manifolds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). This study characterizes the statistical correspondence between dimension-reduced Raman spectral patterns and gene expression profiles. Analyzing the correspondence, we reveal a stoichiometry conservation principle that constrains gene expression profiles to low-dimensional manifolds.</p></caption>

<p>In this report, we first reveal that, in addition to transcriptomes, condition-dependent proteome profiles of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> are predictable from cellular Raman spectra. Next, we scrutinize the correspondence between Raman and proteome data, identifying several stoichiometrically conserved groups (SCGs) whose expression tightly correlates with the major changes in cellular Raman spectra. Finally, we reveal that the stoichiometry conservation centrality of each gene correlates with its essentiality, evolutionary conservation, and condition-specificity of gene expression levels, which turns out general across different omics layers and organisms.</p>

<title>Statistical correspondence between Raman spectra and proteomes</title>
<p>To examine the correspondence between Raman spectra and proteomes in <italic>E. coli</italic>, we reproduced 15 environmental conditions for which absolute quantitative proteome data are already available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>) and measured Raman spectra of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells under those conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). The culture conditions we adopted include (i) exponential growth phase in minimal media with various carbon sources, (ii) exponential growth phase in rich media, (iii) exponential growth phase with various stressors, and (iv) stationary phases (Table S1). We measured Raman spectra of single cells sampled from each condition and focused on the fingerprint region of biological samples, where the signals from various biomolecules concentrate (spectral range of 700â1800 cm<sup>â1</sup>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> and Fig. S2). The Raman spectra were classified on the basis of the environmental conditions using a simple linear classifier, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2Câ2E</xref>). This classifier calculates the most discriminatory axes by maximizing the ratio of between-condition variance to within-condition variance and reduces the dimensions of Raman data to <italic>m</italic> â 1, where <italic>m</italic> is the number of conditions (see sections 1.1 and 2.1 in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>)).</p>

<p><bold>(A)</bold> The experimental design. We cultured <italic>E. coli</italic> cells under 15 different conditions and measured single cellsâ Raman spectra.

</fig>
<p>The result shows that Raman spectral points from different environmental conditions are distinguishable in the LDA space (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2Câ2E</xref>). For example, the first and second LDA axes clearly distinguish the conditions âLBâ and âstationary3daysâ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), and the third axis distinguishes âGlucose42Câ and âGlycerolAAâ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Notably, the first principal axis LDA1 correlated with growth rate significantly (Pearson correlation <italic>r</italic> = 0.81 <italic>Â±</italic> 0.09, Fig. S2). Visualizing the Raman LDA data by embedding them on a 2D plane using t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>) confirms that the points for each condition form a distinctive cluster (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). These results imply that positions in the Raman LDA space reflect condition-dependent differences in cellular physiological states.</p>
<p>We next asked whether these Raman spectral differences in the LDA space could be linked to the different proteome profiles. To examine this, we hypothesized linear correspondence between the proteome vector <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="539921v3_inline1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and the low-dimensional Raman vector <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="539921v3_inline2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> in condition <italic>j</italic>,
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="539921v3_eqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
<italic>B</italic> is a matrix that connects <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="539921v3_inline3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="539921v3_inline4.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. We calculated <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="539921v3_inline5.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> as the average of the low-dimensional LDA Raman data of single cells in condition <italic>j</italic> since the proteomes were measured for cell populations.</p>
<p>We conducted leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) to verify this linear correspondence (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). We excluded one condition (here, <italic>j</italic>) as a test condition and estimated B as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="539921v3_inline6.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> by simple ordinary least squares (OLS) regression using the data of the rest of the conditions. We thereby estimated the proteome in condition <italic>j</italic> as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="539921v3_inline7.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>The proteome profile estimated using the first four major LDA axes (LDA1âLDA4) agreed well with the actual proteome data under most conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref> and Fig. S3; see section 1.2 in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) for the estimation with all the LDA axes). Changing the condition to exclude, we estimated the proteomes for all the 15 conditions and calculated the overall estimation error by the Euclidean distance <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="539921v3_inline8.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. The result shows that the overall estimation error is significantly small (<italic>p</italic> = 0.00005 by permutation test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>)). Adopting other distance measures does not change the conclusion (Table S2 and Table S3). These results therefore validate the assumption of linear correspondence between cellular Raman spectra and proteomes and confirm that condition-dependent changes in proteomes can be inferred from the corresponding low-dimensional Raman spectra.</p>

<title>Stoichiometry conservation of proteins in the ISP COG class</title>
<p>The regression matrix B considered above determines how the proteomes relate to the Raman LDA axes. Therefore, analyzing B should provide some insights into constraints on condition-dependent changes in the proteomes.</p>
<p>The matrix B is represented as B = [<bold>b</bold><sub>0</sub> <bold>b</bold><sub>1</sub> <italic>â¦</italic> <bold>b</bold><sub><italic>m</italic>â1</sub>], where <bold>b</bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = (<italic>b</italic><sub>1<italic>k</italic></sub> <italic>b</italic><sub>2<italic>k</italic></sub> <italic>â¦ b</italic><sub><italic>nk</italic></sub>)<sup>T</sup> is the (<italic>k</italic> + 1)-th column of B (0 â¤ <italic>k</italic> â¤ <italic>m</italic> â 1) and <italic>n</italic> = 2,058 is the number of protein species in the proteome data. We first asked whether any shared features might exist in the coefficients of B depending on biological functions of corresponding proteins. We then classified the proteins according to functional annotations of Clusters of Orthologous Group (COG) classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>) and found that, for many proteins belonging to the âinformation storage and processingâ (ISP) COG class, the coefficients corresponding to different LDA axes are approximately proportional to the constant terms; i.e., <italic>b</italic><sub><italic>lk</italic></sub> â <italic>c</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub><italic>b</italic><sub><italic>l</italic>0</sub>, where <italic>c</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> is a constant common to the ISP COG class proteins (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). The ISP COG class contains various proteins involved in processing genetic information such as translation, transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Simple calculations show that these proportionality relationships imply that proteins in the ISP COG class conserves their mutual abundance ratios, i.e., stoichiometry, irrespective of environmental conditions (see section 1.3 in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>)).</p>

<p>Since this is an implication from the Raman-proteome correspondence, we next examined the stoichiometry conservation only with the proteome data, evaluating the expression levels with Pearson correlation coefficients for all the pairs of the conditions for each COG class (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref> and Fig. S4). For the ISP COG class, the correlation coefficients were close to 1, whereas those for the other COG classes were significantly weaker depending on condition pairs. Therefore, stoichiometry conservation is stronger in the ISP COG class than in the other COG classes. Remarkably, neither shared transcription factors nor chromosome locations can account for the observed stoichiometry conservation of many protein pairs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>), implying multi-level regulation and coordination of their abundance.</p>

<title>Identifying stoichiometrically conserved groups</title>
<p>Inspired by the existence of a large class of proteins that conserves their stoichiometry, we considered a systematic way to extract stoichiometrically conserved groups (SCGs) without relying on artificial functional classification of COG. Focusing only on the proteome data, we evaluated stoichiometry conservation by the cosine similarity of expression levels across conditions for all the pairs of proteins in the proteome (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) and extracted groups in each of which the component proteins exhibit coherent expression change patterns by setting a high threshold of cosine similarity (â¥ 0.995, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p>

<p>The largest SCG (SCG 1) included many proteins in the ISP COG class (91 out of 191 SCG 1 members), such as ribosomal proteins and RNA polymerase, and also proteins in the other COG classes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, Table S4). We call this largest SCG <italic>homeostatic core</italic>, as it constitutes the largest stoichiometry-conserving unit in cells. We found that the abundance of each protein in the homeostatic core (SCG 1) increased approximately linearly with the growth rate in each condition (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). This relationship is reminiscent of the growth law: The total ribosomal contents for translation increase linearly with growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). The linear increase in the abundance of each protein in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref> indicates that the growth law is valid even at the single-gene level for a large class of ribosomal and non-ribosomal proteins in the homeostatic core (Fig. S5) (see section 3.1 in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>)).</p>
<p>Though not evenly distributed, the gene loci of the proteins in the homeostatic core are scattered throughout the chromosome (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Therefore, localization of gene loci to a single or a small number of operons is not likely a cause of the observed stoichiometry conservation.</p>
<p>The proteins in the second largest SCG (SCG 2) are expressed at high levels in the fast growth conditions, especially in the âLBâ condition (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). The SCG 2 includes many proteins in the metabolism COG class (21 out of 26 SCG 2 members) (Table S5), and their abundance increases approximately exponentially with growth rate (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). We also identified other condition-specific small SCGs, such as a group most expressed in the âGlycerolAAâ condition (SCG 3) (Table S6), a group mainly expressed in the âFructoseâ condition (SCG 4) (Table S7), and a group most expressed in the stationary phase conditions (SCG 5) (Table S8) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p>

<title>Biological relevance of stoichiometry conservation</title>
<p>To understand the overall strength of stoichiometry conservation of the proteins in the different SCGs, we calculated the sum of cosine similarity, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="539921v3_inline9.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, for each protein species <italic>i</italic>, where cos <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="539921v3_inline10.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is cosine similarity between the expression level vectors of protein <italic>i</italic> and protein <italic>j</italic>, and the sum is taken over all the protein species (see section 1.5 in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>)).

<p>The stoichiometry conservation centrality is biologically relevant because it correlates with gene essentiality. Fractions of essential genes almost monotonically decrease with the ranks of centrality score (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref> and Fig. S6). We also noted that genes with high centrality scores have more orthologs determined by OrthoMCL-DB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>) across the three domains of life (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref> and Fig. S6). Likewise, genes with many orthologs tend to have higher centrality scores (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref> and Fig. S6). Therefore, the stoichiometry conservation in cells correlates with the evolutionary conservation of proteins.</p>
<p>Comparable correlations of stoichiometry conservation centrality with gene essentiality and evolutionary conservation were also found for the <italic>S. pombe</italic> transcriptome data (Fig. S6). In addition, fractions of coding genes almost monotonically decreased with ranks of centrality score in the <italic>S. pombe</italic> data (Fig. S6).</p>
<p>We further analyzed two kinds of <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> transcriptome data. One is a human cell atlas, in which expression of both coding and noncoding genes in 15 fetal organs was quantified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>), and the other is genome-wide Perturb-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>), in which genetically perturbed transcriptomes were measured mainly for coding genes. Our analysis of the human cell atlas data revealed that, while the overall distribution of stoichiometry conservation centrality was broad (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref> top), the centrality distribution of coding genes was skewed to higher values (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref> bottom) as observed for the <italic>E. coli</italic> proteome. Fractions of coding genes almost mono-tonically decreased with ranks of centrality (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>) as seen in the <italic>S. pombe</italic> data (Fig. S6). Essentiality of each gene in human cells was quantified by an index called CRISPR score, which measures the fitness cost imposed by CRISPR-based inactivation of the gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Genes with lower CRISPR scores are considered more essential. Our analysis revealed that genes with higher stoichiometry conservation centrality scores tend to have lower CRISPR scores, thus more essential (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). Similarly, genes with lower CRISPR scores tend to have higher stoichiometry conservation centrality scores. Furthermore, genes with higher centrality scores have more orthologs across the three domains of life, and vice versa (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>). Comparable correlations of stoichiometry conservation with essentiality and evolutionary conservation were also found in the genome-wide Perturb-seq data (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>).

<title>Revealing global stoichiometry conservation architecture of the proteomes with csLE</title>
<p>To gain further insights into the linkage between stoichiometry conservation constraints and cellular Raman spectra, we next analyzed the proteomes using a method similar to Laplacian eigenmaps (LE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). We consider a symmetric matrix A with its (<italic>i, j</italic>) entry is cos <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="539921v3_inline11.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5J</xref>). The entire proteome structure can be represented using the eigenvectors of normalized A. Major differences of this method from the ordinary LE are that we consider an edge for all node pairs and that we adopt cosine similarity for weighting edges. This method places the proteins with higher cosine similarity closer in the resulting space (see sections 1.5 and 2.1 in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>)); we call this method cosine similarity LE (csLE).</p>
<p>In this csLE space Î©<sub>LE</sub>, the stoichiometry conservation centrality of the proteins decreased from center to periphery (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5K</xref>), which confirms that it indeed measures the extent to which each protein is close to the center in the entire stoichiometry conservation architecture. Furthermore, the proteins formed polyhedral distributions with the cluster of the proteins in the homeostatic core at the center and the clusters of the proteins in the other condition-specific SCGs at distinct vertices (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5L</xref>). This distribution is consistent with the fact that the condition-specific SCGs are the components whose expression patterns are distant from the homeostatic core and also between each other.</p>

<title>Representing the proteomes using the Raman LDA axes</title>
<p>Given that the analysis of the Raman-proteome regression coefficients B initially led us to identify the SCGs and the stoichiometry conservation architecture in the proteome data, major changes in cellular Raman spectra characterized by LDA might reflect the expression changes of these coherently-expressed components.</p>

<title>Omics-level interpretation of cellular Raman spectra and a quantitative constraint between expression generality and stoichiometry conservation centrality</title>
<p>To understand rigorously what the similarity of the proteome structures in Î©<sub>B</sub> and Î©<sub>LE</sub> signifies (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>), we clarified the mathematical relation between the coordinates of the proteins in these two spaces (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>; see sections 2.1 and 2.2 in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) for detail). We then characterized the two mathematical conditions that must be satisfied simultaneously (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>).</p>
<p>The first condition is that major axes of the Raman LDA space and those of the proteome csLE space correspond (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). Consequently, cellular Raman spectra under a condition accompanying the expression of a condition-specific SCG must be significantly different from those under conditions with the expression of other condition-specific SCGs in a manner distinguishable by LDA. We verified this first condition with the data (Fig. S9).</p>
<p>The second condition is that the stoichiometry conservation centrality of each protein species <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> must be proportional to <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> := â¥<bold>p</bold><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>â¥<sub>1</sub><italic>/</italic>â¥<bold>p</bold><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>â¥<sub>2</sub>, where â¥<bold>p</bold><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>â¥<sub>1</sub> and â¥<bold>p</bold><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>â¥<sub>2</sub> are the L1 and L2 norms of the expression level vector of protein <italic>i</italic> across conditions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>g</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> can be interpreted as <italic>the expression generality score</italic>. When <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is large, the protein <italic>i</italic> is expressed generally across conditions; when <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is small, this is expressed only under specific conditions (Fig. S8) (see section 1.9 in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>)). Therefore, the proportionality between <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> and <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> indicates that the proteins with high stoichiometry conservation centrality must be expressed non-specifically to conditions.

<p>The spread of the points from the proportionality diagonal line of the <italic>E. coli</italic> proteome data in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref> was found related to the growth rate under the condition where each protein is expressed the most (see section 2.2 in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) for a detailed analysis on the origin of the deviation).

For example, both BamB and YqjD are expressed non-specifically to the conditions with nearly identical expression generality scores. However, BamB is expressed at higher levels under fast growth conditions, whereas YqjP is expressed at higher levels under slow growth conditions due to their relative positions to the proportionality line. Similar growth rate dependence is observed for PaaE and DgoA, but with more prominent condition-specificity because these proteins are characterized by their low expression generality scores.

<p>Proportionality between stoichiometry conservation centrality and expression generality score was also confirmed in both additional datasets (Fig. S7). We further used publicly available quantitative proteome data of <italic>M. tuberculosis, M. bovis</italic>, and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>) to examine this relation and confirmed that the proportionality universally holds (Fig. S7 and Fig. S13). Almost no deviation from the proportionality line existed in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> proteome data measured for the cells in different media but cultured in chemostats with an identical dilution rate (thus, identical growth rate), which is consistent with the result of <italic>E. coli</italic> in which the deviations were related to the growth rate differences.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A Raman spectrum obtained from a single cell is a superposition of the spectra of all of its constituent biomolecules. Therefore, cellular Raman spectra potentially contain rich information on essential state differences in targeted cells. The fact that both transcriptomes and proteomes are inferable from cellular Raman spectra, as demonstrated in this and previous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>) studies, endorses this speculation. The detailed analyses of the relationship between Raman and omics data have identified functionally relevant constraints on omics changes and provided an interpretation of cellular Raman spectra (Fig. S1). Specifically, it has been revealed that major changes in cellular Raman spectra distinguishable by LDA reflect the changes in omics profiles under the constraints of stoichiometry conservation. This correspondence would help us interpret global changes in cellular Raman spectra by translating them into the differences in omics profiles.</p>
<p>We remark that linearity in our formulation enabled us to find the rigorous connection between the two omics spaces Î©<sub>B</sub> and Î©<sub>LE</sub> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). Unlike the original LE, we adopted cosine similarity as weights of edges between all node pairs to measure expression stoichiometry conservation of proteins. This modification was indispensable in terms of interpretation; relative proximity of positions in Î©<sub>LE</sub> reflects the strength of stoichiometry conservation. We also remark that simple principal component analysis (PCA) applied to the normalized <italic>E. coli</italic> proteome data also finds a similar low-dimensional proteome structure (Fig. S6) (see section 1.10 in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>)). Therefore, besides interpretability, omics structures in Î©<sub>LE</sub> might reflect dominant relationships among omics components commonly characterized by several methods of omics representation.</p>
<p>Stoichiometry conservation is plausibly crucial for cellular functions and physiology. For example, the enzymes involved in evolutionarily conserved metabolic pathways conserve their stoichiometry across microorganism species despite their diverse transcriptional and translational rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). It is suggested that stoichiometry conservation is achieved by optimizing the metabolic flux for fast growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). Furthermore, a ribosome-targeting antibiotic causes an imbalance of ribosomal proteins and growth arrest in <italic>E. coli</italic>, but the balance is restored alongside growth recovery through physiological adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). These results suggest that breakage of stoichiometric balance among core components could impose significant fitness cost.</p>
<p>It is intriguing to ask how cells conserve stoichiometry among the components in each SCG. Especially, the homeostatic core (SCG 1) contains many components whose gene loci are scattered throughout the genome. It is known that both transcriptional and translational negative auto-regulation contributes to controlling the stoichiometry of many ribosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). The genes for the ribosomal proteins are scattered in multiple operons and co-regulated with many other non-ribosomal proteins, such as RNA polymerase subunits, translation initiation/elongation factors, and transmembrane transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). Therefore, the stoichiometry-conserving mechanisms established for ribosomes might be partially exploited for the stoichiometry conservation within the homeostatic core.</p>
<p>The proportionality between stoichiometry conservation centrality and expression generality score suggests that proteins with high stoichiometry conservation centrality govern basal cellular functions required under any conditions. In fact, both essential genes and evolutionarily conserved genes are enriched in the omics fractions with high centrality scores. On the contrary, proteins of low centrality scores might have been acquired in later stages of the evolution and exploited to survive or increase fitness under specific conditions. Such hierarchy in the stoichiometry conservation centrality among core and peripheral processes might promote the adaptability of cells since cells can respond to diverse environments without restructuring a large body of the functional homeostatic core. This architectural principle in omics might underlie the robustness and adaptability of biological cells.</p>

<p>This paper reports the <bold>fundamental</bold> finding of how Raman spectral patterns correlate with proteome profiles. The authors then go further to show that this can be used to infer global stochiometric regulation of the proteomes. These findings are likely general and the authors provide <bold>compelling</bold> evidence by analyzing bacterial and human cells but there are some suggestions provided below to make the work clearer and more accessible for it to reach a broader audience.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>This work performed Raman spectral microscopy at the single-cell level for 15 different culture conditions in E. coli. The Raman signature is systematically analyzed and compared with the proteome dataset of the same culture conditions. With a linear model, the authors revealed correspondence between Raman pattern and proteome expression stoichiometry indicating that spectrometry could be used for inferring proteome composition in the future. With both Raman spectra and proteome datasets, the authors categorized co-expressed genes and illustrated how proteome stoichiometry is regulated among different culture conditions. Co-expressed gene clusters were investigated and identified as homeostasis core, carbon-source dependent, and stationary phase-dependent genes. Overall, the authors demonstrate a strong and solid data analysis scheme for the joint analysis of Raman and proteome datasets.</p>
<p>Strengths and major contributions</p>
<p>(1) Experimentally, the authors contributed Raman datasets of E. coli with various growth conditions.</p>
<p>(2) In data analysis, the authors developed a scheme to compare proteome and Ramen datasets. Protein co-expression clusters were identified, and their biological meaning was investigated.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>The experimental measurements of Ramen microscopy were conducted at the single-cell level; however, the analysis was performed by averaging across the cells. The author did not discuss if Ramen microscopy can used to detect cell-to-cell variability under the same condition.</p>
<p>Discussion and impact on the field</p>
<p>Ramen signature contains both proteomic and metabolomic information and is an orthogonal method to infer the composition of biomolecules. It has the advantage that single-cell level data could be acquired and both in vivo and in vitro data can be compared. This work is a strong initiative for introducing the powerful technique to systems biology and providing a rigorous pipeline for future data analysis.</p>

<p>Summary and strengths:</p>
<p>Kamei et al. observe the Raman spectra of a population of single E.Coli cells in diverse growth conditions. Using LDA, Raman spectra for the different growth conditions are separated. Using previously available protein abundance data for these conditions, a linear mapping from Raman spectra in LDA space to protein abundance is derived. Notably, this linear map is condition-independent and is consequently shown to be predictive for held-out growth conditions. This is a significant result and in my understanding extends the earlier Raman to RNA connection that has been reported earlier.</p>
<p>They further show that this linear map reveals something akin to bacterial growth laws (ala Scott/Hwa) that the certain collection of proteins shows stoichiometric conservation, i.e. the group (called SCG - stoichiometrically conserved group) maintains their stoichiometry across conditions while the overall scale depends on the conditions. Analyzing the changes in protein mass and Raman spectra under these conditions, the abundance ratios of information processing proteins (one of the large groups where many proteins belong to &quot;information and storage&quot; - ISP that is also identified as a cluster of orthologous proteins) remain constant. The mass of these proteins deemed, the homeostatic core, increases linearly with growth rate. Other SCGs and other proteins are condition-specific.</p>
<p>Notably, beyond the ISP COG the other SCGs were identified directly using the proteome data. Taking the analysis beyond they then how the centrality of a protein - roughly measured as how many proteins it is stoichiometric with - relates to function and evolutionary conservation. Again significant results, but I am not sure if these ideas have been reported earlier, for example from the community that built protein-protein interaction maps.</p>
<p>Finally, the paper built a lot of &quot;machinery&quot; to connect \Omega_LE, built directly from proteome, and \Omega_B, built from Raman, spaces. I am unsure how that helps and have not been able to digest the 50 or so pages devoted to this.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The rigorous analysis of the data is the real strength of the paper. Alongside this, the discovery of SCGs that are condition-independent and that are condition-dependent provides a great framework.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Overall, I think it is an exciting advance but some work is needed to present the work in a more accessible way.</p>
