<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The color pattern of insects is one of the most diverse adaptive evolutionary phenotypes. However, the molecular regulation of this color pattern is not fully understood. In this study, we found that the transcription factor Bm-mamo is responsible for <italic>black dilute</italic> (<italic>bd</italic>) allele mutations in the silkworm. Bm-mamo belongs to the BTB zinc finger family and is orthologous to mamo in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. This gene has a conserved function in gamete production in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and silkworms and has evolved a pleiotropic function in the regulation of color patterns in caterpillars. Using RNAi and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technology, we showed that Bm-mamo is a repressor or has dark melanin patterns in the larval epidermis. Using in vitro binding assays and gene expression profiling in wild-type and mutant larvae, we also showed that <italic>Bm-mamo</italic> likely regulates the expression of related pigment synthesis and cuticular protein genes in a coordinated manner to mediate its role in color pattern formation. This mechanism is consistent with the dual role of this transcription factor in regulating both the structure and shape of the cuticle and the pigments that are embedded within it. This study provides new insight into the regulation of color patterns as well as into the construction of more complex epidermis features in some insects.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Insects often display stunning colors, and the patterns of these colors have been shown to be involved in behavior(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></italic>), immunity(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></italic>), thermoregulation(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></italic>), and UV protection(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></italic>); in particular, visual antagonism of predators via aposematism(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></italic>), mimicry(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></italic>), cryptic color patterns(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></italic>) or some combination of the above (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></italic>). In addition, the color patterns are divergent and convergent among populations(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></italic>). Due to these striking visual features and highly active adaptive evolutionary phenotypes, the genetic basis and evolutionary mechanism of color patterns have long been a topic of interest.</p>
<p>Insect coloration can be pigmentary, structural, or bioluminescent. Pigments are synthesized by insects themselves and form solid particles that are deposited within the cuticle of the body surface and the scales of the wings(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></italic>). Interestingly, recent studies have shown that bile pigments and carotenoid pigments synthesized through biological synthesis are incorporated into body fluids and fill in the wing membranes of two butterflies (<italic>Siproeta stelenes</italic> and <italic>Philaethria diatonica</italic>) via hemolymph circulation, providing color in the form of liquid pigments(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></italic>). These pigments form colors by selective absorption and/or scattering of light depending on their physical properties(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></italic>). However, structural color refers to colors, such as metallic colors and iridescence, generated by optical interference and grating diffraction of the microstructure/nanostructure of the body surface or appendages (such as scales)(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></italic>). Pigment color and structural color are widely distributed in insects and can only be observed by the naked eye in illuminated environments. However, some insects, such as fireflies, exhibit colors (green to orange) in the dark due to bioluminescence(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></italic>). Bioluminescence occurs when luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of small molecules of luciferin(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></italic>). In conclusion, the color patterns of insects have evolved to become highly sophisticated and are closely related to their living environment. For example, cryptic color can deceive animals via high similarity to the surrounding environment. However, the molecular mechanism by which insects form precise color patterns to match their living environment has not been determined.</p>
<p>Recent research has identified the metabolic pathways associated with related pigments, such as melanins, pterins, and ommochromes, in Lepidoptera(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></italic>). A deficiency of enzymes in the pigment metabolism pathway can lead to changes in color patterns(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></italic>). In addition to pigment synthesis, the microstructure/nanostructure of the body surface and wing scales are important factors that influence body color patterns. The body surface and wing scales of Lepidoptera are composed mainly of cuticular proteins (CPs)(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></italic>). There are multiple genes encoding CPs in Lepidopteran genomes. For example, in <italic>Bombyx mori,</italic> more than 220 genes encode CPs(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></italic>). However, the functions of CPs and the molecular mechanisms underlying their fine-scale localization in the cuticle are still unclear.</p>
<p>In addition, several pleiotropic factors, such as <italic>wnt1</italic>(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></italic>), <italic>Apontic-like</italic>(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></italic>), <italic>clawless</italic>(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></italic>), <italic>abdominal-A</italic>(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></italic>), <italic>abdominal-B</italic>(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></italic>), <italic>engrailed</italic>(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></italic>), <italic>antennapedia</italic>(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></italic>), <italic>optix</italic>(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></italic>), <italic>bric</italic> Ã  <italic>brac</italic> (<italic>bab</italic>)(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></italic>), and <italic>Distal-less</italic> (<italic>Dll</italic>)(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></italic>), play important roles in the regulation of color patterns. The molecular mechanism by which these factors participate in the regulation of body color patterns needs further study. In addition, there are many undiscovered factors in the gene regulatory network (GRN) involved in the regulation of insect color patterns. The identification of new color pattern regulatory genes and the study of their molecular mechanisms would be helpful for further understanding color patterns.</p>
<p>Silkworms (<italic>B. mori</italic>) have been completely domesticated for more than 5000 years and are famous for their silk fiber production(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></italic>). Because of this long history of domestication, artificial selection and genetic research, its genetic background has been well studied, and approximately 200 strains of mutants with variable color patterns have been preserved(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></italic>), which provides a good resource for color pattern research. The <italic>black dilute</italic> (<italic>bd</italic>) mutant, which exhibits recessive Mendelian inheritance, has a dark gray larval body color, and the female is sterile. <italic>Black dilute fertile</italic> (<italic>bd<sup>f</sup></italic>) is an allele that leads to a lighter body color than <italic>bd</italic> and fertile females (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The two mutations were mapped to a single locus at 22.9 centimorgans (cM) of linkage group 9(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></italic>). No pigmentation-related genes have been reported at this locus. Thus, this research may reveal a new color pattern-related gene, which stimulated our interest.</p>

<title>Candidate gene of the <italic>bd</italic> allele</title>
<p>To identify the genomic region responsible for the <italic>bd</italic> alleles, positional cloning of the <italic>bd</italic> locus was performed. Due to the female infertility of the <italic>bd</italic> mutant and the fertility of females with the <italic>bd<sup>f</sup></italic> allele, we used <italic>bd<sup>f</sup></italic> and the wild-type Dazao strain as parents for mapping analysis. The 1162 back-crossed filial 1st (BC1M) generation individuals from <italic>bd<sup>f</sup></italic>and Dazao were subjected to fine mapping with molecular markers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). A genomic region of approximately 390 kilobases (kb) was responsible for the <italic>bd</italic> phenotype (Table S1). According to the SilkDB database(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></italic>), this region included five predicted genes (<italic>BGIBMGA012516</italic>, <italic>BGIBMGA012517</italic>, <italic>BGIBMGA012518</italic>, <italic>BGIBMGA012519</italic> and <italic>BGIBMGA014089</italic>). In addition, we analyzed the predictive genes for this genomic region from the GenBank(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></italic>) and SilkBase(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></italic>) databases (Fig. S1). The number of predicted genes varied among the different databases. We performed sequence alignment analysis of the predicted genes in the three databases to determine their correspondence. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was subsequently performed, which revealed that <italic>BGIBMGA012517</italic> and <italic>BGIBMGA012518</italic> were significantly downregulated on Day 3 of the fifth instar of the larvae in the <italic>bd</italic> phenotype individuals, while there was no difference in the expression levels of the other genes (Fig. S1). These two genes were predicted to be associated with a single locus (<italic>LOC101738295</italic>) in GenBank. To determine the gene structures of <italic>BGIBMGA012517</italic> and <italic>BGIBMGA012518</italic>, we used forward primers for the <italic>BGIBMGA012517</italic> gene and reverse primers for the <italic>BGIBMGA012518</italic> gene to amplify cDNA from the wild-type Dazao strain. By gene cloning, the predicted genes <italic>BGIBMGA012517</italic> and <italic>BGIBMGA012518</italic> were proven to be one such gene. For convenience, we temporarily called this the <italic>12517/8</italic> gene.</p>

<p>The <italic>12517/8</italic> gene produces two transcripts; the open reading frame (ORF) of the long transcript is 2397 bp, and the ORF of the short transcript is 1824 bp, which is the same 5â-terminus as that of the wild-type Dazao strain (Fig. S2). The <italic>12517/8</italic> gene showed significantly lower expression in the <italic>bd<sup>f</sup></italic> mutant (Fig. S3), and multiple variations were found in the region nearby this gene by comparative genomic analysis between <italic>bd<sup>f</sup></italic> and Dazao (Table S2). In addition, <italic>12517/8</italic> was completely silenced due to the deletion of DNA fragments (approximately 168 kb) from the first upstream intron and an insertion of 3560 bp in the <italic>bd</italic> mutant (Fig. S4).</p>
<p>To predict the function of the <italic>12517</italic>/8 gene, we performed a BLAST search using its full-length sequence and found a transcription factor, the <italic>maternal gene required for meiosis</italic> (<italic>mamo</italic>) in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, that had high sequence similarity to that of the <italic>12517/8</italic> gene (Fig. S5). Therefore, we named the <italic>12517/18</italic> gene <italic>Bm-mamo</italic>; the long transcript was designated <italic>Bm-mamo-L</italic>, and the short transcript was designated <italic>Bm-mamo-S</italic>.</p>
<p>The <italic>mamo</italic> gene belongs to the Broad-complex, Tramtrack and bric Ã  brac/poxvirus zinc finger protein (BTB-ZF) family. In the BTB-ZF family, the zinc finger serves as a recognition motif for DNA-specific sequences, and the BTB domain promotes oligomerization and the recruitment of other regulatory factors(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></italic>). Most of these factors are transcription repressors, such as nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR) and silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT)(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></italic>), but some are activators, such as p300(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></italic>). Therefore, these features commonly serve as regulators of gene expression. <italic>mamo</italic> is enriched in embryonic primordial germ cells (PGCs) in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. Individuals deficient in <italic>mamo</italic> are able to undergo oogenesis but fail to execute meiosis properly, leading to female infertility in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></italic>). <italic>Bm-mamo</italic> was identified as an important candidate gene for further analysis.</p>

<title>Expression pattern analysis of <italic>Bm-mamo</italic></title>
<p>To analyze the expression profiles of <italic>Bm-mamo</italic>, we performed quantitative PCR. The expression levels of the <italic>Bm-mamo</italic> gene in the Dazao strain were investigated throughout the body at different developmental stages, from the embryonic stage to the adult stage. The gene was highly expressed in the molting stage of caterpillars, and its expression was upregulated in the later pupal and adult stages (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). This finding suggested that the <italic>Bm-mamo</italic> gene responds to ecdysone and participates in the processes of molting and metamorphosis in silkworms.</p>

<p>According to the investigation of tissue-specific Dazao strain expression in 5th-instar 3rd-day larvae, the midgut, head, and epidermis exhibited high expression levels; the trachea, nerves, silk glands, testis, ovary, muscle, wing disc and Malpighian tubules exhibited moderate expression levels; and the blood and fat bodies exhibited low expression levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). These findings suggested that <italic>Bm-mamo</italic> is involved in the developmental regulation of multiple silkworm tissues. Due to the melanism of the epidermis of the <italic>bd</italic> mutant and the high expression level of the <italic>Bm-mamo</italic> gene in the epidermis, we measured the expression level of this gene in the epidermis of the 4th to 5th instars of the Dazao strain.

<p>To study the function of the <italic>Bm-mamo</italic> gene, we carried out an RNA interference (RNAi) experiment. Short interfering RNA (siRNA) was injected into the hemolymph of silkworms, and an electroporation experiment(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></italic>) was immediately conducted.

<title>Downstream target gene analysis</title>
<p><italic>Bm-mamo</italic> belongs to the zinc finger protein family, which specifically recognizes downstream DNA sequences according to their zinc fingers. We identified homologous genes of <italic>mamo</italic> in multiple species and conducted a phylogenetic analysis (Fig. S6). Sequence alignment revealed that the amino acid residues of the zinc finger motif of the mamo-S protein were highly conserved among 57 species. The insufficient ability of the different species in GenBank to predict alternative transcripts of mamo may have resulted in the mamo-L protein being found in only 30 species (Fig. S7). As the mamo protein contains a tandem Cys<sub>2</sub>His<sub>2</sub> zinc finger (C2H2-ZF) motif, it can directly bind to DNA sequences. Previous research has suggested that the ZF-DNA binding interface can be understood as a âcanonical binding modelâ, in which each finger contacts DNA in an antiparallel manner. The binding sequence of the C2H2-ZF motif is determined by the amino acid residue sequence of its Î±-helical component. The first amino acid residue in the Î±-helical region of the C2H2-ZF domain is at position 1, and positions â1, 2, 3, and 6 are key amino acids involved in the recognition and binding of DNA. The residues at positions â1, 3, and 6 specifically interact with base 3, base 2, and base 1 of the DNA sense sequence, respectively, while the residue at position 2 interacts with the complementary DNA strand(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></italic>). To analyze the downstream target genes of mamo, we first predicted the DNA-binding motifs of these genes using online software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://zf.princeton.edu">http://zf.princeton.edu</ext-link>) based on the canonical binding model(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></italic>). In addition, the DNA-binding sequence of mamo (<underline>TGCGT</underline>) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></italic>), which has a consensus sequence with the predicted binding site sequence of Bm-mamo-S (G<underline>TGCGT</underline>GGC), and the predicted sequence was longer. This indicates that the predicted results for the DNA-binding site have good reliability. Furthermore, the predicted DNA-binding sites of Bm-mamo-L and Bm-mamo-S were highly consistent with those of mamo orthologs in different species (Fig. S8). This finding suggested that the protein may regulate similar target genes between species.</p>
<p>C2H2-ZF transcription factors function by recognizing and binding to <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences in the genome, which harbor <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements (CREs)(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></italic>). CREs are broadly classified as promoters, enhancers, silencers or insulators(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></italic>). CREs are often near their target genes, such as enhancers, which are typically located upstream (5â) or downstream (3â) of the gene they regulate or in introns, but approximately 12% of CREs are located far from their target gene(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></italic>). Therefore, we first investigated the 2 kb upstream and downstream regions of the predicted genes in silkworms.</p>
<p>The predicted position weight matrices (PWMs) of the recognized sequences of Bm-mamo protein and the Find Individual Motif Occurrences (FIMO) software of MEME were used to perform silkworm whole-genome scanning for possible downstream target genes. The 2 kb upstream and downstream regions of the 14,623 predicted genes in silkworms were investigated. A total of 10,622 genes contained recognition sites within 2 kb of the upstream/downstream region of the Bm-mamo protein in the silkworm genome (Fig. S9, Table S3 &amp; Table S4).</p>
<p>Moreover, we compared the transcriptome data of integument tissue between homozygotes and heterozygotes of the <italic>bd</italic> mutant at the 4<sup>th</sup> instar/beginning molting stage(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></italic>). In the integument tissue, 10,072 genes (â¼69% of the total predicted genes of silkworm) were expressed in heterozygotes, and 9,853 genes (â¼67% of the total predicted genes) were expressed in homozygotes of the <italic>bd</italic> mutant. In addition, there were 191 genes whose expression significantly differed between homozygotes (<italic>bd</italic>/<italic>bd</italic>) and heterozygotes (+/<italic>bd</italic>) according to comparative transcriptome analysis (Table S5)(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></italic>). Protein functional annotation was performed, and 19 CP genes were significantly differentially expressed between heterozygotes and homozygotes of <italic>bd</italic>. In addition, the orthologs of these CPs were analyzed in <italic>Danaus plexippus</italic>, <italic>Papilio xuthu</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (Table S6). Furthermore, we identified 53 enzyme-encoding genes, 17 antimicrobial peptide genes, 6 transporter genes, 5 transcription factor genes, 5 cytochrome genes, and others. Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), CP was significantly enriched, and previous studies have shown that CPs can affect pigmentation(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></italic>). Therefore, we first investigated the expression of the CP genes. Among them, 18 CP genes had Bm-mamo binding sites in the upstream and downstream 2 kb genomic regions. In addition, we investigated the expression levels of the 18 CP genes in the integument from the 4<sup>th</sup> instar (Day 1) to the beginning of the 5<sup>th</sup> instar in the <italic>Bm-mamo</italic> knockout lines (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>&amp; Fig. S10). The CP genes were significantly upregulated at one or several time points in homozygous (<italic>mamo<sup>-</sup></italic>/<italic>mamo<sup>-</sup></italic>) individuals compared with heterozygous (<italic>mamo<sup>-</sup></italic>/<italic>+</italic>) <italic>Bm-mamo</italic> knockout individuals. Interestingly, the expression of the CP gene <italic>BmorCPH24</italic> was significantly upregulated at the feeding stage in <italic>Bm-mamo</italic> knockout homozygotes. Previous studies have shown that BmorCPH24 deficiency can lead to a marked decrease in pigmentation in silkworm larvae(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></italic>). Therefore, the expression of some CP genes may be necessary for determining the color patterns of caterpillars.</p>
<p>In addition, the synthesis of pigment substances is an important driver of color patterns(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></italic>). Eight key genes (<italic>TH</italic>, <italic>DDC</italic>, <italic>aaNAT</italic>, <italic>ebony</italic>, <italic>black</italic>, <italic>tan</italic>, <italic>yellow</italic> and <italic>laccase2</italic>) involved in melanin synthesis(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></italic>) were investigated in heterozygous and homozygous <italic>Bm-mamo</italic> gene knockout lines. Among them, <italic>yellow</italic>, <italic>tan</italic>, and <italic>DDC</italic> were significantly upregulated during the molting period in the homozygous <italic>Bm-mamo</italic> knockout individuals (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). The upstream and/or downstream 2 kb genomic regions of <italic>yellow</italic>, <italic>tan</italic> and <italic>DDC</italic> contain the binding site of the Bm-mamo protein. In addition, the expression of <italic>yellow</italic>, <italic>DDC</italic> and <italic>tan</italic> can promote the generation of melanin(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></italic>). To explore the interaction between the Bm-mamo protein and its binding sequence, EMSA was conducted. The binding site of Bm-mamo-S (C<underline>TGCGT</underline>GGT) was located approximately 70 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site of the <italic>Bm</italic>-<italic>yellow</italic> gene. The EMSA results showed that the Bm-mamo-S protein expressed in prokaryotes can bind to the C<underline>TGCGT</underline>GGT sequence in vitro (Fig. S11). This finding suggested that the Bm-mamo-S protein can bind to the upstream region of the <italic>Bm</italic>-<italic>yellow</italic> gene and regulate its transcription. Therefore, the <italic>Bm-mamo</italic> gene may control the color pattern of caterpillars by regulating key melanin synthesis genes and 18 CP genes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Insects have evolved many important phenotypes during the process of adapting to the environment. Among these traits, the color pattern is one of the most interesting. The biochemical metabolic pathways of pigments, such as melanin, ommochromes, and pteridines, have been identified in insects(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></italic>). However, the regulation of pigment metabolism-related genes and the processes involved in the transport and deposition of pigment substances are unclear. In this study, we discovered that the <italic>Bm-mamo</italic> gene negatively regulates melanin pigmentation in caterpillars. When this gene is deficient, the body color of silkworms exhibits substantial melanism, and changes in the expression of some melanin synthesis genes and some CP genes are also significant.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Structural genes of melanin synthesis</title>
<p>Deficiencies of some genes in the melanin synthesis pathway, such as <italic>TH</italic>, <italic>yellow</italic>, <italic>ebony</italic>, <italic>tan</italic>, and <italic>aaNAT,</italic> can lead to variations in color patterns (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></italic>). However, they often lead to localized pigmentation changes only in later-instar caterpillars. For example, in <italic>yellow</italic>-mutant silkworms, the eye spot, lunar spot, star spot, spiracle plate, head, and some sclerotized areas appear reddish brown, and the other cuticle is consistent with that in the wild type in later instars of larvae (third instar to fifth instar)(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></italic>). This situation is highly similar to that of the <italic>tan</italic> mutant in silkworms(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></italic>). Why do the <italic>yellow</italic> and <italic>tan</italic> phenotypes appear only in a limited cuticle region in later instars of silkworm larvae? One possible reason is that the expression of <italic>yellow</italic> and <italic>tan</italic> is limited to a certain region by transcription regulators. Alternatively, other factors, such as CPs in the cuticle, may limit pigmentation by interacting with pigment substances in the cuticle.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we investigated the expression levels of <italic>yellow</italic> and <italic>tan</italic> in the pigmented region (lunar spot) and nonpigmented region of the epidermis during the 4th molting of the wild-type Dazao strain. The expression level of <italic>yellow</italic> was significantly upregulated in the lunar spot (the epidermis on the dorsum of the fifth body segment) compared with the nonpigmented region (the epidermis on the dorsum of the sixth body segment) at 6 hours and 12 hours after molting.</p>
<p>Moreover, <italic>tan</italic> was significantly upregulated 18 hours after molting in the lunar spot region (Fig. S12). This finding suggested that the upregulated expression of pigment synthesis genes at key time points may be important for pigmentation. However, <italic>yellow</italic> and <italic>tan</italic> were still moderately expressed in the nonpigmented epidermis, although they did not cause significant melanin pigmentation. This finding indicates that pigment synthesis alone cannot determine the predominant color pattern of the cuticle in caterpillars.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b">
<title>Cuticular proteins participate in pigmentation</title>
<p>On the other hand, synthesized pigment substances need to be transported from epidermal cells and embedded into the cuticle to allow pigmentation. Therefore, the correct cuticle structure and location of cuticular proteins in the cuticle may be important factors affecting pigmentation. Previous studies have shown that a lack of expression of <italic>BmorCPH24</italic>, which encodes an important component of the endocuticle, can lead to dramatic changes in body shape and a significant reduction in the pigmentation of caterpillars(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></italic>). We crossed <italic>Bo</italic> (<italic>BmorCPH24</italic> null mutation) and <italic>bd</italic> to obtain F<sub>1</sub> (<italic>Bo</italic>/+<italic><sup>Bo</sup></italic>, <italic>bd</italic>/<italic>+</italic>) and then self-crossed F<sub>1</sub> to observe the phenotype of F<sub>2</sub>. The area of lunar spots and star spots decreased, and light-colored stripes appeared on the body segments; however, the other areas still exhibited significant melanin pigmentation in double-mutation (<italic>Bo</italic>, <italic>bd</italic>) individuals (Fig. S13). However, in previous studies, the introduction of <italic>Bo</italic> into <italic>L</italic> (ectopic expression of <italic>wnt1</italic> results in lunar stripes generated on each body segment)(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></italic>) and <italic>U</italic> (overexpression of <italic>SoxD</italic> results in excessive melanin pigmentation of the epidermis)(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></italic>) strains by genetic crosses markedly reduced the pigmentation of <italic>L</italic> and <italic>U</italic>(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></italic>). Interestingly, there was a more significant decrease in pigmentation in the double mutants (<italic>Bo</italic>, <italic>L</italic>) and (<italic>Bo</italic>, <italic>U</italic>) than in (<italic>Bo</italic>, <italic>bd</italic>). These findings suggested that <italic>Bm-mamo</italic> has a greater ability than does <italic>wnt1</italic> and <italic>SoxD</italic> to regulate pigmentation. On the one hand, mamo may be a stronger regulator of the melanin metabolic pathway, and on the other hand, mamo may regulate other CP genes to reduce the impact of BmorCPH24 deficiency.</p>
<p>How do CPs affect pigmentation? One study showed that some CPs can form âpore canalsâ to transport macromolecules(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></italic>). In addition, some CPs can be crosslinked with catecholamines, which are synthesized in the melanin metabolism pathway(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></italic>). Because there are no live cells in the cuticle, melanin precursor substances may be transported by the pore canals formed by some CPs and fixed to specific positions through cross-linking with CPs. The cuticular protein TcCPR4 is needed for the formation of pore canals in the cuticle of <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></italic>). In contrast, the vertical pore canal is lacking in the less pigmented cuticles of <italic>T. castaneum</italic>(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></italic>). This finding suggested that the pore canals constructed by TcCPR4 may transport pigments and contribute to cuticle pigmentation in <italic>T. castaneum</italic>. Moreover, the melanin metabolites N-acetyldopamine (NADA) and N-Î²-alanyldopamine (NBAD) can target and sclerotize the cuticle by cross-linking with specific cuticular proteins (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></italic>). This finding suggested that pigments interact with specific CPs, thereby affecting pigmentation, hardening properties and the structure of the cuticle. Interestingly, a study showed that in addition to absorbing specific wavelengths, pigments can affect cuticle polymerization, density, and the refractive index, which in turn affects the reflected wavelengths that produce structural color in butterfly wing scales(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></italic>). This implies that the interaction between pigments and CPs can be very subtle, resulting in the formation of unique nanostructures, such as those on wing scales, that produce brilliant structural colors.</p>
<p>Consequently, to maintain the accuracy of the color pattern, the localization of CPs in the cuticle may be very important. In a previous study employing microarray analysis, different CPs were found in differently colored areas of the epidermis in <italic>Papilio xuthus</italic> larvae(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></italic>). We investigated whether the CP genes were highly expressed in the black region of <italic>Papilio xuthus</italic> caterpillars. Thirteen orthologous genes were found in silkworms (Table S7). Among them, 11 genes (<italic>BmorCPR67</italic>, <italic>BmorCPR71</italic>, <italic>BmorCPR76</italic>, <italic>BmorCPR79</italic>, <italic>BmorCPR99</italic>, <italic>BmorCPR107</italic>, <italic>BmorCPT4</italic>, <italic>BmorCPH5</italic>, <italic>BmorCPFL4</italic>, <italic>BmorCPG27</italic> and <italic>BmorCPG4</italic>) were significantly upregulated in homozygous (<italic>mamo<sup>-</sup></italic>/<italic>mamo<sup>-</sup></italic>) knockout individuals at some time points from the 3rd day of the 4th instar to the 5th instar; <italic>BmorCPG4</italic> was also among the 18 previously detected CP genes, and two genes (<italic>BmorCPG38</italic> and <italic>BmorCPR129</italic>) were not differentially expressed between homozygous (<italic>mamo<sup>-</sup></italic>/<italic>mamo<sup>-</sup></italic>) and heterozygous (<italic>mamo<sup>-</sup></italic>/<italic>+</italic>) individuals (Fig. S14). The expression of the 28 CP genes mentioned above was significantly upregulated in homozygous (<italic>mamo<sup>-</sup></italic>/<italic>mamo<sup>-</sup></italic>) gene knockout individuals at several stages. These CPs may be involved in the transportation or cross-linking of melanin in the cuticle. However, there were no differences in the expression levels of these genes during some periods compared with those in the control group, and the expression of some genes was significantly downregulated at some time points in the melanic individuals (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). This finding suggested that the regulation of CP genes is complex and may involve other transcription factors and feedback effects. CPs are essential components of the insect cuticle and are involved in cuticular microstructure construction (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></italic>), body shape development(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></italic>), wing morphogenesis(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></italic>), and pigmentation(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></italic>). CP genes usually account for more than 1% of the total genes in an insect genome and can be categorized into several families, including CPR, CPG, CPH, CPAP1, CPAP3, CPT, CPF and CPFL(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></italic>). The CPR family is the largest group of CPs and contains a chitin-binding domain called the Rebers and Riddiford motif (R&amp;R)(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></italic>). The variation in the R&amp;R consensus sequence can be divided into three subfamilies (RR-1, RR-2, and RR-3)(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></italic>). Among the 28 CPs, 11 RR-1 genes, 6 RR-2 genes, 4 hypothetical cuticular protein (CPH) genes, 3 glycine-rich cuticular protein (CPG) genes, 3 cuticular protein Tweedle motif (CPT) genes, and 1 CPFL (like the CPFs in a conserved C-terminal region) gene were identified. The RR-1 consensus among species is usually more variable than the RR-2 consensus, which suggests that RR-1 may have a species-specific function. RR-2 often clustered into several branches, which may be due to gene duplication events in co-orthologous groups and may result in conserved functions between species (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></italic>). The classification of CPH was based on the lack of known motifs. In the epidermis of Lepidoptera, CPH genes often exhibit high expression levels. For example, <italic>BmorCPH24</italic> has the highest expression level in the silkworm larval epidermis(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></italic>). The CPG protein is rich in glycine. The CPH and CPG genes are less commonly found in insects outside the order Lepidoptera (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></italic>). This finding suggested that these genes may provide species-specific functions for Lepidoptera. CPT contains a Tweedle motif, and the <italic>TweedleD1</italic> mutation has a dramatic effect on body shape in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></italic>). The CPFL family members are relatively conserved among species and may be involved in the synthesis of larval cuticles(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></italic>). CPT and CPFL may have relatively conserved functions among insects. The CP genes are a group of rapidly evolving genes, and their copy numbers may undergo significant changes in different species. In addition, RNAi experiments on 135 CP genes in the brown planthopper (<italic>Nilaparvata lugens</italic>) revealed that deficiency of 32 CP genes leads to significant defects in phenotypes, such as lethality and developmental retardation. These findings suggested that the 32 CP genes are indispensable and that other CP genes may have redundant and complementary functions (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></italic>). In previous studies, it was found that the construction of the larval cuticle of silkworms requires the precise expression of more than two hundred CP genes(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></italic>). The production, interaction, and deposition of CPs and pigments are complex and precise processes, and our research showed that <italic>Bm-mamo</italic> plays an important regulatory role in this process in silkworm caterpillars. To further understand the role of CPs, future work should aim to identify the functions of important cuticular protein genes and the deposition mechanism in the cuticle.</p>

In the ommochrome metabolic pathway, <italic>Bm-re</italic>, which encodes an MFS protein, may function in the transportation of several amino acids, such as cysteine or methionine, into pigment granules(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></italic>). Therefore, the encoded product of <italic>BmMFS</italic> may participate in pigmentation by promoting the maturation of pigment granules. Moreover, <italic>BGIBMGA013576</italic> and <italic>BGIBMGA013656</italic>, which encode MFS domain-containing proteins belonging to the solute carrier family 22 (SLC22) and solute carrier family 2 (SLC2) families, respectively, were significantly upregulated in <italic>bd</italic>. These two genes may participate in pigmentation in a similar manner to that of the <italic>BmMFS</italic> gene. In addition, the <italic>red Malpighian tubule</italic> (<italic>red</italic>) gene encodes a LysM domain-containing protein. <italic>Red</italic> deficiency results in a significant decrease in orange pterin in the wing of <italic>Colias</italic> butterflies. Research suggests that the product of <italic>red</italic> may interact with V-ATPase to modulate vacuolar pH across a variety of endosomal organelles, thereby affecting the maturation of pigment granules in cells(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></italic>). These findings indicate that the maturation of pigment granules plays an important role in the coloring of Lepidoptera and that <italic>Bm-mamo</italic> may be involved in regulating the maturation of pigment granules in the epidermal cells of silkworms.</p>
<p><italic>Bm-mamo</italic> may affect the synthesis of melanin in epidermal cells by regulating <italic>yellow</italic>, <italic>DDC</italic>, and <italic>tan</italic>, regulate the maturation of melanin granules in epidermal cells through <italic>BmMFS</italic>, and affect the deposition of melanin granules in the cuticle by regulating CP genes, thereby comprehensively regulating the color pattern of caterpillars.</p>

<title>The upstream sequence of <italic>Bm-mamo</italic></title>
<p>Moreover, in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>mamo</italic> is needed for functional gamete production. In the silkworm, <italic>Bm-mamo</italic> has a conserved function in female reproduction. The DNA-binding motifs of the mamo proteins in silkworms and fruit flies are highly conserved, suggesting that they may regulate the same downstream target genes. However, <italic>mamo</italic> has developed new functions in color pattern regulation in silkworm caterpillars. We found that in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, the <italic>mamo</italic> gene is expressed mainly during the adult stage; it is not expressed during the 1<sup>st</sup> instar or 2<sup>nd</sup> instar larval stage and has very low expression at the 3<sup>rd</sup> instar (Table S8). In addition, several binding sites of mamo were found near the TSS of <italic>yellow</italic> in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (Fig. S15). The <italic>yellow</italic> gene is a key melanin metabolic gene with upstream and intron sequences that have been identified as multiple CREs, and it has been considered a research model for CREs (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></italic>). This difference may be due to a change in the expression pattern of <italic>mamo,</italic> which led to the development of a new function for this gene in regulating coloration in silkworm caterpillars. Changes in gene expression patterns are generally believed to be the result of the evolution of CREs. Because CREs play important roles in the spatiotemporal expression pattern regulation of genes, many CREs are found in noncoding regions, which are relatively prone to sequence variation compared with the sequences of coding genes(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></italic>). However, the molecular mechanism underlying the sequence changes in CREs is unclear.</p>
<p>TFs, because they recognize relatively short sequences, generally between 4 and 20 bp in length, can have many binding sites in the genome(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></italic>). Therefore, one member of the TF family has the potential to regulate many genes in one genome. Single regulation of specific TFs can lead to patterned changes in the expression of multiple downstream genes, enabling organisms to adapt to the environment by altering a given type of trait. For example, the marine form of the three-spined stickleback (<italic>Gasterosteus aculeatus</italic>) has thick armor, whereas the lake population (which was recently derived from the marine form) does not. Research has shown that pelvic loss in different natural populations of three-spined stickleback fishes occurs via regulatory mutations resulting from the deletion of a tissue-specific enhancer (<italic>Pel</italic>) of the <italic>pituitary homeobox transcription factor 1</italic> (<italic>Pitx1</italic>) gene. The researchers genotyped 13 pelvic-reduced populations of three-spined sticklebacks from disparate geographic locations. Nine of the 13 pelvic-reduced stickleback populations had sequence deletions of varying lengths, all of which were located at the <italic>Pel</italic> enhancer (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>We investigated nucleotide diversity in 51 wild silkworms and 171 domesticated silkworms (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></italic>). The nucleotide diversity of introns and upstream sequences of <italic>Bm-mamo</italic> in wild silkworms was significantly greater than that in domestic silkworms. In addition, the approximately 1 kb genomic region upstream had high fixation indices (<italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic>) (Fig. S16). This indicates a significant degree of differentiation between the wild strains in this genomic region. Multiple sequence alignment analysis of this region was performed between 12 wild silkworms and 12 domestic silkworms (Fig. S17 &amp; Table S9). The results showed that the wild silkworm group had a greater degree of nucleotide variation, while the sequences in domestic silkworms were highly conserved. The domestic silkworm group had two different forms: one had a long interspersed nuclear element (LINE) inserted at approximately 4.5 kb, and the other did not have this transposon sequence. It is suggested that this genomic region is prone to variation in wild silkworm and is fixed in domestic silkworms. The larvae of domesticated strains often have a lighter or even pale body color, but the wild-type strains have a darker color. The <italic>Bm-mamo</italic> gene may be involved in the domestication of silkworms.</p>
<p>The function of TFs is to precisely regulate the temporal and spatial expression of target genes. Therefore, the expression of TFs requires strict regulation. There are long intergenic regions upstream of many important TFs, dozens of kilobase pairs (Kb) to hundreds of Kb, which may contain many CREs for better control its expression pattern. It has often been believed that changes in CREs are caused by random mutations. However, recent studies have shown that there is a mutation bias in the genome; compared with that in the intergenic region, the mutation frequency is reduced by half inside gene bodies and by two-thirds in essential genes. In addition, they compared the mutation rates of genes with different functions. The mutation rate in the coding region of essential genes (such as translation) is the lowest, and the mutation rates in the coding region of specialized functional genes (such as environmental response) are the highest. These patterns are mainly affected by the features of the epigenome(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></italic>). Due to the plasticity of epigenomic features, mutations bias associated with epigenomes may even lead to environmental influences on mutations (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></italic>). This finding suggested that different functional regions in the genome are subject to distinct controls and that some sequences can undergo procedural changes under environmental changes. Therefore, some variations in the CRE of TFs in response to environmental changes may be mutation bias.</p>

<p>This papers performs fine-mapping of the silkworm mutants bd and its fertile allelic version, bdf, narrowing down the causal intervals to a small interval of a handful of genes. In this region, the gene orthologous to mamo is impaired by a large indel, and its function is later confirmed using expression profiling, RNAi, and CRISPR KO.

<p>The genotype-to-phenotype workflow, combining forward (mapping) and reverse genetics (RNAi and CRISPR loss-of-function assays) linking mamo to pigmentation are extremely convincing.</p>
<p>Comments on latest version:</p>
<p>This second revision took into account all the reviewers' comments. The authors added an interesting analysis of nucleotide diversity at the Bm-mamo locus, using available sequence data from 51 wild silkworms and 171 domesticated silkworms.</p>
<p>
The last paragraph added to the discussion, starting with &quot;It has often been believed that changes in CREs are caused by random mutations&quot;, is speculative. There is currently no evidence that the mutation rate is biased at the Bm-mamo locus.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>eLife assessment</p>
<p>This important study identifies the gene mamo as a new regulator of pigmentation in the silkworm Bombyx mori, a function that was previously unsuspected based on extensive work on Drosophila where the mamo gene is involved in gamete production. The evidence supporting the role of Bm-nano in pigmentation is convincing, including high-resolution linkage mapping of two mutant strains, expression profiling, and reproduction of the mutant phenotypes with state-of-the-art RNAi and CRISPR knock-out assays. While the discussion about genetic changes being guided or accelerated by the environment is extremely speculative and has little relevance for the findings presented, the work will be of interest to evolutionary biologists and geneticists studying color patterns and evolution of gene networks.</p>

<p>Response: Thank you very much for your careful work. In the revised version, we conducted a comparative genomic analysis of the upstream regions of the Bm-mamo gene in 51 wild silkworms and 171 domesticated local silkworms. The analysis of nucleotide diversity (pi) and the fixation index (FSTs) of the Bm-mamo genome sequences in the wild and domesticated silkworm populations were also performed. The results showed that the Bm-mamo genome sequence of local silkworms was relatively conserved, while the upstream sequence of wild silkworms exhibited high nucleotide diversity. This finding suggested a high degree of variability in the regulatory region of the Bm-mamo gene, in wild strains. Additionally, the sequence in this region may have been fixed by domestication selection. We have optimized the description in the discussion section.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This papers performs fine-mapping of the silkworm mutants bd and its fertile allelic version, bdf, narrowing down the causal intervals to a small interval of a handful of genes. In this region, the gene orthologous to mamo is impaired by a large indel, and its function is later confirmed using expression profiling, RNAi, and CRISPR KO. All these experiments are convincingly showing that mamo is necessary for the suppression of melanic pigmentation in the silkworm larval integument.</p>
<p>The authors also use in silico and in vitro assays to probe the potential effector genes that mamo may regulate.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The genotype-to-phenotype workflow, combining forward (mapping) and reverse genetics (RNAi and CRISPR loss-of-function assays) linking mamo to pigmentation are extremely convincing.</p>
<p>This revision is a much improved manuscript and I command the authors for many of their edits.</p>

<p>Response: Thank you very much for your careful work. With the help of reviewers and editors, we have revised the manuscript to improve its readability.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I find the last part of the discussion, starting at &quot;It is generally believed that changes in gene expression patterns are the result of the evolution of CREs&quot;, to be confusing.</p>
<p>In this section, I believe the authors sequentially:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>emphasize the role of CRE in morphological evolution (I agree)</p>
</list-item></list>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>emphasize that TF, and in particular their own CRE, are themselves important mutational targets of evolution (I agree, but the phrasing need to insist the authors are here talking about the CRE found at the TF locus, not the CRE bound by the TF).</p>
</list-item></list>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>use the stickleback Pel enhancer as an example, which I think is a good case study, but the authors also then make an argument about DNA fragility sites, which is hard to connect with the present study.</p>
</list-item></list>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>then continue on &quot;DNA fragility&quot; using the peppered moth and butterfly cortex locus. There is no evidence of DNA fragility at these loci, so the connection does not work. &quot;The cortex gene locus is frequently mutated in Lepidoptera&quot;, the authors say. But a more accurate picture would be that the cortex locus is repeatedly involved in the generation of color pattern variants. Unlike for Pel fragile enhancer, we don't know if the causal mutations at this locus are repeatedly the same, and the haplotypes that have been described could be collateral rather than causal. Overall, it is important to clarify the idea that mutation bias is a possible factor explaining &quot;genetic hotspots of evolution&quot; (or genetic parallelism sensu 10.1038/nrg3483), but it is also possible that many genetic hotspots are repeated mutational targets because of their &quot;optimal pleiotropy&quot; (e.g. hub position in GRNs, such as mamo might be), or because of particularly modular CRE region that allow fine-tuning. Thus, I find the &quot;fragility&quot; argument misleading here. In fact the finding that &quot;bd&quot; and &quot;bdf&quot; alleles are different in nature is against the idea of a fragility bias (unless the authors can show increased mutation rates at this locus in a wild silkmoth species?). These alleles are also artificially-selected ie. they increased in frequency by breeding rather than natural selection in the wild, so while interesting for our understand of the genotype-phenotype map, they are not necessarily representative of the mutations that may underlie evolution in the wild.</p>

<p>Response: Thank you very much for your careful work. DNA fragility is an interesting topic, but some explanations for DNA fragility are confusing. One study measured the rate of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs), which are chromosomes containing marine Pel that broke ~25 to 50 times more frequently than did the control. These authors believe that the increase in the mutation rate is caused by DNA sequence characteristics, particularly TG-dinucleotide repeats. Moreover, they found that adding a replication origin on the opposite side of Pel did not cause the fungus to switch fragile, making the forward sequence stable and the reverse complement fragile. Thus, Pel fragility is also dependent on the direction of DNA replication. In summary, they suggested that the special DNA sequence is the cause of DNA fragility. In addition, the sequence features associated with DNA fragility in the Pel region are also found in thousands of other positions in the stickleback and human genomes (Xie KT et al, 2019, science).</p>
<p>In yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs), the characteristics of DNA sequences, such as TG-dinucleotide repeat sequences, may be important reasons for DNA fragility, and these breaks occur during DNA replication. However, the inserted sequence of YAC often undergoes deletion or recombination during cultivation and passage. In addition, yeast is a single-celled organism. Therefore, the results in yeast cannot represent the situation in multicellular organisms. If multicellular organisms are like this, there are several issues as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The DNA replication process occurs separately in different multicellular organisms. Because DNA breakage and repair are independent, they can lead to the presence of different alleles in different cells. This can potentially lead to the occurrence of extensive chimeric organisms. However, we have not found such a situation in the genome sequencing of many multicellular organisms.</p>
<p>(2) If the DNA sequence, TG-dinucleotide repeats, is the determining factor, the mutations near the sequence lose their strong correlation with environmental changes. The researchers conducted yeast artificial chromosome experiments in the same environment and found that the frequency of DNA breaks containing TG dinucleotide repeat sequences was 25 to 50 times greater than that of the control group. This means that, whether in the marine population or the lake population, this part of the sticklebacksâ genome has undergone frequent mutations. However, according to related research, populations of lake sticklebacks, rather than marine populations, often exhibit a decrease in the pelvic phenotype.</p>
<p>(3) Researchers have found thousands of loci in the genome of sticklebacks and humans that contain such sequences (TG-dinucleotide repeats). This means that thousands of sites undergo frequent mutations during DNA replication. Unless these sites do not possess functionality, they will have some impact on the organism, even causing damage. Even if they are not functional sequences, these sequences will gradually be discarded or replaced during frequent mutations rather than being present in large quantities in the genome.</p>
<p>Therefore, the study of DNA fragility in yeast cannot explain the situation in multicellular organisms.</p>
<p>As you noted, we want to express that the frequent variation in the cortex gene should be regulated by targeted regulation involving the GRN in Lepidoptera. In addition, studies on specific epigenetic modifications discovered through the referenced fragile DNA sites suggest that DNA fragility is not determined by the DNA sequence (Ji F, 2020, Cell Res) but rather by other factors, such as epigenetic factors. The sequence features discovered at fragile DNA sites are traces of frequent mutations, not causes.</p>
<p>In this revision, we analyzed the nucleotide diversity of the mamo genome in 51 wild and 171 domestic silkworms. We found high nucleic acid diversity from the third exon to the upstream region of this gene in wild silkworms. We randomly selected 12 wild silkworms and 12 domestic silkworms and compared their upstream sequences to approximately 1 kb. In wild silkworms, there is significant diversity in their upstream sequences. In domestic silkworms, the sequences are highly conserved, but in some silkworms, a long interspersed nuclear element (LINE) is inserted. This finding suggested that there is frequent variation in the sequence of this region in wild silkworms, while fixation occurs in domesticated silkworms. These genomic data are sourced from the pangenome of silkworms (Tong X, 2022, Nat Commun.). In the pangenomic research, 1078 strains (205 local strains, 194 improved strains, 632 mutant strains, and 47 wild silkworms), which included 545 third-generation sequencing genomes, were obtained. An online website was built to utilize these data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://silkmeta.org.cn/">http://silkmeta.org.cn/</ext-link>). We warmly welcome you to use these data.</p>

<p>Curiously, the last paragraph (&quot;Some research suggests that common fragile sites...&quot;) elaborate on the idea that some sites of the genome are prone to mutation. The connection with mamo and the current article are extremely thin. There is here an attempt to connect meiotic and mitotic breaks to Bm-mamo, but this is confusing: it seems to propose Bm-mamo as a recruiter of epigenetic modulators that may drive higher mutation rates elsewhere. Not only I am not convinced by this argument without actual data, but this would not explain how the mutations at the Bm-mamo itself evolved.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Thank you very much for your careful work. This section mainly illustrates that DNA fragility is not determined by sequence but is regulated by other factors in animals. In fruit flies, they found that mamo is an important candidate gene for recombination hotspot setting in meiosis. First, we evaluated PRDM9, which plays an important role in setting recombination hotspots during meiosis. Our purpose in mentioning this information is to illustrate that chromosome recombination is a process of programmed double strand breaks and to answer another reviewer's question about programmed events in the genome. In summary, we suggest that some variations in DNA sequences are procedural results.
We have optimized the description of this section in this version.</p>

<p>On a more positive note, I find it fascinating that the authors identified a TF that clearly articulates or orchestrate larval pattern development, and that when it is deleted, can generate healthy individuals. In other words, while it is a TF with many targets, it is not too pleiotropic. This idea, that the genetically causal modulators of developmental evolution are regulatory genes, has been described elsewhere (e.g. Fig 4c in 10.1038/s41576-020-0234-z, and associated refs). To me, the beautiful findings about Bm-mamo make sense in the general, existing framework that developmental processes and regulatory networks &quot;shape&quot; the evolutionary potential and trajectories of organisms. There is a degree of &quot;programmability&quot; in the genomes, because some loci are particularly prone to modulate a given type of trait. Here, Bm-mamo, as a potentially regulator of both CPs and melanin pathway genes, appear to be a potent modulator of epithelial traits. Claiming that there are inherent mutational biases behind this is unwarranted.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Thank you very much for your careful work. I completely agree with your statement that the genome exhibits a certain degree of programmability. On the one hand, some transcription factors can precisely control the spatiotemporal expression levels of some structural genes (such as pigment synthesis genes). On the other hand, these transcription factors are also subject to strict expression regulation. Because the color pattern is complex, changes in single or minority structural genes result in incomplete or imprecise changes in coloring patterns. Nevertheless, several regulatory factors can regulate multiple downstream target genes. Changes in their expression patterns can lead to holistic and significant changes in color patterns. There are long intergenic regions upstream of many important transcription factors, dozens of kilobase pairs (Kb) to hundreds of Kb, which may contain many different regulatory elements for better control of their expression patterns. Therefore, gene regulatory networks can directly regulate transcription factors to modulate a given type of trait. Transcription factors and their downstream target genes can form a functional module, which is similar to a functional module in software or operating systems. This regulation of transcription factors is simpler in terms of steps, which are similar to a single click switch button. The gene regulatory network regulates these modules in response to environmental changes and is widely recognized.</p>
<p>Some people do not agree that genetic variations can also be regulated. They claim that this is completely random. The infinite monkey theorem (FÃ©lix-Ãdouard-Justin-Ãmile Borel, 1909) states that if an infinite number of monkeys were given typewriters and an infinite amount of time, they would eventually produce the complete works of Shakespeare. Although this theory advocates randomness on the surface, its conclusions are full of inevitability (tail event). In nature, some things we observe do not have obvious regularity because they involve relatively complex factors, and the underlying logic is obscure and difficult to understand. We often name them random. However, as we gradually understand the logic behind this complex event, we can also recognize the procedural nature of this randomness.</p>
<p>Previously, chromosomal recombination during meiosis was believed to be a random event. However, currently, it is believed that the process is procedural. The occurrence of meiotic recombination mentioned earlier indicates that the genome has the ability to self-set the position of double-strand breaks to form new allelic forms. Because meiotic recombination is programmed, transcription factors that recognize DNA sites, enzymes that cleave double strands, and DNA repair systems exist, programming can also introduce genetic variation. A study in plants has provided insights into this programmed mutation (Monroe JG, 2023, nature).
Frequent changes in the expression patterns of some transcription factors occur between and/or within species. In this article, we only discuss the possible reasons for variations in the expression patterns of some transcription factors in a general manner and simple reasoning. We have added an analysis of the response of wild silkworms and improved the relevance of the discussion.</p>

<list-item><p>Editorial comment on the second half of the Abstract:</p>
</list-item></list>
<p>Wu et al : &quot;We found that Bm-mamo can comprehensively regulate the expression of related pigment synthesis and cuticular protein genes to form color patterns. This indicates that insects have a genetic basis for coordinate regulation of the structure and shape of the cuticle, as well as color patterns. This genetic basis provides the possibility for constructing the complex appearances of some insects. This study provides new insight into the regulation of color patterns.&quot;</p>
<p>I respectfully suggest a more accurate rephrasing, where the methods are mentioned, and where the logical argument is more straightforward. For example</p>
<p>&quot;Using RNAi and CRISPR we show that Bm-mamo is a repressor or dark melanin patterns in the larval epithelium. Using in-vitro binding assays and gene expression profiling in wild-type and mutant larvae, we also show that Bm-mamo likely regulate the expression of related pigment synthesis and cuticular protein genes in a coordinated manner to mediate its role in color pattern formation. This mechanism is consistent with a dual role of this transcription factor in regulating both the structure and shape of the cuticle and pigments that are embedded within it. This study provides new insight into the regulation of color patterns as well as in the construction more complex epithelial features in some insects.&quot;</p>
<p>I hope this let the ideas of the original version transpire as the authors intended.</p>
