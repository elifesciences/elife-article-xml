<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>There is a growing understanding of how alternative splicing contributes to functional specialization and adaptation, especially in well-studied model organisms. However, its large-scale evolutionary dynamics remain poorly understood. Through a comparative analysis of alternative splicing across 1,494 species spanning the entire tree of life, this study integrates numerous lines of prior evidence to provide a unified view of alternative splicing. We propose a novel genome-scale metric designed to support cross-species comparison. Our findings indicate that alternative splicing is highly variable across lineages. While unicellular eukaryotes and prokaryotes display minimal splicing, mammals and birds exhibit the highest levels of alternative splicing. Despite sharing a conserved intron-rich genomic architecture, mammals and birds show considerable interspecies divergence in splicing activity. In contrast, plants display moderate levels of alternative splicing but exhibit high variability of genomic composition. Furthermore, a strong negative correlation is observed between alternative splicing and the proportion of coding content in genes, with the highest levels of alternative splicing observed in genomes containing approximately 50% intergenic DNA.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Alternative splicing is the post-transcriptional mechanism by which different protein isoforms are generated from a single gene by the selective combination of exons and introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Rogalska et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bush et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, it allows functional diversification of a single gene without increasing the number of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">2012</xref>), though it relies on a highly sophisticated set of splicing factors and regulatory pathways to maintain accuracy. This process is central to organismal complexity, regulating gene expression across different tissues, developmental stages, and environmental conditions. On one side, it is involved in essential biological functions, such as tissue differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wright et al., 2022</xref>), neural development, and immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Rogozin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wolf and Koonin, 2013</xref>), where it is highly conserved to maintain functional integrity and precise gene regulation. However, its weak splice sites allow for greater plasticity, enabling adaptation to different conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Caron et al., 2017</xref>). As a result, it also serves as a major driver of biological innovation, promoting functional diversification and adaptability by expanding transcriptomic and proteomic diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Su et al., 2006</xref>). It has been described as a form of “evolutionary tinkering”, where gradual accumulation of mutations can introduce or remove splice sites, leading to the production of alternative protein isoforms with modified structural and regulatory properties. Thus, it enables functional adaptations while maintaining essential biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Mattick, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Over the past 1,400 million years, alternative splicing rates have steadily increased, particularly within the metazoan lineage, coinciding with the emergence of specialized cell types and tissuespecific gene regulation. Prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes exhibit significantly lower alternative splicing rates, supporting the idea that it represents an advanced regulatory feature associated with multicellularity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Rogozin et al., 2012</xref>). On the other side, vertebrates exhibit significantly higher levels of alternative splicing than invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hinman and Cary, 2017</xref>), and different taxonomic groups have developed distinct splicing strategies. Animals, in particular mammals, birds, and arthropods, display the highest levels of alternative splicing, whereas plants show intermediate splicing levels, suggesting that it evolved independently in this lineage. Notably, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al. (2014)</xref> found no significant difference in alternative splicing levels between birds and mammals, contradicting earlier reports. In contrast to animals, several studies have shown that plants exhibit lower alternative splicing rates but compensate through gene duplication and genome expansion via transposable elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Koralewski and Krutovsky, 2011</xref>). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Koonin (2006)</xref>, authors observed that some large plant genomes, such as maize, exhibit higher alternative splicing rates than smaller genomes like Arabidopsis, suggesting a positive correlation between genome complexity and transcriptomic flexibility. In plants, genome expansion frequently occurs through whole-genome duplications and repetitive element accumulation, both of which create additional opportunities for splice site recognition and regulation. Polyploidy, the presence of multiple chromosome sets, is a widespread feature in plant evolution, with approximately 70% of flowering plants having undergone whole-genome duplications. These duplications lead to subfunctionalization, where duplicated genes evolve different splicing isoforms to fulfill distinct functional roles, thereby increasing alternative splicing diversity. Another major factor influencing alternative splicing in plants is the expansion of transposable elements, particularly retrotransposons, which significantly contribute to genome size and structural variation. As a consequence, plant genomes accumulate large noncoding intergenic regions due to expansion of transposable elements, further influencing alternative splicing regulation.</p>
<p>The expansion of non-coding genomic regions has played a key role in the evolutionary development of alternative splicing. The evolution of coding sequences is not uniform across genes; essential genes involved in transcription, translation, and metabolic processes tend to evolve more slowly, while genes related to immune responses and environmental adaptation undergo faster rates of sequence change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cavalier-Smith, 2005</xref>). It has been revealed that highly expressed genes evolve at slower rates due to their structural stability and efficient folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Koonin, 2009</xref>). Selection pressure against protein misfolding constrains sequence variation, particularly in essential genes, such as those encoding core cellular machinery. As a consequence, the constraints imposed on coding sequences also vary across the major groups, with prokaryotes displaying higher sequence conservation due to compact genomes and high selective pressures. In contrast, multicellular eukaryotes exhibit higher plasticity, reflecting the impact of relaxed selection and functional specialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Koonin and Wolf, 2010</xref>). Comparative genomic studies have revealed that while coding sequences are subject to strong functional constraints, non-coding elements exhibit greater evolutionary plasticity, often expanding through genome duplications and transposable element activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ahnert et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Silva et al., 2020</xref>). Non-coding sequences introduce new regulatory elements that influence alternative splicing and gene expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Veena, Patil and Rana, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Koonin and Wolf, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wolf and Koonin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Li et al., 2024</xref>). In particular, increased intron length correlates with greater transcriptomic complexity, as it is involved in the fine-tuning of gene expression through alternative splicing mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Oesterreich et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, these observations highlight the complex interplay between non-coding sequence expansion and splicing regulation, although the precise relationship between genome architecture and alternative splicing dynamics remains to be fully elucidated. This gap motivates the need for standardized, genome-wide metrics to better understand splicing patterns across species. Advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have revealed an unprecedented level of transcript diversity, uncovering previously unrecognized splicing events across multiple species and contributing to our knowledge of its regulatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Shapiro, 2017</xref>). Several studies have developed databases for alternative splicing analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Itoh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Holste et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kim et al., 2006</xref>). However, while these studies have uncovered important gaps, they remain isolated findings. Most of these databases focus on model organisms, such as human and mouse genomes, and primarily focus on conserved splicing events. In addition, most comparative studies rely on orthology-based methods and multiple sequence alignment. While these techniques are effective for detecting evolutionary conservation in alternative splicing patterns, these methodologies restrict their applicability in large-scale comparative analyses across distantly related taxa. To date, no study has integrated the vast body of knowledge generated. There is still no standardized metric available for cross-species comparisons of alternative splicing. Here, we propose a whole-genome measure, the <italic>Alternative Splicing Ratio</italic>, which can be computed from high-quality annotation files such as those provided by the NCBI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Pruitt et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, we examine methodological biases in the NCBI annotation files, evaluating how factors such as RNA-Seq depth, computational approaches, and tissue diversity influence alternative splicing detection. Thus, we provide a standarized measure that minimizes these biases, providing a reliable framework for cross-species comparisons. This study represents the first large-scale comparative genomic analysis that integrates data from alternative splicing events across more than a thousand species, encompassing the entire tree of life, and offering a comprehensive perspective on their evolutionary relationship.</p>

<title>Genome variables</title>
<p>The compositional structure of genomes is organized into hierarchical domains, reflecting distinct levels of DNA sequence organization. To characterize this structure, we consider three key genomic variables: genome size, gene content, and coding content. Within the genome, the gene content represents the total amount of DNA that forms genes, encompassing both coding and non-coding regions. Coding content, in turn, refers to the amount of DNA within genes that is transcribed into mRNA. Unlike untranslated regions (UTRs) or intronic sequences, Coding DNA Sequences (CDSs) are composed of sequences that contribute directly to mRNA synthesis.</p>
<p>Alternative splicing is the process by which different combinations of exons and introns are selectively retained or excluded during pre-mRNA processing, resulting in the production of distinct mRNA isoforms. Here we propose a novel genome-wide metric, the <italic>Alternative Splicing Ratio</italic> (ASR), which quantifies the average number of distinct transcripts generated per coding sequence. The ASR is mathematically defined in Methods and schematically illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref>. Although it is computable for single genes, it is extended to the entire genome by mapping every transcribed CDS detected in a species onto its genomic coordinates. Thus, it provides a global quantification of alternative splicing, capturing the extent to which coding sequences are reused across the entire transcriptome. By summarizing this complexity into a single numerical value, it enables large-scale comparative analyses across species, facilitating the study of transcriptomic diversity and evolutionary patterns of splicing regulation. As described in Methods, ASR was computed for 1,494 species spanning the entire tree of life. Additionally, to correct for annotation-related biases, we computed a normalized value, ASR<sup>∗</sup>, that accounts for inconsistencies in genome annotations across species. This normalization was necessary to mitigate biases introduced by differences in sequencing depth, tissue diversity, assembly quality, and computational gene prediction, ensuring more accurate cross-species comparisons.</p>

The ASR is then computed as the ratio of the total number of nucleotides in mRNA isoforms to the number of nucleotides composing coding DNA: <italic>ASr</italic> = (16 + 9 + 19)∕25 = 1.76.</p></caption>

<title>Variation in Alternative Splicing Among Major Clades</title>
<p>We performed a comparative analysis to identify variations in alternative splicing across different taxonomic groups. We conducted comparisons of mean values using Welch’s ANOVA with Bonferroni correction to control for multiple testing. To further validate our findings, we also conducted a Monte Carlo permutation test, which supported the conclusions (see Methods). Due to the presence of extreme outliers, we conducted the permutation test by comparing both the mean and the median. These two measures of central tendency provide complementary insights into the data distributions, which are non-normal in most cases. The mean, while sensitive to extreme values, gives an overall measure of centrality, whereas the median offers a more robust estimate that is less influenced by outliers. Quantitative results of the Monte Carlo permutation test are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Table 1</xref> of Supplementary File 1.</p>
<p>To explore how alternative splicing varies across the tree of life, we first compared the distribution of ASR and ASR<sup>∗</sup> values across a broad range of taxonomic groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref>). The results revealed significant differences for most comparisons, with only few exceptions. Overall, unicellular organisms—including archaea, bacteria, fungi, and unicellular eukaryotes—tend to exhibit comparable levels of alternative splicing, with particular similarity observed between unicellular eukaryotes, fungi, and bacteria. Among multicellular taxa, mammals and birds display similar ASR values, as do arthropods and fish. Slight differences were observed in the comparisons when using the normalized ASR value (ASR<sup>∗</sup>). In particular, we found that plants exhibit values comparable to those of fish, despite their distant evolutionary relationship. Similarly, arthropods and birds also display similar ASR<sup>∗</sup> median values. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls3">Table 3</xref> of Supplementary File 1, the average ASR values indicate that mammals exhibit the highest alternative splicing activity (3.1), followed by birds (2.7), fish and arthropods (2.2), plants (1.6), and unicellular organisms (1), the latter indicating minimal or no alternative splicing. When normalized ASR<sup>∗</sup> values are considered, the ranking among multicellular taxa is maintained, with mammals showing the highest values (2.8), followed by birds (2.5), arthropods (2.3), and both fish and plants with values around 2.</p>

</fig>
<p>In addition to alternative splicing, we also examined whether certain genomic composition variables differ across major taxonomic groups. Specifically, we focused on the proportion of the genome composed of genes, the proportion of coding sequences within genes, and the overall proportion of coding sequences within the genome. By assessing whether these genomic variables also distinguish taxonomic groups, we can evaluate to what extent variation in alternative splicing values may be influenced by genomic composition. Consistent with this, we found significant differences across most taxonomic groups in both mean and median values of the genomic variables (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Table 2</xref> in Supplementary File 1). As reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls3">Table 3</xref> of Supplementary File 1, bacteria and archaea exhibit the highest gene content proportions, with genes accounting for approximately 86% of their genomes. This percentage is followed by fish, arthropods, fungi, and unicellular eukaryotes, all of which show similar percentages of approximately 61%, with no significant differences among them. Birds (53%) and mammals (45%) show moderate gene content, whereas plants have the lowest proportion among all groups, at around 25%. On the other side, the coding-to-gene proportion increases progressively across taxa as follows: mammals (3%), birds (5%), fish (9%), arthropods (11%), plants (27%), fungi and unicellular eukaryotes (88%), and finally, bacteria and archaea, each with approximately 99%.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Evolutionary Patterns of Alternative Splicing</title>
<p>Understanding genomic expansion patterns and its relationship with alternative splicing across taxa is key to determining whether genome evolution follows universal constraints or taxon-specific trajectories. To systematically address this question, we conducted two complementary analyses. On one side, we performed a Phylogenetic Generalized Least Squares (PGLS) to identify possible relationships among genomic percentages and alternative splicing while accounting for phylogenetic dependence (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls4">Table 4</xref> of Supplementary File 1). On the other side, we analyzed the relative variability of each genomic variable across taxonomic groups using the coefficient of variation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls5">Tables 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls6">6</xref> of Supplementary File 1). First, we computed the relative variability of each genomic feature <italic>x</italic>, (<italic>CV</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub>), providing a means to quantify the extent of variation within each taxonomic group.</p>
<p>Second, we computed variability ratios between pairs of genomic features, (<italic>CV<sub>x</sub></italic>/<italic>CV<sub>y</sub></italic>), allowing us to compare the variability of one genomic trait to another within and across taxa. A detailed explanation of both methods can be found in the Methods section.</p>
<p>PGLS analyses revealed no significant correlation between alternative splicing and genome size across any taxonomic group for both ASR and ASR<sup>∗</sup> values. However, in mammals and birds, alternative splicing showed a strong association with both gene and coding content. This association further extends to genomic proportions, particularly the ratio of coding to gene content. These correlations remain consistent for both ASR and ASR<sup>∗</sup>, except in the case of coding content, which does not correlate with ASR<sup>∗</sup> in any taxonomic group. These findings indicate that, for mammals and birds, genomes with larger amounts of gene content and coding sequences exhibit higher levels of alternative splicing. When analyzing relative proportions rather than absolute content, we found that alternative splicing (ASR and ASR<sup>∗</sup>) is strongly associated with two key genomic ratios: the genomic fraction occupied by genes and the proportion of coding sequence within genes. In the latter case, we observe a strong negative correlation, supporting the hypothesis that genes with a higher intronic fraction are more likely to give rise to multiple isoforms through alternative splicing.</p>
<p>Notably, in contrast to mammals and birds, neither gene content nor coding content shows an association with alternative splicing (ASR or ASR<sup>∗</sup>) across the other taxonomic groups examined. The only exception is observed in plants, where gene content shows a positive association with ASR<sup>∗</sup>, albeit considerably weaker than the correlation observed in mammals and birds. When considering genomic proportions, however, the analysis reveals correlations in some lineages, although differences are observed between ASR and ASR<sup>∗</sup>. Nonetheless, these associations are generally weaker than those observed in mammals and birds, suggesting that the association between genomic architecture and alternative splicing is stronger in these two groups. In fish, the proportion of genes within the genome is positively associated with both ASR and ASR<sup>∗</sup>. In addition, gene proportion is positively associated with ASR in arthropods and with ASR<sup>∗</sup> in plants. The coding-togene ratio appears as a relevant predictor of alternative splicing ratio, correlating with both ASR and ASR<sup>∗</sup> in plants and fungi. Furthermore, its correlation with ASR<sup>∗</sup> is also significant in arthropods and archaea. Another genomic proportion indicative of the genome structure is the coding-to-genome ratio. While ASR shows no significant correlation with this ratio in any taxonomic group, ASR<sup>∗</sup> exhibits a positive correlation in both arthropods and plants. Overall, these findings indicate that the genomic architecture of coding and gene content, and not only their abundance, may play a central role in shaping splicing complexity across most multicellular lineages, particularly in mammals and birds. In these groups, alternative splicing is strongly associated with intron-rich genes, and the results may reflect a shared, lineage-specific trajectory in the evolution of transcriptomic complexity.</p>
<p>Beyond lineage-specific associations—which may contribute to broader patterns—an overarching trend is observed when examining variability across taxa. We first quantified the relative variability of alternative splicing using the coefficient of variation, which expresses dispersion normalized by the mean, making it independent of scale. Unicellular organisms exhibit negligible variability in alternative splicing, as expected given their minimal or absent splicing activity. Within these groups, only fungi show a slight degree of variation, though still close to zero. In contrast, multicellular taxa display considerable variability in alternative splicing values, with clear differences among groups. Among them, plants consistently exhibit the lowest alternative splicing variability, both in ASR and normalized ASR<sup>∗</sup> measures. Arthropods, fish, and birds show higher variability than plants in ASR; however, after normalization in ASR<sup>∗</sup>, their variation is only slightly higher than plants. Finally, mammals exhibit the highest levels of variability in both ASR and ASR<sup>∗</sup>, indicating a high degree of heterogeneity in splicing activity. Also, as a measure of relative variability, we used the ratio of coefficients of variation to compare how much alternative splicing values vary in relation to genomic features. Specifically, the variability ratio between ASR and the percentage of coding within genes, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="571677v2_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> follows a progressive trend from unicellular organisms to animals, with mammals and birds exhibiting the highest ratios. These relations are visually reflected in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> of Supplementary File 2. A variability ratio above 1 indicates that alternative splicing is more variable across species within a taxonomic group than the proportion of coding. Notably, only birds and mammals display values exceeding 1 for both ASR and its normalized value ASR<sup>∗</sup>, highlighting a greater degree of interspecific heterogeneity in splicing relative to the proportion of coding composing genes. As a consequence, these lineage-specific patterns of variability in splicing activity, and their strong association with gene architecture, may reflect specific regulatory strategies in mammals and birds. At the opposite end of the spectrum, unicellular organisms exhibit uniformly low variability ratios, indicating that the percentage of coding varies more across species than alternative splicing levels. This pattern is consistent with the near absence of alternative splicing in these groups, which show little to no variation. Among them, unicellular eukaryotes display the lowest variability ratio, approaching zero, reflecting an almost complete lack of variability in splicing relative to coding content. Between these two opposite trends, fish, plants, and arthropods exhibit intermediate variability ratios, all around 0.5 for both ASR and ASR<sup>∗</sup> values. Although slight differences exist, the decreasing trend from fish to plants and arthropods remains consistent, indicating that these groups display a balanced degree of variation in alternative splicing compared to coding content. This result suggests a continuum between two distinct strategies: one characterized by coding-rich genomes with minimal alternative splicing, as observed in prokaryotes, and another in which small changes in intron-rich gene architectures are coupled with high variations in alternative splicing levels—as seen in mammals and birds.</p>

<p>A phase-like transition in alternative splicing activity is observed at approximately 20 Mb of coding DNA, a value that appears to be a threshold separating unicellular and multicellular organisms. As shown in <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> of Supplementary File 2, species below this threshold exhibit negligible alternative splicing values. Beyond this threshold, which is exceeded in all multicellular taxa, alternative splicing levels increase. Still, alternative splicing values vary substantially across species, indicating that while a shift toward more complex post-transcriptional regulatory strategies is common among multicellular organisms, the degree of splicing activity is modulated by different factors, including fine-scale differences in gene architecture.</p>
<p>Finally, as previously observed, a significant relationship exists between alternative splicing and the proportion of gene content in most multicellular groups, suggesting that intergenic regions may play a relevant role in shaping splicing dynamics. Otherwise, it may reflect an indirect association with the regulatory architecture of alternative splicing. These patterns are visually represented in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> of Supplemetary File 1. The results further indicate that both ASR and ASR<sup>∗</sup> reach their highest values in genomes with approximately 50% intergenic content, supporting the hypothesis that this genomic configuration may favor optimal conditions for alternative splicing. Notably, while mammals and birds exhibit a positive association between ASR<sup>∗</sup> and the proportion of gene content, fish and plants display an inverse pattern, with regression slopes shifting from positive to negative. In mammals, where genes represent less than 50% of the genome, ASR<sup>∗</sup> increases with the percentage of genic content, peaking at 50%. In contrast, fish—whose genomes often exceed this threshold—further gene expansion is no longer positively associated with splicing activity, potentially indicating an evolutionary constraint on genome organization. After examining the correlation between genic proportion and ASR<sup>∗</sup>, we next explored the relationship between the number of genes and ASR. This analysis revealed strong positive correlations in mammals, birds, fish, and arthropods. Altogether, these results suggest the existence of an optimal intergenic composition that enhances alternative splicing.</p>

<title>A Whole-Genome Approach for Quantifying Alternative Splicing</title>
<p>In this study, we propose a whole-genome measure to quantify alternative splicing, which can be computed using genome annotation files such as those provided by the NCBI Genome Annotation Pipeline. This measure is robust, as we exclusively consider high-quality genomic data from assemblies at the chromosome and whole-genome levels. Since genomes with poor assembly quality are not considered, potential biases in the annotation of alternative isoforms due to low-quality data are minimized. Furthermore, the NCBI pipeline applies the same computational model to annotate both animal and plant genomes, so we also minimize potential biases arising from differences in annotation methodologies between these groups. Our evaluation of methodology-associated biases introduced by the NCBI annotation pipeline reveals that the only significant bias is related to the level of experimental support, with better-supported annotations showing higher alternative splicing estimates. Specifically, the number of CDSs introduced in the pipeline is positively correlated with higher alternative splicing values. As a consequence, this factor represents a potential source of bias. To address this, we apply a normalization to ASR values, effectively correcting for discrepancies introduced by differences in annotation confidence and RNA-Seq coverage across taxa. Furthermore, taxonomic comparisons and lineage-specific patterns in alternative splicing yielded similar results for both ASR and the normalized metric ASR<sup>∗</sup>, reinforcing the validity of ASR as a robust metric for large-scale comparative analyses.</p>
<p>While alternative splicing represents a prominent mechanism of transcriptomic diversification, it should be considered that it constitutes only one component of the broader landscape of gene regulation. Structural and behavioral complexity in organisms arises from a combination of regulatory processes—including transcriptional control, chromatin remodeling, epigenetic modifications, and RNA editing—whose combined interactions ultimately shape phenotypic diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Levine and Tjian, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Shlyueva et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Feschotte, 2008</xref>). In this study, we focus specifically on alternative splicing as a measurable and comparable proxy for regulatory complexity at the genome level. However, we recognize that a more comprehensive analysis of organismal complexity would require the integration of additional layers of regulation and functional data across lineages.</p>

<title>Evolutionary Strategies of Transcriptomic Diversification</title>
<p>While previous studies have highlighted the role of splice site strength, exon length, and regulatory element density in shaping splicing outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bortfeldt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Keren et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Itoh et al., 2004</xref>), our results provide a genomic-level perspective that contextualizes alternative splicing within large-scale patterns. Specifically, we find that alternative splicing activity is not randomly distributed among taxa but follows lineage-specific associations with genome composition, particularly with respect to the proportion of coding and non-coding DNA. In mammals and birds—groups that exhibit the highest alternative splicing values—we observe a strong negative correlation between alternative splicing and the proportion of coding DNA within genes. This indicates that intron-rich gene architectures may promote isoform diversity, consistent with models in which exon skipping predominates and weak splice sites are compensated by dense regulatory motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kalsotra and Cooper, 2011</xref>). Interestingly, these groups exhibit a highly conserved gene structure, with coding regions representing less than 5% of gene length, while alternative splicing levels display considerable variability across species. Thus, within a narrow coding-to-gene compositional range, alternative splicing may be finely regulated, with minor variations in gene structure associated with substantial changes in isoform diversity. This pattern suggests that transcriptomic modularity could be achieved through subtle adjustments in gene architecture, potentially reflecting an evolutionary strategy favoring regulatory refinement over gene duplication. However, future research should investigate the mechanistic basis of this relationship and test whether such fine-tuned structural control indeed underlies shifts in splicing dynamics. In line with models describing alternative splicing as a modular system of transcript generation, this genomic strategy allows functional diversification without the need for coding expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Modrek and Lee, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Nilsen and Graveley, 2010</xref>). These findings also align with recent theoretical work proposing that alternative splicing and regulatory complexity increase as coding accumulation slows down, acting as an evolutionary response to structural constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Koonin, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results reveal a threshold at approximately 20 Mb of coding DNA, separating unicellular from multicellular organisms. Below this coding size, species display a lack of alternative splicing, whereas above it, splicing activity becomes increasingly significant. This observation supports the hypothesis that coding expansion reaches a critical point, beyond which additional genomic innovation depends less on gene duplication and more on regulatory diversification, particularly through alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lynch, 2007</xref>). Importantly, while coding content increases in multicellular organisms, the relative proportion of coding sequences within genes decreases sharply, especially in mammals and birds. As illustrated in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref>, once the proportion of coding drops below 50%, alternative splicing emerges significantly, reaching its highest levels in coding-poor organisms. This result is in agreement with previous studies showing that a decrease in coding density is strongly associated with increased splicing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lynch and Conery, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Holland et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hinman and Cary, 2017</xref>). As coding expansion slows down, the reliance on alternative splicing intensifies, indicating a shift toward post-transcriptional plasticity as a dominant evolutionary strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ast, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Rogozin et al., 2012</xref>). This shift may be key for shapping broader evolutionary patterns in the relationship between genome composition and transcriptomic complexity across lineages. These findings also support the hypothesis that the slowdown in coding sequence accumulation is intrinsically linked to the emergence of post-transcriptional strategies, such as alternative splicing.</p>

</fig>
<p>There is a large-scale progressive trend in the variability relationship between coding-to-gene composition and alternative splicing across evolutionary lineages. At one end of the spectrum, prokaryotes exhibit highly compact genomes, with minimal non-coding DNA and negligible alternative splicing activity. In the absence of alternative splicing, these organisms rely on gene duplication as the primary mechanism for functional innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lynch, 2007</xref>). At the opposite end, mammals and birds show the highest levels of alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barbosa-Morais et al., 2012</xref>), despite having highly constrained genomic architectures. Between these extremes, plants, arthropods, and fish occupy intermediate positions, with high variability in both coding percentage and splicing levels. This finding supports the existence of two contrasting strategies: one that favors expansion through gene duplication and coding sequence accumulation (as in prokaryotes and some unicellular eukaryotes), and another that maximizes regulatory reuse and complexity through alternative splicing in genomically constrained organisms with high functional plasticity, such as mammals and birds. As a consequence, differences in variability relationships across taxa may be attributed to fundamental shifts in genome expansion strategies. These results support the view that alternative splicing is not merely a means of increasing functional complexity, but also an evolutionary adaptation to structural constraints within the genome.</p>
<p>Our findings also reveal that alternative splicing activity peaks in genomes with approximately 50% of intergenic content, supporting the hypothesis that there exists an optimal genic-to-intergenic balance that maximizes regulatory efficiency. While intergenic regions may contribute to alternative splicing activity, their excessive expansion, as observed in plants, does not result in increased alternative splicing levels. Thus, a threshold of approximately 50% of intergenic content may represent a point beyond which additional non-coding DNA becomes functionally redundant. Thus, rather than promoting continued increases in isoform diversity, expansive intergenic growth may impose architectural limitations that reduce the utility of additional regulatory space. This pattern is consistent with previous work indicating that transcriptomic complexity does not scale linearly with genome size(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hahn and Wray, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">McShea, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Claverie, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Choi et al., 2020</xref>) and may instead be constrained by saturation effects in regulatory architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Muro et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Luiselli et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Shapiro, 2017</xref>). Future research should explore the mechanisms underlying this apparent intergenic threshold, testing whether regulatory saturation or spatial constraints limit the contribution of additional non-coding regions to alternative splicing complexity.</p>
<p>Plants exhibit a distinct evolutionary strategy compared to animals, particularly in the way noncoding regions have expanded. In contrast to prokaryotes, unicellular eukaryotes, and most animals, where genes constitute over 40% of the genome, plant genomes show a significantly lower gene content, ranging from as little as 7% to a maximum of 40%. This reduction is accompanied by a pronounced expansion of intergenic regions, which varies widely across plant species. Despite this extensive non-coding accumulation, plants display only moderate levels of alternative splicing, suggesting that increased intergenic space does not necessarily enhance transcriptomic complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chamala et al., 2015</xref>). Intron retention is the predominant mechanism of alternative splicing in plants, whereas exon skipping dominates in animals. Splice sites in plants are also generally weaker and lack the compensatory enrichment of regulatory sequences, such as exonic splicing enhancers, commonly observed in metazoans. These differences imply that alternative splicing in plants may be governed by distinct regulatory constraints, likely shaped by evolutionary processes such as polyploidy, genome duplication, and differential selection on non-coding expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Reddy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Filichkin et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s3c">
<title>Evidence for the Adaptive Role of Alternative Splicing</title>
<p>One of the major debates regarding alternative splicing is whether it arises as an adaptive trait or as a byproduct of reduced selection efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lynch, 2007</xref>). Species with smaller effective population size experience weaker purifying selection, allowing the accumulation of slightly deleterious mutations, including those affecting alternative splicing. This “non-adaptive model” suggests that alternative splicing increases in complex organisms not due to selective advantages but as a consequence of weaker selection pressure in species with small population sizes. However, genomic analyses contradict this view, revealing that alternative splicing is not randomly accumulated but is rather highly conserved in some genes, making it functionally relevant across taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Rogalska et al., 2024</xref>). Advances in long-read RNA sequencing technologies have revealed that while many alternative splicing events may be non-functional or represent splicing errors, a significant subset leads to functionally relevant protein isoforms that are preferentially expressed in specific tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wright et al., 2022</xref>). Several studies have revealed the conservation of alternative splicing patterns across different animal genomes, such as human, mouse, rat, chicken, fish, and insect genomes, suggesting that splicing regulation plays a fundamental role in evolutionary adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Holste et al., 2006</xref>). These events are particularly enriched in genes associated with essential biological processes and functionally critical organs, such as the brain, heart, muscles, and testes. This highlights their role in preserving key physiological functions while also contributing to evolutionary adaptation. On the other hand, beyond tissue specialization, alternative splicing is increasingly recognized as a key factor in rapid environmental adaptation, allowing organisms to fine-tune gene expression and modulate protein isoform production in response to external stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Koonin, 2006</xref>). Stress conditions, such as temperature fluctuations and hypoxia, have been observed to regulate alternative splicing patterns, helping organisms adjust their physiological responses dynamically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Shapiro, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aravind et al., 2009</xref>). Another example is found in genes associated with the immune system, where alternative splicing modulates immune responses to pathogens, further emphasizing its role in adaptive flexibility. Beyond environmental adaptation, it also plays a major role in biological differentiation at different levels of the biological organization, including transcript diversification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Nilsen and Graveley, 2010</xref>), cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fiszbein and Kornblihtt, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fu et al., 2009</xref>) and speciation events, such as morphs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Steward et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Grantham and Brisson, 2018</xref>), castes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lyko et al., 2011</xref>) or even subspecies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Harr and Turner, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The findings presented in this study support the view that alternative splicing is not simply a byproduct of relaxed purifying selection, but instead reflects a finely regulated mechanism linked to genome architecture. While the non-adaptive model states that splicing diversity increases stochastically due to weaker selection in species with small effective population sizes, our results show that alternative splicing levels are strongly associated with genomic architecture, particularly with the proportion of coding sequences within genes. Mammals and birds exhibit highly conserved, intron-rich gene structures, in which the proportion of coding sequences within genes remains low and stable across species. Despite this structural conservation, these groups display substantial interspecific variability in alternative splicing levels, but this variability is strongly and negatively correlated with the proportion of coding DNA within genes, indicating that even small differences in coding compression are associated with pronounced differences in splicing activity. These results suggest that alternative splicing is highly sensitive to structural variation, rather than accumulating stochastically. It may act as a modular regulatory system that enables transcriptomic diversification without requiring further expansion of coding sequences. Together with prior evidence of tissue-specific conservation and adaptive responses mediated by alternative splicing, our results reinforce its role as a key evolutionary mechanism that integrates structural features of the genome with regulatory plasticity. However, more comprehensive research is needed to determine whether these patterns reflect causal relationships. Future studies should integrate high-quality annotations, functional assays, and comparative analyses to fully disentangle the relative contributions of structural constraints and regulatory complexity.</p>

<title>Alternative Splicing Ratio: A Genome-Scale Measure</title>
<p>The genome is defined as the sequential arrangement of nucleotides, where the ith position of a nucleotide is denoted as <italic>G</italic>(<italic>i</italic>).

By way of example, a value of <italic>f</italic> (<italic>i</italic>, <italic>j</italic>) = 3 indicates that the nucleotides at positions <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> co-occur in three distinct isoforms. Accordingly, <italic>f</italic> (<italic>i</italic>, <italic>i</italic>) corresponds to the number of different CDSs where nucleotide <italic>G</italic>(<italic>i</italic>) is inserted. The <italic>transcription matrix M</italic>, with <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> = <italic>f</italic> (<italic>i</italic>, <italic>j</italic>), is a symmetric matrix that encodes the co-occurence patterns of nucleotides within multiple mRNAs, providing a genotype-phenotype mapping framework for transcriptomic and proteomic diversity.

<title>NCBI RefSeq Dataset</title>
<p>Genomic features are computed from high-quality, whole-genome assemblies available in the Ref-Seq database provided by the NCBI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Database, 2024</xref>). These assemblies are annotated by the NCBI genome annotation pipeline, which integrates diverse experimental evidence, including RNA-Seq data, ESTs, and protein alignments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kitts et al., 2015</xref>). The annotation files are in GFF3 format, and the data is provided in tab-delimited tables, where each row represents an entity (e.g., gene, mRNA or CDS) and columns contain attributes like unique identifiers, genomic coordinates and functional annotations. The annotations also include additional attributes such as start and stop codons, and untranslated regions (UTRs). Genome size, gene content, and coding region coverage are estimated by looking at the start and end coordinates of each genomic element. Gene content is calculated as the total number of nucleotides falling within annotated gene regions. In contrast, the coding region coverage is determined by summing all nucleotides that belong to at least one CDS.</p>
<p>Each file is organized hierarchically in a parent-child structure that represents the relationship between genes, their transcripts (mRNA), and coding sequences (CDS). At the top level, each gene is uniquely identified and associated with multiple mRNA transcripts, which represent the alternative splicing variants of that gene. These mRNA transcripts, in turn, are linked to one or more CDS, which correspond to the portions of the mRNA that are translated into proteins. The set of CDSs associated with a given mRNA is retained in the spliced mRNA, defining a distinct protein isoform. Hierarchical relationships are preserved through shared identifiers across levels: a gene ID links to its transcripts, and a transcript ID links to its associated CDS entries. This structured format allows for efficient navigation and analysis of the dataset, supporting downstream applications like isoform quantification. Note that we have only considered CDSs with a well-defined parent-child relationship. Pseudogenes and duplicated genes have been excluded for this study.</p>
<p>In this study we propose a novel genome-level measure of alternative splicing. In annotation files, each isoform is identified by looking at the set of CDSs associated with a given mRNA transcript. Since each gene can produce multiple protein isoforms, the corresponding mRNA transcripts often contain regions with overlapping CDSs. Thus, the metric is calculated as the ratio of the total cumulative length of all annotated CDSs to their length when projected onto the genome. This approach provides novel quantitative insights into estimating alternative splicing activity at the species level.</p>
<p>First, the assembly summary of RefSeq was downloaded, which includes detailed information about the genome annotations available in the database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Reports, 2024</xref>). Second, the dataset was subsequently filtered based on the following criteria: (i) only genomes annotated by the NCBI RefSeq annotation pipeline were selected, ensuring consistent and reliable annotations; (ii) assemblies were restricted to those with an assembly level of ‘chromosome’ or ‘complete genome,’ which guarantees high-quality data; and (iii) genomes were further filtered to include only those belonging to specific taxonomic groups of interest (see Section Taxonomy assignment).

<title>Methodology-associated biases in the data</title>
<p>In this study, we used assembled genomes annotated by the NCBI genome annotation pipelines. The NCBI Genome Annotation Pipeline is designed for the annotation of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes. On one side, the NCBI Eukaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (EGAP) is an evidence-based pipeline for the high-quality annotation of genes, transcripts, and proteins of eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Pruitt et al., 2012</xref>). Each RefSeq assembly generated from the EGAP includes a very detailed annotation report that provides information about the supporting sequencing data and variations in methodology. All eukaryotic genomes annotated to date from the EGAP can be found in the following repository: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/annotation_euk/all/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/annotation_euk/all/</ext-link>. On the other side, the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP) is specifically designed to annotate bacterial and archaeal genomes, focusing on the unique genomic features of these domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tatusova et al., 2016</xref>). Annotations for prokaryotes rely on curated data from the NCBI RefSeq database, including known gene sequences and protein information. It processes assembled genomes, identifying coding sequences (CDSs), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), small RNAs, and other genetic elements. Unlike the eukaryotic pipeline (EGAP), which incorporates complex RNA-Seq alignments and isoform modeling, PGAP emphasizes the detection of essential genes, operons, and conserved elements, as splicing is rare in prokaryotes. The prokaryotic pipeline is optimized for high-throughput processing, ensuring consistent and accurate annotation of thousands of bacterial and archaeal genomes.</p>
<p>While archaeal and bacterial genomes are annotated through the Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP), annotation files for plants and animals are derived through the Eukaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (EGAP). However, not all RefSeq genomes have been processed through the EGAP pipeline. RefSeq annotations of fungi and unicellular eukaryotes use the annotations as submitted to the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC), so there is variation in methodology. These organism groups are generally not annotated using RNASeq data and have few, if any, alternative isoforms annotated. Nevertheless, this lack of annotation does not imply that these organisms have no alternative splicing. Instead, it reflects limitations in the data and annotation methodologies.</p>
<p>There can be various sources of noise in the annotation of alternative isoforms. Regarding the annotation methodology, we can expect—based on previous evidence—that alternative splicing is a significant mechanism in multicellular organisms. Since the same annotation pipeline is applied to both animals and plants, it is reasonable to assume that genome annotation is not a source of noise for these eukaryotic groups and does not introduce significant biases in the number of alternative isoforms. Moreover, due to the cross-referenced and high-quality data provided by the RefSeq database, we ensure that the annotated features are reliable and comparable across diverse taxa within multicellular eukaryotic groups.</p>
<p>Methodology-associated biases in NCBI annotation files primarily stem from the reliance on the quality and availability of input data. Additionally, the use of reference-based annotation methods can introduce biases by propagating errors or omissions from reference genomes. Variability in sequencing technologies may also impact the accuracy of annotations, potentially leading to biased estimates of alternative splicing events. On the other hand, poor assembly quality can negatively impact the annotation of alternative splicing. However, in this study, we focus exclusively on genomes assembled at the chromosome or complete genome level, effectively reducing biases caused by assembly quality. Biases in annotation genomes also include the overrepresentation of model organisms, which leads to more accurate annotations for well-studied species. For less-studied species, genome annotations often rely on automated predictions and may lack experimental validation. RNA-Seq depth influences the annotation of alternative splicing events and lncRNAs. Consequently, the amount of annotated alternative isoforms depends on the organism, but that’s primarily for humans, mice, and rats, for which we can expect some biases. We have thousands of genome annotations from a variety of species that are not model organisms, so similar biases may exist across many organisms. The amount and diversity of RNA-Seq data used for annotations are highly variable, which can also lead to significant biases. While many organisms are annotated using substantial amounts of RNA-Seq data (billions of reads), this varies considerably across organisms, and tissue diversity is often limited by data availability. Such limitations can affect downstream analyses, reducing the generalizability and reliability of conclusions drawn from these data.</p>
<p>For this study, we have implemented two filtering criteria to reduce methodological biases in the dataset: first, all multicellular organisms were annotated using the EGAP pipeline, which integrates evidence-based computational models; second, only genomes assembled at the chromosome level were included. Despite these measures, potential biases remain, particularly those related to RNA-Seq depth and tissue diversity. To account for potential biases introduced by the annotation process in eukaryotic genomes, we evaluated how the experimental evidence of CDSs affects estimates of alternative splicing. We found that the proportion of coding sequences that are fully supported by experimental evidence is strongly associated with ASR values, whereas annotations mainly based on computational models systematically underestimate splicing complexity. A multivariate regression analysis identified three key predictors of ASR variation: fully supported CDSs, known CDSs, and model-derived CDSs, which are related to each other. Among them, the proportion of fully supported CDSs is the dominant factor. Based on this, we implemented a normalization procedure that adjusts ASR values using a polynomial regression model, effectively removing annotation-related biases. This normalization, which we denote as ASR<sup>∗</sup>, enables more accurate cross-species comparisons while preserving relative differences in splicing levels. However, normalized values should be interpreted as standardized estimates rather than absolute measures, as the correction is empirical and designed to improve comparability across diverse taxonomic groups.</p>

<title>Monte Carlo permutation tests</title>
<p>Pairwise statistical analysis using Monte Carlo permutation tests was performed to assess differences in genomic variables (e.g., genome size, gene content, coding size, and alternative splicing ratio) across taxonomic groups. Given that some variables present a high number of outliers and, in certain cases, deviate from normality and homoscedasticity–both critical assumptions for many parametric analyses–this approach was employed as a complementary method to Welch’s ANOVA, which accounts for heteroscedasticity.</p>
<p>This non-parametric approach evaluates statistical significance by generating a null distribution through random resampling. Specifically, we tested differences using two statistical measures: the mean and the median. First, we computed the observed difference between groups and then compared it to a null distribution generated from 10,000 random permutations, in which group labels were shuffed to simulate the null hypothesis of no difference between groups. The empirical p-value was calculated as the proportion of permuted test statistics greater than or equal to the observed difference. To account for multiple comparisons, we applied the Bonferroni correction, ensuring a stringent control of Type I error across all pairwise tests. All analyses in this study confirm that 10,000 permutations provide a robust estimation of the exact test, as increasing the number of permutations to 20,000 yielded statistically equivalent results.</p>

<title>Comparative Genomic Analysis</title>
<p>We used the TimeTree platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://timetree.org">timetree.org</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kumar et al. (2022)</xref>) to generate a phylogenetic tree, which provides evolutionary relationships based on common ancestry. The tree was saved in Newick format (.nwk). Since not all species in our dataset (for which we have annotation files) are documented on this platform, the resulting phylogenetic tree includes a subset of species. Specifically, our tree consists of 170 archaea, 213 bacteria, 35 unicellular eukaryotes, 79 fungi, 110 plants, 116 arthropods, 163 fish, 70 birds, and 122 mammals.</p>
<p>We conducted a Phylogenetic Generalized Least Squares (PGLS) regression to assess the relationships between genomic variables and alternative splicing ratio while accounting for phylogenetic non-independence among species. This method incorporates evolutionary relationships into the statistical model by adjusting for shared ancestry, ensuring that trait correlations are not confounded by phylogenetic structure. To quantify these relationships, we showed the slope (<italic>β</italic>), which indicates the direction of the relationship. Positive values indicate an increase in the dependent variable as the independent variable increases, and negative values indicate the opposite. We also showed the p-value, which assesses the statistical significance of this relationship, with lower values (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) indicating that the observed pattern is unlikely to be due to chance. The adjusted <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="571677v2_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, measured the proportion of variance explained by the model while correcting for the number of predictors. Finally, <italic>λ</italic> quantified the phylogenetic signal, with values close to 1 indicating strong phylogenetic dependence and values near 0 reflecting evolutionary independence. These metrics collectively allow us to determine genomic relationships and evaluate whether they are driven by taxon-specific patterns.</p>
<p>We also computed the coefficient of variation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="571677v2_inline3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> for each variable, a scale-independent measure of dispersion. The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="571677v2_inline4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation <italic>s</italic> to the sample mean <italic>x̄</italic>, expressed as:
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="571677v2_eqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
This metric quantifies the relative variability of a trait, making it particularly useful for comparing datasets with different units or magnitudes. A higher <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="571677v2_inline5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> indicates greater dispersion relative to the mean, suggesting higher heterogeneity, whereas a lower value implies more constrained variability. By analyzing the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="571677v2_inline6.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> of genomic variables and alternative splicing, we assess the extent of evolutionary variation within and across taxonomic groups. This approach allows us to detect regions of genomic composition that display higher heterogeneity, providing insights into which aspects of genome evolution are more flexible and are subject to stronger evolutionary constraints. Moreover, by comparing these patterns across taxonomic groups, we can assess whether the distribution of genomic heterogeneity follows similar trends across lineages or if taxon-specific factors shape distinct variability regimes. We introduce a metric to quantify these variability relationships, defined as the ratio of the coefficient of variation between different variables, calculated as:
<disp-formula id="eqn4">
<graphic xlink:href="571677v2_eqn4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="571677v2_inline7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is the coefficient of variation of <italic>x</italic>. These ratios provide a scale-independent measure of how the variability of one genomic trait compares to another within and across taxonomic groups.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this contribution, the authors investigate the degree of alternative splicing across the evolutionary tree, and identify a trend of increasing alternative splicing as you move from the base of the tree (here, only prokaryotes are considered) towards the tips of the tree. In particular, the authors investigate how the degree of alternative splicing (roughly speaking, the number of different proteins made from a single ORF (open reading frame) via alternative splicing) relates to three genomic variables: the genome size, the gene content (meaning the fraction of the genome composed of ORFs), and finally, the coding percentage of ORFs, meaning the ratio between exons and total DNA in the ORF.</p>
<p>The revised manuscript addresses the problems identified in the first round of reviews and now serves as a guide to understand how alternative splicing has evolved within different phyla, as opposed to making unsubstantiated claims about overall trends.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In &quot;Alternative Splicing Across the Tree of Life: A Comparative Study,&quot; the authors use rich annotation features from nearly 1,500 high-quality NCBI genome assemblies to develop a novel genome-scale metric, the Alternative Splicing Ratio, that quantifies the extent to which coding sequences generate multiple mRNA transcripts via alternative splicing (AS). This standardized metric enables cross-species comparisons and reveals clear phylogenetic patterns: minimal AS in prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes, moderate AS in plants, and high AS in mammals and birds. The study finds a strong negative correlation between AS and coding content, with genomes containing approximately 50% intergenic DNA exhibiting the highest AS activity. By integrating diverse lines of prior evidence, the study offers a cohesive evolutionary framework for understanding how alternative splicing varies and evolves across the tree of life.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>By studying alternative splicing patterns across the tree of life, the authors systematically address an important yet historically understudied driver of functional diversity, complexity, and evolutionary innovation. This manuscript makes a valuable contribution by leveraging standardized, publicly available genome annotations to perform a global survey of transcriptional diversity, revealing lineage-specific patterns and evolutionary correlates. The authors have done an admirable job in this revised version, thoroughly addressing prior reviewer comments. The updated manuscript includes more rigorous statistical analyses, careful consideration of potential methodological biases, expanded discussion of regulatory mechanisms, and acknowledgment of non-adaptive alternatives. Overall, the work presents an intriguing view of how alternative splicing may serve as a flexible evolutionary strategy, particularly in lineages with limited capacity for coding expansion (e.g., via gene duplication). Notably, the identification of genome size and genic coding fraction thresholds (~20 Mb and ~50%, respectively) as tipping points for increased splicing activity adds conceptual depth and potential generalizability.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the manuscript offers a broad comparative view of alternative splicing, its central message becomes diffuse in the revised version. The focus of the study is unclear, and the manuscript comes across as largely descriptive without a well-articulated hypothesis or explanatory evolutionary model. Although the discussion gestures toward adaptive and non-adaptive mechanisms, these interpretations are not developed early or prominently enough to anchor the reader. The negative correlation between alternative splicing and coding content is compelling, but the biological significance of this pattern remains ambiguous: it is unclear whether it reflects functional constraint, genome organization, or annotation bias. This uncertainty weakens the manuscript's broader evolutionary inferences.</p>
<p>Sections of the Introduction, particularly lines 72-90, lack cohesion and logical flow, shifting abruptly between topics without a clear structure. A more effective approach may involve separating discussions of coding and non-coding sequence evolution to clarify their distinct contributions to splicing complexity. Furthermore, some interpretive claims lack nuance. For example, the assertion that splicing in plants &quot;evolved independently&quot; seems overstated given the available evidence, and the citation regarding slower evolution of highly expressed genes overlooks counterexamples from the immunity and reproductive gene literature.</p>
<p>Presentation of the results is occasionally vague. For instance, stating &quot;we conducted comparisons of mean values&quot; (line 146) without specifying the metric undercuts interpretability. The authors should clarify whether these comparisons refer to the Alternative Splicing Ratio or another measure. Additionally, the lack of correlation between splicing and coding region fraction in prokaryotes may reflect a statistical power issue, particularly given their limited number of annotated isoforms, rather than a biological absence of pattern.</p>
<p>Finally, the assessment of annotation-related bias warrants greater methodological clarity. The authors note that annotations with stronger experimental support yield higher splicing estimates, yet the normalization strategy for variation in transcriptomic sampling (e.g., tissue breadth vs sequencing depth) is insufficiently described. As these factors can significantly influence splicing estimates, a more rigorous treatment is essential. While the authors rightly acknowledge that splicing represents only one layer of regulatory complexity, the manuscript would benefit from a more integrated consideration of additional dimensions, such as 3D genome architecture, e.g., the potential role of topologically associating domains in constraining splicing variation.</p>

<p>The manuscript reports on a large-scale study correlating genomic architecture with splicing complexity over almost 1,500 species. We still know relatively little about alternative splicing functional consequences and evolution, and thus, the study is relevant and timely. The methodology relies on annotations from NCBI for high-quality genomes and a main metric proposed by the authors and named Alternative Splicing Ratio (ASR). It quantifies the level of redundancy of each coding nucleotide in the annotated isoforms.</p>
<p>According to the authors' response to the first reviewers' comments, the present version of the manuscript seems to be a profoundly revised version compared to the original submission. I did not have access to the reviewers' comments.</p>
<p>Although the study addresses an important question and the authors have visibly made an important effort to make their claims more statistically robust, I have a number of major concerns regarding the methodology and its presentation.</p>
<p>(1) A large part of the manuscript is speculative and vague. For instance, the Discussion is very long (almost longer than the Results section) and the items discussed are sometimes not in direct connection with the present work. I would suggest merging the last 2 paragraphs, for instance, since the before last paragraph is essentially a review of the literature without direct connection to the present work.</p>
<p>(2) The Methods section lacks clarity and precision. A large part is devoted to explaining the biases in the data without any reference or quantification. The definition of ASR is very confusing. It is first defined in equation 2, with a different name, and then again in the next subsection from a different perspective on lines 512-518. Why build matrices of co-occurrences if these are, in practice, never used? It seems the authors exploit only the trace. A major revision, if I understood correctly, was the correction/normalisation of the ASR metric. This normalisation is not explained. The authors argue that they will write another paper about it, I do not think this is acceptable for the publication of the present manuscript. Furthermore, there is no information about the technical details of the implementation: which packages did the authors use?</p>
<p>(3) Could the authors motivate why they do not directly focus on the MC permutation test? They motivate the use of permutations because the data contains extreme outliers and are non normal in most cases. Hence, it seems the Welch's ANOVA is not adapted. &quot;To further validate our findings, we also conducted</p>
<p>
148 a Monte Carlo permutation test, which supported the conclusions (see Methods).&quot; Where is the comparison shown? I did not see any report of the results for the non-permuted version of the Welch's ANOVA.</p>
<p>(4) What are the assumptions for the Phylogenetic Generalized Least Squares? Which evolution model was chosen and why? What is the impact of changing the model? Could the authors define more precisely (e.g. with equations) what is lambda? Is it estimated or fixed?</p>
<p>(5) I think the authors could improve their account of recent literature on the topic. For instance, the paper <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.93629.3">https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.93629.3</ext-link>, published in the same journal last year, should be discussed. It perfectly fits in the scope of the subsection &quot;Evidence for the adaptive role of alternative splicing&quot;. Methods and findings reported in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-021-02441-9">https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-021-02441-9</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.genome.org/cgi/doi/10.1101/gr.274696.120">https://www.genome.org/cgi/doi/10.1101/gr.274696.120</ext-link> directly concern the assessment of AS evolutionary conservation across long evolutionary times and/or across many species. These aspects are mentioned in the introduction on p.3. but without pointing to such works. Can we really qualify a work published in 2011 as &quot;recent&quot; (line 348-350)?</p>
<p>The generated data and codes are available on Zenodo, which is a good point for reproducibility and knowledge sharing with the community.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

<p>Methodological biases in annotation and sequencing methods</p>
<p>We acknowledge the reviewer’s concern regarding methodological heterogeneity in genome annotations, particularly regarding the use of CDS annotations derived from public databases. In response, we have properly addressed the potential sources of bias in estimating alternative splicing (AS) across such a broad taxonomic range.</p>
<p>Given the methodological challenges encountered in this study, we have undertaken an in-depth analysis of the biases associated with genome annotations and their impact on large-scale estimates of alternative splicing. This effort has resulted in the development of a comprehensive framework for quantifying, modeling, and correcting such biases, which we believe will be of interest to the broader genomics community. We are currently preparing a separate manuscript dedicated to this methodological aspect, which we intend to submit for publication in the near future.</p>
<p>To account for these biases, we performed a statistical evaluation of annotation quality by examining the relationship between ASR values and multiple features of the NCBI annotation pipeline, including both technical and biological variables. Specifically, we analyzed a set of metadata descriptors related to: (i) genome assembly quality (e.g., Contig N50, Scaffold N50, number of gaps, gap length, contig/scaffold count), (ii) the amount and diversity of experimental evidence used in annotation (e.g., number of RNA-Seq reads, number of tissues, number of experimental runs, number of proteins and transcripts, including those derived from Homo sapiens), and (iii) the nature of the annotated coding sequences (e.g., total number of CDSs, percentage of CDSs supported by experimental evidence, proportion of known CDSs, percentage of CDSs derived from ab initio predictions).</p>
<p>This comprehensive analysis revealed that the strongest bias affecting ASR values is associated with the proportion of fully supported CDSs, which showed a strong positive correlation with observed splicing levels. In contrast, the percentage of CDSs relying on ab initio models showed a negative correlation, indicating that computational predictions tend to underestimate splicing complexity. Based on these findings, we implemented a polynomial normalization model using the percentage of fully supported CDSs as the main predictor of annotation bias. The resulting normalized metric, ASR<sup>∗</sup>, corrects for annotation-related variability while preserving biologically meaningful variation.</p>
<p>We further verified the robustness of this correction by comparing the main results of our study using both the raw ASR and the normalized ASR<sup>*</sup> across all analyses. The qualitative and quantitative consistency of results obtained with both metrics demonstrates that our findings are not an artifact of methodological bias and validates the reliability of our approach.</p>
<p>Conceptual and Statistical Framework</p>
<p>Our aim was not to investigate specific regulatory mechanisms of alternative splicing, but rather to explore large-scale statistical patterns across the tree of life using a newly defined metric—the Alternative Splicing Ratio (ASR)—that enables genome-wide comparisons of splicing complexity across species. To clarify the conceptual framework, we have revised the manuscript to explicitly state our assumptions, objectives, and the scope of our conclusions. The ASR metric is now briefly introduced in the Results section, with a more detailed mathematical formulation included in the Methods section.</p>
<p>From a methodological standpoint, we have expanded the manuscript to better support the comparative framework through additional statistical analyses. In particular, we now include:</p>
<p>• Monte Carlo permutation tests to assess pairwise differences in splicing and genomic variables across taxonomic groups, which are robust to non-normality and heteroscedasticity in the data.</p>
<p>• Welch’s ANOVA with Bonferroni correction, which accounts for unequal variances when comparing group means.</p>
<p>• Phylogenetic Generalized Least Squares (PGLS) regression, which explicitly models phylogenetic non-independence between species and allows us to infer lineage-specific associations between genomic composition and alternative splicing.</p>
<p>• Coefficient of variation analysis, used to evaluate the relative variability of splicing and genomic traits across groups in a scale-independent manner.</p>
<p>• Variability ratio metrics, designed to compare the dispersion of splicing values relative to genomic features, thereby quantifying trends in regulatory plasticity versus structural constraints.</p>
<p>All methods are thoroughly described in the revised Methods section, and their application is presented in the Results section.</p>
<p>Functional vs. non-functional nature of AS events</p>
<p>We have included a new discussion paragraph addressing the ongoing debate regarding the functionality of alternative splicing and a possible non-adaptive explanation for the patterns observed. While many previous studies suggest that a considerable fraction of AS events might represent splicing noise or non-functional isoforms, our intention is not to adopt this view uncritically. Instead, we cite recent literature to provide a more nuanced interpretation, recognizing both the potential adaptive value and the uncertainty surrounding the functional relevance of many AS events. Thus, rather than assuming that all observed alternative splicing events are adaptive or biologically meaningful, we now emphasize that many patterns may emerge from other processes, such as those associated to genomic constraints.</p>
<p>Terminology and Result Interpretation</p>
<p>The manuscript has been thoroughly revised to improve both the scientific language and the conceptual framing. We have removed inappropriate terminology such as “higher/lower organisms” and “highly evolved”. Also, we have reinterpreted the results. As part of this process, the manuscript has been substantially rewritten to focus on the most meaningful findings. Ultimately, we have retained only those results that specifically concern broad-scale patterns of alternative splicing across taxa, which are now presented with greater clarity and methodological rigor.</p>

<p>Gene Regulatory Complexity Beyond Splicing Mechanisms</p>
<p>While alternative splicing represents a prominent mechanism of transcriptomic diversification, we agree with the reviewer that it constitutes only one component of the broader landscape of gene regulation. Structural and behavioral complexity in organisms arises from a combination of regulatory processes, and our study focuses specifically on alternative splicing as a measurable proxy within this multifactorial system. To clarify this point, we have added a paragraph in the Discussion section, where we explicitly contextualize alternative splicing within the wider regulatory architecture. In that paragraph, we discuss additional mechanisms that contribute to phenotypic complexity—such as transcriptional control, chromatin remodeling, epigenetic modifications, and RNA editing—citing key literature.</p>
<p>Alternative Splicing Measure and Methodology</p>
<p>While we agree that alternative splicing is not a definitive measure of organismal complexity, we argue that it remains a meaningful proxy for transcriptomic and regulatory diversification, especially when analyzed at large phylogenetic scale. In this version of the manuscript, our goal was not to equate alternative splicing with biological complexity, but rather to quantify its patterns across lineages and evaluate its relationship with genome structure. This point is now explicitly stated in both the Introduction and Discussion.</p>
<p>We also recognize the limitations associated with the use of coding sequence (CDS) annotations from public databases such as NCBI RefSeq. To address this concern, we have conducted a detailed analysis of the potential biases introduced by heterogeneous annotation quality, sequencing depth, and computational prediction, as previously addressed in our response to Reviewer #1.</p>
<p>In response to concerns about unsupported statements, we have completely rewritten the manuscript to ensure that all claims are now explicitly supported by data and grounded in up-to-date scientific literature. We have reformulated speculative statements, removed inappropriate generalizations, and improved the logical flow of the arguments throughout the text. In summary, we have strengthened both the conceptual framework and the methodological foundation of the study, while maintaining a cautious interpretation of the results.</p>
<p>Trends of Alternative Splicing</p>
<p>To address the reviewer’s concern, we have revised the interpretation of trends as used in our analysis. In this study, we define a trend not as a strict directional progression or a linear trajectory across all species, but rather as a broad statistical pattern observable in the relative distribution and variability of alternative splicing across major taxonomic groups. We do not claim that this pattern reflects a universal adaptive pathway. Instead, we interpret it as a signal of differences in regulatory strategies associated to the genome architecture. To avoid misinterpretation, we have rephrased several sentences in the manuscript and explicitly emphasized the variability within groups, and the lack of significant correlations in certain clades.</p>
<p>Inconsistent statistics</p>
<p>The discrepancies pointed out were due to differences between mean and median-based analyses. These have been clarified and consistently reported in the revised manuscript. Error bars, p-values, and a supplementary table summarizing all tests are now included. Furthremore, we have no removed any species from our dataset.</p>
