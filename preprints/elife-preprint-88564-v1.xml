<abstract>
<p>Compartment formation in interphase chromosomes is a result of spatial segregation between eu- and heterochromatin on a few mega base pairs (Mbp) scale. On the sub-Mbp scales, Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) appear as interacting domains along the diagonal in the Hi-C contact map (CM). Hi-C experiments showed that most of the TADs vanish upon deleting cohesin, while the compartment structure is maintained and is even enhanced. However, closer inspection of the data reveals that a non-negligible fraction of TADs is preserved (P-TADs) after cohesin loss. Imaging experiments show that, at the single-cell level, TAD-like structures are present even without cohesin. To provide a structural basis for these findings, we used polymer simulations to show that certain TADs with epigenetic mismatches across their boundaries survive after depletion of loops. More importantly, the three-dimensional structures show that many of the P-TADs have sharp physical boundaries. Informed by the simulations, we analyzed the Hi-C maps (with and without cohesin) in mouse liver and HCT-116, which affirmed that epigenetic mismatches and physical boundaries (calculated using the 3D structures) explain the origin of the P-TADs. Single-cell structures, calculated from using only the Hi-C map without <italic>any parameters</italic>, display TAD-like features in the absence of cohesin that are remarkably similar to the findings in imaging experiments, thus providing a cross validation of the computations. Some P-TADs, with physical boundaries, are relevant to the retention of enhancer-promoter/promoter-promoter interactions. Overall, our study shows that preservation of a subset of TADs upon removing cohesin is a robust phenomenon that is valid across multiple cell lines.</p>

<label>I.</label><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Advances in experimental techniques have provided details of the three-dimensional (3D) organization of chromosomes in diverse species[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">l</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. The contact map (CM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], inferred using chromosome conformation capture technique and related variants (referred to as Hi-C from now on), is a two-dimensional (2D) matrix, whose elements indicate the probability that two loci separated by a certain genomic distance are spatially adjacent. The Hi-C experiments on different mammalian cells suggest that there are two major length scales in the organization of interphase chromosomes. On the scale, <italic>L</italic><sub>C</sub> ∼ (2-5) Mbp (mega base pairs or Mbp), one observes checkerboard patterns in the CMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>], which are thought to be associated with micro-phase separation between the two major epigenetic states, active (A) or euchromatin and inactive (B) or heterochromatin. On the length scale, <italic>L</italic><sub>TAD</sub>, from tens of kb up to a few Mb, chromatin domains, referred to as Topologically Associating Domains (TADs), appear as squares along the diagonal of the CMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Contacts are enriched within the TADs, and are suppressed across the boundaries between the TADs. A number of polymer models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>] have shown that compartment formations and TADs may be explained using micro-phase separation. The use of the two length scales, <italic>L</italic><sub>C</sub> and <italic>L</italic><sub>TAD</sub>, in characterizing the organization of interphase chromosomes is now entrenched in the held, although there are suggestions that finer sub-TAD structures emerge at kilo base scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. In particular, recent Micro-C experiments have shown that there are fine structures starting from the nucleosome level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>], thus establishing the hierarchical organization of interphase chromosomes over a broad range of length scales.</p>
<p>TADs are thought to regulate gene expression by constraining the contacts between target gene and regulatory regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. As a consequence, perturbation or disruption of their integrity such as deletions, duplications or inversions of DNA segments within the TADs, could lead to aberrant gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. A class of chromatin loops, mediated by the ATP-dependent motor cohesin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>] and the DNA-binding protein CTCF protein (“cohesin-associated CTCF loop”), organizes a subset of the TADs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Cohesin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>] extrudes DNA loops of varying length, which are terminated when cohesin encounters the transcriptional insulator CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. This implies that cohesin and CTCF are often colocalized at the TAD boundary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>].</p>
<p>Several experiments have shown that depletion of architectural proteins (Nipbl, RAD21, and CTCF) disrupts the organization of interphase chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. Schwarzer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>] showed that the removal of the cohesin loading factor, <italic>Nipbl</italic> in the mouse liver cell results in loss of TADs. They concluded that compartment formation, which is independent of cohesin, is a consequence of the underlying epigenetic landscape, while TAD formation requires cohesin. Similarly, it was found that upon removal of cohesin subunit, <italic>RAD21</italic> cohesin-associated CTCF loops and TADs are abolished [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Deletion of <italic>RAD21</italic> results in the complete loss of the so-called loop domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], which are formed when CTCF colocalizes with cohesin. In contrast, imaging experiments[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>] showed that TAD-like structures, with sharp boundaries are present, at the single-cell level even after deleting cohesin. Three headlines emerge from these studies are: (i) They reinforce the two-length scale description of genome organization at the ensemble level. (ii) Factors that prevent the association of cohesin with chromosomes globally abolish the TADs and the Hi-C peaks, but preserve (or even enhance) compartmentalization. Experimental studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>] and polymer simulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>] have shown that the global epigenetic state determines compartment formation, while the more dynamic TADs, with finite lifetimes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>], require ATP-dependent cohesin motor. (iii) TAD-like features persist in single cells before and after auxin treatment, albeit with changes in the locations of sharp domain boundaries.</p>
<p>The results of super resolution experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>], at the single-cell level (described above), forced us to ask if there is evidence for preservation of TADs at the ensemble level. To this end, we analyzed the experimental CMs from mouse liver and HCT-Π6 cells, in the presence and absence of cohesin to assess if TADs are preserved at the ensemble level. We discovered that, on an average a fraction of TADs, identified using the TopDom method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>], are retained in the mouse liver and HCT116 cell lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1</xref>) after removing cohesin. These findings raise the following questions. What is the structural basis for the retention of a small but not insignificant fraction of TADs that are preserved after cohesin loss? Is it possible to establish a structural explanation for TAD retention at the ensemble level (Hi-C), which would reconcile with the results in super resolution imaging experiments showing TAD-like structures at the single level, even without cohesin?</p>

<p>We answered the questions posed above by using the following strategy. We first performed polymer simulations for two chromosomes from the GM 12878 cell line using the Chromosome Copolymer Model (CCM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>] with and without loop anchors, which roughly mimics the wild type (WT) and the absence of cohesin-associated CTCF loops, respectively. Informed by the results from the polymer simulations, we analyzed the experimental data from two cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. We discovered that epigenetic mismatch does account for a reasonable fraction (≈ 0.4 in mouse liver and ≈ 0.3 in HCT-116 cell lines) of P-TADs. We also generated the 3D structural ensemble of the chromosomes that are needed to locate the physical boundaries. The 3D structures were calculated using the parameter free HIPPS method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>] for all the chromosomes for both the cell lines. The analyses using the 3D coordinates accounted for about 53% of the P-TADs. More importantly, the 3D structures revealed TAD-like structures, at the single-cell level, exhibit in the presence and absence of cohesin, which is in accord with the super resolution imaging data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Our work shows that the effects of cohesin removal on chromatin structures are nuanced, requiring analyses of both the epigenetic landscape as well as 3D structures in order to obtain a comprehensive picture of how distinct factors determine interphase chromosome organization in the nucleus. Our calculations for chromosomes from three cell lines lead to the robust conclusion that a subset of P-TADs is intact after deleting cohesin.</p>

<title>A non-negligible fraction of TADs are preserved upon removal of cohesin</title>
<p>Experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, 34-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>] have shown that deletion of cohesin loaders (<italic>Nipbl in mouse liver, SCC2 in yeast</italic>), cohesin subunit (<italic>RAD21</italic>) abolishes a substantial fraction of both cohesin-associated CTCF loops and the TADs. These observations across different cell lines raise an important question: Do all the TADs completely lose their contact patterns after removal of cohesin? To answer this question, we first analyzed 5Okb-resolution CMs from the two cell lines (mouse liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>] and HCT-116 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]) before and after degradation of <italic>Nipbl</italic> and <italic>RAD21</italic>, respectively (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s6">Appendix Analyses of the experimental data for details</xref>). Using TopDom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>] to identify the TADs in the CMs, we discovered that roughly 16% (26%) of TADs in mouse liver (HCT116) cell are preserved (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2</xref> to identify P-TADs using Hi-C data) upon <italic>Nipbl</italic> (<italic>RAD21</italic>) removal (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.l</xref>). Approximately, 659 TADs out of 4176 are preserved (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1a</xref>) after removing <italic>Nipbl</italic> in the mouse liver cells. In the HCT-116 cells, 1226 TADs out of 4733 are preserved (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1b</xref>) upon <italic>RAD21</italic> loss. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1c</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1d</xref> show that the number of P-TADs depends on the chromosome number. We ought to emphasize that the actual number of P-TADs, which depends on the TAD-calling protocol, is not as important as the finding that a non-negligible fraction is preserved after cohesin depletion.</p>

<title>CCM simulations reproduce wild-type Hi-C maps</title>
<p>To explore the mechanism resulting in P-TADs, we first simulated the chromosome copolymer model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], CCM (<xref rid="figa2" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.2a</xref>). To independently decipher the origins of P-TADs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1</xref>) in experiments, we calculated the CMs for Chr13, shown in <xref rid="figa2" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.2</xref> (Chr10 in <xref rid="figa3" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.3</xref>) from the GM12878 cell line.

</fig>
<p>In order to quantitatively compare the Hi-C data and the simulated CMs, we transformed the contact maps to Pearson correlation maps, which is used to assess if two loci have correlated interaction profiles (<xref rid="figa2" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.2c</xref>). The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the two probability distributions for the Pearson correlation coefficients, <italic>ρ<sub>ĳ</sub></italic>s, from simulations and experiments is 0.04 (see <xref rid="figa2" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.2d</xref>). We also performed Principal Component Analysis (PGA) on the Pearson correlation matrix to identify the compartment structure. Comparison of the PCA-derived first principal components (PC1) across the Chr13 reveals that A/B compartments observed in the CCM correspond well to those found in the experiments (<xref rid="figa2" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.2e</xref>).</p>
<p>We then compared the three-dimensional spatial organization between the simulations and experiments using the Ward Linkage Matrix (WLM), which is based on an agglomerative clustering algorithm. The simulated WLM is calculated from a spatial distance map of the organized chromosome, as described in <xref rid="figa2" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.2f-h</xref>. We constructed the experimental WLM by converting the Hi-C contact map to a distance map using the approximate relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>], <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="513342v3_inline20.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. Here, <italic>P<sub>ĳ</sub></italic> is the contact probability and <italic>R<sub>ĳ</sub></italic> is the 3D spatial distance between loci <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s6">Appendix Data Analyses</xref>). The Pearson correlation coefficient (<italic>ρ<sub>wlmexp</sub>,wlm<sub>ccm</sub></italic>) between experimental and simulated WLMs is 0.83 (<xref rid="figa2" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.2h</xref>).</p>
<p>Snapshots of TAD structures in <xref rid="figa2" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.2k</xref> and n show that they are compact but structurally diverse. The average sizes of the TADs detected using TopDom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>] from Hi-C and simulated contact maps are ∼6l5<italic>kbs</italic> and ∼565<italic>kbs</italic>, respectively. Overall the emerging picture of the compartment and TAD structures using different methods are consistent with each other. The results in <xref rid="figa2" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.2</xref> show that the agreement between the CCM simulations and Hi-C data is good, especially considering that (i) error estimates in the Hi-C experiments are essentially unknown, and (ii) more importantly, we did tune the value of any parameter to fit the experimental CMs. We surmise that the CCM faithfully reproduces the important features of the Hi-C maps for Chr13 (see <xref rid="figa3" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.3</xref> for Chr10 results).</p>

<title>Epigenetic mismatch accounts for a large fraction of P-TADs</title>
<p>Most of the TADs are not discernible after loop loss, as evidenced by the blurred edges in the contact maps (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3c</xref>). In the CCM simulations of chromosomes from human GM12878 cell line a subset of TADs remains even after cohesin-associated CTCF loop loss. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3a</xref> shows that ≈ 44% (Chr10) and 28% (Chr13) of initial TADs identified in the <italic>P<sub>l</sub> =</italic> 1 simulations using TopDom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>] are preserved after loop loss (<italic>P<sub>l</sub> =</italic> 0). These values are in line with TAD preservation in chromosomes in HCT-116 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] cells (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1d</xref>). The percentages of P-TADs depend on both the resolution of the Hi-C experiments as well as the algorithm used to identify the TADs. By using the same method to analyze both the simulation results and experimental data, it is hoped that the conclusions would be qualitatively robust.</p>
<p>We used the simulation results to determine the reasons for P-TADs by comparing the results for <italic>P<sub>L</sub></italic>=l and <italic>P<sub>l</sub>=</italic>0. The first observation is that some TADs, even with cohesin-associated CTCF loops, consist mostly of sequences in the same epigenetic state (A or B). <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3d</xref> compares the fate of one TAD in the region (19.3-21.8 Mb) in Chr13 between <italic>P<sub>L</sub></italic>=l and <italic>P<sub>l</sub>=</italic>0<italic>·</italic> The highlighted TAD is preserved upon loop loss although the probabilities of contact within this TAD is reduced when <italic>P<sub>l</sub> = 0</italic> (bottom) compared to <italic>P<sub>l</sub></italic> = 1 (top). Their boundaries correspond to a switch in the epigenetic state (the sequence location where the change in the epigenetic states occurs, as shown by the two black arrows). In contrast, a TAD in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3e</xref>, that is present in the WT, is abolished when <italic>P<sub>l</sub>=</italic>0<italic>·</italic> The disruption of this particular TAD, lacking in at least one epigenetic mismatch, occurs because it can interact more frequently with neighboring TADs composed of similar epigenetic states, which in this case is B-type loci. The importance of epigenetic mismatch in the P-TADs has been noted before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>].</p>
<p>The results in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs.3d</xref> and e show that a mismatch in the epigenetic state across a TAD boundary in the WT is likely to result in its preservation after cohesin-associated CTCF loop loss. To test this assertion, we calculated the number of P-TADs that are associated with mismatches in the epigenetic states (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s6">Appendix Data Analyses</xref> and <xref rid="figa1" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.1</xref> for details). We considered the TAD boundary and epigenetic mismatch as overlapping if they are less than 100kb apart, which is reasonable given that Hi-C resolution adopted here is 5Okb. By using 100kb as the cut off, we only consider mismatch occurrences that exceed two loci. With this criterion, out of 216 (169) TADs calculated using TopDom 96 (47) are P-TADs for Chr13 (Chr10) (vertical blue bars in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3b</xref> in which there are epigenetic mismatches in the WT).</p>
<p>The P-TADs with epigenetic mismatches, illustrated in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3f</xref>, shows TADs in the 2.5Mbs region in Chr13. Among the three P-TADs, two of them, whose boundaries are marked by dashed blue lines, have epigenetic mismatch across the TAD boundary. These two TADs survive after removal of cohesin-associated CTCF loop.</p>

<title>P-TADs have prominent spatial domain boundaries</title>
<p>Because there are a number of P-TADs that are preserved <italic>even without epigenetic mismatches</italic> across their boundaries, we wondered if the distance matrix, which requires 3D structures, would offer additional insights about P-TADs upon cohesin-associated CTCF loop loss. Recent imaging experiments[4O, 42, 46] revealed that TAD-like domain structures with spatially segregated heterogeneous conformations are present in single cells even without cohesin. The boundaries of TAD-like domains, identified from individual 3D structures, vary from cell to cell. They exhibit a preference to reside at specific genomic positions only upon averaging, as found in the Hi-C experiments. The boundary probability at each locus is the proportion of chromosome structures in which the locus is identified as a domain boundary in the 3D space. The locations of prominent peaks in the boundary probability frequently overlap with TADs detected by the population level Hi-C maps.</p>
<p>To explore the relation between P-TADs in ensemble averaged CMs and preferential boundaries in individual 3D structures of chromosomes, we first constructed individual spatial distance matrices (DMs) using 10,000 simulated 3D structures, which were used to identify the single-cell domain boundaries (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s6">Appendix Data Analyses</xref> for details and <xref rid="figa6" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.6</xref>). We find preferential domains, with high peaks in the boundary probability along the genomic region as well as variations in single-cell domains both in <italic>P<sub>L</sub></italic> = 1 and <italic>Pl</italic> = 0 (see <xref rid="figa8" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.8</xref>).</p>
<p>The simulations show that TADs with epigenetic mismatches across the boundary are likely to be preserved after cohesin-associated CTCF loop loss. Furthermore, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3f</xref> (blue dashed lines) shows that single-cell domain boundaries preferentially reside at the TAD boundaries with epigenetic mismatches, leading to a prominent signature for the ensemble boundary after averaging over a population of cells. Interestingly, the P-TAD has prominent peaks in boundary probability, even without epigenetic mismatch, at the same genomic position as in the CM (green lines in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3f</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">g</xref>). These observations imply that the presence of physical boundaries in the 3D structures may be used to identify P-TADs, especially in instances when there are no epigenetic mismatches.</p>
<p>Not all preferential boundaries identified in the distance matrices of the WT cells coincide with the TADs detected using the CM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. There is discordance in the TAD boundaries and high peaks in boundary probability. The top panel in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3h</xref> (magenta lines) shows that in the (102 - 104.5) Mb range, TopDom predicts that there are three P-TADs in the WT after loop loss (see the top panel with <italic>P<sub>l</sub></italic> = 0). There are two prominent peaks in the WT boundary probability whose boundaries coincide with the TADs predicted by TopDom (see bottom panel with <italic>P<sub>l</sub>=</italic>1 in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3h</xref>). But the peak height for the third TAD is very small. At best, one can deduce from the boundary probabilities (compare the results in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3h</xref> for <italic>P<sub>l</sub>=</italic>1 and <italic>P<sub>l</sub>=</italic>0) that the middle TAD is preserved, which would be consistent with the TopDom prediction.</p>
<p>We calculated a standardized Z-score for the boundary probability in the genomic region to determine the preferred boundaries in single-cell domains. The number of P-TADs that are accounted for by prominent boundary peaks increases if Z-score is reduced. This implies that some P-TADs detected in the CMs using TopDom have weak physical boundaries in the 3D structures. We considered the maxima, with Z-score values larger than 0.7, as preferred boundaries in order to determine if P-TADs arise due to the presence of strong physical boundary. With this criterion, we obtained good agreement for the mean length of the TADs detected in the CM using the TopDom method. The averaged sizes of the TADs in Chr13 using TopDom and boundary probability are ∼565<italic>kbs</italic> and <italic>∼</italic>535<italic>kbs</italic>, respectively. Quantitative analysis of the boundary probabilities along the genomic region revealed ≈66% of the P-TADs in Chr10 and Chr13 have preferential positioning in single-cell domains (green bars in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Most P-TADs with epigenetic mismatches display prominent peaks in the boundary probability (≈ 85%).</p>
<p>Let us summarize the primary lessons from the simulations, which form the basis for analyzing the experiments on chromosomes from mouse liver and HCT-116 cell lines. (i) Mismatch in the epigenetic state across the TAD boundary is a predominant factor in determining the P-TADs after CTCF loop deletion. (ii) The presence of physical boundaries in the 3D structures accounts for certain fraction of P-TADs, although in some instances TopDom predictions (used in (i)) are not compatible with boundaries deduced from 3D structures.</p>

<title>Structural explanation of P-TADs upon cohesin removal from analysis of Hi-C data</title>
<p>In order to assess if the conclusions from simulations explain the experimental data, we first calculated the number of P-TADs whose boundaries have switches in the A/B epigenetic states in mouse liver and HCT-116 cell lines. We assigned chromatin state A (active, red) or B (repressive, blue) by analyzing the combinatorial patterns of histone marks using ChromHMM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s6">Appendix analyses of the experimental data</xref> and <xref rid="figa7" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.7</xref>). An average over the 20 chromosomes shows that 280 P-TADs were associated with a mismatch between A and B epigenetic states upon Δ<italic>Nipbl</italic> in mouse liver (blue bar in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4a</xref>). The corresponding number of P-TADs, averaged over 23 chromosomes, with epigenetic mismatches is 396 after deleting <italic>RAD21</italic> in HCT-116 (blue bar in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4b</xref>). Not unexpectedly, TADs with epigenetic mismatches across their boundaries are preserved with high probability. We find that a large number of P-TADs are accounted (green bars in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4a</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4b</xref>) for by the presence of peaks in the boundary probabilities, which we discuss in detail below.</p>
<p>We then searched for a structural explanation for P-TADs in the two cell lines (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4a</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4b</xref>). A plausible hint comes from the the CCM simulations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), which show that boundary probabilities are good predictors of P-TADs. This implies that peaks in the boundary probabilities should correspond to P-TADs. Similar findings are obtained by analyzing the experimental data (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">d</xref>). Additional examples are discussed in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>. In light of these findings, we wondered if, in general, physical boundaries can be inferred directly using data from ensemble experiments. To this end, we used the HIPPS method (see Methods), to calculate an ensemble of 3D structures with the Hi-C contact map as the input. Several conclusions follow from the results in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5</xref>. First, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5a</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">b</xref> show that HIPPS faithfully reproduces Hi-C contact maps. Second, using the ensemble of 3D structures, we calculated the locus-dependent boundary probabilities for both the WT and cohesin-depleted cells. Comparison of the peak positions in the averaged boundary probabilities and TAD boundaries shows that they often coincide, although there are discordances as well (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5</xref> and <xref rid="figa12" ref-type="fig">Appendix Figs. 12</xref> and <xref rid="figa13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>). Third, when there is a mismatch in the epigenetic states, a substantial fraction of P-TADs have high peaks in the boundary probabilities (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5</xref> and <xref rid="figa12" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig. 12</xref>). As in the simulations, a large fraction of P-TADs (≈ 67%) have high peaks in the boundary probabilities. Taken together, the results show that the predictions using boundary probabilities and the TopDom method are consistent. Finally, analyses of the experiments suggest that the epigenetic state as well as the presence of physical boundary in the 3D structures have to be combined in order to determine the origin of P-TADs in cohesin depleted cells.</p>

<p>With the near quantitative agreement with experiments, we performed detailed analyses, based on the epigenetic mismatches and boundary probabilities for chromosomes from the mouse liver (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5</xref>). The Appendix contains analyses of the experimental data, and the results for HCT-116 cell are given in <xref rid="figa12" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig. 12</xref>. To illustrate different scenarios, we consider the 2.5Mbs regions from Chr6 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5c</xref>), Chr7 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5d</xref>), and Chr15 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5e</xref>). (i) For Chr 6, there are three TADs according to TopDom (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5c</xref>) in the WT. Upon Δ<italic>Nipbl</italic>, these TADs are abolished (compare the top and bottom panels in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5c</xref>). The epigenetic track indicates that the region is mostly in the repressive (B) state. Quantification of the boundary probabilities along the <italic>2.5Mb</italic> region of Chr6 shows that the TADs also lack physical boundaries upon Š<italic>Nipbl.</italic> (ii) Examples of P-TADs that satisfy the epigenetic mismatch criterion are given in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5d</xref>. Using TopDom, we identified several TADs (top panel in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5d</xref>) in this region of Chr7. It is interesting that the boundary probabilities obtained from the HIPPS-generated distance matrices are also large when there is a mismatch in the epigenetic states. In these examples, both epigenetic mismatches and boundary probabilities give consistent results (see the dashed blue lines in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5d</xref>). Two TADs in the WT (the ones on the right in the upper panel in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5d</xref>) merge to form a single TAD in the Δ<italic>Nipbl.</italic> This observation is in accord with expectation based on epigenetic mismatch, whose corollary is that if there is a TAD within a region that contains predominantly A or B type loci they ought to merge upon Δ<italic>Nipbl.</italic> (iii) In the <italic>2.5Mb</italic> region of Chr15, there are three TADs in the WT (top panel in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5e</xref>). The first and the third TADs have an epigenetic mismatch at only one boundary (blue dashed line), and the expectation is that they would not be preserved upon <italic>Nipbl</italic> removal. However, the boundary probabilities show that the TADs have physical boundaries in both, and thus they are preserved. Taken together, the results in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5</xref> show that only by combining the epigenetic mismatches (Hi-C data is sufficient) and the boundary probabilities (3D structures are required), one can account for a number of P-TADs.</p>

<title>Single-cell structural change upon cohesin depletion</title>
<p>Finally, we asked whether HIPPS can capture the 3D structural changes in cohesin-depleted cell at the single-cell level.

We used HIPPS to the Hi-C contact map on the same genomic region as in the experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>] to generate the 3D structures.

Several inferences may be drawn from the results in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6</xref>. (1) There are large variations in the distance matrices and domain boundary locations/strengths from cell to cell (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6c</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">d</xref>). This finding is in excellent agreement with imaging data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. (2) In both experiments and our calculations, there are TAD-like structures at the single level even after <italic>RAD2I</italic> is removed (see the right panel in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6c</xref> for the theoretical predictions). We should add that TAD-like structures in single cells with and without cohesin have also been found using the strings and binders polymer model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. (3) The calculated boundary strength distribution (blue histogram in the left panel in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6d</xref>) for the WT is in reasonable agreement with the measured distribution (purple histogram from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]). Similarly, the calculated and measured boundary strength distributions for Δ<italic>RAD21</italic> cells are also in good agreement (right panel in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6d</xref>). Just as in experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>], we find that the distributions of boundary strength are the same in the WT and in cells without <italic>RAD21.</italic> (4) We also find that the average locus-dependent boundary probability obtained using theory is in very good agreement with the reported experimental data (compare the curves in the left panel in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6e</xref> for the WT and the ones on the right for Δ<italic>RAD</italic>21 cells).</p>

<label>III.</label><title>Discussion</title>
<p>By analyzing the experimental Hi-C data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>], we showed that upon cohesin loss a non-negligible fraction of TADs is preserved. To examine the factors that control the P-TADs, we first performed polymer simulations of two chromosomes in the presence and absence of cohesin-associated CTCF loops from the GM 12878 cell line. The simulations for chromosomes from a cell line reproduced the salient findings noted in the experiments in mouse liver and HCT-Π6 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. The key findings in the simulations are: (1) Mismatches in the epigenetic states across the TAD boundary account for a large fraction of P-TADs. Certain P-TADs, that lack epigenetic mismatches, could be preserved as revealed by the presence of physical boundaries in the 3D structures. (2) In general, there is an overall consistency between predictions based on boundary probability calculations using 3D structures, and mismatches in the epigenetic switches across TAD boundaries.</p>
<p>Informed by the simulation results, we analyzed the experimental Hi-C data on chromosomes from two cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. Analyses of the structures determined from the Hi-C map using the HIPPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>], with and without <italic>Nipbl</italic> or <italic>RAD</italic>21, showed that A-type loci form larger spatial clusters after cohesin removal, consistent with enhancement of compartments inferred from Hi-C CMs (<xref rid="figa4" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.4</xref>). More importantly, we found that a large fraction of P-TADs can be accounted for by the epigenetic mismatches and the preferential boundaries in 3D structures of chromosomes. Thus, a combination of the two perspectives accounts for the experimental observations pertaining to P-TADs upon cohesin loss[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. Most of the P-TADs with epigenetic mismatches in the CMs have a prominent peak in the boundary probability, which indicates a strong physical boundary in the 3D structures. If this interpretation is correct, then a natural conclusion is that not only micro-phase separation on the larger scale, <italic>L</italic><sub>C</sub> but also some special TADs on a shorter scale, <italic>L</italic><sub>tad</sub> are encoded in the epigenetic sequence.</p>

<title>P-TADs are due to enhancer/promoter interactions</title>
<p>Cohesin is thought to directly or indirectly regulate enhancer-promoter (E-P) interactions. However, strikingly a recent Micro-C experiment discovered that E-P and promoter-promoter (P-P) interactions are largely insensitive to acute depletion of cohesin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. It has been previously shown that E-P/P-P interactions form one or multiple self-associating domains, strips extending from domain borders and loop-like structures at their intersections at a finer scale [4951]. Based on the recent finding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>], we explored if maintenance of finer-scale E-P and P-P interactions is the origin of the P-TADs without epigenetic mismatches by analyzing Micro-C data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. The left panel in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7a</xref> shows cohesin-associated (green dashed line) and cohesin-independent (blue dashed line) TAD structures (defined using Topdom) in the WT cells. In the latter case, the TADs E-P and P-P loops (blue circles) exist at the boundary but there is <italic>no epigenetic mismatch</italic>, implying that it is a domain needed for E-P or P-P communication. Interestingly, the TADs were also conserved upon cohesin loss (right panel in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7a</xref>). Analyses of the 3D structures (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7b</xref>) also reveal that the TADs with E-P/P-P loops have strong physical boundaries even in the absence of cohesin. <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7c</xref> shows an example of a TAD with both E-P/P-P loops and cohesin/CTCF loops at the boundary in the WT cells is retained after cohesin deletion, and is associated with prominent boundary peaks. We propose that only a subset of TADs are conserved, potentially for functional reasons. Taken together, our observations suggest that maintenance of E-P/P-P interactions is the origin of the P-TADs even in the absence of epigenetic mismatches. It is worth emphasizing that these conclusions can only be obtained by analyzing the 3D structures, which we calculated from the Micro-C contact maps using the parameter free HIPPS method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>].</p>

<title>TAD-like structure are preserved at the single-cell level</title>
<p>Remarkably, the conclusion that there are cell-to-cell variations in the distance maps, noted in imaging experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>], are also fully affirmed in the calculated 3D structures calculated directly from the ensemble Hi-C data. In addition, the calculations also show that in mouse liver and HCT-116 cell lines, TAD-like structures are present after removing <italic>Nipbl</italic> and <italic>RAD21</italic>, respectively. We established that the Hi-C data sets can be utilized to generate 3D structures using HIPPS, which allows us to examine the impact of perturbations on three-dimensional organization of interphase chromosomes at the single-cell level. These results are significant because (1) only a limited number of loci can be directly imaged whereas Hi-C data can be routinely generated at higher resolution, <bold>(2)</bold> the number of Hi-C data on various cell types and species currently is greater than that from imaging data.</p>

<title>Comments on the Methods</title>
<p>In order to explore the factors that control the P-TADs, there are two assumptions. (1) The results of the Hi-C experiments are taken at face value in the sense. We view this as an assumption because errors in the Hi-C readouts may be difficult to evaluate even though such experiments are invaluable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. (2) The TADs were identified using TopDom, one of many TAD callers. A recent survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>] shows that, although the finding that TADs are hierarchically organized domains is robust, there are substantial variations in the identification of these domains predicted by different methods. Although TopDom fairs reasonably well in comparison to other methods, there is no guarantee that it identifies the TAD location or the number of TADs accurately. It is only for convenience that we used TopDom as the reference to which the results using the boundary probabilities are compared.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>We performed polymer simulations for the following reasons: (i) Because all TAD calling schemes are approximate, we evaluated the accuracy of given protocol (TopDom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>] in our study) using the well calibrated CCM. TAD identification in the CCM simulations could be made directly from the 3D structures, thus allowing us to test the validity of the TopDom method. (ii) The combination of 3D structures, assignment of epigenetic states using ChromHMM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>], and accurate calculation of the Hi-C maps using the CCM, was used to determine the origin of P-TADs. (iii) An added bonus is that the polymer simulations on an entirely different cell type (human GM 12878) could be used to assess the robustness of our conclusions.</p>
<p>To avoid biases in the formulation of the hypothesis to explain TAD preservation, we simulated chromosomes from the Human Cell line (GM 12878), which is different from the cell lines used in experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. In the main text, we report results for Chr13 (19115.10 Mbp). The total number of <italic>5Okb</italic> loci is <italic>N</italic> = 1923, and the total number of loop anchor pairs is 72. To ensure that the results are robust, we also simulated Chr10 (<xref rid="figa3" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.3</xref>.</p>

<title>Chromosome Copolymer Model (CCM) for Chromosomes</title>
<p>We modified the Chromatin Copolymer Model (CCM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>] in order to simulate full length interphase chromosomes. In the CCM, chromosomes are modeled as a self-avoiding copolymer with A (B) type loci representing the active (repressive) epigenetic state.

<p>The unit of energy is <italic>k<sub>B</sub>T</italic>, where <italic>k<sub>B</sub></italic> is the Boltzmann constant and <italic>T</italic> is the temperature.</p>
<p>We used the CCM simulations in order to deduce the reasons for preservation of certain TADs when the loop anchors are deleted. The simulations must reproduce the two major findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]: (a) propensity of the A and B loci to segregate should be enhanced upon removal of cohesin; (b) a fraction of TADs should be preserved upon cohesin or cohesin-associated CTCF loop loss. Each locus in the polymer is either A type (active locus is in red) or B type (repressive locus is in blue) (<xref rid="figa2" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.2a</xref>). The locus type is determined using the Broad ChromHMM track [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. There are 15 chromatin states, out of which the first eleven are related to gene activity, based on which we group states 1-11 as active state (A), and states 12-15 as repressive state (B). The locations of the CTCF/cohesin-mediated loop anchors, which are fixed in the polymer simulations (cohesin is present), are obtained from the Hi-C data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>] (GSE63525_GMl2878_primary+replicate_HiCCUPS_with_motifs.txt.gz). Removal of the loop constraints mimics the absence of cohesin. In the Wild type (WT) simulations, the probability of loop anchor, <italic>P<sub>L</sub></italic> being present is unity. To model cohesin depletion, we set <italic>P<sub>L</sub></italic> = 0 to assess the impact of deleting the loops on compartments and TADs.</p>

<title>Effective energy scales</title>
<p>The creation of CCM was motivated by the experimental observation that active and repressive loci segregate on a few mega base scale.

<p>DBSCAN is a clustering algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>] that finds regions of high density by grouping together data points that are in proximity based on spatial distribution. For DBSCAN, two parameters, <italic>Epsilon</italic> and <italic>MinPoints</italic> are required; <italic>Epsilon</italic> is a threshold distance between two loci that is used to classify if they belong to the same cluster whereas <italic>MinPoints</italic> is the minimum number of data points needed to form a dense region.

It is likely that optimal values depend on the chromosomes, A/B loci type and the cell type.

<title>TAD and P-TAD identification</title>
<p>TopDom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>] is one of many methods used to identify TADs.

TAD boundaries are discovered as local minima in the binSignal. Subsequently, false detections in the local minima are filtered by using the Wilcox Rank Sum. We used the software package and source codes of TopDom (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/jasminezhoulab/TopDom">https://github.com/jasminezhoulab/TopDom</ext-link>) with default parameter, <italic>w</italic>=5. Two aspects concerning the implementation of TopDom should be kept in mind. (i) TopDom results change depending on parameter values. Large <italic>w</italic> produces big domains, reducing the total number of detected domains. (ii) There are some matrix columns/rows whose contact frequencies sum up to zero. We refer to them as missing bins. We selected only the domains whose boundaries have zero or one missing bin in a 25Okb range, since the presence of the missing bin influences contact insulation.</p>
<p>For completeness, let us define preserved TADs (P-TADs). We detected TADs using TopDom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>] based on the Hi-C data. First, <italic>P-ΊADs</italic> are those that remain in <italic>both</italic> the wild type (WT) cells and cohesin-depleted cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2</xref>). If the boundaries between two TADs in cohesin-depleted cells are within ± 5Okb window from the corresponding boundary in the WT, and if there is greater than ≥ 80% overlap between the WT and cohesin-depleted cells, such a TAD is classified as a P-TAD. Second, <italic>epigenetic mismatches across TAD boundaries</italic> refer to the alteration of epigenetic state upon going from one TAD to the neighboring TAD (see <xref rid="figa1" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.1</xref>). For instance, one TAD consisting of predominantly euchromatin loci with the adjacent TAD comprising largely heterochromatin loci would create epigenetic mismatches across the boundary. We also used three dimensional structures of chromosomes, with and without cohesin, to calculate boundaries in three dimensions to determine the structural origin of P-TADs.</p>

<title>P-TADs with epigenetic mismatches</title>
<p>The procedure of epigenetic mismatches is schematically shown in <xref rid="figa1" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.l</xref>. Mismatches that occupy only one locus (50<italic>kb</italic>) were excluded (see <italic>I</italic> in <xref rid="figa1" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.1</xref>). We considered the P-TAD boundary and epigenetic mismatch as overlapping if they are less than 100kb apart (<italic>II</italic> in <xref rid="figa1" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.l</xref>). Finally, P-TADs with epigenetic mismatches, consisting of &lt;70% of sequences in identical epigenetic states, with epigenetic mismatches, were filtered out (<italic>III</italic> in <xref rid="figa1" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.l</xref>).</p>

<title>Boundary strength and boundary probability</title>
<p>To measure the boundary strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>] for each locus <italic>i</italic>, we first calculated the median distance values <italic>(L)</italic> of the left three columns, each extending 6-elements below the diagonal, and the median value <italic>(R)</italic> of the right three 6-element columns below the diagonal. Similarly, the median value <italic>(B)</italic> of the right three 6-element columns above the diagonal, and the median value <italic>(T)</italic> of the left three 6-element columns above the diagonal were calculated.</p>
<p>The two boundary strengths, <italic>L/R</italic> (start-of-domain boundary strength) and <italic>B/T</italic> (end-of domain boundary strength) are computed as defined in <xref rid="figa6" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.6</xref>. The local maxima above a defined threshold in the start/end-of domain boundary strengths are identified as te start/end positions of the domain boundary, respectively. This is physically reasonable because at the boundary between two TADs <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="513342v3_inline18.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> is low which implies that <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="513342v3_inline19.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> has to be large. Based on the boundary positions in individual cells, we compute the start/end boundary probability for each locus as the fraction of chromosomes in which the corresponding locus is identified as a start/encl boundary of a domain. The average of these start and encl boundary probabilities for each locus is defined as the boundary probability at the locus (<xref rid="figa6" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.6</xref>).</p>

<title>Appendix A: Analyses of the experimental data</title>
<p>A hypothesis that emerges from the CCM simulations is that the TADs, which are preserved with high probability upon cohesin deletion, have epigenetic mismatches across the TAD boundary, and are often accompanied by peaks in the boundary probability. In order to test this hypothesis, we analyzed the Hi-C contact map from Schwarzer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>] (mouse liver) and Rao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] (HCT-116). In each experiment, cohesin loading factor, <italic>Nipbl</italic> and a core component of the cohesin complex, <italic>RAD21</italic> were depleted by employing a liverspecific, tamoxifen-inducible Cre driver and an auxin-inducible degron (AID), respectively. The availability of the wild-type (WT) and cohesin depleted (Δ<italic>Nipbl</italic> or Δ<italic>RAD21</italic>) CMs allows us to test the hypothesis derived from simulations.</p>
<p>In order to analyze the mouse liver data, we used the wild-type and <italic>Nipbl</italic>-depleted Hi-C contact maps at 5Okb-resolution from GEO: GSE9343l. The locations of the CTCF loops were determined using the HiCCUPS method in HiCPeaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/XiaoTaoWang/HiCPeaks">https://github.com/XiaoTaoWang/HiCPeaks</ext-link>). HiCCUPS examines each pixel in a Hi-C contact matrix and detects loops by finding the pixels that are enriched relative to local neighborhoods (pixels to its lower-left, pixels to its left and right, pixels above and below, and pixels within a doughnut-shaped region surrounding the pixel of interest). We obtained the locations of the 3,301 loop anchors for 20 chromosomes from the wild type Hi-C contact maps. Epigenetic landscape is determined using the Broad ChromHMM track for mouse liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/gireeshkbogu/chromatin_states_chromHMM_mm9">https://github.com/gireeshkbogu/chromatin_states_chromHMM_mm9</ext-link>). Among the 15 chromatin states in the track, we assigned states 1-10 and 15 to be in the active state (A) because they are related to gene transcription. States 11-14 correspond to heterochromatin, and hence are taken to the repressive (B).</p>
<p>For the HCT-116 cell, we used 5Okb-resolution Hi-C map for untreated and <italic>RAD21</italic>-depleted cells obtained from GEO: GSE104334. Chromatin state characterization was performed using ChromHMM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>] considering twelve histone modifications ChIP-seq data (H3K27ac, H3K9ac, H3K27me3, H3K36me3, H3K79me2, H3K9me2, H3K9me3, H4K2Omel, H3K4mel, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, and CTCF) that are available in the ENCODE Project Consortium. Chromatin functional states are annotated based on the study by Moudgil et. al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>]. For this cell line, we assigned states 1-9 and 15 to be in the the A (active) because they are related to gene transcription. States 10-14 are repressed, and hence may be classified as repressive (B) (<xref rid="figa7" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.7</xref>). Locations of the chromatin loops for HCT 116 from Hi-C contact maps were determined using HiCCUPS in juicer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</ext-link> aidenlab/juicer) following the procedure from Rao at al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Using this procedure, we detected 3,624 loop anchors for 23 chromosomes from wild type Hi-C contact maps.</p>

<title>Calculation of the 3D structures of chromosome from Hi-C contact maps</title>
<p>In order to identify the A/B clusters and calculate the boundary probability, we need the 3D coordinates of the loci. We used the HIPPS (Hi-C-polymer-physics-structures) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>] method, which uses the Hi-C contact map as the input, to generate an ensemble of three-dimensional chromosome structures. In the HIPPS method, the mean distance matrix is generated using polymer physics using a power-law relation between the mean contact probability, <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="513342v3_inline21.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> between loci <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> and the average spatial distance, <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="513342v3_inline22.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. An ensemble of 3D structures is calculated by using the mean distance matrix as a constraint using the principle of maximum entropy. We generated an ensemble of 10,000 individual 3D structures by applying the HIPPS method to Hi-C contact map for each chromosome for the two cell lines. The 3D structures are used to calculate the boundary positions (see below) to identify potential single-cell domains, which complements the TopDom analysis.</p>

<title>Appendix B: Effect of <italic>RAD21</italic> removal</title>
<p>Single-cell studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>] on a <italic>2.5Mb</italic> region (Chr21:34.6-37.1Mb) in HCTΠ6 cell showed that several pronounced TAD structures detected in the WT cells were eliminated if <italic>RAD21</italic> is degraded. This could be predicted by the EMH because the degraded TADs are mostly composed of active (A) loci. Our analysis for the same region also shows flat domain boundary probability (<xref rid="figa12" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig. 12a</xref>). In contrast, <xref rid="figa12" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig. 12b</xref> reveals that preferential TAD boundaries persist, and are retained despite <italic>RAD21</italic> loss, which is associated with epigenetic mismatches. Furthermore, some TADs without epigenetic mismatches are preserved, and could be identified based on the presence of physical boundaries in the 3D structures (green lines in <xref rid="figa12" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig. 12c</xref>).</p>

<title>Appendix C: Corner dots in P-TADs</title>
<p>Our analyses of the experimental data show that TADs whose borders correspond to both epigenetic mismatch and CTCF loop anchors in the WT cells are preserved after removal of cohesin. However, not all P-TADs have loop anchors at their boundaries (corner dots) in the WT cells (see <xref rid="figa11" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig. 11</xref>). Out of the 280 (396) P-TADs with epigenetic mismatches in mouse liver (HCT-116) chromosomes, 117 (170) did not have corner dots at their boundaries before deleting <italic>Nipbl (RAD2I)</italic>. This suggests that some TAD boundaries are formed in the absence of corner dots. It is the underlying epigenetic landscape that is the predominant factor in the formation of such domain boundaries.</p>

<title>Appendix D: Loss of cohesin-associated CTCF loops leads to an increase in the degree of compartmentalization</title>
<p>The first experimental finding is that cohesin knockdown results in preservation or even enhancement of the compartment structure[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. To ensure that CCM reproduces this finding, we first explored how cohesin-associated CTCF loop deletion affects compartmentalization by performing simulations without loop anchors, which is implemented by setting <italic>P<sub>l</sub> =</italic> 0 (see Methods). We find that the plaid patterns persist after the deletion of the loops (<xref rid="figa4" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.4a</xref>). Visual comparison between the two CMs in <xref rid="figa4" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.4a</xref> shows that this is indeed the case. Moreover, the rectangles in <xref rid="figa4" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.4a</xref> also show that finer features, absent when <italic>P<sub>l</sub></italic> is unity, emerge when <italic>P<sub>l</sub>=</italic>0, which is an indication of increase in the compartment strength. Pearson correlation maps (lower panel in <xref rid="figa4" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.4a</xref>) illustrate the reduction in the contact profiles between A and B loci (dark-blue color) after loop loss. There is an enhancement in interactions between same type loci (A-A or B-B) (dark-red color). The results in <xref rid="figa4" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.4a</xref> confirm the experimental finding that disruption of the loops not only creates finer features in the compartment structures but also results in increased number of contacts between loci of the same type, which is simultaneously accompanied by a decrease in the number of A-B interactions.</p>
<p>We then investigated if the enhancement of compartments observed in the CMs has a structural basis. An imaging study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>] showed that active loci form larger spatial clusters in cohesin depleted cells. To probe whether this finding is reproduced in our CCM simulations, we first calculated the spatial distance matrix (DM) using 10,000 simulated 3D structures. For individual matrices, with and without cohesin-associated CTCF loops, we identified A (B)-dense regions as A (B) clusters, respectively, using the DBSCAN (Densitybased spatial clustering of applications with noise) method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>]. <xref rid="figa4" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.4b</xref> shows the number of clusters obtained using DBSCAN. The number of A clusters varied between individual structures, which reflects the heterogeneity in the chromosome organization. On an average, there are about five A clusters for <italic>P<sub>L</sub></italic> = 1, which decreases to four with <italic>P<sub>L</sub> =</italic> 0, which is one indication of the increase in the compartment strength. We also calculated the size of the clusters, which is the average fraction of loci in each cluster in individual structures (right panel in <xref rid="figa4" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.4c</xref>). On an average, the size of A clusters is greater after loop loss. This implies that active clusters merge in space to form larger and more connected clusters upon deleting the loops. In contrast, there is no change in the number and size of B clusters (see <xref rid="figa4" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.4a</xref>). Taken together, our observations for A and B clusters show that the A loci form larger clusters upon loop loss, which leads to stronger segregation between A and B loci after the loops are deleted.</p>
<p>In the <xref rid="figa4" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.4</xref>, we used the DBSCAN method to demonstrate the enhanced compartmentalization upon cohesin deletion. In order to assess if our method produces results that are consistent with other techniques, we also calculated the compartment strength used in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>]. In this method, chromosomal interaction frequencies are first normalized by the average interaction frequency at a given genomic distance, s. Then the distance corrected interaction frequencies are sorted based on the PC1 value for each locus <italic>i</italic>, which we calculated from the contact map. Finally, the frequencies were aggregated into 50 bins to obtain the saddle plot (<xref rid="figa5" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.5</xref>) in which the top left corner (B-B) indicates the frequency of interaction between the B compartments, while bottom right (A-A) represents the contact frequency between the A compartments. Top Right (B-A) and Bottom Left (A-B) corners are interaction frequencies between A and B compartments. The strength of the compartment is calculated using, ((A–A) + (B–B)) / ((A–B) + (B–A)). The values used for this ratio were determined by calculating the mean value of 20% bins in each corner of the saddle plot. We used cooltools for saddle plot calculations (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/open2c/cooltools">https://github.com/open2c/cooltools</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Relation to experiments regarding the compartmenlization</title>
<p>Besides being consistent with imaging experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>], we wondered whether the structural changes inferred from the Hi-C maps from the mouse liver and HCT-116 cell lines liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>] could be used to demonstrate the strengthening of compartments upon deleting cohesin. We calculated an ensemble of 10,000 3D structures for chromosomes from the two cell lines using the parameter free HIPPS method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. Consistent with the simulation results, we also observed variations in the spatial organization of A and B loci in individual structures in WT and cohesin depleted cells. DBSCAN analysis identified a smaller number A/B clusters with larger size in Δ<italic>Nipbl</italic> (Δ<italic>RAD</italic>21) cells compared to WT cells, as shown in <xref rid="figa4" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.4d</xref> for Chr11 and Chr19 (see <xref rid="figa4" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.4e</xref> for HCT-116 results).</p>
<p>To provide additional insights into the calculated conformations, we constructed Pearson correlation matrices using contact maps calculated from the 3D structures. <xref rid="figa4" ref-type="fig">Appendix Figs.4f</xref> and <xref rid="figa4" ref-type="fig">g</xref> show that cohesin loss induces stronger plaid patterns, which is consistent with simulation results (lower panel of <xref rid="figa4" ref-type="fig">Appendix Fig.4a</xref>) for Chr13 from GM12878 cell line. Comparison of the 3D structural changes with and without cohesin shows that the micro-phase separation between active and inactive loci is strengthened, with larger A and B physical clusters upon depletion of cohesin, which accords well with Hi-C experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>].</p>

(d) The distance maps in 10,000 cells are calculated using the 3D structures using the HIPPS method[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>] with Hi-C contact map from Schwarzer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>] as input. Local maxima above a defined threshold at the start/end-of domain boundary strengths (yellow and green lines, respectively) are defined as domain boundaries in the WT Chr13. The start/end boundary probabilities for each locus are calculated as the proportion of cells in which the corresponding locus is a boundary location. The average of the start and end boundary probabilities cover 10,000 cells, is defined as the boundary probability for a given locus.</p></caption>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study, of interest for students of the biology of genomes, uses simulations in combination with published data to examine how many TADs remain after cohesin depletion. The authors suggest that a significant subset of chromosome conformations do not require cohesin, and that knowledge of specific epigenetic states can be used to identify regions of the genome that still interact in the absence of cohesin. The theoretical approaches and quantitative analysis are state-of-the-art, and the data quality and strength of the conclusions are <bold>solid</bold>. However, because &quot;physical boundaries (of domains?)&quot; in the model appear to be a consequence of preserved TADs, rather than the other way around, the functional insights are limited.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, Jeong et al. investigate the prevalence and cause of TADs that are preserved in eukaryotic cells after cohesin depletion. The authors perform an extensive analysis of previously published Hi-C data, and find that roughly 15% of TADs are preserved in both mouse liver cells and in HCT-116 cells. They confirm previous findings that epigenetic mismatches across the boundaries of TADs can cause TAD preservation. However, the authors also find that not all preserved TADs can be explained this way. Jeong et al. provide an argument based on polymer simulations that &quot;physical boundaries&quot; in 3D structures provide an additional mechanism that can lead to TAD preservation. However, in its current form, we do not find the argumentation and evidence that leads to this claim to be fully compelling.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>We appreciate the extensive statistical analysis performed by the authors on the extent to which TAD's are preserved; this does seem like a novel and valuable contribution to the field.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. As the authors briefly note, the fact that compartmentalization due to epigenetic mismatches can cause TAD-like structures upon cohesin depletion has already been discussed in the literature; see for example Extended Data Figure 8 in (Schwarzer et al., 2017) or the simulation study (Nuebler et al., 2018). We are hence left with the impression that the novelty of this finding is somewhat overstated in this manuscript.</p>
<p>
2. It is not quite clear what the authors conceptually mean by &quot;physical boundaries&quot; and how this could offer additional insight into preserved TADs. First, the authors use the CCM model to show that TAD boundaries correlate with peaks in the single cell boundary probability distribution of the model. This finding is consistent with previous reports that TAD-like structures are present in single cells, and that specific TAD boundaries only arise as a population average. The finding based on the CCM simulations hence seems to be that preserved TADs also arise as a population average in cohesin-depleted cells, but we do not follow what the term &quot;physical boundaries&quot; refers to in this context. The authors then use the Hi-C data to infer a maximum-entropy-based HIPPS model. They find that preserved TADs often have boundaries that correspond to peaks in the single cell boundary probabilities of the inferred model. The authors seem to imply that these peaks in the boundary probability correspond to &quot;physical boundaries&quot; that cause the preservation of TADs. This argument seems circular; the model is based on inferring interaction strengths between monomers, such that the model recreates the input Hi-C map. This means that the ensemble average of the model should have a TAD boundary where one is present in the input Hi-C data. A TAD boundary in the Hi-C data would then seem to imply a peak in the model's single-cell boundary probability. (The authors do display two examples where this is not the case in Fig.3h, but looking at these cases by eye, they do not seem to correspond to strong TAD boundaries.) &quot;Physical boundaries&quot; in the model are hence a consequence of the preserved TADs, rather than the other way around, as the authors seem to suggest. At the very least the boundary probability in the HIPPS model is not an independent statistic from the Hi-C map (on which their model is constrained), so we have concerns about using the physical boundaries idea to understand where some of the preserved TADs come from.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Here Jeong et al., use a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches to define molecular contexts that support specific chromatin conformations. They seek to define features that are associated with TADs that are retained after cohesin depletion (the authors refer to these TADs as P-TADs). They were motivated by differences between single cell data, which suggest that some TADs can be maintained in the absence of cohesin, whereas ensemble HiC data suggest complete loss of TADs. By reananalyzing a number of HiC datasets from different cell types, the authors observe that in ensemble methods, a significant subset of TADs are retained. They observe that P-TADs are associated with mismatches in epigenetic state across TAD boundaries. They further observe that &quot;physical boundaries&quot; are associated with P-TAD maintenance. Their structure/simulation based approach appears to be a powerful means to generate 3D structures from ensemble HiC data, and provide chromosome conformations that mimic the data from single-cell based experiments. Their results also challenge current dogma in the field about epigenetic state being more related to compartment formation rather than TAD boundaries. Their analysis is particularly important because limited amounts of imaging data are presently available for defining chromosome structure at the single-molecule level, however, vast amounts of HiC and ChIP-seq data are available. By using HiC data to generate high quality simulated structural data, they overcome this limitation. Overall, this manuscript is important for understanding chromosome organization, particularly for contacts that do not require cohesin for their maintenance, and for understanding how different levels of chromosome organization may be interconnected. I cannot comment on the validity of the provided simulation methods and hope that another reviewer is qualified to do this.</p>

<p>This manuscript presents a comprehensive investigation into the mechanisms that explain the presence of TADs (P-TADs) in cells where cohesin has been removed. In particular, to study TADs in wildtype and cohesin depleted cells, the authors use a combination of polymer simulations to predict whole chromosome structures de novo and from Hi-C data. Interestingly, they find that those TADs that survive cohesin removal contain a switch in epigenetic marks (from compartment A to B or B to A) at the boundary. Additionally, they find that the P-TADs are needed to retain enhancer-promoter and promoter-promoter interactions.</p>
<p>Overall, the study is well-executed, and the evidence found provides interesting insights into genome folding and interpretations of conflicting results on the role of cohesin on TAD formation.</p>
<p>To strengthen their claims, the authors should compare their de-novo prediction approach to their data-driven predictions at the single cell level.</p>
