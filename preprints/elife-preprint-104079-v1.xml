<title>Abstract</title><p>It is now recognized that mitochondria play a crucial role in tumorigenesis, however, it has become clear that tumor metabolism varies significantly between cancer types. The failure of recent clinical trials attempting to directly target tumor respiration with inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation has highlighted the critical need for additional studies comprehensively assessing mitochondrial bioenergetics. Therefore, we systematically assessed the bulk tumor and mitochondrial metabolic phenotype between murine HER2-driven mammary cancer tumors and paired benign mammary tissue. Transcriptomic and proteomic profiling revealed that HER2-driven mammary tumors are characterized by a downregulation of mitochondrial genes/proteins compared to benign mammary tissue, including a general downregulation of OXPHOS subunits comprising Complexes I-IV. Despite this observation, mitochondrial respiration supported by both carbohydrate-derived substrates (pyruvate) and lipids (palmitoyl-carnitine) was several-fold higher in HER2-driven tumors which persisted regardless of normalization method (i.e. wet weight, total protein content and when corrected for mitochondrial content). This upregulated respiratory capacity could not be explained by OXPHOS uncoupling; however, several subunits/regulators of Complex V function were not downregulated in the tumors, suggesting possible compensatory effects may contribute to high respiratory rates. Furthermore, tumor mitochondria displayed a smaller and more punctate morphology, aligning with a general reduction in mitochondrial fusion and increase in mitochondrial fission markers, which could contribute to improved OXPHOS efficiency. Together, this data highlights that the typical correlation of mitochondrial content and respiratory capacity may not apply to all tumor types and implicates the activation of mitochondrial respiration supporting tumorigenesis in this model.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The field of cancer metabolism has rapidly evolved in the last decade. A specific focus of many researchers has been on understanding the role of mitochondria in tumorigenesis with the goal to potentially target aspects of mitochondrial metabolism to reduce proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. It was initially hypothesized that a universal characteristic of cancer cells was dysfunctional oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), as proposed by Otto Warburg in the 1920s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. This theory spurred interest in studying mitochondria in various cancers, highlighting the diverse mitochondrial phenotypes in this context. While instrumental for OXPHOS, mitochondria are now recognized for their multifaceted roles in regulating cellular homeostasis, including supporting macromolecule biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, maintaining redox balance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> and generating metabolites that regulate gene transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Given their pleiotropic effects within the cell, there is a growing recognition that mitochondria play an essential role in cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, and an appreciation that interrogating mitochondrial bioenergetics in diverse cancers may identify novel therapeutic strategies.</p>
<p>Reductions in the content/activity of mitochondrial enzymes within the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and electron transport chain (ETC) impairs mitochondrial respiratory capacity and coincides with activating transcriptional programs driving tumorigenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Indeed, inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (Complex II) in osteosarcoma cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, and renal cell carcinoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> enhances cancer growth despite OXPHOS inhibition. Furthermore, in colorectal cancer, age-related Complex I deficiency coincides with reduced respiratory capacity but enhanced serine synthesis and subsequent growth rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Despite this evidence suggesting that disruptions in mitochondrial bioenergetics contribute to tumor progression, several elegant studies using genetic and pharmacological approaches have solidified that a functional ETC is required for cancer cell growth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the use of whole-genome sequencing specifically interrogating mtDNA phenotypes across several human cancers has revealed that loss of function mutations in mtDNA genes are often under negative selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, suggesting the maintenance of mitochondrial function may support tumorigenesis in some cancers and impairments in mitochondrial metabolism are not a ubiquitous finding. However, mitochondrial content represents one dimension of bioenergetic regulation, and may not fully reflect mitochondrial function <italic>in vivo</italic> where substrate delivery/sensitivity and mitochondrial coupling can be altered independently of mitochondrial content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Therefore, a comprehensive assessment of mitochondrial function, particularly in the context of the mitochondrial proteome, is essential to provide deeper insights into the bioenergetic phenotypes observed in different cancers.</p>
<p>Within this framework, there has been considerable interest in investigating mitochondrial bioenergetics and dynamics in breast cancer subtypes due to the limited therapeutic options for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and therapeutic resistance in breast cancers driven by estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR) and human epidermal growth factor (HER2) receptor amplification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Indeed, increases in mitochondrial respiration or “OXPHOS reliance” is associated with poor outcomes in treatment naïve TNBC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, metastatic ER+ tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, and HER2-driven breast cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. While inhibiting OXPHOS in this context<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> (i.e. with Complex I inhibitor IACS-010759) has shown some pre-clinical success, systemic toxicity has prevented the translation of this strategy to the clinic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Furthermore, it is unclear whether increases in mitochondrial respiration arise from increases in mitochondrial content or intrinsic enhancements in mitochondrial function (i.e. coupling efficiency, substrate delivery/sensitivity) – information that is critical to develop successful mitochondrial-targeted therapies with a wider therapeutic window. Thus, in the current study, we comprehensively assessed the bulk tumor and mitochondrial phenotype between murine HER2-driven mammary cancer tumors and benign mammary tissue in the context of the underlying transcriptome and proteome. Respiratory capacity supported by both pyruvate and lipids was enhanced in HER2-driven tumors even when corrected for mitochondrial content, suggesting intrinsic bioenergetic adaptations may exist to maintain OXPHOS during tumorigenesis in this model.</p>

<title>Mammary tumors from MMTV/neu<sup>ndl</sup>-YD5 mice display canonical HER2 pathway activation</title>
<p>Cell lines are commonly used to study isolated mechanisms driving tumorigenesis, however, they neglect the variety of cell types in the tissue of origin and the influence of the tumor microenvironment, which is a key regulator of cancer growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. To this end, we have utilized tumor and benign mammary tissues from MMTV/neu<sup>ndl</sup>-YD5 transgenic mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> to investigate HER2-driven tumor biology (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1A</xref>). Signaling events linked to HER2 activation rely on the autophosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> and MMTV/neu<sup>ndl</sup>-YD5 mice possess an add-back mutation at the Y1226/7 (YD) site, activating downstream signaling events linked to SHC/GRB2 with similar transforming potential as the wild-type protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1B</xref>). While the proximal signaling events linked to HER2 activation in this model have been described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, to validate our bulk tissue-based model, we assessed the mRNA (transcriptomics) and protein (quantitative label-free proteomics and western blotting) expression of canonical HER2 pathway members (RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways) that are well-characterized in various HER2-overexpressing mammary cancer cell lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. <italic>Her2</italic> transcript levels were increased ∼175-fold (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1C</xref>) and transcripts belonging to the Ras/MAPK (<italic>Hras, Mapk1, Mapk3</italic>) and PI3K/AKT/mTOR (<italic>Pik3cg, Pik3c2a, Pik3c2b, Pikrcg, Pik3c3, Akt3</italic>) pathways were also upregulated in the tumors compared to the benign mammary tissue (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1D</xref>). At the protein level, HER2 was readily detectable in mammary tumors by quantitative label-free proteomics but undetectable in paired benign tissues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1E</xref>) suggesting enhanced HER2 transcription also manifests as an increase in receptor content in the tumors. Downstream of HER2 activation, the total protein content of p38 MAPK, ERK1/2 and eEF2 were significantly increased in tumors compared to benign tissue detected by western blot (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1F,G</xref>). When normalized to total protein, p38 MAPK and eEF2 phosphorylation were not higher in tumors due to proportional increases in total protein abundance, while in contrast, phosphorylated ERK1/2 and mTOR were significantly upregulated suggesting both Ras/MAPK and the PI3k/AKT/mTOR pathways were activated in tumors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S-Fig. 1</xref>). Overall, these data demonstrate that mammary tumors display classical hallmarks of HER2-driven cancer cell signaling, allowing for the subsequent investigation of HER2-driven tumor biology and metabolism in this model.</p>

<title>Assessment of the HER2-driven mammary tumor transcriptome</title>
<p>To understand the biology and metabolism of HER2-driven mammary tumors, we assessed their transcriptomes using RNA sequencing. Principal component analysis (PCA) using the entire gene expression profile showed distinct separation between groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2A</xref>). Visualizing all differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using a volcano plot (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2B</xref>) and the top 3000 DEGs using a heatmap (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2C</xref>) revealed several differentially upregulated and downregulated genes between groups where genes involved in MAPK– and AKT-linked signaling, ECM remodelling and cellular stress responses <italic>(Etv1, Dusp6, Papln, Ier3</italic>) were among the most upregulated genes in the tumors and genes involved in lipid metabolism (<italic>Dgat2, Lipe, Cd36</italic>) were among the most downregulated. Enrichment analysis of the top 3000 upregulated DEGs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2D</xref>) identified pathways characteristic of HER2-driven signaling (e.g. tyrosine kinase signaling, GTPase signaling) and gene ontology (GO) analysis identified processes indicative of active transcription, translation, and protein turnover characteristic of a rapidly proliferating tissue (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2E</xref>). Interestingly, enrichment analysis of the top 3000 downregulated genes in the tumors consistently identified that mitochondrial metabolism, and in particular components of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system were downregulated in tumors compared to benign mammary tissue (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2F,G</xref>). Altogether, these data further support that this whole tissue model aligns with canonical HER2-driven cell signaling events and highlights that HER2-driven tumors are characterized by reductions in mitochondrial gene expression.</p>

<title>Assessment of HER2-driven mammary tumor proteome</title>
<p>We further validated our transcriptomic findings at the protein level using label-free quantitative proteomics and detected 2589 proteins in the benign mammary tissue and 2448 proteins in the HER2-driven tumors; 1848 of which were found in both groups (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3A</xref>). This 143 initial analysis revealed 741 and 600 uniquely expressed (i.e. only detected in one tissue) proteins in benign mammary tissue and tumors respectively (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S-Fig. 2A</xref>). Interestingly, OXPHOS and aerobic respiration proteins were identified among the top pathways in benign tissue, but not in tumors (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S-Fig. 2B-G</xref>), further supporting the notion of downregulated mitochondrial content within tumors. Reflecting the PCA for the transcriptomic data, analysis of all overlapping proteins between benign and tumor samples revealed distinct separation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3B</xref>). Of the 1848 proteins found in both the tumors and benign tissue, 420 were significantly different (p-adj. &lt;0.1, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A,C,D</xref>). However, the majority of the differentially expressed proteins were downregulated (n=411) in tumors compared to benign mammary tissue. Upregulated proteins (n=9) included those involved in canonical HER2 signaling, protein synthesis and processing, and glycolytic metabolism (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">S-Table 1</xref>). Supporting transcriptomic data, which indicated a reduction in mitochondrial content and OXPHOS, enrichment analysis revealed that 8 of the top 10 downregulated pathways (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>) and all top 10 downregulated GO (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>) were related to mitochondrial biogenesis and/or metabolism, and OXPHOS was identified in the top 10 downregulated KEGG pathways (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3G</xref>). Together, these proteomic data support our transcriptomic analysis suggesting HER2-driven tumors are characterized by lower mitochondrial content than benign mammary tissue.</p>

<p>While mitochondrial biogenesis is a coordinated process simultaneously upregulating several mitochondrial proteins, the total mitochondrial transcriptome/proteome does not necessarily change proportionally with OXPHOS complex and/or TCA cycle/dehydrogenase content, especially in cancerous tissues. Indeed, reductions in the content of specific respiratory complexes seem to be cancer specific, which can have functional repercussions on mitochondrial respiration rates and/or efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Within this context, we assessed the gene expression profile of all OXPHOS complex subunits between groups, which revealed relatively ubiquitous reductions in transcript count (transcripts per million) across subunits of Complexes I-IV (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D-H</xref>). Interestingly, while the majority of Complex V subunits were also downregulated, this complex had the highest proportion of subunits, displaying no differences between groups (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5D,I</xref>). The TCA cycle transcriptome also reflected a general downregulation of transcript abundance, apart from alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (<italic>Ogdhl</italic>) and succinyl-CoA synthetase GDP forming subunit-β (<italic>Suclg2</italic>), which had a higher transcript abundance in some tumor samples (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5J</xref>).

<title>Mitochondrial respiratory capacity is increased in HER2-driven mammary tumors</title>
<p>Considering our transcriptomic and proteomic data strongly suggest HER2-driven mammary tumors display reductions in mitochondrial content, we next assessed whether this would manifest as a reduction in respiratory capacity by measuring mitochondrial respiratory flux rates. In permeabilized tumors and benign mammary tissue, we assessed basal/endogenous respiration and respiration with saturating carbohydrate (pyruvate/malate) and lipid (palmitoyl-carnitine) substrates. For each protocol, several biological replicates (individual tumors) were utilized, spanning a continuum of whole tumor wet weights/volumes (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S-Fig. 5A,B</xref>). Since no strong correlations were found between tumor wet weight or volume and basal or maximal respiration supported by carbohydrate-or lipid-linked substrates (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S-Fig. 5C-J</xref>), all data points were pooled. When normalizing respiration to tissue wet weight (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>), tumors displayed significantly higher basal/endogenous respiration and higher respiration with subsequent additions of pyruvate, malate (CI-linked respiration), ADP (State III respiration), glutamate (CI-linked respiration also supported by alpha-ketoglutarate anaplerosis), and succinate (to maximize CII-linked respiration) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6B</xref>). Equally, tumors displayed significantly higher respiration rates supported by lipids (palmitoyl-carnitine, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6C</xref>), suggesting that HER2-driven tumors are capable of relying on both substrate sources, perhaps to maximize aerobic metabolism. This initial analysis of respiratory rates was normalized to tissue wet weight, which can be influenced by differences in total and mitochondrial protein content in a given tissue volume. To address this, we first normalized respiratory flux rates to total cellular protein (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6D,E</xref>), which minimizes differences in factors such as tissue density and hydration that are not directly contributing to mitochondrial oxygen consumption. The third normalization method employed was normalizing respiratory flux to a mitochondrial enrichment factor (MEF) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6F,G</xref>) which is the ratio of mitochondrial proteins to the underlying total proteome (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S-Fig. 3A,B</xref>). This approach controls for differences in mitochondrial content between tissues to determine whether increases in respiration are due to increases in mitochondrial content or intrinsic changes in mitochondrial function. Interestingly, the fundamental observation of increased respiratory flux rates in tumors compared to benign tissues was conserved independent of the normalization method, suggesting that HER2-driven mammary tumors are characterized by high respiratory flux rates independent of total cellular protein or reduced mitochondrial protein content. While greater intrinsic OXPHOS was observed with all substrates, lipid supported respiration was stimulated to a greater extent in the tumors, resulting in comparable carbohydrate (pyruvate, malate, ADP) and lipid (palmitoyl-carnitine, malate, ADP) supported respiration (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7A</xref>). This effect occurred despite many of the genes and proteins involved in lipid metabolism at the plasma membrane and in the cytosol (e.g. <italic>Acsl1, Adipoq, Dgat1/2, Lipe, Fabp4, Cd36, Pparg</italic>) and mitochondria (<italic>e.g. Etfa, Etfb, Etfdh, Hadh, Hadhb, Cpt1b, Cpt2</italic>) being downregulated in tumors compared to benign mammary tissue (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7B-E</xref>). The intrinsic activation of respiration was not a ubiquitous finding for all processes linked to OXPHOS, as reactive oxygen species (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S-Fig. 6A</xref>) emission rates were higher in tumors compared to benign tissue when normalized to wet weight (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S-Fig. 6B</xref>), lower when normalized to total protein (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S-Fig. 6C</xref>) and not different when normalized to mitochondrial content (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S-Fig. 6D</xref>).</p>

<title>High respiratory flux rates cannot be explained by OXPHOS uncoupling</title>
<p>Typically, respiratory capacity correlates with mitochondrial content in fully differentiated tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. However, given the apparent discrepancy between mitochondrial/OXPHOS protein content and respiratory flux rates in HER2-driven tumors, we investigated alternative explanations for this observation. One possible explanation for the observed enhanced respiratory rates could be due to the uncoupling of OXPHOS from ATP synthesis, especially when ROS emission is not proportional to respiratory flux. To address this possibility, we utilized oligomycin (OMY) to inhibit the F0 subunit of ATP synthase (Complex V) and examine its inhibitory potency between groups (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7F</xref>). While OMY inhibited respiration in benign mammary tissue by ∼55%, respiration in tumors was inhibited by ∼80% (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7G</xref>). Subsequent additions of antimycin A (AMA) to inhibit Complex III and rotenone (ROT) to inhibit Complex I, fully inhibited respiration in both tissues (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7G</xref>). Since respiration was inhibited to a greater extent in the tumors in response to OMY, this protocol strongly suggests that HER2-driven tumor mitochondria are highly coupled.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of the current study was to investigate the metabolic characteristics of a mouse model of HER2-driven mammary cancer compared to benign mammary tissue. Specifically, we focused on the bioenergetic adaptations that have occurred with HER2-driven tumorigenesis both with respect to mitochondrial function (respiration and ROS) and mitochondrial content (total mitochondrial proteome and OXPHOS complexes). This investigation revealed several findings: 1) HER2-driven mammary tumors display high respiratory rates compared to benign mammary tissue, 2) tumors are capable of oxidizing lipids and pyruvate to a similar extent despite the downregulation of several genes involved in lipid catabolism, and 3) high tumor respiratory rates cannot be explained by higher mitochondrial content. These data highlight that HER2-driven mammary tumors have the capacity to maintain high OXPHOS rates despite lower mitochondrial content, challenging the typical bioenergetic relationship in fully differentiated tissues.</p>

<title>Relationship between mitochondrial content and function in breast cancer</title>
<p>Studies simultaneously assessing mitochondrial content and mitochondrial respiration and the contribution of these factors to breast cancer malignant transformation are scarce. While reductions in ETC subunit content/activity have been described in mitochondria isolated from human mammary carcinoma cultures compared to mammary epithelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, it has been assumed that a reduction in ETC subunit content would manifest as a reduction in respiratory capacity. However, this is at odds with several reports that classify breast cancer cells as OXPHOS reliant due to increases in mitochondrial respiration correlating with advanced disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Indeed, across many cancers it is generally assumed that mitochondrial content and respiratory function increase or decrease concomitantly, however, recent work has challenged this dogma, demonstrating that high rates of respiration normalized to tissue weight can be negated when corrected for mitochondrial mass,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> revealing intrinsic alterations in cancer cell bioenergetics. In the current study, utilizing this same approach to control for differences in mitochondrial content, we found that respiratory capacity supported by pyruvate and lipids in HER2-driven mammary tumors was significantly higher (∼2-4 fold) compared to benign mammary tissue despite lower mitochondrial enrichment (total mitochondrial proteome) and lower abundance of several respiratory complex subunits, suggesting intrinsic changes in mitochondrial function/efficiency may explain the acquisition of increased mitochondrial respiratory capacity during HER2-driven tumorigenesis. Several mechanisms could enhance respiration in a mitochondrial-content independent manner, including increased coupling of electron transfer to ATP synthesis (coupling efficiency), changes in the delivery of substrates across the mitochondrial membranes, intrinsic changes in the activity of ETC complexes and/or ATP synthase, and alterations in mitochondrial morphology/dynamics.</p>

<title>Coupling Efficiency</title>
<p>Several studies have suggested that a key function of mitochondrial respiration in cancer cells is the regeneration of NAD<sup>+</sup>, FAD and ubiquinone to provide the necessary metabolites for biomass production, rather than ATP synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. From a bioenergetic perspective, this could be achieved by inducing uncoupled respiration, which could manifest in an apparent increase in intrinsic mitochondrial respiration, given that measures of respiratory flux quantify oxygen consumption rather than ATP synthesis. However, in the present study the Complex V inhibitor oligomycin inhibited respiration to a greater extent in HER2-driven tumors, suggesting that uncoupling cannot explain the enhanced respiration rates observed, and if anything, tumors are more coupled than benign mammary tissue. This interpretation aligns with work in MCF7 cells where mitochondrial ATP represents the majority of cellular ATP production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> suggesting the ATP synthetic function of OXPHOS in breast cancer is likely intact. Indeed, enhanced mitochondrial ATP provision and OXPHOS-dependent biomass expansion are not mutually exclusive processes and increased coupled respiration would satisfy both the bioenergetic and biosynthetic requirements of rapid cell proliferation during tumorigenesis.</p>

<title>Substrate Delivery and Preference</title>
<p>Recent work has highlighted the dependency of HER2+ tumor cells on both lipid (long chain fatty acids) and carbohydrate-derived (pyruvate) substrate for optimal proliferative capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. In addition to pyruvate, HER2-driven tumors may be particularly poised to utilize lipids, given the proximity of cancer cells to adipocytes in the mammary tumor microenvironment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, which has spurred interest in inhibiting lipid use/fat oxidation as an adjunct therapy in HER2-driven cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Indeed, the use of endogenous substrate may be preferred as solid tumors expand and factors such as increased interstitial fluid pressure and extracellular matrix remodelling impact tumor vessel quality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, possibly limiting exogenous substrate delivery. However, at the transcript and protein level, enzymes involved in mitochondrial lipid uptake (CPT1, CPT2) and pyruvate uptake (MPC) were largely downregulated compared to benign tissue which would limit rather than enhance mitochondrial substrate delivery. Despite this lower abundance of enzymes supporting mitochondrial substrate delivery, mitochondrial respiration supported by pyruvate and lipids were significantly higher in tumors. Considering lipid and carbohydrate oxidation converge within the mitochondrial matrix, both providing acetyl-CoA to the TCA cycle, it is possible that enhanced OXPHOS efficiency lies at a distal site, implicating intrinsic OXPHOS adaptations as a possible explanation for enhanced respiration in HER2-driven tumors.</p>

<title>Intrinsic OXPHOS Adaptations</title>
<p>Several cancers are characterized by the altered expression of individual ETC subunits and/or ATP synthase which can have functional repercussions on respiratory function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. In the current study, despite a consistent downregulation of subunits comprising Complexes I-IV in HER2-driven tumors, a subset of Complex V genes were not downregulated (specifically two subunits of the c-ring of F0 domain (<italic>Atp5g1, Atp5g2</italic>), two subunits of the F6 domain stalk connecting the F0 and F1 domains (<italic>Atp5j1, Atp5j2</italic>), and regulatory proteins ATPase inhibitory factor 1 (<italic>Atpif1</italic>) and distal membrane assembly component 2 (<italic>Dmac2l</italic>)). This shift essentially increases the ratio of ATP synthase/ETC and raises the possibility that a maintenance of these subunits may enhance OXPHOS rates in the face of downregulated CI-IV subunit content since maximal coupled respiration is usually limited by proton flux through ATP synthase. Indeed, despite mtDNA lesions in proton pumping complexes (I, III and IV) being common in many cancers, presumably reducing the content/function of these complexes, ATP synthase mutations are less common, suggesting positive selection may exist to maintain coupled respiration and ATP production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Thus, while speculative, it is possible that higher respiration rates in HER2-driven tumors may partially reflect maintained ATP synthase content/function. Alternatively, while bioenergetic efficiency is typically related to intrinsic changes in OXPHOS stoichiometry, mitochondrial morphology can indirectly affect efficiency. We observed smaller, punctate mitochondria in HER2-driven mammary tumors when visualized by TEM, generally aligning with reductions in mitochondrial fusion and increases in mitochondrial fission-related targets. While the direct relationship between mitochondrial morphology and bioenergetics remains contentious, evidence suggests smaller mitochondria (due to enhanced fission or reduced fusion) may be associated with enhanced bioenergetics. Smaller mitochondria tend to have a higher surface-area-to-volume ratio which has been correlated with upregulated OXPHOS in the liver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, and low rates of respiration is associated with the inhibition of mitochondrial fission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Furthermore, rare genetic mitochondrial diseases are often characterized by hyper-fused mitochondria which is associated with OXPHOS limitations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>.

Depending on the number of tumors present (typically 1-5), tumors were allocated for mitochondrial function (placed fresh in BIOPS preservation buffer), transmission electron microscopy (fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde/1% paraformaldehyde) or snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for further analysis (western blotting, transcriptomics, quantitative label-free proteomics) immediately after whole tumor wet weight was recorded. Paired mammary tissue with no visible tumors, furthest from the site of tumor excision (i.e. if tumors localized in cervical region benign tissue was harvested from inguinal region) were used as an internal comparison, denoted as benign mammary tissue.</p>

<p>Mitochondrial respiration experiments were performed using the Oroboros Oxygraph-2k systems at 37°C in MiR05 respiration buffer (0.5 mM EGTA, 3 mM MgCl2·H2O, 60 mM potassium lactobionate, 10 mM KH2PO4, 20 mM HEPES, 110 mM sucrose, 20 mM taurine, and 1 g/L fatty acid free BSA; pH 7.1) with constant stirring at room air saturation (starting at 180 µM O2). Two-5 mg of permeabilized tumor tissue or 15-20 mg of permeabilized (both permeabilized with 20 µg/µL saponin) mammary tissue were used per 2 mL chamber and each protocol was conducted as at least two technical replicates (duplicate) per tumor or benign sample. Prior to the addition of substrates for any protocol, endogenous (basal) respiration was assessed with no substrates added. Complex I and Complex II supported respiration was assessed with the addition of 5 mM pyruvate and 2 mM malate, 5 mM ADP, 10 mM glutamate and 10 mM succinate. In a subset of these experiments, subsequent additions of oligomycin (OMY, 1 µM), antimycin A (AMA, 2.5 µM) and rotenone (ROT, 1 µM) were added to assess OXPHOS coupling.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Frangos et al. used a transcriptomic and proteomic approach to characterise changes in HER2-driven mammary tumours compared to healthy mammary tissue in mice. They observed that mitochondrial genes, including OXPHOS regulators, were among the most down-regulated genes and proteins in their datasets. Surprisingly, these were associated with higher mitochondrial respiration, in response to a variety of carbon sources. In addition, there seems to be a reduction in mitochondrial fusion and an increase in fission in tumours compared to healthy tissues.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The data are clearly presented and described.</p>
<p>The author reported very similar trends in proteomic and transcriptomic data. Such approaches are essential to have a better understanding of the changes in cancer cell metabolism associated with tumourigenesis</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This study, despite being a useful resource (assuming all the data will be publicly available and not only upon request) is mainly descriptive and correlative and lacks mechanistic links.</p>
<p>It would be important to determine the cellular composition of the tumour and healthy tissue used. Do the changes described here apply to cancer cells only or do other cell types contribute to this?</p>
<p>Are the changes in metabolic gene expression a consequence of HER2 signalling activation? Ex-vivo experiments could be performed to perturb this pathway and determine cause-effects.</p>
<p>The data of fission/fusion seem quite preliminary and the gene/protein expression changes are not so clear cut to be a convincing explanation that this is the main reason for the increased mitochondria respiration in tumours.</p>

<p>Frangos et al present a set of studies aiming to determine mechanisms underlying initiation and tumour progression. Overall, this work provides some useful insights into the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction during the cellular transformation process. This body of work could be improved in several possible directions to establish more mechanistic connections.</p>
<p>(1) The interesting point of the paper: the contrast between suppressed ETC components and activated OXPHOS function is perplexing and should be resolved. It is still unclear if activated mitochondrial function triggers gene down-regulation vs compensatory functional changes (as the title suggests). Have the authors considered reversing the HER2-derived signals e.g. with PI3K-AKT-MTOR or ERK inhibitors to potentially separate the expression vs. functional phenotypes? The root of the OXPHOS component down-regulation should also be traced further, e.g. by probing into levels of core mitochondrial biogenesis factors. Are transcript levels of factors encoded by mtDNA also decreased?</p>
<p>(2) The second interesting aspect of this study is the implication of mitochondrial activation in tumours, despite the downregulation of expression signatures, suggestive of a positive role for mitochondria in this tumour model. To address if this is correlative or causal, have the authors considered testing an OXPHOS inhibitor for suppression of tumorigenesis?</p>
<p>(3) A number of issues concerning animal/ tumour variability and further pathway dissection could be explored with in vitro approaches. Have the authors considered deriving tumour-derived cell cultures, which could enable further confirmations, mechanistic drug studies and additional imaging approaches? Culture systems would allow alternative assessment of mitochondrial function such as Seahorse or flow cytometry (mitochondrial potential and ROS levels).</p>
<p>(4) The study could be greatly improved with further confirmatory studies, eg immunoblotting for mitochondrial components with parallel blots for phospho-signalling in the same samples. It would be interesting if trends could be maintained in tumour-derived cell cultures. It is notable that OXPHOS protein/transcript changes are more consistent (Figure 5, Supplementary Figure 4) than mitochondrial dynamics /mitophagy factors (Figure 8). Core regulatory factors in these pathways should be confirmed by conventional immunoblotting.</p>
