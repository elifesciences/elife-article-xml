<title>Abstract</title><p>Pathogenic and nonpathogenic mycobacteria secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) under various conditions. EVs produced by <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) have raised significant interest for their potential in cell communication, nutrient acquisition, and immune evasion. However, the relevance of vesicle secretion during tuberculosis infection remains unknown due to the limited understanding of mycobacterial vesicle biogenesis. We have previously shown that a transposon mutant in the LCP-related gene <italic>virR</italic> (<italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>) manifested a strong attenuated phenotype during experimental macrophage and murine infections, concomitant to enhanced vesicle release. In this study, we aimed to understand the role of VirR in the vesicle production process in <italic>Mtb</italic>. We employ genetic, transcriptional, proteomics, ultrastructural and biochemical methods to investigate the underlying processes explaining the enhanced vesiculogenesis phenomenon observed in the <italic>virR</italic> mutant. Our results establish that VirR is critical to sustain proper cell permeability via regulation of cell envelope remodeling possibly through the interaction with similar cell envelope proteins, which control the link between peptidoglycan and arabinogalactan. These findings advance our understanding of mycobacterial extracellular vesicle biogenesis and suggest that these set of proteins could be attractive targets for therapeutic intervention.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) is one of the most successful human pathogens with the capacity to persist within the host establishing long-lasting infections. <italic>Mtb</italic> possesses multiple highly evolved mechanisms to manipulate host cellular machinery and evade the host immune system. Similar to other intracellular pathogens, <italic>Mtb</italic> releases proteins and lipids, that interfere with host cellular processes, via canonical or specialized secretion systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Majlessi et al., 2015</xref>). How mycobacteria confined within phagosomes delivers virulence factors to other cellular compartments and/or into the extracellular milieu to affect the physiology of neighboring cells is currently a matter of investigation. Understanding the physiology of this phenomenon during the infection process might be critical to develop alternative therapies against tuberculosis (TB).</p>
<p>Like most forms of life, <italic>Mtb</italic> uses an alternative antigen release process based on extracellular vesicles (EVs) (R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Prados-Rosales et al., 2011</xref>). Mycobacterial EVs (MEVs) are membrane walled spheres of 60-300 nm in diameter, released by live bacteria <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. MEVs contain iron scavenging molecules, immunologically active complex lipids and lipoproteins, and classical virulence factors such as the <italic>Mycobacterium ulcerans</italic> toxin mycolactone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Marsollier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Prados-Rosales et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">R Prados-Rosales et al., 2011</xref>). Several studies have clearly established a role of MEVs in immunomodulation and shown that MEVs deliver factors that impair macrophage effector functions, inhibit T cell activation, and modify the response of host cells to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Athman et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Prados-Rosales et al., 2014b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">2014a</xref>; R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Prados-Rosales et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Rath et al., 2013</xref>). MEVs have also shown potential as biomarkers of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Schirmer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Ziegenbalg et al., 2013</xref>). Although the importance of MEVs has been recognized, hardly anything is known regarding both how such vesicles are exported across the mycobacterial cell wall and the molecular mechanisms underlying vesicle formation in mycobacteria. To date, several modulators of MEVs have been described. Our group identified two conditions leading to stimulation of vesicle production, namely: iron starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Prados-Rosales et al., 2014b</xref>) and the deletion of <italic>virR</italic> (Rv0431, <underline>v</underline>esiculogenesis and immune response <underline>R</underline>egulator) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Rath et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, it was shown that the Pst/SenX3-RegX3 signal transduction system regulates MEVs production independent from VirR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">White et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting an alternative mechanism of vesicle production. We have recently demonstrated that both iron starvation and deletion of VirR in <italic>Mtb</italic>, two hypervesiculating conditions, trigger the induction of the isoniazid-induced gene operon <italic>iniBAC</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gupta et al., 2023</xref>). We determined that both IniA and IniC are dynamin-like proteins (DLP) presumably assisting MEV release through the fusion of the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gupta et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Understanding how defects in VirR lead to hypervesiculation through DLPs is important to provide mechanistic explanation for the vesiculation process in mycobacteria.</p>
<p>Several lines of evidence support the notion that VirR might be involved in maintaining cell wall integrity: (i) First, sequence analysis of the VirR protein indicates that it contains a conserved LytR_C domain (<bold>Fig S1</bold>), which is usually found in combination with another domain named LytR-Cps2A-Psr (LCP), and proteins carrying both domains have been associated with the remodeling of the cell wall in Gram-positive bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hubscher et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>Mtb</italic> has six genes encoding for LCP proteins, three with both LCP and LytR_C domains (Rv3267, Rv3484 and Rv0822), two with a solo LytR_C domain (VirR and Rv2700) and one protein with a solo LCP domain (Rv3840) (<bold>Fig S1</bold>). The LCP family includes enzymes that transfer glycopolymers from membrane-linked precursors to peptidoglycan (PG) or cell envelope proteins and are central to cell envelope integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kawai et al., 2011</xref>). In mycobacteria its was demonstrated that some members of the (LCP) family of proteins are responsible for the linkage between arabinogalactan (AG) and PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Grzegorzewicz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Harrison et al., 2016</xref>). Rv3267, Rv3484 and Rv0822 appear to have overlapping functions in cell wall assembly, Rv3267 being the primary ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Grzegorzewicz et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, while knocking down the gene encoding for the main AG-PG ligase (cg0847, <italic>lcpA</italic>) in <italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum</italic> leads to the release of outer membrane material to the extracellular medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Baumgart et al., 2016</xref>), this phenotype is not observed in any knockout strain in the <italic>Mtb</italic> orthologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Grzegorzewicz et al., 2016</xref>), probably reflecting the ability of the mutants to negatively regulate the biosynthesis of cell wall constituents in response to a decrease in ligase activity; (ii) Second, we and others have determined the increased susceptibility of the transposon <italic>virR</italic> mutant (<italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>) with respect to the WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ballister et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Rath et al., 2013</xref>), and the mutant in the <italic>virR</italic> ortholog, Rv2700 (cell envelope integrity, <italic>cei</italic>) to cell wall targeting drugs such as meropenem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ballister et al., 2019</xref>). Based on these results, we hypothesize that LytR_C solo domain proteins including VirR and Cei Rv2700 have critical roles in the maintenance of cell wall homeostasis and their absence provokes cell wall alterations leading to enhanced vesiculation.</p>
<p>In this work we show that the absence of VirR leads to ultrastructural changes in the cell envelope as observed by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). These changes are compatible with enhanced permeability and an enlargement of the PG layer, as measured by high resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM). We demonstrate that VirR interacts with canonical LCP proteins and propose a model for such interaction. These results indicate that VirR is a central scaffold at the cell envelope remodeling process assisting the PG-AG linking process and that this function is important for vesicle production in <italic>Mtb</italic>.</p>

<title>High EV production linked to the lack of VirR is associated with an altered cell envelope in <italic>Mtb</italic> in the absence of cell lysis</title>
<p>While Gram-negative bacteria can release outer membrane vesicles directly into the extracellular environment from their outermost compartment, Gram-positive bacteria and mycobacteria have thick cell envelopes surrounding the cytoplasmic membrane that acts as a permeability barrier. The mycobacterial cell envelope is composed of PG covalently linked to AG, which in turn is decorated with exceptionally long-chain mycolic acids (MA). These MA, together with intercalating glycolipids, form the unique mycobacterial outer membrane (OM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kalscheuer et al., 2019</xref>). Previous analysis of mycobacterial vesicle associated lipids showed predominantly polar lipids, consistent with the cytoplasmic membrane being the likely origin of the vesicles (R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Prados-Rosales et al., 2011</xref>). This is also true in EV produced by Fe-limited <italic>Mtb</italic> whose lipid content consists mainly of polar lipids and the lipidic siderophore, mycobactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Prados-Rosales et al., 2014b</xref>). Given that these vesicles must traffic from their point of origin in the plasma membrane through the cell envelope, we hypothesized that local remodeling of the cell envelope is necessary for EV release, and that this process may be exacerbated in a <italic>virR</italic> mutant (<italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>). To test this, we examined the cell envelope structure of <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> grown in minimal medium (MM), as well as wild type (WT) and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>complemented (<italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-C) strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Rath et al., 2013</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref></bold>). Using cryo-EM on whole cells, which allows the study of mycobacterial cell surface-associated compartments in a close-to-native state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sani et al., 2010</xref>), we could easily discern three layers comprising the mycobacterial cell envelope: i) the outer membrane (OM); ii) an intermediate layer composed of two sublayers (L1 and L2, previously assigned to the mycolate-PG-AG (mAGP) network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sani et al., 2010</xref>)); and iii) the cytoplasmic membrane (CM) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref></bold>). We observed a significant increase in the thickness of the overall cell envelope (OM-CM) in the <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> strain compared to the WT. This difference was largely explained by the expansion of the CM-L1 layer, which appeared also more granulated, suggesting cell wall alterations closer to the cell membrane and indicating aberrant production of either AG, PG or both. Complementation with a functional copy of <italic>virR</italic> restored normal cell envelope structure (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A-C</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>In Gram-negative bacteria increased vesiculation has been observed in conditions associated with either loss or maintenance of periplasm integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">McMillan and Kuehn, 2021</xref>). Moreover, a novel mechanism of vesicle production common to both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria has recently been described, in which a cell explosion phenomenon driven by bacteriophages leads to the formation of EVs in culture when bacteria are under genotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Nagakubo et al., 2021</xref>). Consequently, we tested whether the enhanced vesiculation described in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Rath et al., 2013</xref>) could be linked to cell lysis events. To do this, we analyzed the presence of cytoplasmic IdeR, a transcription factor which is not present in EVs and is not detected in secreted proteins preparations, in culture supernatants of <italic>Mtb</italic> strains, assuming that its detection could be linked to a loss of envelope integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gupta et al., 2023</xref>). We first confirmed that the <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>strain manifested an enhanced vesiculation by measuring EVs using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) (<bold>Fig S2A</bold>). We did not detect differences in size distribution of isolated EVs between strains. The same supernatants and cell lysates were used to detect the presence of IdeR by immunoblot using a specific polyclonal antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pandey and Rodriguez, 2014</xref>). As a control for normal release of an extracellular protein, we used a monoclonal antibody against Ag85b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Prados-Rosales et al., 2017</xref>). We could not detect IdeR in the supernatant of any of the strains, indicating that defects of <italic>virR</italic> do not lead to cell lysis (<bold>Fig S2B</bold>). Taken together, the observed changes in the cell envelope of high EV producing bacteria suggest that cell envelope alterations in response to lack of VirR and increased membrane vesicle biogenesis may be connected in <italic>Mtb</italic>.</p>

<title>The absence of LytR_C solo domain proteins in <italic>Mtb</italic> leads to enhanced cell envelope permeability concomitant to hypervesiculation</title>
<p>The collective cryoEM observations that indicated an enlargement of the compartment next to the cell membrane may be linked to a more permeable cell envelope. Supporting this notion is the recent finding that <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> or the mutant in the <italic>virR</italic> ortholog <italic>cei</italic> (Rv2700) manifest an enhanced uptake of ethidium bromide (EtBr) relative to WT strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ballister et al., 2019</xref>). We could reproduce these results and add that <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-C strain restores the permeability levels of the WT strain (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref></bold>). This enhanced permeability was concomitant to an increased sensitivity to different antitubercular drugs, including meropenem and vancomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ballister et al., 2019</xref>). In agreement with these results, we could measure a significantly enhanced sensitivity of <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> to the PG-targeting drug vancomycin relative to WT and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-C strains (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref></bold>). Interestingly, the magnitude of the sensitivity to cell wall targeting drugs was either moderate (ethambutol) or absent (isoniazid) in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ballister et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, we observed enhanced incorporation of fluorescent D-amino acids (FDAAs) in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> relative to the WT strain in both MM and 7H9 media (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref></bold>), again suggesting increased permeability, altered PG turnover or both.</p>

<p>We then tested whether the enhanced permeability and vesiculation of <italic>virR</italic><sup>mut</sup> are also connected in an <italic>Mtb</italic> mutant lacking <italic>cei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ballister et al., 2019</xref>). To do this, we generated <italic>cei</italic> conditional mutants using the CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Rock et al., 2017</xref>). Further, we also generated <italic>virR</italic> CRISPRi conditional mutants to properly compare both strains (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref></bold>). When these strains were cultured in the presence of anhydrotetracycline (ATc) to induce the transcriptional silencing of target genes, we could measure enhanced vesiculation by analyzing vesicle concentration in the supernatant by NTA (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref></bold>), relative to strains cultured in the absence of ATc. Overall, these results validate the enhanced permeability phenotype of <italic>Mtb</italic> mutants in the LytR_C solo domain proteins VirR and Cei and establish that this subfamily of proteins participates in the regulation of vesicle production in <italic>Mtb</italic>. Moreover, the higher susceptibility to PG-cross-linking inhibitors in both mutants and the enhanced incorporation of FDAAs in the <italic>virR</italic> mutant strain suggests defects in PG remodeling.</p>

<title>Transcriptional profiling of <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> showcases systemic alterations in cell wall architecture and metabolism</title>
<p>To identify VirR-dependent mediators of vesicle production, we carried out a transcriptional profiling of <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> and compared it to that of WT strain. Previous efforts to define the transcriptional profile of <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> showed no significant differences compared to WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Rath et al., 2013</xref>). However, those experiments were carried out with bacteria grown in rich 7H9 medium, while here, we use a defined high-Fe minimal medium (MM), which is typically used for vesiculation experiments (R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Prados-Rosales et al., 2011</xref>). We extracted RNA from four independent cultures (average optical densities (OD) of 0.4 and 0.38 for WT and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>, respectively) one day before vesicle isolation and conducted RNA-seq. Of these, N=3 and N=4 libraries of WT and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> passed QC (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref></bold>). Principal component analysis (PCA) was then performed on the transcriptomic data, after filtering out lowly expressed genes, as well as genes containing outlier observations (N=4004 genes tested), and revealed significant differences between strains, aligned with the first principal component (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref></bold>, one-tailed Mann-Whitney test p=2.86e-02), explaining as much as 78.27% of total gene expression variance. We then conducted differential expression analysis to find 1663 genes differentially expressed in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> compared to WT (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref></bold>, Benjamini-Hochberg FDR&lt;0.05), which represent 41.5% of all genes tested.</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, we looked for gene ontologies enriched among these VirR-dependent genes, stratified by the direction of the effects (750 up-regulated, and 913 down-regulated in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> relative to WT). The enrichment analyses highlighted five main groups of biological processes and cell compartment ontologies that appeared altered in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> with respect to WT (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref></bold>). First, among genes that were expressed at lower levels in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>, we found enrichments terms related to several stress associated with the intra-phagosomal environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Schnappinger et al., 2003</xref>), such as response to hypoxia (FDR=1.14e-06), heat (FDR = 4.24 e-03) or oxidative stress (response to reactive oxygen species: FDR=9.00e-02), suggesting that responses to host-induced stress are compromised in the mutant, as it is also suggested by the enrichment of responses to host immune response (FDR=2.00 e-02). Furthermore, the mutant strain showed a reduction in transcripts related to the protein secretion term (FDR=2.51e-04), and, specifically, protein secretion by the type VII secretion system (FDR=1.15 e-04). Contributing to this enrichment, we found that both components of the key antigen-dimer ESAT-6/Cfp10, (Rv3875 and Rv3874, respectively), were significantly downregulated in the mutant strain (log2FC =-0.15, FDR=1.94 e-02 for Rv3875, and log2FC= -0.16, FDR = 2.25 e-02 for Rv3874).</p>
<p>Second, we found terms related to lipid metabolism and transport: (e.g. fatty acid biosynthetic process: FDR=4.92e-02; steroid metabolism, FDR=4.24e-03) enriched among downregulated genes in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>, suggesting that the regulation of both anabolic and catabolic pathways of lipids, key for bacterial survival and pathogenesis upon infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ghazaei, 2018</xref>), are partially VirR-dependent. However, not every lipid-related pathway appeared downregulated in the mutant strain, since PDIM biosynthesis genes were predominantly up-regulated in the mutant (DIM/DIP cell wall layer assembly enrichment FDR=3.60e-02, and phenolic phtiocerol biosynthetic process FDR=3.60e-02).</p>
<p>The third group of enrichments included terms related to global regulation of gene expression, mostly enriched among downregulated genes in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>(positive regulation of gene expression FDR=1.82 e-02, positive regulation of transcription, DNA templated FDR=4.92 e-02), suggesting a global alteration of the transcriptional landscape. The remaining two groups of ontologies included terms related to energy-production metabolism and post-transcriptional regulatory processes and compartments. Among these terms, we found evidence for an enrichment of genes encoding ribosome-located proteins (large ribosomal subunit, FDR= 3.60e-02) among genes up-regulated in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>, which suggests the involvement of relevant VirR-dependent post-transcriptional regulatory processes impacting protein biosynthesis in the mutant. Similarly, enrichments of further key metabolic pathways beyond lipids metabolic routes included terms enriched among genes down-regulated in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>, such as electron transport chain, (FDR=9.15 e-03), and ATP biosynthetic process (FDR=1.36 e-02), as well as terms enriched among upregulated genes in the mutant such as NADH dehydrogenase activity, (FDR=1.53 e-02). All together, these results combined with the differences concerning lipid metabolism discussed above, suggest a global remodeling of metabolic networks in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>.</p>

<title><italic>virR</italic> regulates the protein content of EVs in <italic>Mtb</italic></title>
<p>To capture the impact of transcriptional adaptation to the proteome and the degree of divergence between transcriptional shifts and proteins changes of <italic>Mtb</italic> in the absence of <italic>virR</italic>, we next performed label-free peptide mass spectrometry (LF-MS) of whole cell lysates (WCLs) of <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> and WT strains. Additionally, we isolated EVs from axenic cultures and obtained their proteomic composition to examine for potential VirR-dependent differences in protein cargo that may alter the functionality of EVs (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref></bold>). As a result, we obtained proteomic profiles across strains and cell compartments for a total of N=934 proteins. Upon PCA analysis of the proteomic data (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref></bold>), we found that the first principal component (PC1), explaining 36.8% of total variance, separated samples from WCLs and EVs regardless of the strain (PC1 differs across cell compartments: one-tailed Mann Whitney t test p=1.08e-03), while the second PC (PC2) (21.3% of total variance explained) captured strain effects on the proteomic footprint only among EVs (one-tailed Mann Whitney t test for PC2 differences between <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> EVs and the rest: p=4.55 e-03). These results suggest that differences in protein abundances between EVs and WCLs are larger than differences found between strains, and that, concerning the differences across strains, these are comparatively more important in EVs. Next, we conducted differential protein expression analyses to find 15 upregulated and 4 downregulated proteins between WT and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> strains in WCLs, at FDR=5%, which represents 2% of the total of proteins under analyses (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>, right bar</bold>). Despite the scarcity of significant differences in expression across strains in WCLs, some of the proteins most differentially expressed in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> are involved in key processes for bacterial survival and virulence, including key metabolic enzymes such as the Acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase AcsA (logFC = -3.78, FDR = 4.40 e-03), as well as FprA, (logFC= -2.77, FDR=1.55 e-02), involved in the reduction of NADP+ into NADPH, both downregulated in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>.</p>

</fig>
<p>Conversely to the WCL dataset, we did find larger differences in protein expression across strains in EVs, with 187 proteins more abundant and 166 less abundant in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> EVs than that of WT (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>, left bar</bold>). This represents 37.8% of all proteins tested, a value largely comparable to the percentage of differentially expressed genes identified in the RNA-seq data. Regarding downregulated EV proteins in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> we observed robust enrichments in ontology terms related with protein biosynthesis, including translation (FDR=2.09 e-28), ribosome (FDR=3.01 e-37), and ribosome assembly (FDR=6.71 e-04), indicating that EVs from the <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> are ribosome-depleted. Consistent with these results 42 ribosomal proteins were found to be less abundant in the <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> strain relative to WT (<bold>Fig S3</bold>). Interestingly, these results contrast with the higher mRNA levels found for genes associated with the ribosomal compartment in the RNA-seq data obtained from WCLs (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref></bold>, <bold>right panel</bold>), suggesting that the depletion of ribosomal content found in the vesicles is the result of post-transcriptional regulatory events. Furthermore, we found that the two bacterioferritin proteins BfrA (log2FC=-3.19, FDR=3.42 e-04) and BfrB (log2FC=-2.47, FDR=9.70 e-05), were simultaneously less abundant in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>, (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref></bold>), together contributing to the enrichment of the ontology term ferroxidase activity (FDR=8.30 e-02) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref></bold>). This result is suggestive of a possible defect of <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>EVs in iron sequestration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mohammadzadeh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Prados-Rosales et al., 2014b</xref>). We also found differences in metabolic pathways associated to the EV content, including enzymes involved in metabolism of nucleotides (FDR=9.63e-02 (up), (FDR=8.30e-02 (down), cellular amino acids ((FDR=6.26e-04 (up), FDR=1.41e-02 (down)) as well as carbohydrates (glycogen FDR=9.63e-02 (up), oligosaccharides FDR=8.30e-02 (down)). The simultaneous enrichments of these metabolic pathways observed both among upregulated and downregulated vesicular proteins (<bold>Fig S4</bold>), indicates a complex, VirR-dependent, rewiring of metabolic routes in the vesicles from the mutant strain.</p>
<p>Further, proteins upregulated in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> EVs were enriched in terms related to mycolic acid metabolism (FDR=1.10 e-03), and peptidoglycan-based cell-wall biogenesis (FDR=1.44 e-02). Proteins such as InhA (logFC=3.65 FDR=6.10 e-05), and KasB (logFC=1.78 FDR=1.22 e-02), involved in mycolic acid synthesis were also upregulated in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>(<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4F</xref></bold>). The upregulation of these proteins, along with the enrichments at the transcriptional level of DIM/DIP biosynthetic pathways (upregulated in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>), as well as steroid catabolic routes (down-regulated), suggests a shift in the control of the pool of propionyl-CoA, both at the level of its production, -as a byproduct of the catabolism of methyl-branched lipids, odd-chain-length fatty acids as well as cholesterol- and its detoxification by the bacterium through different routes, such as the methylmalonyl pathway, the glyoxylate cycle and the methylcitrate cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). To shed light on these changes at the metabolic level, we conducted a metabolic profiling to quantify the concentration of metabolites that are central in these different detoxification routes including propionyl-CoA: acetyl-CoA, pyruvate, methylcitrate, and methylmalonyl-CoA (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4G</xref>, left bottom panel</bold>). Only methylmalonyl-CoA was found to be significantly repressed in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> (p=0.028). This result, along with the trend towards increased protein, and especially gene expression that is observed for genes involved in the biosynthesis of PDIMs from methylmalonyl (including phenolpthiocerol synthesis type-I polyketide synthases A-E, (ppsA-E), fatty-acid-CoA synthetases fadD26 and fadD28, among others, <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4G</xref></bold>), suggests that the methylmalonyl pool is depleted in the mutant strain as a result of an increased activity of the PDIM biosynthetic pathway. Furthermore, the acetyl/propionyl-CoA carboxylase subunits Acc, appear repressed in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> EVs, suggesting that the production of methylmalonyl Co-A from the degradation of propionyl CoA is inhibited within the vesicles of the mutant strain.</p>
<p>Taken together, the omics analyses align with the structural and functional differences observed in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>. We reasoned that the increased expression of PDIMs biosynthetic genes and the reduced expression of genes related to protein synthesis may be triggered to compensate the enhanced permeability measured in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>. In addition, this enhanced permeability leads to an increase in the release of EV, which seems to be depleted in ribosomes and iron storage proteins.</p>

<title>Cell envelope permeability is a major driver of MEV release</title>
<p>If enhanced cell permeability is a global consequence of <italic>virR</italic> disruption that leads to enhanced vesiculation, we hypothesized that other conditions either inducing or decreasing cell envelope permeability could lead to alterations in vesicle production in <italic>Mtb</italic>. To test this, we treated <italic>Mtb</italic> with sublethal concentrations of thioridazine (TRZ), a known enhancer of cell permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">De Keijzer et al., 2016</xref>); and, alternatively, we cultured the bacillus with cholesterol as a sole carbon source, a condition which reduces mycobacterial cell permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Brzostek et al., 2009</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref></bold>). Neither condition altered bacterial viability as measured by the absence of the release of the transcription factor IdeR, as an indication of cell lysis (<bold>Fig S2C</bold>). We then measured vesicle levels in culture supernatants and found that <italic>Mtb</italic> significantly releases more vesicles upon treatment with TRZ, and significantly reduces vesicle release in the presence of cholesterol as a sole carbon source (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref></bold>), as measured by dot blot after normalization to colony forming units (CFUs). These results strongly suggest that cell envelope permeability determines the magnitude of the vesiculation phenomenon in <italic>Mtb</italic>.</p>

<p>We next investigated whether common transcriptional features underpin the regulation of cell envelope permeability in the tested conditions. To do that, we compared the transcriptional response of <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> with that of available datasets including <italic>Mtb</italic> cultured in the presence of 0.01% of cholesterol as a sole carbon source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pawełczyk et al., 2021</xref>), and <italic>Mtb</italic> treated with 6 μg ml<sup>-1</sup> of TRZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dutta et al., 2010</xref>). Experimentally, we retrieved the set of genes up and down-regulated in <italic>Mtb</italic> grown in cholesterol vs glucose-rich culture media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Brzostek et al., 2009</xref>), and interrogated whether those genes were enriched among the sets of differentially expressed genes in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> vs WT reported in this study (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref></bold>). Interestingly, we found that those genes whose expression changed in the same direction in conditions associated with low, or high permeability, in both studies were mutually enriched, while the cross-comparisons between sets with opposite responses to low-permeability-associated treatments in both studies led to significant depletion statistics. These results validate the initial hypothesis according to which changes in permeability induced by these two treatments are linked to the activation of a common transcriptional program. The inspection of genes that are simultaneously upregulated in treatments associated with low permeability in both studies identified DosR as a putative regulator associated with the orchestration of this transcriptional footprint of low cell permeability. The two-component system DosS-DosR has a well-known role as a global regulator of the transition to dormancy, and its regulon is consistently upregulated in non-permeable dormant bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Honaker et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, authors found that low-permeability bacteria cultured in a cholesterol medium, albeit featuring a regular growing phenotype, activated the DosR regulon, suggesting that cell wall remodeling leading to a decrease in permeability linked with the induction of DosR can be triggered independently to the transcriptional regulatory programs leading to growth arrest and dormancy in <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pawełczyk et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, the integration of the genes that are down-regulated in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> validates this hypothesis (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref></bold> and <bold>FigS5</bold>), since 39 out of the 48 genes annotated in the DosR regulon are simultaneously up-regulated in conditions linked to low permeability in both studies.</p>
<p>A similar analytic approach for the comparison of the response of <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> and the response to the drug TRZ, a treatment well-known for inducing an increase in permeability in <italic>Mtb</italic>-treated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dutta et al., 2010</xref>) (GSE16626), led to conceptually similar results, with genes simultaneously upregulated in both TRZ and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> (OR=1.51, p=0.03), as well as genes simultaneously down-regulated (OR=1.48, p=0.03), being marginally enriched. Interestingly, among the 20 genes showing the largest, and most significant repression effects by both treatments (log2FC&gt;0.5 &amp; FDR&lt;0.05 in both analyses), we found 6 genes whose functions are related with metal nutrients uptake, homeostasis and metabolism, such as genes encoding the bacterioferritin BrfB, rubredoxins RubA and RubB, metal homeostasis sensors CsoR (copper) and kmtR (nickel and cobalt), and the metal exporter CtpJ (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref></bold>). Taken together, these analyses highlight the transcriptional parallels between <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> and both TRZ and cholesterol conditions, which strongly suggests the existence of a common transcriptional signature associated with the control of cell permeability.</p>

<title>The absence of VirR leads to an aberrant enlargement of PG in <italic>Mtb</italic></title>
<p>To elucidate the specific molecular defects that explain the periplasm enlargement, the enhanced permeability, and the antibiotic sensitivity phenotypes, we performed a biochemical analysis of WT and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>cell envelopes. First, we analyzed the total lipid profile by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and observed significant differences in prevalent polar lipids linked to the cell membrane including, lysophosphatidic and phosphatidic acid, species of monoacylated and diacylated glycerol, phosphatidylethanolamines and phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannoside (PIM) species, being more abundant in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> relative to WT and complementing strain. (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref></bold>). To validate these results, we ran thin layer chromatography (TLC) analysis on the same lipid extracts and found that the mutant carries more phospholipids in the membrane including more AcPIM<sub>2</sub> and PE (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref></bold>). Moreover, we could not measure major differences in the level of mycolic acid species (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref></bold>), while significantly more PDIMs were detected in the mutant relative to the other strains (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref></bold>). This later result agrees with that of transcriptomics and proteomics analyses. When analyzing apolar lipids we also observed increased levels of free mycolic acids (FMA) and free fatty acids (FFA) upon <italic>virR</italic> deletion (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E</xref></bold>). The enhanced release of these apolar lipids has also been documented in a <italic>C. glutamicum</italic> mutant in Cg0847 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Baumgart et al., 2016</xref>), a canonical LCP protein. Importantly, we could not detect any of these lipids in EVs from <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6F</xref></bold>), while major polar phospholipids could be resolved in EVs from all strains (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6G</xref></bold>), as previously reported (R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Prados-Rosales et al., 2011</xref>).

<p>Next, we performed a glycosyl composition analysis of isolated cell walls (including mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex) and determined that there were no significant differences between strains in AG content as well as in the ratio between arabinose and galactose (A/G) (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref></bold>). Similarly, no changes were observed in the galactan length as measured by the ratio between galactose (G) and rhamnose (R) G/R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Justen et al., 2020</xref>). We noticed that the ratio between N-acetylglucosamine (NAGc) and rhamnose (R) (NAGc/R) was significantly higher in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> relative to WT, suggesting an increase in PG content in this strain (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref></bold>). The validation of these results was performed independently by measuring the amount of diaminopimelic acid (DAP) in isolated cell walls, as a surrogate of PG content, and determined that <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> carries two times more PG than WT or complemented strains (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref></bold>). We next obtained pure PG preparations of each strain and performed an analysis by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref> and Fig S6</bold>). This technique has been recently used to investigate the nanometric features of isolated Gram-positive bacterial cell walls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Pasquina-Lemonche et al., 2020</xref>). Semi-automated analysis of liquid AFM images from mycobacterial isolated PG samples revealed that: (i) the absence of VirR leads to a significant reduction in PG pore diameter (down to 9.2 ± 0.6 nm) relative to WT (16 ± 3.3 nm) and complemented strains (10 ± 0.8 nm) (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C, D</xref> and Fig S6</bold>); (ii) the number of pores is significantly higher in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> compared to WT and complemented strain (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7E</xref> and Fig S6</bold>); (iii) manual analysis of AFM images in ambient conditions revealed that <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> PG is significantly thicker than that of the other strains of the study (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7F</xref></bold>). These results show for the first time the nanometric architecture of isolated PG in mycobacteria by AFM and suggest a role for VirR in regulating PG thickness and porosity. Strikingly, we found that the PG enlargement observed in the <italic>virR</italic><sup>mut</sup> correlated with increased susceptibility to the muramidase lysozyme (<bold>Fig S7</bold>), indicating modifications in PG remodeling in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>. Collectively, although the structural changes at nanoscopic level of the peripheral areas of the cell observed by AFM leads to a more dense and thick structure harder to penetrate, the chemical changes in the peptidoglycan structure observed and biochemical assays suggest that changes associated with alterations in VirR-regulated PG remodeling makes the wall more permeable and support increased release of EV in <italic>Mtb</italic>.</p>

<title>VirR interacts with canonical LCP proteins</title>
<p>As mentioned above VirR is a LytR_C solo domain protein with no catalytic LCP domain. Other members of the LCP protein family like Rv3267 and Rv3287 are the main PG-AG ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Grzegorzewicz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Harrison et al., 2016</xref>) and also carry a LytR_C domain. We have previously shown that VirR interacts with itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Rath et al., 2013</xref>). Consequently, we reasoned that if VirR contributed to PG-AG ligation it could do it via interaction with canonical LCP proteins through the LytR_C domain. Although VirR is one of the most abundant proteins found in tuberculin preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Prasad et al., 2013</xref>), we determined that it localizes at sites of nascent cell wall by fluorescence microscopy (<bold>Fig S8</bold>). Therefore, its location could initially allow for interactions with other cell surface proteins like LCP. Both recombinant VirR and the main AG-PG ligase Lcp1 (Rv3267) oligomerize in a blue-native PAGE gel (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8A</xref></bold>). This observation suggests that they interact with proteins sharing similar domain features. We next performed a flotation assay where we examined the behavior of VirR on an iodixanol gradient in the presence or absence of Lcp1. Using a specific antibody raised against VirR, we observed that the presence of Lcp1 displaces the relative location of VirR toward upper fractions of the gradient, indicating a potential interaction of both proteins and the formation of higher molecular weight complexes (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8B</xref></bold>). To investigate the interaction of virR and Lcp1, along with other Lcp proteins, in a more physiological environment we used the bipartite splitGFP approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cabantous et al., 2013</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8C</xref> and Fig S9</bold>), which has been recently utilized to demonstrate the co-localization and interaction of the membrane-bound metal ATPase CtpC with the chaperon PacL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Boudehen et al., 2022</xref>). We first recapitulated the VirR self-interaction and added that such interaction implicates the LytR_C domain since no differences in fluorescence were measured between full and truncated versions of VirR (VirRsol) lacking the first 41 amino acids. As negative controls, we included interactions between VirR and the cell surface associated metal ATPase CtpC (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8C</xref></bold>). When testing interactions between VirR and other Lcp proteins (Rv0822c, Lcp1 (Rv3267) and Rv3284) we could not measure any GFP signal when full Lcp proteins were used in the assay. Conversely, a significant increase in fluorescence was measured for all combinations when truncated Lcp proteins including either the C-terminal domain or specifically the LytR_C domain were tested (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8C</xref></bold>). These results strongly suggest that VirR interacts with Lcp proteins and that these interactions occur via LytR_C terminal domains.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our group reported <italic>virR</italic> as the first gene implicated in the biogenesis of EVs in <italic>Mtb</italic> ten years back (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Rath et al., 2013</xref>). A transposon mutant in <italic>virR</italic> (<italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>) overproduces MEVs and this provokes augmentation of cytokine responses in mouse and human macrophages. This mutant manifested an attenuated phenotype in experimental infections on macrophages and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Beaulieu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Rath et al., 2013</xref>). Such studies established that VirR has a role in virulence by negatively modulating the release of MEVs. These studies provided evidence that vesiculogenesis in <italic>Mtb</italic> is genetically regulated. Since then, conditions such as iron starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Prados-Rosales et al., 2014b</xref>) and other genes including <italic>iniAC</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gupta et al., 2023</xref>) and the Pst/SenX3-RegX3 signal transduction system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">White et al., 2018</xref>) have been shown to contribute to the biogenesis of MEVs. Interestingly, VirR, a LytR_C solo domain protein (<bold>Fig S1</bold>), shares homology with Lcp proteins, which in <italic>Mtb</italic> are known to participate in the enzymatic connection between AG and PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Grzegorzewicz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Harrison et al., 2016</xref>). This suggests VirR function might be linked to cell wall remodeling.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated how VirR can control the magnitude of MEV release in <italic>Mtb</italic>. We did this by studying the underlying enhanced vesiculogenesis phenomenon observed in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> using genetic, transcriptiomics, proteomics and ultrastructural and biochemical methods. It was clear from our cryo-EM studies that <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> has an aberrant cell wall as the layer above the cell membrane was significantly larger than that of WT and complemented strains. The enlarged compartment showed higher granular texture, a feature that has been previously associated to PG precursors in unrelated Gram-positive bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zuber et al., 2006</xref>). This observation and previous studies showing the increased sensitivity of <italic>VirR<sup>mut</sup></italic> to vancomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ballister et al., 2019</xref>) strongly suggested that the cell wall defect is connected to PG remodeling. The use of AFM on isolated PG confirmed this and showed for the first time the nanostructure of PG in <italic>Mtb</italic>, providing information on PG thickness, pore size and number of pores. AFM indicated that <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> PG is thicker, has significantly more pores of small size. Considering the pore sizes measured across strains (ranging from 9-16 nm), we initially ruled out the notion that EVs (which are spheres of 50-300 nm in diameter) are released through the peripheral cell wall. Therefore, <italic>Mtb</italic> must have an alternative mechanism to release EVs, possible during the division process where the PG is most fragile, presumably due to defects in crosslinking. These events were not possible to visualize in AFM given that PG fragments from all the strains were lacking the poles or clearly defined division sites but could be the subject of further studies in the future. However, we cannot exclude that MEV plasticity could allow for crossing the cell wall via PG pores.</p>
<p>A recent study showed that <italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum</italic> can produce and release different types of MVs through different routes, including mycomembrane blebbing or bubbling cell death, depending on the stress at which <italic>C. glutamicum</italic> is exposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Nagakubo et al., 2021</xref>). In the present study, we have shown that <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> overproduces EVs under normal growing conditions in the absence of cell lysis, according to our assay which measured cytoplasmic leaking of the transcription factor IdeR. Overall, we show that EV production in <italic>Mtb</italic> under our growing conditions, is not linked to cell death. This fact largely excludes the bubbling cell death mechanism. Moreover, our lipidomic analysis now and before (Rafael <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Prados-Rosales et al., 2011</xref>) indicates the absence of mycomembrane lipids in isolated MEVs from all strains, ruling out that MEVs originate at the mycomembrane. These apparent disagreements with the <italic>C. glutamicum</italic> study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Nagakubo et al., 2021</xref>) might indicate that <italic>Mtb</italic> EV biogenesis may differ from that of <italic>C glutamicum</italic>, and other mycolic acid-containing bacteria with shorter fatty acids. Additional variables that may explain differences between studies is the growth media and the time at which vesicles are isolated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gupta et al., 2023</xref>). Of note, <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> EVs were isolated at day 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Nagakubo et al., 2021</xref>), a time at which this fast-growing mycobacteria is already in stationary phase.</p>
<p>The transcriptional profile of <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> can provide a partial explanation for the attenuated phenotype of the mutant due to a downregulation of genes activated upon stresses associated to the intraphagosomal environment. It is particularly interesting to observe the specific reduction in transcript levels of the two most important effectors of the esx-1 secretion system. On the other hand, genes involved in PDIM synthesis were upregulated. It is possible that the specific upregulation of PDIM synthesis in absence of <italic>virR</italic> is part of compensatory response to a reduced permeability. We were surprised to find no differences between protein profiles in whole cells between WT and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> strains, despite difference in transcriptomics. A biological interpretation of these results would point to the existence of global compensatory mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation used by the bacteria to partially recover comparable proteomic profiles in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>to those observed in the WT.</p>
<p>Contrary to whole cell lysates, EV protein profiles between <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> and WT were largely different. In this context, it is accepted that certain proteins and lipids are enriched in bacterial EVs and that preferential inclusion of such antigens in MVs supports a specific vesicle biogenesis mechanism. In Gram positive bacteria and mycobacteria both membrane and cytosolic proteins are included in EVs since the origin of these structures is linked to the cell membrane (R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Prados-Rosales et al., 2011</xref>) and, presumably, the incorporation of intracellular proteins may occur during the process of vesicle formation. We found a higher abundance of proteins related to PG and MA synthesis in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> EVs relative to WT. Therefore, these two processes seem to contribute to EV biogenesis in <italic>Mtb</italic>. Additional data presented in this study, which includes ultrastructural and chemical analyses confirm this. Both PG and MA synthesis are complex processes, including a diverse set of genes. What parts of the biogenesis of these molecules are important for the formation of EVs is a matter of future investigations.</p>
<p>Another finding of the study is the connection between permeability and the magnitude of the vesiculation process in <italic>Mtb</italic>. We linked these two phenomena first, by measuring enhanced vesiculation and permeability in the same strain (<italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>) and second, by modifying the permeability using chemical (via sublethal exposure to TRZ) and nutritional supplements (via providing cholesterol as sole carbon source) in WT <italic>Mtb</italic>. TRZ, a repurposed drug that belongs to the class of phenothiazines, is known to affect respiration in <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Amaral et al., 1996</xref>). It is also assumed that TRZ can inhibit efflux pumps leading to an increased susceptibility to first line antitubercular drugs when tested in combination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">De Knegt et al., 2014</xref>). This provides an explanation for the synergistic effects of such combinations. An independent explanation of such synergy may also come from the increased permeability, as it has been recently shown by a quantitative proteomics analysis of <italic>Mtb</italic> cells exposed to sublethal concentration of TRZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">De Keijzer et al., 2016</xref>). When we grew <italic>Mtb</italic> with cholesterol as a sole carbon source, a condition that slows mycobacterial growth but also reduces cell permeability via cholesterol accumulation in the cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Brzostek et al., 2009</xref>), we observed the opposite trend on MEV biogenesis. We consider this finding of high relevance since <italic>Mtb</italic> permeability is one the major concerns when developing potential antimycobacterial drugs. Nevertheless, bacterial cell permeability is a complex property that it is controlled by physiochemical, biological, and chemical processes such as stereochemistry, lipophilicity, saturation and unsaturation, flexibility, viscosity, fluidity, pressure, temperature and physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Nagamani and Sastry, 2021</xref>). How these variables change to allow the release of MEVs is not known.</p>
<p>This study also proposes a model VirR function whereby VirR may work as a scaffold for canonical Lcp proteins, which in <italic>Mtb</italic> links PG to AG. Based on the demonstration that VirR interacts with canonical Lcp proteins, we believe that the absence of VirR deregulates the localization of canonical Lcp proteins. Although we cannot rule out the contribution of other phenomena including alteration of the PG molecule, VirR is a central scaffold in the cell wall remodeling process. Taking into consideration the fact that <italic>VirR<sup>mut</sup></italic>is attenuated in virulence on preclinical models of infections and manifests an enhanced vesiculogenesis and permeability, VirR may represent a novel and interesting drug target. We envision that targeting VirR may not only make <italic>Mtb</italic> weaker and more permeable to other antitubercular drugs, but to stimulate the immune system, via MEVs, to fight infection.</p>

<title>Atomic force microscopy and data analysis</title>
<p>The dry pellets of purified peptidoglycan from the three strains were dissolved in pure water and further broken by tip sonication at 2 mA for 30 sec, three cycles. Then 10 µl of the PG suspension was added to standard AFM substrate made of mica coated with 0.01 % Poly-L-lysine by incubating the sample during 90 min to achieve good coverage. The sample was further rinsed with water and dried with Nitrogen flow. The AFM in ambient conditions (i.e. air) was performed using Tapping mode in a Bruker FastScan Bio machine (Santa Barbara, CA, United States) with Nunano SCOUT 350 - Silicon AFM probes (spring constant: 42 N/m, Resonance frequency: 350 kHz). The images were taken using a free amplitude of 10 nm with set point of 70-80 % of free amplitude (e.g. 7 nm). For AFM high resolution imaging in liquid the images were acquired in Peak force Tapping mode in imaging buffer made of 10 mM Tris and 150 mM KCl, pH: 8, with the FastScan Bio machine using Bruker Fastscan-D AFM probes (spring constant: 0.1 N/m, Resonance frequency: 70 kHz) at the force range of 1-3 nN peak force set point. The imaging parameters used are as follows; Scan rate: 1 Hz; Scan angle: 0 °; Peak force amplitude: 80-100 nm and with high pixel resolution (512-880).</p>
<p>The thickness measurements were performed with standard Gwyddion 1D height distribution tool (selecting an area containing background and a single leaflet of peptidoglycan). The number of cells analysed varied from n = 23 (for Mtb WT), n = 36 (for <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>) and n = 25 (for <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-C). The comparisons extracted from this data is statistically relevant with t test with Welch’s correction performed. The analysis of the high-resolution images obtained in liquid was performed using the semi-automated custom-made routine from (Pasquina-Lemonche, et al. “Pore AFM”, 2024) where the pore area, later converted in diameter, and the pore number were measured from the 2D slice of each image containing the maximum number of pores (see <bold>Fig. S8</bold>). The number of images similar to images shown in <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref></bold> were n = 8 for all strains, analyzing both pore size and pore number, the statistical comparisons were also performed using a t test with Welch’s correction.</p>

<title>Blue native PAGE</title>
<p>Oligomerization of VirR and Lcp1 was analyzed by Blue native PAGE (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, United States). Recombinant VirR and Lcp1 proteins were prepared in 1xLB Native PAGE including DDM at 0.5% final concentration. After incubation at 4°C for 30 min, samples were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4<sup>°</sup>C. The supernatant was recovered and mixed with G-250 additive following manufacturer instructions (Invitrogen) and loaded onto a Novex® Bist-Tris 4-16% gradient gel and run following manufacturer instructions. Gel was first fixed and then stained with Coomassie.</p>

<title>Liposome flotation assay</title>
<p>Individual or combined VirR and Lcp1 were prepared at 2 μM in buffer A in a final volume of 50 µl and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. This volume was mixed with 100 µl of 60% optiprep (Sigma-Aldrich) to a final concentration of 40% and overlaid with 100 µl of subsequent optiprep solutions at 35%, 30%, 20% and 10% (optiprep solutions were prepared in Buffer A). The samples were centrifugated at 70000 rpm for 2 h at 4<sup>°</sup>C in an Optima TLX Ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN United States). Eleven fractions of 50 µl were recovered and examined by dot blot (performed as previously described). Polyclonal antibodies raised against VirR and Lcp1 were used as primary antibodies. Quantification of dotblots was performed in ImageJ as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Schirmer et al., 2022</xref>). Briefly, integrated densities were calculated after background subtraction, and referred to wild type values to obtain the relative integrated intensities.</p>

<title>Fluorescence microscopy</title>
<p>The <italic>Mtb</italic> strain bearing the plasmid VirR-pMV261-Venus was grown in MM to an OD595nm of 0.4. At this stage, cells were harvested, washed three times in 1 × PBS (pH 7.4), resuspended in 1/3 – 1/6 volume of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and incubated for 2 h at 37 <sup>°</sup>C. Finally, the cells were washed twice in 1 × PBS and resuspended in 100–200 μl of PBS. Microscope slides were covered with 5 μl poly-L-lysine (Sigma) and excess poly-L-lysine was removed away with distillated water. A 20 – 40 μl aliquot was applied to pre-treated slides, allowed to air dry and covered with antifade solution (Prolong Gold, Invitrogen) and visualized under the fluorescence microscope using a 100x oil immersion objective on an Orca 12-ERG digital CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics) mounted on a Nikon E600 microscope.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The present study's main aim is to investigate the mechanism of how VirR controls the magnitude of MEV release in Mtb. The authors used various techniques, including genetics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and ultrastructural and biochemical methods. Several observations were made to link VirR-mediated vesiculogenesis with PG metabolism, lipid metabolism, and cell wall permeability. Finally, the authors presented evidence of a direct physical interaction of VirR with the LCP proteins involved in linking PG with AG, providing clues that VirR might act as a scaffold for LCP proteins and remodel the cell wall of Mtb. Since the Mtb cell wall provides a formidable anatomical barrier for the entry of antibiotics, targeting VirR might weaken the permeability of the pathogen along with the stimulation of the immune system due to enhanced vesiculogenesis. Therefore, VirR could be an excellent drug target. Overall, the study is an essential area of TB biology.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors have done a commendable job of comprehensively examining the phenotypes associated with the VirR mutant using various techniques. Application of Cryo-EM technology confirmed increased thickness and altered arrangement of CM-L1 layer. The authors also confirmed that increased vesicle release in the mutant was not due to cell lysis, which contrasts with studies in other bacterial species.</p>
<p>Another strength of the manuscript is that biochemical experiments show altered permeability and PG turnover in the mutant, which fits with later experiments where authors provide evidence of a direct physical interaction of VirR with LCP proteins.</p>
<p>Transcriptomics and proteomics data were helpful in making connections with lipid metabolism, which the authors confirmed by analyzing the lipids and metabolites of the mutant.</p>
<p>Lastly, using three approaches, the authors confirm that VirR interacts with LCP proteins in Mtb via the LytR_C terminal domain.</p>
<p>Altogether, the work is comprehensive, experiments are designed well, and conclusions are made based on the data generated after verification using multiple complementary approaches.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The major weakness is that the mechanism of VirR-mediated EV release remains enigmatic. Most of the findings are observational and only associate enhanced vesiculogenesis observed in the VirR mutant with cell wall permeability and PG metabolism. The authors suggest that EV release occurs during cell division when PG is most fragile. However, this has yet to be tested in the manuscript - the AFM of the VirR mutant, which produces thicker PG with more pore density, displays enhanced vesiculogenesis. No evidence was presented to show that the PG of the mutant is fragile, and there are differences in cell division to explain increased vesiculogenesis. These observations, counterintuitive to the authors' hypothesis, need detailed experimental verification.</p>
<p>Transcriptomic data only adds a little substantial. Transcriptomic data do not correlate with the proteomics data. It remains unclear how VirR deregulates transcription. TLCs of lipids are not quantitative. For example, the TLC image of PDIM is poor; quantitative estimation needs metabolic labeling of lipids with radioactive precursors. Further, change in PDIMs is likely to affect other lipids (SL-1, PAT/DAT) that share a common precursor (propionyl- CoA).</p>
<p>The connection of cholesterol with cell wall permeability is tenuous. Cholesterol will serve as a carbon source and contribute to the biosynthesis of methyl-branched lipids such as PDIM, SL-1, and PAD/DAT. Carbon sources also affect other aspects of physiology (redox, respiration, ATP), which can directly affect permeability and import/export of drugs. Authors should investigate whether restoration of the normal level of permeability and EV release is not due to the maintenance of cell wall lipid balance upon cholesterol exposure of the VirR mutant.</p>
<p>Finally, protein interaction data is based on experiments done once without statistical analysis. If the interaction between VirR and LCP protein is expected on the mycobacterial membrane, how the SPLIT_GFP system expressed in the cytoplasm is physiologically relevant. No explanation was provided as to why VirR interacts with the truncated version of LCP proteins and not with the full-length proteins.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this work, Vivian Salgueiro et al. have comprehensively investigated the role of VirR in the vesicle production process in Mtb using state-of-the-art omics, imaging, and several biochemical assays. From the present study, authors have drawn a positive correlation between cell membrane permeability and vasculogenesis and implicated VirR in affecting membrane permeability, thereby impacting vasculogenesis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors have discovered a critical factor (i.e. membrane permeability) that affects vesicle production and release in Mycobacteria, which can broadly be applied to other bacteria and may be of significant interest to other scientists in the field. Through omics and multiple targeted assays such as targeted metabolomics, PG isolation, analysis of Diaminopimelic acid and glycosyl composition of the cell wall, and, importantly, molecular interactions with PG-AG ligating canonical LCP proteins, the authors have established that VirR is a central scaffold at the cell envelope remodelling process which is critical for MEV production.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Throughout the study, the authors have utilized a CRISPR knockout of VirR. VirR is a non-essential gene for the growth of Mtb; a null mutant of VirR would have been a better choice for the study.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The present study's main aim is to investigate the mechanism of how VirR controls the magnitude of MEV release in Mtb. The authors used various techniques, including genetics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and ultrastructural and biochemical methods. Several observations were made to link VirR-mediated vesiculogenesis with PG metabolism, lipid metabolism, and cell wall permeability. Finally, the authors presented evidence of a direct physical interaction of VirR with the LCP proteins involved in linking PG with AG, providing clues that VirR might act as a scaffold for LCP proteins and remodel the cell wall of Mtb. Since the Mtb cell wall provides a formidable anatomical barrier for the entry of antibiotics, targeting VirR might weaken the permeability of the pathogen along with the stimulation of the immune system due to enhanced vesiculogenesis. Therefore, VirR could be an excellent drug target. Overall, the study is an essential area of TB biology.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors have done a commendable job of comprehensively examining the phenotypes associated with the VirR mutant using various techniques. Application of Cryo-EM technology confirmed increased thickness and altered arrangement of CM-L1 layer. The authors also confirmed that increased vesicle release in the mutant was not due to cell lysis, which contrasts with studies in other bacterial species.</p>
<p>Another strength of the manuscript is that biochemical experiments show altered permeability and PG turnover in the mutant, which fits with later experiments where authors provide evidence of a direct physical interaction of VirR with LCP proteins.</p>
<p>Transcriptomics and proteomics data were helpful in making connections with lipid metabolism, which the authors confirmed by analyzing the lipids and metabolites of the mutant.</p>
<p>Lastly, using three approaches, the authors confirm that VirR interacts with LCP proteins in Mtb via the LytR_C terminal domain.</p>
<p>Altogether, the work is comprehensive, experiments are designed well, and conclusions are made based on the data generated after verification using multiple complementary approaches.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The major weakness is that the mechanism of VirR-mediated EV release remains enigmatic. Most of the findings are observational and only associate enhanced vesiculogenesis observed in the VirR mutant with cell wall permeability and PG metabolism. The authors suggest that EV release occurs during cell division when PG is most fragile. However, this has yet to be tested in the manuscript - the AFM of the VirR mutant, which produces thicker PG with more pore density, displays enhanced vesiculogenesis. No evidence was presented to show that the PG of the mutant is fragile, and there are differences in cell division to explain increased vesiculogenesis. These observations, counterintuitive to the authors' hypothesis, need detailed experimental verification.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank the reviewer for this comments. We would like to convince this reviewer about the fact that the VirR mutant is truly caring a more fragile PG. We will perfume additional experiments that would support this notion. We will determine the degree of PG release to the extracellular space and run additional mass spectrometry data on isolated PG.</p>

<p>Transcriptomic data only adds a little substantial. Transcriptomic data do not correlate with the proteomics data. It remains unclear how VirR deregulates transcription. TLCs of lipids are not quantitative. For example, the TLC image of PDIM is poor; quantitative estimation needs metabolic labeling of lipids with radioactive precursors. Further, change in PDIMs is likely to affect other lipids (SL-1, PAT/DAT) that share a common precursor (propionyl- CoA).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We agree with the reviewer that TLC analysis is not quantitative. Additional TLCs will be run to investigate other lipids sharing common precursors. At the present time, we can not run radioactive experiments on the lab.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The connection of cholesterol with cell wall permeability is tenuous. Cholesterol will serve as a carbon source and contribute to the biosynthesis of methyl-branched lipids such as PDIM, SL-1, and PAD/DAT. Carbon sources also affect other aspects of physiology (redox, respiration, ATP), which can directly affect permeability and import/export of drugs. Authors should investigate whether restoration of the normal level of permeability and EV release is not due to the maintenance of cell wall lipid balance upon cholesterol exposure of the VirR mutant.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We concur with the reviewer that cholesterol as sole carbon source is introducing many changes in Mtb cells beside permeability. Our central hypothesis regarding this data is that cholesterol will make Mtb cell membrane less fluid and this fact will make Ev release to be reduced. We will try to measure membrane fluidity in the presence and absence of cholesterol. However, permeability changes in Mtb cells can be manifested at different levels of the cell envelope. This would suggest that the increased permeability observed in the VirR mutant, could be different than that of observed upon TRZ treatment. The main point on this is that vesiculogenesis could be a general process responding to changes in permeability regardless of the cell envelope compartment affected. We need to define experiments here, but we will try to demonstrate this.</p>

<p>Finally, protein interaction data is based on experiments done once without statistical analysis. If the interaction between VirR and LCP protein is expected on the mycobacterial membrane, how the SPLIT_GFP system expressed in the cytoplasm is physiologically relevant. No explanation was provided as to why VirR interacts with the truncated version of LCP proteins and not with the full-length proteins.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Split-GFP has been previously used with cell membrane proteins with success. However, we will repeat the experiments and perform statistics.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this work, Vivian Salgueiro et al. have comprehensively investigated the role of VirR in the vesicle production process in Mtb using state-of-the-art omics, imaging, and several biochemical assays. From the present study, authors have drawn a positive correlation between cell membrane permeability and vasculogenesis and implicated VirR in affecting membrane permeability, thereby impacting vasculogenesis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors have discovered a critical factor (i.e. membrane permeability) that affects vesicle production and release in Mycobacteria, which can broadly be applied to other bacteria and may be of significant interest to other scientists in the field. Through omics and multiple targeted assays such as targeted metabolomics, PG isolation, analysis of Diaminopimelic acid and glycosyl composition of the cell wall, and, importantly, molecular interactions with PG-AG ligating canonical LCP proteins, the authors have established that VirR is a central scaffold at the cell envelope remodelling process which is critical for MEV production.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank the reviewer for this kind words.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Throughout the study, the authors have utilized a CRISPR knockout of VirR. VirR is a non-essential gene for the growth of Mtb; a null mutant of VirR would have been a better choice for the study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank the reviewer for bringing up this issue. Contrary to predictions, we believe that virR is an essential gene as we have tried to delete it several times with no success. We used in the study a transposon mutant and its complementing strain since they have been the base of previous studies to establish their genetic implications in vesiculogenesis in Mtb. The choice of CRISPRi was run similar experiments in a background different from transposon mutagenesis. Our data, support similar phenotypes in term of vesicle release.</p>
