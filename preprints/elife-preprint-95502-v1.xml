<title>Abstract</title><p>Microbes strongly affect invasive plant growth. Interactions between soil microbes and invasive plants have received widespread attention; however, it remains to be determined how phyllosphere and rhizosphere soil microbes affect seedling mortality and the growth of invasive plants across ontogeny under varying soil nutrition levels. In this study, we used the invader <italic>Ageratina adenophora</italic> to evaluate these effects in plant growth chambers. We found that leaf litter harboured more potential pathogens and thus had more adverse effects on seed germination and seedling survival than soil inoculation. Microbial inoculation at different growth stages altered the microbial community and functions enriched in seedlings, and earlier inoculation had a more adverse effect on seedling survival and growth. In most cases, the soil nutrient level did not affect microbe-mediated seedling growth and the relative abundance of the microbial community and functions involved in seedling growth. Some microbial genera have distinct effects on seedling survival from those on growth. Moreover, fungal strains isolated from dead seedlings inoculated with litter exhibited significant phylogenetic signals to seedling mortality, in which strains of <italic>Allophoma</italic> and <italic>Alternaria</italic> caused high seedling mortality. Our study stresses the essential role of <italic>A. adenophora</italic> litter microbes in population establishment by regulating seedling density and growth.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Plant-modified soil properties in turn affect the performance of plants, which are termed ‘plant–soil feedbacks (PSFs)’. PSFs can affect species coexistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bever et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">van der Putten et al., 2013</xref>) and local plant community composition and dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bauer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kardol et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Teste et al., 2017</xref>). For plant invasion, PSFs have positive effects by escaping soil pathogens and recruiting some beneficial microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Liu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Mitchell &amp; Power, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Xu et al., 2012</xref>) or negative effects by accumulating local pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Callaway et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Flory &amp; Clay, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar to soil, leaf litter could also affect plant growth, species diversity and community structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Ma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Olson &amp; Wallander, 2002</xref>), thus playing important roles in population establishment and community dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jessen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lamb, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Xiong &amp; Nilsson, 1999</xref>). However, related research has focused mainly on physical (e.g., maintaining soil moisture and temperature, increasing nutrition and reducing light) or chemical effects (e.g., releasing allelochemicals) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Demey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jessen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Möhler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>) but has rarely focused on leaf microbial effects. Until 2017, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Whitaker et al. (2017)</xref> extended the PSF to aboveground tissues (including leaf, stem and floral tissues), termed “plant‒ phyllosphere feedbacks (PPFs)”, and found that all four Asteraceae species experienced stronger negative PPFs than PSFs. Subsequently, this team further verified that all ten tested Asteraceae plants experienced negative PPFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Zaret et al., 2021</xref>). The lack of strong mutualists and relatively high abundance of pathogens in the phyllosphere may account for the negative PPFs.</p>
<p>In addition to microbial sources (i.e., soil vs leaf litter), ontogeny (seedling growth stage) and soil nutrient levels could affect plant‒microbe interactions. For example, seedlings showed distinct sensitivity over the growth stage, and younger seedlings were more susceptible to infection by a single soil microbe because of fewer defense resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Geisen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jevon et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, leaf litter has an adverse effect on seedling emergence but a positive effect on later plant growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abbas et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Möhler et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>); litter also has a stronger negative effect on earlier vegetation growth than the elder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Loydi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Wang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Xiong &amp; Nilsson, 1999</xref>). Moreover, plants enrich distinct microbes under different nutrient conditions and affect plant performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dostál, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Gustafson &amp; Casper, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Widdig et al., 2020</xref>). For example, the bacterial diversity in duckweed plants was reduced under nutrient‒deficient conditions, but the abundance of Firmicutes increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Bunyoo et al., 2022</xref>), and members of Firmicutes have been reported to promote plant stress tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ai et al. (2018)</xref> reported that nutrient additions caused crops to enrich some bacteria and fungi from soil and increase yield.</p>
<p><italic>Ageratina adenophora</italic> (Sprengel) R.M. King &amp; H. Robinson (Asteraceae), known as Crofton weed or Mexican devil weed, has invaded more than 30 countries and areas, including South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, India and China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Julien &amp; Griffiths, 1998</xref>). It is a perennial weed and can produce high yields of seeds with a high germination rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Parsons WT, 2001</xref>). This weed commonly grows in monoculture, but a high density of seedlings is not common in the wild. Previous studies have shown that <italic>A. adenophora</italic> can enrich the beneficial soil microbial community to facilitate its invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Niu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>); in contrast, <italic>A. adenophora</italic> leaves harbor diverse fungal pathogens that can cause adverse effects on itself seed germination and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kai Fang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">K. Fang et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, it is interesting to ask whether leaf microbes play a distinct role from soil microbes in regulating <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedling density and whether these effects change with the <italic>A. adenophora</italic> growth stage and soil nutrition level.</p>
<p>In this study, we inoculated <italic>A. adenophora</italic> with soil or leaf litter at three stages, 0 d, 21 d, and 28 d after sowing, and transplanted seedlings to grow in soils with high or low nutrition levels. We first determined the germination, seedling survival and growth of <italic>the A. Adenophora</italic> plants. Then, we characterized the bacterial and fungal communities of the soils and leaf litter as inoculation sources, as well as the microbial communities enriched in the leaves and roots of the <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedlings after growing; we also isolated the fungi associated with the dead seedlings and tested their mortality to seedlings. Finally, we correlated the microbial community with <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedling mortality and growth.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that the microbial community associated with leaf litter and rhizosphere soils can account for the differential effects on <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedling mortality and growth over growth stages when growing under different nutrition levels. We expected that 1) leaf litter would have more adverse effects on seed germination, seedling survival and growth than soil, as leaf litter often harbours more plant pathogens, and 2) inoculation at different growth stages would change the microbial community enriched by seedlings and thus affect seedling growth. Earlier inoculation has a more adverse impact on seedling growth than later inoculation, as younger seedlings were more sensitive to pathogen infection than older seedlings. 3) The nutrition level influences seedlings to recruit the microbial community and thus affects seedling growth.</p>

<title>Leaf litter and rhizosphere soils had differential effects on seedling mortality and growth of <italic>A. adenophora</italic> over growth stages when grown under different nutrition levels</title>
<p>When inoculated during the G0 period, the leaves significantly delayed germination time more than soil; relatively, the sterile leaves caused a longer germination time than non–sterile leaves (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, both <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Leaf and soil had no distinct effects on the germination rate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). In addition, inoculation of sterile and non–sterile leaves at G0 caused a high death rate (19.7% vs 96.7%) for seedlings growing in petri dishes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, Fig. S1). Only non–sterile leaves caused low seedling death (8.4%) when the seedlings were inoculated at G21 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Two weeks after transplanting these seedlings into cups, those seedlings treated by leaf inoculation, non–sterile sample inoculation, and inoculation at an earlier stage died more than those treated by soil inoculation, sterile sample inoculation, and inoculation at a later stage. Moreover, seedlings grown in high-nutrient soil died more than those grown in low-nutrient soil. (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d-f</xref>, Fig. S2a). Specifically, the interaction between feedback and microbe or inoculation time treatments but not nutrition level significantly affected the seedling death rate, where inoculation with only non–sterile litter at an earlier stage caused a higher death rate than inoculation at a later stage, regardless of whether the seedlings were grown at a high or low soil nutrient level (all <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, Fig. S2a,b).</p>

<p>We further correlated the microbial genera and potential functions of leaf and soil inocula with seedling mortality in response to inoculation with non–sterile inocula at G0. The abundances of both the soil and leaf microbial genera were related to the seedling death rate (DR) but not to the germination time (GT) or germination rate (GR) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a,f</xref>). Specifically, the leaf core bacterial genera <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, <italic>Sphingomonas</italic>, <italic>Massilia</italic>, <italic>Variovorax</italic>, <italic>Aureimonas</italic>, and <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> were positively correlated with DR, but the soil core bacteria, including Alphaproteobacteria_unclassified, <italic>Rhodoplanes</italic>, Vicinamibacteraceae_unclassified, and <italic>Pedomicrobium</italic>, were negatively correlated with DR (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a-c</xref>). Plant bacterial pathogens (2.29%) were the potential function of the core bacterial taxa in leaves but not in soil; soil had a greater abundance of nitrogen circle–related function (50.98%) than leaves (17.55%) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d,e</xref>, Table S1-2). The leaf core fungal genera <italic>Didymella</italic>, Pleosporales_unclassified, <italic>Subplenodomus</italic>, and <italic>Bulleromyces</italic> were positively correlated with DR, but the soil core fungal genera <italic>Mortierella</italic>, <italic>Hypocrea</italic>, <italic>Pochonia</italic> and <italic>Volutella</italic> were negatively correlated with DR (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f-h</xref>). The abundance of plant fungal pathogens was greater in leaves (68.20%) than in soil (33.93%), while Ecotomycorrhizal was found only in soil (16.33%) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4i,j</xref>, Table S3-4).</p>
<p>We obtained 192 cultivable fungal isolates from 40 dead seedlings, with an average of 4.825 isolates per dead seedling (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). Based on the ITS genes of the representative strains (Table S5), they were divided into 7 families.

The seedling mortality of these strains exhibited a significant phylogenetic signal (Pagel’s λ = 0.82, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0002).

<title>Different feedback, inoculation time, nutrient level and plant compartment affected the seedling bacterial and fungal communities and functional assembly and growth</title>
<p>The NMDS and PERMANOVA revealed that all four factors significantly affected the bacterial community and functional assembly in seedlings, and the greatest effect was inoculation time and compartment (all <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, R<sup>2</sup>: 0.102 – 0.138), followed by feedback and nutrition (all <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, R<sup>2</sup>: 0.024 – 0.082, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a,b,e,f</xref>). Additionally, compartment, feedback and inoculation time significantly affected the fungal community and functional assembly (all <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, R<sup>2</sup>: 0.054 – 0.102), but nutrition affected only the fungal community (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.031) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c,d,g,h</xref>). Further analysis for each inoculation time treatment showed that compartment and feedback mainly affected the microbial community and functional assembly and explained a greater proportion of the variation in bacteria than in fungi and in function than in the community. The nutrient level mainly affected the bacterial community at certain inoculation time (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 for G0, G21 and G28, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6i-l</xref>, Fig. S5, Table S6-7).</p>

<p>We further analysed the correlation between microbial abundance and putative functions enriched by seedlings and seedling growth (RI). We identified 47 root endophytic genera that were significantly correlated with <italic>A. adenophora</italic> growth. Among them, seven negative genera were less abundant in seedlings treated by litter inoculation than in those treated by soil inoculation but were similar in abundance in seedlings treated by different inoculation time, and in seedlings grown at different nutrient levels. In contrast, forty positive genera, e.g., the fungi <italic>Duganella and Mortierella</italic> and the bacteria <italic>Massilia, Pseudomonas, and Sphingomonas</italic>, were more abundant in seedlings treated by litter inoculation than by soil inoculation but lower abundance in seedlings inoculated at G0 than at the other three inoculation times (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>). Eighteen leaf endophytic genera with significant correlation with RI were identified, of which three negative genera, including bacteria <italic>Tardiphaga</italic>, <italic>Brevundimonas</italic> and fungi <italic>Microsphaera</italic>, were more abundant in seedlings inoculated at G0 than at other three inoculation times and slightly higher in seedlings treated by soil inoculation than litter inoculation; in contrast, fifteen positive genera, e.g., fungi <italic>Hypocrea</italic>, Pleosporales_unclassified, were more abundant in seedlings by litter inoculation than by soil inoculation, and higher in seedlings inoculated at G21 than three inoculation time treatment (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>).</p>

<p>We identified several bacterial functions in the roots and fungal function guilds enriched in the roots and leaves of <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedlings that were significantly correlated with the RI (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c-e</xref>). Two bacterial functions involved in the N cycle (nitrate ammonification and nitrite ammonification) in roots showed a significantly positive correlation with the RI (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>). The fungal guild Ectomycorrhizal showed a significantly positive correlation. Unexpectedly, the putative Plant Pathogen guild showed a significantly positive correlation with seedling growth, while the Arbuscular Mycorrhizal guild showed a negative correlation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7d,e</xref>). Those positive bacterial functions in roots and fungal guilds in leaves had greater relative abundances in the seedlings after litter inoculation than after soil inoculation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c,e</xref>); additionally, the positive fungal guilds in roots and leaves had significantly greater abundances in the seedlings of G21 than in those of the other three inoculation time points.

<title>Leaf litter microbes had more adverse effects on <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seed germination and seedling survival than soil microbes</title>
<p>Supporting our first expectation, leaf litter had more adverse effects on seed germination and seedling survival than soil (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Leaf litter has been previously reported to have adverse effects on seedling emergence and population establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abbas et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Möhler et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>) by reducing light and physical barriers and releasing allelochemicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abbas et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gross, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Möhler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Although our data also indicated that leaf litter can produce allelochemicals to delay seed germination time because sterile leaves cause longer germination time than non–sterile leaves, our study emphasized the adverse microbial role of leaf litter in seedling mortality (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Indeed, we found that leaf litter harbored more abundant bacterial and fungal genera associated with seedling mortality, as well as a greater proportion of plant pathogens than soil (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). The results implied that litter harboured many plant pathogens and thus played an essential role in mediating <italic>A. adenophora</italic> population density by killing conspecific seedlings.</p>
<p>These findings provide novel insights for understanding plant invasion. Invasive plants are commonly characterized by ruderal species, with rapid growth and a high yield of seeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baker, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Parsons WT, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Zheng et al., 2009</xref>). These traits are beneficial for rapid population establishment and range expansion at newly invaded sites. However, these invasive plant species commonly form high-density monocultures once the population is established, e.g., <italic>A. adenophora</italic>. In such a situation, high-density seedlings may exacerbate intraspecific competition. Self-limiting of the population elicited by leaf microbes may in turn help <italic>A. adenophora</italic> maintain monocultures at established sites. Thus, it is highly interesting to determine whether leaf microbe-mediated self-limitation at an early life stage is common and important in other invasive systems.</p>

<title>Peripheral microbial sources produce more adverse effects on seedling survival and growth when inoculated at the early growth stage than at the later stage</title>
<p>Supporting our second expectation, inoculation time significantly affected seedling survival and growth; in particular, seedling mortality was higher and seedlings grew more adversely when inoculated at G0 than at later growth stage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c,g</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). The plant growth stage could change the impact of plant host-associated microbes, and such an impact is always strongest in early plant growth stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bagchi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jevon et al., 2020</xref>). One potential reason is that small seedlings usually allocate most of their resources to survive and grow, while older seedlings have relatively more resources to defend against pathogen infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Geisen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Schloter &amp; Matyssek, 2009</xref>). For example, smaller seedlings were more sensitive to inoculated individual fungi, soil microbiota or litter addition than older seedlings due to fewer defense resources and little chance of recovering from biomass loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Geisen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jevon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). Another possible reason is related to the interaction between seed-borne microbes and peripheral microbial sources in young seedlings. There is evidence that seed–borne endophytes are likely to be beneficial for seedling growth and stress resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Herrera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wang &amp; Zhang, 2023</xref>). These seed endophytes might be inhibited or even excluded from young seedlings by external sources of microbes inoculated at G0, when seedlings are highly sensitive to inoculated microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Geisen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jevon et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, it is very valuable to determine how peripheral microbial sources interact with seed – borne endophytes in seedlings across ontogeny.</p>
<p>We did not observe an adverse effect of leaf litter microbes on <italic>A. adenophora</italic> growth, as observed previously by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kai Fang et al. (2019)</xref>, who inoculated <italic>A. adenophora</italic> at G0 (sowing seeds) because all seedlings by leaf litter inoculation at G0 died after transplantation into soils in this study. In contrast, both the microbial community and function were significantly positively correlated with seedling growth and had a greater relative abundance in seedlings inoculated with leaf litter than in those inoculated with soil, while those with a negative correlation showed the opposite trend (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). This fact suggested that leaf litter microbes might have a more positive effect on <italic>A. adenophora</italic> growth than soil microbes if inoculated during the latter growth stage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Interestingly, we found that N circle-related bacterial functions in seedling roots were positively correlated with seedling growth (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Zhao et al. (2019)</xref> showed that <italic>A. adenophora</italic> invasion increased N circle-related bacterial functional genes in soil and subsequently directly promoted plant growth and invasion. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">K. Fang et al. (2019)</xref> also reported that several root endophytic nitrogen–fixing bacteria of <italic>A. adenophora</italic> could significantly promote its growth. Interestingly, the abundance of these N circle–related bacterial functions was greater in seedling roots inoculated with leaf litter than in those inoculated with soil (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>), which suggests a possible way in which some N circle–related bacteria associated with leaf litter may migrate from leaves into roots after leaf litter inoculation.</p>

<title>Nutrient levels affect seedling mortality but not microbe-mediated <italic>A. adenophora</italic> growth</title>
<p>Nutrient addition could promote more severe invasion, as invasive plants often have higher performance under high nutrition than native plants. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Shan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Slate et al., 2022</xref>). However, it is unclear whether such an advantage involved in a changed microbial community-driven host growth effect. We also found that <italic>A. adenophora</italic> grew bigger and more rapidly in the high-nutrient treatment than in the low-nutrient treatment (Fig. S7); moreover, the nutrient level significantly changed the microbial community and bacterial function (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). However, in contrast to our third expectation, nutrient level negligently affected microbe-mediated <italic>A. adenophora</italic> growth, and the relative abundance of microbes and functions involved in seedling growth (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>,<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7a-e</xref>). Previously, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ai et al. (2018)</xref> reported that nutrient additions cause crops to enrich some bacteria and fungi from soil and increase yield; however, there is no evidence that the increased yield effect is due to enriched microbial communities. Our data indicated that the invasion advantage driven by high nutrient availability may be driven primarily by plant physiological traits, such as rapid nutrient absorption and growth strategies, rather than by enriched microbes. Alternatively, it is possible that our delayed harvest of seedlings under low nutrition level may cover the distinct microbial role in seedling growth between the two nutrient levels (see Method).</p>
<p>However, there was an interaction effect between nutrient level and inoculation period (Fig. S3). For example, high nutrient level resulted in a more significant positive microbial effect on seedling growth than low nutrient level when inoculated at G21, regardless of leaf litter or soil inoculation. It is unclear whether, during the first 21 days before inoculation, more beneficial seed endophytes are enriched to produce a more positive effect on seedling growth under high-nutrition conditions than under low-nutrition conditions, as seed endophytes can facilitate nutrient acquisition and subsequently promote plant growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Khalaf &amp; Raizada, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Sanchez-Lopez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Shao et al., 2021</xref>). Nonetheless, seedlings grown in high-nutrient soil had greater mortality than those grown in low-nutrient soil (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jessen et al. (2023)</xref> also reported that fertilization, independent of litter removal, significantly decreased the total number and richness of seedlings, likely because higher ammonium levels in fertilized plots could create a toxic environment for seedlings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Britto &amp; Kronzucker, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>The same microbial genera have distinct effects on <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedling survival versus growth</title>
<p>Correlation analysis of the microbial community and function with seedling survival and growth revealed several genera with distinct effects on seedling survival versus growth. For example, the bacterial genera <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> and <italic>Massilia</italic> are adverse to seedling survival but beneficial for later seedling growth (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4</xref>,<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Many strains belonging to these genera have been reported to promote the growth of many plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Jimenez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Luo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Qiao et al., 2019</xref>), including <italic>A. adenophora</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">K. Fang et al., 2019</xref>), because they are commonly involved in N<sub>2</sub> fixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Albino et al., 2006</xref>). However, some microbes, e.g., the fungi <italic>Mortierella</italic> and <italic>Hypocrea</italic>, were consistently beneficial to <italic>A. adenophora</italic> by reducing early seedling mortality and promoting later seedling growth (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4</xref>,<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). These fungi, as plant growth-promoting fungi (PGPFs), have been widely reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Contreras-Cornejo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Ozimek &amp; Hanaka, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wani et al., 2017</xref>). These findings suggested that microbial interactions are highly complicated during the early life stage of <italic>A. adeonophora</italic>. On the one hand, there may be sequential effects for some plant growth-promoting microbial groups. For example, bacteria <italic>Massilia, Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> may negatively affect seedling growth and even kill seedlings if the arrival time is too early after germination. On the other hand, such distinct effects of these bacterial groups on seedling survival versus growth may result from different species from the same genus or even from genetically distinct strains from one species. Interestingly, we found that most <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> ASVs enriched in seedlings (&gt;80%) had no share with the inoculum sources. This suggested that most of the bacterial ASVs with beneficial growth effects were from seeds rather than from the inocula (Fig. S9).</p>
<p>Surprisingly, related plant pathogen guilds showed a positive correlation with <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedling growth (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Because these putative plant pathogens were classified as plant pathogens based on the current database, it remains to be determined whether such putative plant pathogens for most native plant species are not detrimental to invader <italic>A. adenophora</italic> growth. Indeed, the pathogenicity of plant pathogens is often dependent on host plant identity, and it could switch from a beneficial endophyte to a pathogen or vice versa among host plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Delaye et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Tian et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

<title>Seedling-killing microbes are those associated with leaf litter</title>
<p>We found that most seedling-killing microbes isolated from dead seedlings were previously reported as leaf spot pathogens. For example, <italic>Alternaria</italic> (Pleosporaceae) and several genera belonging to the family Didymellaceae, such as <italic>Allophoma</italic>, <italic>Stagonosporopsis</italic>, <italic>Didymella</italic>, <italic>Boeremia</italic>, and <italic>Epicoccum</italic>, showed high seedling mortality (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). <italic>Alternaria</italic> sp. is often pathogenic to a large variety of plants, such as stem cancer, leaf blight or leaf spot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Leiminger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Thomma, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Vergnes et al., 2006</xref>), and members of <italic>Allophoma</italic> have also been reported as pathogens for dieback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Babaahmadi et al., 2018</xref>) and leaf spot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Garibaldi et al., 2012</xref>). All these fungi are leaf spot pathogens of <italic>A. adenophora</italic> and its neighboring native plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kai Fang et al., 2021</xref>). In particular, the numerically dominant <italic>Allophoma</italic> strains obtained in this study had the same ITS genes as the leaf endophyte and leaf spot pathogen <italic>Allophoma</italic> associated with <italic>A. adenophora</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kai Fang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Yang et al., 2023</xref>). Recently, these strains were identified as the novel species <italic>Mesophoma speciosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Yang et al., 2023</xref>).

Based on these results, these fungal genera likely exist in <italic>A. adenophora</italic> by a lifestyle switch from endophytic to pathogenic. The virulence of these strains for seedling survival under certain conditions may play an essential role in limiting the population density of <italic>A. adenophora</italic> monocultures.</p>

<title>Implications for developing biocontrol for <italic>A. adenophora</italic> invasion</title>
<p>Our data also have implications for the development of biocontrol agents for <italic>A. adenophora</italic> invasion. Currently, several leaf spot fungi, such as the leaf spot fungus <italic>Phaeoramularia</italic> sp., which is released against <italic>A. adenophora</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kluge, 1991</xref>); the white smut fungus <italic>Entyloma ageratinae</italic> against <italic>A. riparia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Barton et al., 2007</xref>); the rust fungus <italic>Uromycladium tepperianum</italic> against the weed <italic>Acacia saligna</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Wood, 2012</xref>); and the rust fungus <italic>Puccinia spegazzinii</italic> against <italic>Mikania micrantha</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Day &amp; Riding, 2019</xref>), have been used as biological agents for the control of plant invasion. These agents mainly control weeds by damaging the leaves, stems, and petioles and reducing growth rates, flowering, percentage cover and population density. In this study, the strains associated with leaf litter, such as <italic>Allophoma</italic> sp. and <italic>Alternaria</italic> sp., caused high seedling mortality and thus could control <italic>A. adenophora</italic> invasion at the seedling establishment stage. On the other hand, we found that an external source of microbes had a greater adverse effect on seedling survival and growth when inoculated at G0 than at the later growth stage.

<title>Sample collection and preparation</title>
<p>All seeds, rhizosphere soil (AAS) and leaf litter (AAL) of <italic>A. adenophora</italic> were collected from Xishan Forest Park, Kunming city, Yunnan Province (25°55′34″N; 102°38′30″E, 1890 m), on 9<sup>th</sup> April 2022. We collected dead leaves (litters) from the stems as inoculated leaves to avoid contamination by soil microbes; moreover, dead leaves could better represent litter in natural systems than fresh leaves. All leaf litter and soil samples were collected from five <italic>A. adenophora</italic> populations ∼200 m away from each other and treated as independent biological replicates. These <italic>A. adenophora</italic> plants grow in monoculture for more than 10 years, thus their rhizosphere soils and litters were used in our feedback experiment rather than via a typical two-phase approach (the first conditioning phase vs the second testing phase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brinkman et al., 2010</xref>). The collected soil and litter samples were naturally dried in a clean room and weighed. The soil was ground to a 2 mm sieve before weighing. For convenience in the inoculation application, we prepared these samples in leaf litter bags (each containing 2 g of leaf litter) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Zaret et al., 2021</xref>) and soil bags (each containing 5 g of soil) as well as 0.1 g of soil or litter (cut into smaller than 2×2 mm) in centrifuge tubes. All sample bags and tubes were divided into nonsterile and sterile groups and stored at 4°C until inoculation. The sterile groups (soils or litters) were sterilized by gamma irradiation (30 kGy, 30 h, Huayuan Nuclear Radiation Technology Co., Ltd., Kunming, China), which can kill all microorganisms because no colonies were formed after 7 days of inoculation on PDA media for gamma irradiation samples (see Fig. S6); moreover, there was no evidence that this irradiation method changed the chemistry of the samples. The non– sterile groups (soil or litter) were natural samples containing live microorganisms. The natural soil or litter (0.3 g) was weighed into tubes and placed at –80°C until DNA extraction.</p>

<title>Experimental design</title>
<p>The experimental design is shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>: (1) We inoculated <italic>A. adenophora</italic> with non–sterile rhizosphere soil and leaf litter of <italic>A. adenophora</italic> and sterile groups as control groups to distinguish the effects of aboveground from belowground microbes. (2) We inoculated soils or leaf litter of <italic>A. adenophora</italic> at three growth stages (0 d, 21 d, 28 d) to explore seedling susceptibility to microbial infection and growth effects. We performed inoculation on the day of sowing seeds on water agar plates (containing 5 g of agar and 500 mL of water) for germination, named G0 inoculation; on the 21<sup>st</sup> day after seedling growth, named G21; and on the 28<sup>th</sup> day after seedling growth, named G28. We further performed a combination inoculation, that is, inoculation on both the 21<sup>st</sup> and 28<sup>th</sup> days after seedling growth, named G21+28 inoculation. Therefore, we had four treatments for inoculation time. (3) We grew all the inoculated seedlings in background soil (made of Pindstrup substrate, pearlite and vermiculite at a volume ratio of 8:1:1, and nutrient content of Pindstrup substrate see Table S9) by adding the same volume of Hoagland nutrient solution (high nutrient level) or only water (low nutrient level) to the soil. In total, our experimental design included 4 inoculation time (G0, G21, G28, G21+28) × 2 inoculum sources (leaf litter, rhizosphere soil) × 2 microbial treatments (sterile, non–sterile) × 2 nutrient levels (high, low) × 5 replicates = 160 cups. All the cups were randomly placed in the growth chamber and rearranged randomly every week to mitigate potential positional effects. Seedlings were harvested after 8 weeks of growth under high nutrient conditions. We had to grow seedlings under low nutritional condition for another 4 weeks to harvest because they were too small to harvest, while those under high nutritional conditions grew too fast and up to the cup PTFE cover (see Fig. S7). No seedlings survived at G0 inoculation of non–sterile leaf litters when harvested. Stem height, dry aboveground biomass and underground biomass were measured at harvest. Fresh seedling leaves and roots (0.3 g) from three seedlings per treatment as three replicates when harvested were surface-sterilized for microbial community detection. The aboveground and underground dry biomasses for seedlings with less than 0.3 g fresh weight were obtained by linear regression (see Fig. S8). Seed germination and inoculation manipulation for each inoculation treatment are detailed in supplementary method 1 (also see <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>

<title>Molecular sequencing of the microbial community</title>
<p>To link microbial sources (leaf litter and soil) with seed germination, seedling mortality and subsequent seedling biomass, we sequenced the microbial community associated with inoculum samples (natural <italic>A. adenophora</italic> soils (AAS) and leaf litter (AAL)), as well as fresh leaves and roots of <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedlings grown in the non– sterile treatments. Fresh leaves and roots (0.3 g) of each seedling at harvest were chosen for surface sterilization and then stored at –80°C until total DNA was extracted. For DNA extraction, target‒gene amplification and sequencing steps, see Supplementary Method 2.</p>

<title>Seedling-killing fungus experiment</title>
<p>No dead seedlings were observed from Petri dishes inoculated with non–sterile soils at G0. Thus, we used 40 dead seedlings obtained from Petri dishes inoculated with non–sterile leaf litter at G0 to isolate fungi. Each dead seedling was cut into 1 mm × 1 mm pieces, and three tissues were placed on each PDA Petri dish and incubated at ambient temperature (20–25°C) for 6–8 days or until mycelia grew. Hyphal tip cultures were subsequently transferred onto new PDA plates and incubated until pure colonies appeared. The DNA of these purified fungal strains was extracted and identified by sequencing the ITS region (for details, see Supplementary Method 2).</p>
<p>To test the mortality of the fungal strains to seedlings, sixteen surface-sterilized <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seeds were sown in a water ager plate in a Petri dish. Ten similar-sized seedlings in one petri dish 21 days after sowing were selected for fungal inoculation. Five Petri dishes were used as five replicates for each strain. Fungi were grown on PDA for 7 days in an incubator at 25°C, after which 6 mm diameter agar discs with fungal mycelia were inoculated into seedlings by touching the leaves or stems (see Fig. S4). Seedlings were regarded as dead when the leaf and stem became brown and rotten. We recorded the number of dead seedlings after 14 days of inoculation of agar discs and then calculated the death rate (DR = the number of dead seedlings/10).</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>It is unreasonable to directly compare seedling biomass among treatments because of different seedling growth time under high or low soil nutrition condition (see method description above), the response index (RI) was calculated to evaluate the feedback intensity (or direction) of microbes in inocula soil or leaf: RI = (variable<sub>non-sterile</sub> – variable<sub>sterile</sub>)/variable<sub>sterile</sub>) (Bruce <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Williamson &amp; Richardson, 1988</xref>), then a one‒sample T test was used to define the significance between the RI value and zero, where RI &gt; 0 and &lt; 0 represent microbes to promote or inhibit seedling growth, respectively. Generalized linear models (GLMs) with Gaussian error distributions (identity link) generated by the “lme4” package were used to identify the effects of feedback, microbe, inoculation time, nutrient level treatments and their interaction on seedling mortality as well as the effects of feedback, inoculation time, nutrient level treatments and their interaction on the RI value. The R<sup>2</sup> values of the models were obtained by the “piecewiseSEM” package, and P values were estimated using the Anova function via chi-squared (χ2) tests in GLMs. The nonparametric Mann–Whitney U test was used to perform all two-group comparisons, and the Kruskal–Wallis test was performed to compare the differences in RI or microbial relative abundances among the four inoculation time treatments.</p>
<p>Nonparametric Mann–Whitney U tests, Kruskal–Wallis tests and one‒sample T tests were executed using SPSS v. 22.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis was used to visualize the similarities in bacterial and fungal composition and function among the treatments. Permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was performed with the ADONIS function in the R (v. 4.2.0) package “vegan” to test the differences in the bacterial and fungal communities and functions among the treatment groups. Bacterial functional profiles were predicted using functional annotation of prokaryotic taxa (FAPROTAX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Louca et al., 2016</xref>). Fungal functional guilds were inferred using the program FUNGuild, and guild assignments with confidence rankings of “Highly probable” and “Probable” were retained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Nguyen et al., 2016</xref>). The core microbial taxa were primarily selected from the ASVs that appeared (100% prevalence) among all the samples. Spearman’s correlation analysis was used to link microbial communities in inoculation sources (leaf litter and soils) with seed germination and seedling mortality in petri dishes of the non-sterile G0 treatment, as well as to link seedling growth with microbial communities or functions enriched by seedling leaves or roots based on all treatments. A correlation was considered significant when <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05. Heatmap plotting was performed in R 4.2.0 with the “pheatmap” package. To examine the phylogenetic signal of the seedling death rate to fungal strains, we calculated Pagel’s λ with the R package “phytools”, which measures the distribution of a trait across a phylogeny. A Pagel’s λ was closer to 1, indicating a stronger phylogenetic signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Pagel, 1999</xref>). The remaining figures were visualized in GraphPad Prism v7.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study advances our understanding of how leaf and soil microbes separately affect the performance of an invasive plant, Ageratina adenophora. The conclusions regarding the roles of litter microbes in regulating the A. adenophora population are currently supported only by <bold>incomplete</bold> evidence owing to limitations in experimental design and statistical analyses, as well as uncertainties associated with the presentation. The work will be of interest to invasion biologists.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The work by Zeng et al. comprehensively explored the differences in the effects of leaf and soil microbes on the seed germination, seedling survival, and seedling growth of an invasive forb, Ageratina Adenophora, and found evidence of stronger effects of leaf microbes on Ageratina compared with soil microbes, which were negative for seed germination and seedling survival but positive for seedling growth. By further DNA sequencing and fungal strain cultivation, the authors were able to identify some of the key microbial guilds that may facilitate such negative and positive feedback.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The theoretic framework is well-established.</p>
<p>(2) Relating the direction of plant-microbe feedback to certain microbial guilds is always hard, but the authors have done a great job of identifying and interpreting such relationships.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) In the G0 and G21 inoculation experiments, allelopathic effects from leaf litters had not been accounted for, while these two experiments happened to be the ones where negative feedback was detected.</p>
<p>(2) The authors did not compare the fungal strains accumulated in dead seedlings to those accumulated in live seedlings to prove that the live seedlings indeed accumulated lower abundances of the strains that were identified to increase seedling mortality.</p>
<p>(3) The data of seed germination and seedling mortality could have been analyzed in the same manner as that of seedling growth, which makes the whole result section more coherent. I don't understand why the authors had not calculated the response index (RI) for germination/mortality rate and conducted analyses on the correlation between these RIs with microbial compositions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study provides strong evidence that leaf microbes mediate self-limitation at an early life stage. It highlights the importance of leaf microbes in population establishment and community dynamics.</p>
<p>The authors conducted three experiments to test their hypothesis, elucidating the effects of leaf and soil microbial communities on the seedling growth of A. adenophora at different stages, screening potential microbial sources associated with seed germination and seedling performance, and identifying the fungus related to seedling mortality. The conclusions are justified by their results. Overall, the paper is well-structured, providing clear and comprehensive information.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your assessment.</p>

<p>(1) The theoretic framework is well-established.</p>
<p>(2) Relating the direction of plant-microbe feedback to certain microbial guilds is always hard, but the authors have done a great job of identifying and interpreting such relationships.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your assessment.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) In the G0 and G21 inoculation experiments, allelopathic effects from leaf litters had not been accounted for, while these two experiments happened to be the ones where negative feedback was detected.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did not directly test the allelopathic effects. However, our inoculation of sterile litter or soil indicated the potential allelopathic role in germination and seedling mortality. Interestingly, such allelopathic effects are elicited by leaf litter not by soil, which include delaying germination time (see Fig. 1a) and killing some seedlings (see Fig. 1c). Nonetheless, microbial effects are significantly more adverse than allelopathic (also see Fig. 1e). We will discuss this point in the resubmitted version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors did not compare the fungal strains accumulated in dead seedlings to those accumulated in live seedlings to prove that the live seedlings indeed accumulated lower abundances of the strains that were identified to increase seedling mortality.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your concerns. We have not isolated fungi from healthy seedlings to make a comparative study. However, our team work previously found that the seedling-killing Allophoma strains obtained in this study had the same ITS genes as the leaf endophyte and leaf spot pathogen Allophoma associated with mature A. adenophora individual; some seedling-killing Alternaria also occur in healthy seedlings inoculated by leaf litter. We thus assumed that these seedling-killing fungi, e.g., Allophoma and Alternaria, likely exist in A. adenophora mature individual by a lifestyle switch from endophytic to pathogenic, and these fungi can kill seedling only at very early life stage of A. adenophora.</p>
<p>Thus, we discussed this point as: “We did not isolate fungi from healthy seedlings in this study. However, a previous report revealed that the dominant genera in healthy seedlings inoculated with leaf litter were Didymella and Alternaria (Kai Fang et al., 2019). Based on these results, these fungal genera likely exist in A. adenophora by a lifestyle switch from endophytic to pathogenic. The virulence of these strains for seedling survival under certain conditions may play an essential role in limiting the population density of A. adenophora monocultures.” See Lines 416-435.</p>
<p>Here, we also will consider adding more sentences to discuss your concerns in the resubmitted version as: “It is worth to explore the dynamic of these strains along with seedling development and to determine if these strains kill seedling only at very early stage.”</p>

<p>(3) The data of seed germination and seedling mortality could have been analyzed in the same manner as that of seedling growth, which makes the whole result section more coherent. I don't understand why the authors had not calculated the response index (RI) for germination/mortality rate and conducted analyses on the correlation between these RIs with microbial compositions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much. Response index (RI) was calculated as: (variablenon-sterile–variablesterile)/variablesterile)). Because mortality rates of some sterile groups were zero values, it is impossible to calculate their RIs. Relatively, microbes rarely affect seed germination time (GT) and rate (GR) (see Fig. 1a,b). Therefore, we preferred to make a direct comparison of their difference between non-sterile and sterile treatments (see also Figure S2), and we also conducted a correlation by these values with microbial compositions rather than by RIs (see Fig. 4).</p>
<p>We will emphasis this point in the Materials and Methods when resubmit our revision.</p>
