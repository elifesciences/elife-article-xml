<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Dynamic interactions between gut mucosal cells and the external environment are essential to maintain gut homeostasis. Enterochromaffin (EC) cells transduce both chemical and mechanical signals and produce 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) to mediate disparate physiological responses. However, the molecular and cellular basis for functional diversity of ECs remains to be adequately defined. Here, we integrated single-cell transcriptomics with spatial image analysis to identify fourteen EC clusters that are topographically organized along the gut. Subtypes predicted to be sensitive to the chemical environment and mechanical forces were identified that express distinct transcription factors and hormones. A <italic>Piezo2<sup>+</sup></italic> population in the distal colon was endowed with a distinctive neuronal signature. Using a combination of genetic, chemogenetic and pharmacological approaches, we demonstrated <italic>Piezo2<sup>+</sup></italic> ECs are required for normal colon motility. Our study constructs a molecular map for ECs and offers a framework for deconvoluting EC cells with pleiotropic functions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The capacity of the gut epithelium to sense and react to its surrounding environment is essential for proper homeostasis. Enteroendocrine (EEC) cells within the gut epithelium respond to a wide range of stimuli, such as dietary nutrients, irritants, microbiota products, and inflammatory agents by releasing a variety of hormones and neurotransmitters to relay sensory information to the nervous system, musculature, immune cells, and other tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. In particular, enterochromaffin (EC) cells represent one of the major epithelial sensors. Historically, EC cells were histologically identified as the first type of gastrointestinal endocrine cells and have been thought of as a single cell type for about seven decades, until the emergence of recent studies that point to their heterogeneity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>EC cells constitute less than 1% of the total intestinal epithelium cells, but they produce &gt;90% of the body’s 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> to modulate a wide range of physiological functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Dysregulation of peripheral 5-HT levels is implicated in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal (GI) diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, cardiovascular disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, osteoporosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, and are associated with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> as well as psychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. The distinct and highly diverse functions of peripheral 5-HT suggest the possibility of specialization of EC sub-types that react to specific stimuli, such as chemicals in the lumen of the gut, mechanical forces, dietary toxins, microbiome metabolites, inflammatory mediators, and other GI hormones.</p>
<p>Since EC cells are infrequent and distributed throughout the gut wall, traditional approaches have utilized endocrine tumor cell lines, whole tissue preparations or genetic models (such as tryptophan hydroxylase 1 knockout) to investigate the functions of EC cells, which have generally assumed that EC cells are a single cell type and have not addressed their heterogeneity in sensory modalities. A recent study exploited intestinal organoids and described EC cells as polymodal chemical sensors, but lacked the resolution to disentangle the origin of the polymodality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Some studies have compared small intestinal and colonic EC cells by RT-PCR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, and one study used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to compare a small number of human EC cells from the stomach and duodenum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Single-cell transcriptomics have been utilized to profile intestinal epithelia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> and enteroendocrine cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, which include EC cells, however, questions regarding regional, molecular and functional heterogeneity of EC cells remain to be investigated in depth.</p>
<p>Here, we generated a genetic reporter of tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (Tph1), the rate-limiting enzyme of 5-HT synthesis in EC cells, and applied scRNA-seq to profile &gt;6,000 EC cells. Together with spatial imaging analysis at single-cell resolution, we identified 14 clusters of EC cells distributed along the rostro-caudal and crypt-villus axes of the gut. We stratified EC subsets based on their repertoires of sensory molecules. In particular, we demonstrate an important role of the <italic>Piezo2<sup>+</sup>/Ascl1<sup>+</sup>/Tph1<sup>+</sup></italic>subpopulation in normal gut motility, one of the proposed functions of EC-derived 5-HT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Our comprehensive molecular resource and findings provide direct evidence of molecular and cellular heterogeneity of EC cells and is anticipated to be valuable for future studies.</p>

<title>Generation and characterization of a <italic>Tph1-bacTRAP</italic> reporter model</title>
<p>To systematically analyze EC cells we generated a <italic>Tph1</italic>-bacTRAP mouse strain by placing a <italic>RPL10-GFP</italic> fusion gene under the transcriptional control of the <italic>Tph1</italic> gene in a BAC construct (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). In this <italic>Tph1</italic>-bacTRAP line, all GFP<sup>+</sup> (representing Tph1<sup>+</sup>) cells in the duodenum and over 95% of the cells in the jejunum and large intestine were immunoreactive for 5-HT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). Cells that stained positive for 5-HT but negative for GFP were also observed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>), which are likely to include tuft cells that store but do not synthesize 5-HT (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Epithelial cells from the duodenum, jejunum, ileum and colon were isolated from the <italic>Tph1</italic>-bacTRAP mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>,<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">d</xref>), sorted <italic>via</italic> fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and both GFP<sup>+</sup> and GFP<sup>-</sup> cells were subjected to scRNA-seq. Among a total of 4,729 cells, <italic>Tph1</italic> transcripts were measured in 88.9% of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells, together with the chromogranin genes, <italic>Chga</italic> (in 97.3% of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells) and <italic>Chgb</italic> (in 98.8% of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells), established markers for EC cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>). Cluster analysis indicated that 23% of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were grouped with GFP<sup>-</sup> cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>), although these cells had higher levels of the EC marker genes compared to the GFP<sup>-</sup> cells they clustered with (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>,<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">f</xref>). It is possible that these cells are immature and have not yet fully differentiated. Thus, we refer to the GFP<sup>+</sup> cells that clustered with the GFP<sup>-</sup> cells together as unspecialized- or non-EC cells.</p>

<p>An independent single-cell profiling experiment was performed focusing on GFP<sup>+</sup> cells (0.3-0.5% of total dissociated epithelial cells) from the duodenum, jejunum, proximal and distal colon of the <italic>Tph1</italic>-bacTRAP mice, where numbers of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were adequate (i.e. excluding the ileum) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). 4,348 high-quality single cells were obtained, of which 19% comprised of non-EC cells and identified as stem cells, transit amplifying cells (TACs), immature enterocytes, mature enterocytes, colonocytes, T lymphocytes and mucosal mast cells based on their respective markers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1g</xref>). A total of 3,526 EC cells (at threshold &gt;500 detected genes and &lt;10% mitochondrial transcripts) were retained for analysis.</p>

<title><bold>Distinct EC subpopulations along the rostro-caudal axis</bold></title>
<p>EC cells are one of the few EEC cell types distributed along the full length of the GI tract. The most significant transcriptomic distinction was observed between small intestinal and colonic EC cells as revealed by principal component analysis (PCA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary Fig. 1h</xref>), even though all the EC cells expressed a core set of EC markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary Fig. 1i</xref>). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering complemented with bootstrap resampling partitioned EC single cells by regions based on their overall transcriptomic similarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary Fig. 1j</xref>). The regional distinction of EC cells is apparent from the examination of transcription factors (TFs) along the rostro-caudal axis. While <italic>Pitx2</italic> and <italic>Osr2</italic> demonstrated preferential enrichment in different segments of the gut, a suite of <italic>Hox</italic> genes were only observed in the colon, with <italic>Hoxb13</italic> specifically detected in the distal colon (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). This pattern was shared by all gut epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary Fig. 1k</xref>) and was largely conserved in the human gut mucosa based on our comparative analysis of a scRNA-seq dataset of biopsy samples from human ileum, colon and rectum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Notably, <italic>OSR2</italic> and <italic>HOXB13</italic> were restricted to the ileum and rectum respectively in humans (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). Consistent with a previous study, <italic>Olfr78</italic> and <italic>Olfr558</italic> were enriched in the colon but not the small intestine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To investigate the diversity of EC cells within each intestinal region, we clustered them using the Louvain method for unsupervised community detection and resolved 14 EC clusters that were mostly demarcated by regions: duodenum (clusters 1-6), jejunum (clusters 7-10), proximal colon (clusters 11-12), and distal colon (clusters 13-14, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g,h</xref>). The EC cells from either duodenum (clusters 1-5) or jejunum (clusters 7-10) displayed a continuum in t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (tSNE) space, indicating a gradual transcriptomic change in the SI, whereas colonic EC cells formed clusters distinct from the SI clusters (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g,h</xref>). Interestingly, cluster 6 (duodenum EC cells) was projected away from the rest of the SI EC cells in the tSNE space, suggesting a distinct molecular profile of the cells (see below).</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>SI EC cells are predicted to switch sensors and hormone compositions along the crypt-villus axis</title>
<p>Next, we resolved the identities of the EC clusters using both known and newly identified marker genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h,i</xref>). Since all intestinal EEC cells, including EC cells, derive from Neurog3<sup>+</sup> cells, we annotated the <italic>Neurog3</italic><sup>+</sup> clusters as EC progenitors in the duodenum (cluster 1) and jejunum (cluster 7). Lineage tracing studies have established that crypt and villus EC cells preferentially express <italic>Tac1</italic> (encoding tachykinin precursor 1) and <italic>Sct</italic> (encoding secretin), respectively (independently validated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">e</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. We annotated clusters 4/5 (duodenum) and 8/9 (jejunum) as crypt clusters and clusters 2/3/6 (duodenum) and 10 (jejunum) as villus clusters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>) based on the relative expression levels of <italic>Tac1</italic> and <italic>Sct</italic>. We note that this division is not precise, but reflects a gradient between cells in the crypts and villi.</p>

<p>Since a spatial transcriptomic zonation along the crypt-villus axis had been demonstrated in intestinal enterocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> and EEC cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, we further investigated whether EC cells diversify their transcriptome along the same axis to be poised for various functions. Using differential expression (DE) analysis, we identified a set of signature genes that were preferentially enriched in EC clusters annotated as being from the villus or crypt (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Fig. 2f</xref>). Their differential distribution was further tested to be statistically significant by comparing to bootstrap-facilitated randomization of gene subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Fig. 2g</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">h</xref>).</p>
<p>To validate the spatial distribution of candidate genes, we utilized single-molecule RNA-FISH (smRNA-FISH) as an orthogonal method. We found that molecular sensors, such as <italic>Trpa1</italic> and <italic>Trpm2</italic>, together with additional hormone peptides, such as <italic>Ucn3</italic> and <italic>Cartpt</italic>, were differentially distributed in the EC cells along the crypt-villus axis. To illustrate, scRNA-seq suggested that <italic>Ucn3</italic> (encoding urocortin3) was frequently observed in the crypt clusters 4/5, whereas <italic>Cartpt</italic> (encoding cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript prepropeptide) was enriched in the villus cluster 3 and to a lesser degree in cluster 4 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Consistently, smRNA-FISH demonstrated that <italic>Ucn3</italic> and <italic>Cartpt</italic> were selectively co-expressed with <italic>Tph1</italic>, but not with <italic>Cck</italic> (encoding cholecystokinin; expressed in cluster 6 as discussed below) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b,c</xref>). Specifically, <italic>Ucn3</italic> was found in 57.0% (± 3.3%) of <italic>Tph1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells at the crypt or the neck of the villus, but observed in 24.0% (±2.1%) of <italic>Tph1<sup>+</sup></italic> at the villus. In contrast, <italic>Cartpt</italic> was found in 63% (±3.5%) and 16% (± 0.5%) of <italic>Tph1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells in the villus and crypt, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b-d</xref>). Another pair of examples is the phytochemical sensor <italic>Trpa1</italic> (encoding transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily A, member 1) and a novel sensor gene <italic>Trpm2</italic> (encoding transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 2). <italic>Trpa1</italic> was frequently detected in the crypt cluster 5 in scRNA-seq, in agreement with its crypt location previously reported in rodent and human intestine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, whereas <italic>Trpm2</italic> cells were mostly distributed in the villus clusters based on scRNA-seq analysis and further validated by smRNA-FISH to be co-expressed with 75% (±4.1%) and 12.5% (±0.4%) of <italic>Tph1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells in the villi and crypt, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d,e</xref>). Taken together, our findings are suggestive of a concomitant signature switch in the EC cells from <italic>Tac1/Unc3/Trpa1</italic> to <italic>Sct/Cartpt/Trpm2</italic> as the cells migrate from the crypt to the villus. In addition, scRNA-seq indicated that genes associated with oxidative detoxification including peroxidases and oxygenases (e.g.<italic>Gstk1</italic>, <italic>Alb, Fmo1 and Fmo2)</italic> were preferentially enriched in the crypt clusters 5/4, in contrast to the villus clusters 2/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Fig. 2f</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Reg4, Ucn3, Trpa1, Gstk1,</italic> and <italic>Fmo1</italic> expression levels are very low in progenitor clusters 1 and 7, which is consistent with reports from a time-resolved lineage tracing model that suggest that these genes are expressed late in the differentiation process of EEC cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To assess the functional states of the duodenal and jejunal EC clusters, we performed gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis based on cluster-enriched genes (identified as log<sub>2</sub>(fold-change)&gt;2, FDR&lt;10<sup>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>, data not shown). Consistent with its annotation as a progenitor cluster, cluster 1 was enriched with terms ‘translation’ and ‘ribosome biogenesis’, suggestive of a high protein production state. Crypt clusters 4/5 were enriched with terms related to metabolism and hydroxy compound/alcohol metabolic process/detoxification, whereas villus clusters 2/3 were enriched with terms ‘hemostasis’, ‘viral process’ and ‘neutrophil degranulation’, suggesting the villus clusters may be involved in host defense (also see below for cluster 6).</p>

Among all the EC clusters, the largest number of hormone-coding genes was observed in cluster 6 expressing the highest levels of <italic>Sct, Cck</italic> and <italic>Ghrl</italic>, followed by <italic>Gcg</italic> and <italic>Nts</italic> (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2i</xref>). Cluster 6 was almost exclusively constituted of duodenal EC cells (198/203, 97.5%) and comprised 10.9% of all retained duodenal EC cells (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>), thus representing &lt;0.1% of total duodenal epithelial cells. To validate this small population, we investigated the co-expression of hormonal products by immunohistochemistry in the duodenum and found that 5.8 (±1.4%) of 5-HT expressing cells were positive for CCK, representing 30.9 (±6.6%) of CCK positive cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g-i</xref>). Notably, of the 5-HT/CCK double positive cells, a large proportion demonstrated positivity for ghrelin (GHR, 82%), oxyntomodulin (OXM, 39.5%), one of the peptide products of the pre-proglucagon gene (<italic>Gcg</italic>), neurotensin (NTS, 8.9%), and a small percentage was positive for glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP, 3.0%). These percentages were significantly reduced in 5-HT<sup>+</sup>/CCK<sup>-</sup> cells, which presented 4.8%, 3.2%, 3.7%, and 1.2% positivity for GHR, OXM, NTS and GIP, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2i</xref>).

Using smRNA-FISH, we found that 100% of the <italic>Cck<sup>+</sup>/Tph1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells were positive for <italic>Oc3</italic>, whereas only 11.4% (±2.1%) of <italic>Cck<sup>-</sup>/Tph1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells and 58% (±3.7%) of <italic>Cck<sup>+</sup>/Tph1<sup>-</sup></italic> cells were positive for <italic>Oc3</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a-c</xref>). <italic>Oc3</italic> single-positive cells were rarely observed (1.8% ±2.4% of 970 counted cells examined for <italic>Cck</italic>, <italic>Oc3</italic>, and <italic>Tph1</italic>; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b,d</xref>), indicating that <italic>Oc3</italic> is largely restricted to <italic>Cck<sup>+</sup></italic> and/or <italic>Tph1<sup>+</sup></italic> populations and may be associated with the specification of <italic>Cck<sup>+</sup>/Tph1<sup>+</sup></italic>cells. Notably, triple-positive cells (<italic>Cck<sup>+</sup>/Oc3<sup>+</sup>/Tph1<sup>+</sup></italic>) were more frequently observed in the villus (25 out of every 100 counted single-, double-, or triple-positive cells) than in the crypt (6 out of every 100 single-, double-, or triple-positive cells; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). Focusing on <italic>Oc3<sup>+</sup></italic>cells identified <italic>via</italic> smRNA-FISH, we found that the fraction of <italic>Cck<sup>+</sup>/Oc3<sup>+</sup></italic> cells decreased from 69.3% (±0.98%) in the crypt to 22.8% (±5.3%) in the villus, while <italic>Tph1<sup>+</sup>/Oc3<sup>+</sup></italic> cells increased from 17.3% (±2.4%) in the crypt to 38.0% (±3.2%) in the villus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>), suggesting a likelihood that <italic>Cck<sup>+</sup>/Oc3<sup>+</sup></italic>double positive cells gradually acquire the ability to generate <italic>Tph1</italic> transcripts during their migration to the villus.

<p>We further determined the molecular signature unique to <italic>Cck<sup>+</sup>/Oc3<sup>+</sup>/Tph1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells by contrasting them to the rest of the EC cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>), or other EEC cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3j</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3h</xref>,<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">i</xref>). Specifically, discrete expression of <italic>Crp</italic> (encoding C-reactive protein) was identified in cluster 6 by scRNA-seq and mapped to <italic>Cck+/Tph1+</italic> cells by smRNA-FISH (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>). Crp is a secreted bacterial pattern-recognition receptor involved in complement-mediated phagocytosis, known to be secreted by hepatocytes in response to inflammatory cytokines during infection or acute tissue injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Similarly, several genes encoding molecules recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) were found in cluster 6 cells, including <italic>Tril</italic> (encoding TLR4 interactor with leucine rich repeats), <italic>Tlr2</italic> (encoding Toll-like receptor 2) and <italic>Tlr5</italic> (encoding Toll-like receptor 5). We validated the latter two by smRNA-FISH to be specific in <italic>Cck<sup>+</sup>/Tph1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>,<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">c</xref>), supporting the notion that these cells play a role in pathogen or toxin recognition. Concordantly, <italic>Bcam,</italic> encoding a cell surface receptor that recognizes a major virulence factor (CNF1) of pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, was enriched in cluster 6 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). Along with cluster 6, the two villus clusters (cluster 2/3) were enriched with GO terms associated with host defense (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>), suggesting a continuous evolution of EC cells along the crypt-villus axis to specify a complex subpopulation that mediates acute responses to tissue challenge. In addition to the unique signature of pathogen/toxin recognition, genes encoding G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) associated with nutrient sensing and energy homeostasis, <italic>Mc4r</italic> and <italic>Casr</italic>, were distinctly identified in cluster 6 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). Mc4r (melanocortin receptor 4, encoded by <italic>Mc4r</italic>) plays a central role in energy homeostasis and satiety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. CaR (calcium-sensing receptor, encoded by Casr) acts as a sensor for extracellular calcium and aromatic amino acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. We further validated expression of <italic>Mc4r</italic> and <italic>Casr</italic> by smRNA-FISH to be specific to <italic>Cck<sup>+</sup>/Tph1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells but not single-<italic>Tph1<sup>+</sup></italic> or <italic>Cck<sup>+</sup></italic> cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3e</xref>,<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">f</xref>). Although the nutrient sensing GPCRs were observed at relatively lower levels and frequencies in scRNA-seq data (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e,j</xref>), among the <italic>Mc4r<sup>+</sup></italic> or <italic>Casr<sup>+</sup></italic> cells, &gt;85% of them co-expressed at least one of the genes associated with pathogen/toxin recognition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3j</xref>). Together, these results suggest that a dual molecular signature associated with disparate functions can be resolved in the <italic>Cck<sup>+</sup>/Tph1<sup>+</sup>/Oc3<sup>+</sup></italic>cells. Additionally, numerous genes encoding enzymes/enzyme modulators (<italic>Pcg, Pzp, Habp2</italic>) or proteins related with oxidation state (<italic>Cyp2j5, Cyp2j6, Aldoc, etc</italic>) were highly enriched in cluster 6 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, to provide a broader cellular context for the <italic>Cck<sup>+</sup>/Oc3<sup>+</sup>/Tph1<sup>+</sup></italic>cells, we profiled <italic>Neurod1<sup>+</sup></italic> EEC cells by scRNA-seq after crossing <italic>Neurod1-Cre</italic> mice with <italic>Rosa26-LSL-tdTomato</italic> mice. Among the 4,397 single EEC cells retained (at threshold &gt;500 detected genes and &lt;10% mitochondrial transcripts per cell) from duodenum, jejunum and colon, broad co-expression of hormone-coding transcripts was observed (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3h</xref>) as in previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. To be compatible with conventional classification, clusters were annotated based on the most or second most abundant hormone-coding transcripts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3i</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3g</xref>,<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">h</xref>). For simplicity, we assigned the diffuse clusters of <italic>Tph1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells into either the SI EC cluster or proximal/distal colon EC clusters (based on <italic>Hox</italic> genes) and subdivided the <italic>Cck<sup>+</sup></italic> cells into <italic>Cck</italic> dominating I cells, <italic>Cck</italic> and <italic>Nts</italic> co-expressing N cells, and <italic>Cck</italic> and <italic>Gcg</italic> co-expressing L cells, and the above described <italic>Cck</italic><sup>+</sup>/<italic>Tph1<sup>+</sup></italic>cells, reasoning that <italic>Tph1</italic> transcripts were otherwise restricted within the EC lineage (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3g</xref>,<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">h</xref>). The close relationship of I, N and L cells evident in our dataset is in agreement with a previous study revealing a temporal progression from L to I and N cells using a real-time EEC reporter mouse model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. In addition, <italic>Zcchc12</italic> and <italic>Hhex</italic> were found to be specifically expressed in X and δ clusters respectively, consistent with prior work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Among the <italic>Neurod1+</italic> EEC cells, a discrete cluster with high levels of <italic>Cck</italic>, <italic>Sct</italic>, <italic>Tph1, and Ghrl</italic>, together with <italic>Gcg</italic> and <italic>Nts</italic> transcripts, was identified and annotated as a <italic>Cck<sup>+</sup>/Tph1<sup>+</sup></italic> cluster (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3i</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3g</xref>,<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">h</xref>). <italic>Oc3</italic> and key signature genes resolved in cluster 6 were also specifically identified in this <italic>Cck<sup>+</sup>/Tph1<sup>+</sup></italic> population (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3j</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3h</xref>,<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">i</xref>). We thus conclude that the <italic>Cck<sup>+</sup>/Tph1<sup>+</sup></italic> population in the <italic>Neurod1-tdTomato</italic> dataset is the equivalent of the cluster 6 in the <italic>Tph1-GFP</italic> dataset. A previous investigation with a <italic>Neurog3</italic> reporter identified <italic>Oc3</italic> in a subset of I and N cells, but did not resolve the molecular features of these cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Another example where these cells may have previously been identified is a single-cell analysis of proglucagon-expressing cells, which identified a cluster expressing <italic>Tph1</italic>, <italic>Cck</italic>, <italic>Sct</italic>, <italic>Ghrl</italic>, <italic>Gcg</italic>, and <italic>Nts</italic>, along with <italic>Casr</italic>, <italic>Mc4r</italic>, and <italic>Pzp</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Taken together, our scRNA-seq profiling from two different genetic models, multiplex fluorescent smRNA-FISH and immunohistochemistry analysis of protein expression coordinately identified a discrete subpopulation of enteroendocrine cells preferentially located in the tip of villi in the duodenum and features a complex molecular signature, including a set of sensors associated with pathogen/toxin recognition and another set linked to nutrient sensing.</p>

We further validated this finding by smRNA-FISH (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4g</xref>,<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">h</xref>) and by a similar finding from human mucosa single cells (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4i</xref>-<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">k</xref>). However, our study may not have detected low levels of <italic>Gpbar1</italic> expression. A previous study suggested that <italic>Gpbar1</italic> is expressed in EC cells, but not enriched compared to other cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. In contrast to these cluster-specific sensors, the long chain fatty acid receptor <italic>Ffar1</italic> (<italic>Gpr40</italic>) was found in almost all <italic>Cck<sup>+</sup></italic> cells, as well as in <italic>Gcg<sup>+</sup></italic> L cells from both SI and colon. <italic>Ffar2 (Gpr43)</italic> and <italic>Ffar3 (Gpr41/42)</italic> encode GPCRs that recognize microbial metabolites, the former of which we widely observed in all EEC cells except K cells, whereas the latter we primarily detected in the closely related L,I and N cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3j</xref>).

<p>Cluster 12 EC cells, on the other hand, are specialized in microorganism metabolite sensing. <italic>Olfr558</italic> (encoding olfactory receptor 558) and <italic>Olfr78</italic> (encoding olfactory receptor 78), two genes encoding GPCRs sensing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, were enriched in cluster 12 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a,b</xref>).

It is possible that cluster 12 EC cells may sense pathogens and transmit hormonal signals or (a) neurotransmitter(s) to evoke immune responses in the proximal colon. Using smRNA-FISH, we further mapped <italic>Olfr558</italic> and <italic>Il12a</italic> transcripts to a separate subset of EC cells expressing <italic>Cpb2</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b,c</xref>), confirming the presence of two subpopulations of EC cells associated with different physiological roles in the proximal colon.</p>

<title>Mechanosensor <italic>Piezo2</italic> is enriched in neuron-like distal colonic EC cells</title>
<p>Next, we focused on determining the unique properties of distal colonic EC cells. <italic>Ascl1</italic>, encoding Mash1 (mammalian achaete-scute homolog 1), is required for early neural tube specification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Unexpectedly, <italic>Ascl1</italic> was found in the distal colonic EC cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>, 4a; clusters 13 and 14) and was exclusively mapped to <italic>Tph1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells but not to <italic>Pyy<sup>+</sup></italic>cells in the distal colon, nor to any cell of the proximal colon or jejunum in smRNA-FISH analysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref> and Supplementary Fig 5c). Importantly, this feature was conserved in the human gut mucosa, where <italic>ASCL1</italic> was only detected in the <italic>TPH1<sup>+</sup></italic>cells from the rectum (<italic>HOXB13</italic> high) (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig 5d</xref>).</p>
<p>Expression of <italic>Ascl1</italic> in distal colonic EC cells suggests a possibility these cells have acquired a neuronal-like profile. To test this, we compared EC cells with neuropeptidergic hypothalamic neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>, which produce many hormone peptides similar to those found in the gut enteroendocrine cells. Prominently, EC cells from the distal colon, in contrast to their counterparts from other GI regions, were overwhelmingly associated with GO terms ‘neuron projection morphogenesis’, ‘axon development’ and ‘microtubule-based process’ (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref> and Supplementary Fig 5e). Numerous genes indicative of neuronal identity were mutually enriched in distal colonic ECs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref>). Consistently, EC cells in the distal colon exhibited unique long basal processes, often extending for 50-100 µm, with 5-HT concentrated in the long processes, in contrast to the typical open-type, flask-shaped enteroendocrine cells observed in the proximal colon or SI (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref> and Supplementary Fig 5f)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. The function of these long basal processes is unknown but is unlikely to be related to synaptic transmission as there is no evidence of close apposition between the processes and neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Taken together, EC cells in the distal colon demonstrated molecular and cellular characteristics reminiscent of neurons, which is distinctive from all the other gut enteroendocrine cells.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we identified cilium-related features in a subset of the distal colonic EC cells. In cluster 13, <italic>Foxj1</italic> and <italic>Dnah9</italic>, encoding a TF (forkhead box protein J1) and an axonemal dynein (dynein heavy chain 9, axonemal) required for cilia formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>, respectively, were selectively enriched (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>) and validated by smRNA-FISH in the distal colonic EC cells but not in the proximal colonic EC cells or <italic>Pyy<sup>+</sup></italic> L cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4h</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5g</xref>). Genes associated with GO terms ‘cilium assembly/organization’ were also enriched in the distal colonic EC cells (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>,<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">h</xref>). Primary cilium is a specialized cell surface projection that functions as a sensory organelle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>, where GPCRs (e.g., rhodopsins, olfactory and taste receptors, Smo, <italic>etc</italic>) can be located to and sense the immediate surrounding environment to activate downstream signalling(s)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Consistent with the molecule features, we identified cilia by immunostaining against intraflagellar transport protein 88 (IFT88), an essential component for axonemal transportation, and found exclusive co-staining of IFT88 with 5-HT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4i</xref>). Gene enrichment analysis of the <italic>Foxj1<sup>+</sup></italic> EC cells also revealed concordant expression of <italic>Olfr78</italic> in cluster 13 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>), an observation validated by smRNA-FISH (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5i</xref>) and suggesting that a subset of distal colonic EC cells (cluster 13) represent specialized sensory cells that detect microbial products.</p>
<p>Most prominently, in the distal colon, <italic>Piezo2</italic>, encoding a mechanosensitive ion channel, was identified in almost all EC cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). smRNA-FISH further revealed robust expression of <italic>Piezo2</italic> in the <italic>Ascl1<sup>+</sup>/Tph1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells residing in the epithelial layer of distal colon mucosa (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). In addition, we noticed low levels (1 to 5 puncta per cell) of <italic>Piezo2</italic> signals in the lamina propria beneath the epithelium throughout the gut which contains mainly immune cells and connective tissue cells (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>). In contrast to <italic>Piezo2</italic>, <italic>Piezo1</italic> transcripts were either undetectable or sparsely observed (1 or 2 puncta per cell) in epithelium and lamina propria (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>). <italic>Piezo2</italic> was not detected in the <italic>Tph1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells from the proximal colon, ileum, jejunum and duodenum <italic>via</italic> smRNA-FISH (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b,c</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>). However, previous studies have demonstrated <italic>Piezo2</italic> expression in human and mouse small intestine by RT-PCR and confirmed localization in EC cells by immunohistochemistry, suggesting that <italic>Piezo2</italic> is expressed at levels below the detection threshold of the current study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. To further evaluate the variation of <italic>Piezo2</italic> expression, we sorted GFP<sup>-</sup> and GFP<sup>+</sup> cells from various segments of the gut isolated in the <italic>Tph1-bacTRAP</italic> animals and quantitated <italic>Piezo2</italic> and other newly identified signature genes by qPCR analysis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 6c</xref>,<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">d</xref>). A significant enrichment of <italic>Piezo2</italic>, up to 360-fold, was observed in the GFP<sup>+</sup> cells sorted from the distal colon, when compared to the GFP<sup>+</sup> cells from duodenum, jejunum, or proximal colon or to the GFP<sup>-</sup> cells from the same regions. Based on multiple lines of evidence, we conclude that <italic>Piezo2</italic> is preferentially enriched in neuron-like distal colonic EC cells. Furthermore, a concomitant expression of <italic>Piezo2</italic> with <italic>Foxj1</italic> and <italic>Olfr78</italic> was revealed by scRNA-seq (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>, cluster 13) and validated by smRNA-FISH (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5i</xref>), which suggests that a subpopulation of <italic>Piezo2<sup>+</sup>/Tph1<sup>+</sup></italic>cells are mechanosensory cells.</p>

<title><italic>Piezo2<sup>+</sup>/Ascl1<sup>+</sup>/Tph1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells are required for normal colon motility</title>
<p>It is well documented that mechanical pressure or volume change within the gut lumen stimulates serotonin release from EC cells and initiates secretion and peristalsis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. <italic>Piezo2</italic> is a mechanosensitive ion channel required in several pressure-sensing physiological systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>.

In addition, they found that mechanical stimulation evokes 5-HT release in primary colon cultures. A recent study has now shown that in an epithelial specific <italic>Piezo2</italic> knock-out model whole gut transit and colon transit times are slower compared to wild type animals and, in an <italic>ex vivo</italic> colonic motility assay, small shear forces increase frequency of colonic contractions in wild type but not knock out animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. We have further validated the role of Piezo2 in colon motility, with a focus on the distal colon <italic>Piezo2</italic><sup>+</sup>/<italic>Ascl1<sup>+</sup>/Tph1<sup>+</sup></italic>cells.</p>
<p>First, we generated a <italic>Piezo2-CHRM3*</italic> model by crossing <italic>Piezo2-IRES-cre</italic> knock-in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup> with <italic>Cre</italic>-dependent activating DREADD mice (<italic>Rosa26-LSL-CHRM3*/mCitrine)</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>, such that upon administration of clozapine-N-oxide (CNO), <italic>Piezo2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells are chemically activated <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>). 15 minutes after intracolonic administration of CNO, a robust elevation (2.1 ±0.2 fold) of serum serotonin was observed in <italic>Piezo2-CHRM3*</italic> mice, but not in WT, or <italic>Rosa26-LSL-CHRM3*</italic> mice following the same treatment, and no effect was observed with saline administration or in untreated animals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref> and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>). To investigate serotonin release, we sorted mCitrine<sup>+</sup>/Epcam<sup>+</sup> cells from various gut segments of the <italic>Piezo2-CHRM3*/mCitrine</italic> mice and evaluated serotonin release in response to CNO <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>-e). Despite the low levels of mCitrine signal, we identified and sorted ∼0.3% of mCitrine<sup>+</sup>/Epcam<sup>+</sup> cells from the distal colon. In contrast, this population was largely absent from the proximal colon and duodenum, suggesting <italic>Piezo2-cre</italic> is primarily operational in the distal colon of the epithelial compartment. Additionally, total serotonin levels in the mCitrine<sup>+</sup>/Epcam<sup>+</sup> cells from the distal colon were 4.7 (± 0.6) fold of those in the mCitrine<sup>-</sup>/Epcam<sup>+</sup> cells from the distal colon, proximal colon and duodenum (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 7c</xref>). Moreover, in response to CNO stimulation, serotonin release from the mCitrine<sup>+</sup>/Epcam<sup>+</sup> cells of distal colon was elevated by 1.9 (±0.19) fold, whereas mCitrine<sup>-</sup>/Epcam<sup>+</sup> cells failed to respond (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 7d</xref>,<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">e</xref>). Together, this data demonstrates that CNO-mediated activation of <italic>Piezo2+</italic> cells leads to robust serotonin release from epithelial EC cells.</p>
<p>We observed increased fecal pellet output from the <italic>Piezo2-CHRM3*</italic> mice within 15 minutes after CNO administration, in contrast to the WT controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g</xref>). In a bead expulsion assay (BEA), colon motility was found to be significantly accelerated, such that the time to expel an inserted bead was shortened from 7.24 (±2.0) min in wild type controls to 1.16 (±1.17) min in the <italic>Piezo2-CHRM3*/mCitrine</italic> animals after CNO treatment, while no difference was observed between wild type controls and <italic>Piezo2-CHRM3*/mCitrine</italic> animals in untreated or saline treated cohorts (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5h</xref> and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 7f</xref>).</p>
<p>We noticed that <italic>Htr4</italic>, encoding the 5-HT4 receptor, a prokinetic 5-HT receptor when activated, was selectively expressed by epithelium in the deep crypts of distal colon (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 6e</xref>). Meanwhile, the long basal processes of EC cells filled with 5-HT always extend towards the base of the crypts, where the <italic>Htr4</italic> is preferentially expressed (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 6f</xref>). This finding suggests close proximity of 5-HT release to its receptor.</p>
<p>Next, to investigate whether <italic>Piezo2<sup>+</sup>/Ascl1<sup>+</sup>/Tph1<sup>+</sup></italic> ECs are required for normal colon motility, we crossed <italic>Piezo2-IRES-cre</italic> with <italic>Rosa26-LSL-DTR</italic> (diphtheria toxin receptor)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup> to generate <italic>Piezo2-DTR</italic> mice, such that upon diphtheria toxin (DT) administration, <italic>Piezo2</italic><sup>+</sup> cells would be depleted. Systematic administration of DT led to lethality in the <italic>Piezo2-DTR</italic> mice within 12 hours, but not in the <italic>Rosa26-LSL-DTR</italic> or <italic>Piezo2-cre</italic> mice (data not shown), likely due to the essential function of Piezo2 in respiration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. To avoid lethality, we administrated DT intraluminally into the distal colon for 5 consecutive days and assessed distal colon motility by a 2-hour fecal pellet assay (FPA) and the bead expulsion assay (BEA) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). Profound co-depletion of <italic>Piezo2</italic> and <italic>Tph1</italic> transcripts was demonstrated by smRNA-FISH in the distal colon of the <italic>Piezo2-DTR</italic> mice, but not in the proximal colon or in the WT mice receiving the same DT treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b,c</xref> and <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref>). Substantial loss of 5-HT<sup>+</sup> cells was further validated by immunofluorescence staining in the distal colon, but not in the proximal colon, while the general epithelial architecture was well-maintained (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b,d</xref> and <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref>).

<title>Epithelial Piezo2 is important for normal colon motility</title>
<p>To directly test whether epithelial <italic>Piezo2</italic> is required to maintain normal colon motility, we used <italic>Villin-cre</italic> to deplete Piezo2 in gut epithelial cells. Unexpectedly, 15.9% of the <italic>Villin-cre;Piezo2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>mice (referred to as Piezo2 CKO hereafter) died around 21-34 days after birth, affecting both males and females.

<p>Lastly, we measured BEA and total GI transit time. A significant slowing of expulsion was revealed by BEA in the Piezo2 CKO mice (male 33.7 ±19.0 min, female 32.3 ±18.1 min) compared with littermate Piezo2<sup>fl/fl</sup> controls (male 9.25 ±2.2 min, female 8.9 ±1.5 min, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7d</xref>). In addition, prolonged whole gut transit time was observed in Piezo2 CKO mice (male 182 ±17.5 min, female 175 ±15.6 min) compared to littermate Piezo2<sup>fl/fl</sup> controls (male 146 ±11.7 min, female 143 ±13.7 min; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7e</xref>). To assess small intestinal transit, mice were euthanized 70 min after gavage of a fluorescent dye and the travel distance of the dye within the intestine was calculated as a percentage of total small intestinal length. No difference was observed in small intestine transit between Piezo2 CKO mice (95.9 ±2.6%) versus Piezo2<sup>fl/fl</sup> controls (96.6 ±2.2%, <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 9k</xref>). We then assessed fluorescent dye travel distance as a percentage of total colon length at 120 min after oral gavage, which was significantly shorter (51.2 ±5.6%) in the Piezo2 CKO mice compared to Piezo2<sup>fl/fl</sup> controls (72.1 ±4.1%, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7f,g</xref>). Taken together, loss of Piezo2 in epithelial EC cells primarily affected colon motility.</p>
<p>Collectively, our <italic>in vivo</italic> gain- and loss-of-function analyses demonstrated that <italic>Piezo2<sup>+</sup>/Ascl1<sup>+</sup>/Tph1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells are required for normal colon motility.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we integrated high-throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing with spatial imaging analysis and constructed an ontological and topographical map for enterochromaffin (EC) cells in mouse intestine. We resolved 14 EC subpopulations characterized by their expression of distinct chemical and mechanical sensors, transcription factors, subcellular structures, and explicit spatial distribution within the gut mucosa (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7h</xref>). Together with <italic>in vivo</italic> functional validation of one subtype of EC cells, our study offers a framework to categorize complex sensory cells with defined molecular traits and led us to propose the functional identities for some of the subpopulations (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), while others warrant future investigation due to the limited information on their roles in GI biology (e.g. <italic>Trmp2, Cartpt, Ucn3</italic>).</p>
<p>We demonstrate that the transcriptome diversity of EC cells is closely related to their spatial distribution. The first layer of complexity is defined along the rostro-caudal axis, between the small intestine and the colon. Together with a host of TFs defining the rostro-caudal axis, we observe a gradual enrichment of a neuron-like transcriptome from small intestine to proximal and distal colon, such that <italic>Ascl1</italic>, encoding a key TF required for early neural fate commitment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, is specifically expressed in the distal colonic EC cells. Concomitantly, these cells are featured with axon-like long basal processes and discrete expression of the mechanical sensor <italic>Piezo2</italic>. We resolved a second layer of complexity along the crypt-villus axis for the EC cells in a similar manner as described in EEC cells and enterocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>By combining scRNA-seq profiling from two different genetic models, smRNA-FISH and <italic>in vivo</italic> genetic ablation, our study demonstrated that <italic>Piezo2</italic> is preferentially expressed in distal colonic EC cells that also have neuronal expression profiles. Neuron-like features are seen in the morphology of EC in the mouse distal colon, many of these having long processes, 50-100 µm or longer, that contain 5-HT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. Depletion of Piezo2 from these cells caused a 4-fold increase in bead expulsion time, implying that the mechanical stimulus provided by the bead caused 5-HT release and the initiation of colon propulsion. Consistent with this conclusion, in other studies in mice, 5-HT released from EC has been shown to cause colorectal propulsion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. In addition, <italic>Piezo2</italic> signals were observed in the lamina propria throughout the intestine. Given the previous report that Piezo2 was detected <italic>via</italic> scRNA-seq in a subset of sensory DRG neuron innervating the colon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>, it is possible that both distal colonic EC cells and the sensory DRG neurons contribute to mechanosensory sensing and motility control. Such a dual component epithelial cell-neuronal sensory machinery parallels mechanisms described in the skin (Merkel cell-neurite complexes)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>, lung (neuroepithelial bodies)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup> and most recently in the bladder (urothelial cells-sensory neurons)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>A cluster of <italic>Cck<sup>+</sup>/Oc3<sup>+</sup>/Tph1<sup>+</sup></italic> EC cells identified in the duodenal villi was enriched with two sets of sensory molecules: enzymes/receptors associated with pathogen/toxin recognition (<italic>Crp</italic>, <italic>Lyzl4</italic>, <italic>Bcam</italic>, <italic>Tril</italic>, <italic>Tlr2</italic>, and <italic>Tlr5</italic>) and receptors associated with nutrient sensing (<italic>Casr</italic> and <italic>Mc4r</italic>), suggesting a that these cells react to gastric content entering the duodenum. The gut has a well-established defensive role to expel noxious chemicals and toxins by nausea and vomiting that is initiated by 5-HT release and can be effectively inhibited by 5-HT3 receptor antagonists<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. Our findings suggests that <italic>Cck<sup>+</sup>/Oc3<sup>+</sup>/Tph1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells equipped with pathogen/toxin recognition receptors may play a role in this defense mechanism. This includes C-reactive protein, encoded by <italic>Crp</italic> selectively expressed in <italic>Cck<sup>+</sup>/Oc3<sup>+</sup>/Tph1<sup>+</sup></italic>cells, which is a conserved pattern recognition molecule involved in complement-mediated cell lysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup> and lysozyme-like protein (LYZL) 4 that belongs to a family of antibacterial proteins, Toll-like receptors 2 and 5 and the Toll receptor interacting protein, TRIL. This suggests that the <italic>Cck<sup>+</sup>/Oc3<sup>+</sup>/Tph1<sup>+</sup></italic>EC cells may react to pathogens both locally and through 5-HT signaling. Further study will be required to elucidate the molecular mechanism of this potentially important first line of defense. In regard to the nutrient-sensing molecules, previously, CasR and Mc4r have been reported in a subset of CCK<sup>+</sup> I cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup> and <italic>Gcg<sup>+</sup></italic> L cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>, respectively, whereas <italic>Pzp</italic> is found to be expressed in a subset of <italic>Gcg<sup>+</sup></italic> L cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Our integrated analysis indicates that all three molecules are enriched in the specialized <italic>Cck<sup>+</sup>/Oc3<sup>+</sup>/Tph1<sup>+</sup></italic>cells.</p>
<p>EC cells reside along the frontier between the host and a highly dynamic range of chemicals and microorganism-derived signals within the intestinal lumen that are perturbed in various diseases, and, like other enteroendocrine cells, exhibit considerable plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. There are numerous reports of alterations to EC cell density in different pathophysiological states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup> and, interestingly, some studies illustrating alterations to EC cell function. For example, EC cell sugar sensitivity is reduced in diet-induced obesity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>, and colonic ECs in patients with ulcerative colitis have altered expression of genes relating to antigen processing and presentation and to chemical sensation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>. Identification of orthologous EC subtypes in humans will be an important future step towards identifying how specific EC subtypes are affected in pathophysiological states, such as celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and inflammatory bowel syndrome.</p>

<title><bold>Tissue dissociation and flow cytometry</bold></title>
<p>Male mice aged 8-12 weeks were used. After the animals were sacrificed, small intestine and colon were surgically removed, rinsed with ice-cold PBS and the luminal contents flushed out with PBS using a 20 ml syringe with an 18-gauge round-tip feeding needle (Roboz Surgical Instrument, FN-7906). Duodenal and jejunal tissue was dissected between 1 to 5 cm and 13 to 17 cm distal of pyloric constriction. Ileum was dissected between 1 to 9 cm rostral of ileocecal junction. For the colon, the distal 4 cm tissue of descending colon was dissected as distal colon and the segment with banded lining distal to cecum was dissected as proximal colon. Dissected gut segments were inverted inside out and incubated in DMEM supplemented with 3 mM DTT (Sigma Life Science, D9779), 1 mM EDTA (Gibco, 15575-038) and 10% FBS (Gibco, 26410-079) at 37 °C for 30 min with consistent rotation. The released epithelial tissue was cut into smaller pieces, triturated with a 1000 µl pipette and dissociated in a collagenase solution with 1 U of Dispase (Stem Cell Technologies, 07923), 2 mg/ml Collagenase IV (Worthington Biochemical Corporation, LS004186) and 100 U DNase I (Worthington Biochemical Corporation, LS006330) in DMEM/F12 medium for 20-30 min at 37 °C with gentle mixing every 10 min. The dissociated cells were washed and filtered through a 100 µm cell strainer followed by a 40 µm cell strainer. The flow-through was spun down and filtered through another 40 µm cell strainer. The viability of the single-cell suspension was determined using trypan blue staining.</p>
<p>Cell pellets from the single-cell suspension were resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS, 5% FBS, and 5 mM EDTA) for staining in ice for 10 min with 7-AAD (BD Biosciences, #51-68981E). Only 7-AAD<sup>-</sup> cells were considered as viable cells. To obtain cells for scRNA-seq, GFP<sup>+</sup>/7-AAD<sup>-</sup> and GFP<sup>-</sup>/7-AAD<sup>-</sup> cells were collected from the <italic>Tph1</italic>-bacTRAP mice, while tdTomato<sup>+</sup>/7-AAD<sup>-</sup> and tdTomato<sup>-</sup>/7-AAD<sup>-</sup> cells are collected from the <italic>Neurod1-tdTomato</italic> mice. Single-cell suspensions from different segments of gut were prepared and sorted separately. Single-cell suspensions from duodenum and jejunum were prepared from a single animal, while segments of proximal colon and distal colon were pooled from two and eight animals, respectively, to acquire sufficient numbers of cells. For ileum, however, even pooling eight animals did not yield adequate number for unbiased analysis (intestinal stem cells and transit amplifying cells were disproportionally enriched in the GFP<sup>+</sup> cells, see data analysis), thus ileum was excluded from the subsequent scRNA-seq analysis.</p>

<p>To prepare tissue sections for RNA-FISH, wild-type C57BL/6 mice (8-10 weeks) were sacrificed, intestine and colon were dissected as described above, cleaned and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Electron Microscopy Sciences, 15713) at 4 °C overnight, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose (Ward’s Science, 57-50-1) for 24 h before being embedded in 100% O.C.T.

Multiplex Fluorescent Detection Kit v2 (323100, Advanced Cell Diagnostics) according to manufacturer’s instructions using TSA with Cy3, Cy5, and/or Fluorescein (Perkin Elmer NEL760001KT). All sections were counterstained with DAPI (1:1000; Invitrogen D1306). All co-staining was performed on tissue samples from at least three mice.

For automated analysis, images were preprocessed in Fiji (2.0.0) by maximum intensity projection, background subtraction and contrast enhancement, and the processed images were output as binary images for each channel. A custom CellProfiler pipeline was built to quantitate co-staining of two or three channels. Briefly, regions of interest (ROIs) were manually drawn on the DAPI channel in order to count cells separately in the crypts versus the villi. For each set of images, objects were identified independent in each channel, the signal of which was expanded by a 5-pixel diameter circle. If the circular objects identified from different channels overlapped, the cells were identified as double-or triple-positive. For each experiment, the pipeline was automated through images collected from at least 3 sections per animal in three animals. The number of double-positive cells (e.g., <italic>Tph1+/Cartpt+</italic>) was divided by single-positive cells (e.g., <italic>Tph1<sup>+</sup></italic>) in each ROI and summarized across three animals to calculate mean and SEM statistics were performed using an unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test to compare enrichment in the crypts versus in the villi. To quantitate co-expression of two or three feature genes, the same pipeline was employed without demarcation of crypts versus villi.</p>

<p>Blood samples were collected retro-orbitally from indicated animal cohorts. Animals subjected to blood collection were not used for <italic>in vivo</italic> motility assays. Serum was separated after coagulation at room temperature for 60 min, meaning that platelets could be contributing to the serotonin levels measured. Serotonin levels were detected in sera by ELISA according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Eagle Biosciences). To examine tissue serotonin levels from epithelial tissue, epithelium was extracted by incubation in DMEM supplemented with 3 mM DTT (Sigma Life Science, D9779), 1 mM EDTA (Gibco, 15575-038) and 10% FBS (Gibco, 26410-079) at 37 °C for 30 min with consistent rotation. Dissociated epithelial cells were lysed with standard buffer provided in ELISA kits. Cleared supernatant was used for ELISA. For the serotonin secretion assay, ∼1,000 sorted cells were equilibrated in standard buffer (+0.1% w/v ascorbic acid) for 30 minutes after wash with PBS. Cells were then incubated with standard buffer supplemented with indicated drugs or vehicle control, as well as 0.1% ascorbic acid for 15 minutes. Supernatant and cell lysates were prepared to measure secreted serotonin and cell lysate serotonin separately, the sum of which is calculated as total serotonin level.

<p>Clozapine-N-oxide (Tocris, 4936) was dissolved in sterile 0.9% saline (Quality Biological, 114-055-101). On the day of experiment, the animals were anesthetized with isoflurane (5%, 1 l/min). CNO at indicated doses or saline control were administrated intracolonically using a 1 ml syringe with a 22-gauge round-tip feeding needle (round tip diameter 1.25mm, length 36mm; Roboz Surgical Instrument, FN-7920). Initially, two different doses (60 ng/kg, 120 ng/kg) of CNO were tested. As they were equally potent to induce serum serotonin elevation, the lesser dose (60 ng/kg in 50 µl) was chosen for the rest of experiments. Diphtheria toxin (DT; Sigma, D0564) was reconstituted in sterile water and administrated to anesthetized animals in the same manner as CNO, at 50 µg/kg in 50 µl twice a day for five consecutive days.

Animals were scarified 15 min after gavage; the stomach, small intestine, cecum, and colon were collected PBS. The small intestine was divided into 10 segments of equal length, and the colon (used to obtain total recovered rhodamine B fluorescence) was divided in half. Each piece of tissue was homogenized in PBS and centrifuged (2000 × <italic>g</italic>) to obtain a clear supernatant. Rhodamine fluorescence was measured in 250 µl aliquots of the supernatant (Tecan Trading, Infinite M200). Gastric empty rate was calculated as [(total recovered fluorescence − fluorescence remaining in the stomach) ÷ (total recovered fluorescence)] × 100%. Small intestinal transit was estimated by the position of the geometric center of the rhodamine B dextran in the small bowel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>. For each segment of the small intestine (1–10), the geometric center (<italic>a</italic>) was calculated as follows: <italic>a</italic> = (fluorescence in each segment × number of the segment) ÷ (total fluorescence recovered in the small intestine).

<title>Normalization</title>
<p>Given the presence of stochastic zeros in scRNA-seq data and the wide distribution of total UMIs per cells in our dataset, we used a pool-based size factor to deconvolute cell-specific size factor for each single cell library for normalization purpose. Briefly, a coarse cell clustering was first performed using hierarchical clustering based on the top 50 components of principle component analysis (PCA) for the entire expression matrix. Summation of UMI counts across cells in each resolving cluster was computed as pooled-based size factor and repeated to generate a linear system for all single cells. A weighted least-squares approach is applied to solve the linear system and to deconvolute a cell-base size factor for all single cells, as implemented in Scran (version 2.1.6)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup>.

<p>The authors have performed extensive work generating reporter mice and performing single-cell analysis combined with in situ hybridization to arrive at 14 clusters of enterochromaffin (EC) cells. Then, they focus on Piezo channel expression in distal EC cells and find that these channels might play a role in regulating colonic motility. Overall, this is an informative study that comprehensively classifies EC cells in different regions of the small and large intestine. From a functional point of view, however, the authors seem to ignore the fact that the expression of Piezo-2-IRES-Cre is broad, which would raise concerns regarding their physiological conclusions.</p>
<p>The authors may wish to consider the following specific points:</p>
<p>It is surprising that the number of ileal EC cells is less than that of the distal colon, and it would be interesting to know whether the authors can comment about ileal EC cells. It is unclear why ileal ECs were not included in the study, even though they are mentioned in the diagram (Fig. 2c).</p>
<p>Based on their analysis, there are 10 EC cell clusters in SI while there are only 4 clusters in the colon. The authors should comment on whether this is reflective of lesser diversity among colonic ECs or due to the smaller number of colonic ECs collected.</p>
<p>The authors previously described that distal colonic EC cells exhibit various morphologies (Kuramoto et al., 2021). Do Ascl1(+) EC cells particularly co-localize with EC cells with long basal processes? Also, to validate the RNA seq data, the authors might show co-localization between Piezo2/Ascl1/Tph1 in distal EC cells. It would be interesting to see whether Ascl1-CreER (which is available in Jax) specifically labels distal colonic EC cells as this could provide a good genetic tool to specifically manipulate distal colonic EC cells.</p>
<p>The authors used Piezo2-IRES-Cre mice, whose expression is rather broad. They might examine the distribution of Chrm3-mCitrine in the intestine (IF/IHC would be straightforward). And if the expression is in other cell types (which is most likely the case), they should justify that the observed phenotype derives from Piezo2-expressing EC cells. Alternatively, they could use Piezo2-Cre;ePetFlp (or Vil-Flp);Chrm3 to specifically express DREADD receptors in distal colonic EC cells. Also, what does 5HT release look like in jejunal EC cells in Piezo-CHRM3 mice?</p>
<p>For the same reasons as above, DTR experiments may also be non-specific. For example, based on the IF staining (Fig. 6b,d), there seems to be a loss of Tph1+ cells in the proximal colon of Piezo2-DTR mice, so the effects of the Piezo2-DTR likely extend beyond the distal colon.</p>
<p>It is unclear why the localized loss of Piezo2 in Piezo2-DTR mice alters small intestinal transit (Fig. 6g,h). The authors should discuss the functional differences observed between Piezo2-DTR (intraluminal app) and Vil1-Piezo2 KO mice i.e., small intestinal transit, 5HT release, etc. Are these differences due to the residual Piezo2 expression in Piezo2 KO mice? In this context, the authors may want to discuss their findings in the context of recent papers, such as those from the Patapoutian and Ginty groups.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors investigated the expression profile of enterochromaffin (EC) cells after creating a new tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (Tph1) GFP-reporter mouse using scRNAseq and confirmative RNAscope analysis. They distinguish 14 clusters of Tph1+ cells found along the gut axis. The manuscript focuses on two of these, (i) a multihormonal cell type shown to express markers of pathogen/toxin and nutrient detection in the proximal small intestine, and (ii) on a EC-cluster in the distal colon, which expresses Piezo2, rendering these cells mechanosensitive. In- and ex- vivo data explore the role of the mechanosensitive EC population for intestinal/colonic transit, using chemogenetic activation, diptheria-toxin receptor dependent cell ablation and conditional gut epithelial specific Piezo2 knock-out. Whilst some of these data are confirmative of previous reports - Piezo2 has been implicated in mechanosensitive serotonin release previously, as referred to by the authors - the data are solid and emphasize the importance of mechanosensitive serotonin release for colonic propulsion. The transcriptomic data will guide future research.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The transcriptomic data, whilst confirmative, is more granular than previous data sets. Employing new tools to establish a role of mechanosensitive EC cells for colonic and thus total intestinal transit.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. The proposed villus/crypt distribution of the 14 cell types is not verified adequately. The RNAscope and immunohistochemistry samples presented do not allow assessment of whether this interpretation is correct - spatial transcriptomics, now approaching single-cell resolution, would be likely to help verify this claim.</p>
<p>2. The physiological function and/or functionality of most of the transcriptomically enriched gene products has not been assessed. Whilst a role for Piezo2 expressing cells for colonic transit is convincingly demonstrated, the nature of the mechanical stimulus or the stimulus-secretion coupling downstream of Piezo2 activation is not clear.</p>
