<title>Abstract</title><p>Thalamocortical activity is known to orchestrate sensory gating and consciousness switching. The precise thalamic regions involved, or the firing patterns related to the unconsciousness remain unclear. Interestingly, the thalamically highly-expressed T-type calcium currents have been considered as a candidate for the ionic mechanism for the generation of thalamic-driven change in conscious state. Here, we tested the hypothesis that Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 T-type channels in the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD) might control neuronal firing during unconsciousness using Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 T-type channel knock-out (KO) and knock-down (KD) mice under natural sleep and ethanol-induced unconsciousness. During natural sleep, the MD neurons in KO mice showed general characteristics of sustained firing across sleep stages. We found that KO and MD-specific KD mice showed enhanced resistance to ethanol. During ethanol-induced unconscious state, wild-type (WT) MD neurons showed a significant reduction in neuronal firing from baseline with increased burst firing, whereas Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 KO neurons showed well sustained neural firing, within the level of wakefulness, and no burst firing. Further, 20 Hz optogenetic and electrical activation of MD neurons mimicked the ethanol resistance behavior in WT mice. These results support that the maintenance of MD neural firing at a wakeful level is sufficient to cause resistance to the ethanol hypnosis in WT mice. This work has important implications for the design of treatments for consciousness disorders using thalamic stimulation of deeper nuclei including the targeting of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Drug-induced unconsciousness can be achieved using numerous types of anesthetics with varying modes of action <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Ethanol, one of the most frequently abused drugs in human society, can induce sleep-like loss of consciousness at high doses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. While possible neuropharmacological and neural correlates of ethanol sedation have been proposed using <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> methods <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, recent studies have highlighted the slowing of thalamocortical-driven rhythms as a potent marker of unconsciousness <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. However, the region and the mechanism linked to the thalamic modulation during ethanol induced unconsciousness remains poorly understood.</p>
<p>Physiological correlates of thalamocortical rhythmic activities and consciousness state of the brain are known <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. T-type calcium channels are known generators of thalamocortical rhythms, through the modulation of cell excitability and rebound burst firing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. During sleep, the transition from wakefulness to unconsciousness is associated with membrane hyperpolarization of thalamic neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Similarly, It has been shown that in ethanol sedation, as in natural sleep or absence seizure, the loss of consciousness is characterized by a switch from tonic to burst firing in thalamic neurons, which involves GABAergic inhibition-driven de-inactivation of Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 T-type channels resulting in slow oscillatory response of the thalamocortical network <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Acute intoxication at high doses of ethanol <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> induces both slow oscillations in the delta-theta frequency range and a loss of righting reflex (LORR), the loss of reflex to up-right itself from a supine position, a classical proxy to assess the loss of consciousness. It has been shown that mice lacking global or thalamic Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 showed altered slow oscillations and sleep architecture <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>; delayed sleep induction under several anesthetics (i.e. isoflurane, halothane, sevoflurane and pentobarbital) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>; and increased resistance to drug-induced absence seizure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Notably, the absence or blockade of Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 resulted in an increased preference for ethanol consumption and novelty-seeking behavior <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. In the current studies we tried to explore the possibility of a pivotal role of Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1-mediated T-currents during ethanol-induced sleep or unconsciousness.</p>
<p>The thalamus is one of the major regions expressing Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 T-type calcium channels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> and holds a central role in information-transmission and integration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. <italic>In vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies using genetically modified mice have revealed that Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 T-type channels play a key role in the genesis of thalamocortical rhythms, such as 3Hz spike-and-wave discharges (SWD), a signature of absence seizures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> and delta waves <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Previous investigations on thalamic control of consciousness revealed that nuclei within the dorsal medial thalamus (dMT) hold an important modulatory function in the interaction of attention and arousal <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Particularly, centromedian (CM) thalamic nucleus, and not ventrobasal nucleus (VB), showed rapid shifts in local field potential (LFP) preceding brain state transitions such as NREM and propofol-induced anesthesia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. The centrolateral (CL) thalamic nucleus has been implicated in the modulation of arousal, behavior arrest <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, and improvement of level of consciousness during seizures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> and paraventricular thalamic nucleus showed critical involvement in wake/sleep cycle regulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. The MD, a sub nucleus of dMT, on the other hand, has only recently been implicated in disorders of consciousness <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> and ketamine/ethanol-induced loss of consciousness <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> through the alteration of thalamo-cortical functional connectivity. However, several key questions still remain to be answered: 1) Is there a specific role for MD Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 T-type calcium channels in the control of ethanol-induced loss of consciousness? 2) Whether Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 T-type calcium channel driven neuronal firing pattern has any role in the control of consciousness?</p>
<p>In this study, we identified that KO and MD specific silencing of Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 T-type calcium channels result in increased ethanol resistance in mice. Using single unit recordings, we compared MD activity of WT and KO mice while the mice transitioned from conscious to unconscious state and found that the KO mice showed more sustained MD activity whereas the WT mice showed clearly reduced MD activity. Furthermore and consistently with their resistant phenotype, KO mice showed sustained MD firing, well within the wakefulness level, under ethanol consumption. Finally, we demonstrate that both the optogenetic and electrical stimulations in MD that were mimicking the sustained firing pattern of knock-out mice were sufficient to induce the increased ethanol resistance in WT mice. These results reveal a novel function of MD in ethanol-induced unconsciousness and its underlying neural mechanism.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>To understand the role of T-type Ca2+ channels in modulating the consciousness level, we compared the ethanol resistance between WT and Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1<sup>−/−</sup> KO littermates. We used the forced walking task (FWT; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1-A</xref>), an analog to the LORR assay, which enables a continuous and high-temporal resolution assessment of the loss of movement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> (LOM). Moreover, the FWT objectively measures the latency to and duration of the first LOM, but also the total time spent in LOM using automatized analysis of video confirmed by electromyograms (EMGs) or accelerometer recordings (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1-B</xref> and S1; see Methods). The continuously running treadmill (6 cm/s) ensures a normalized behavior within and between animals before injection (i.e., baseline forced walking) and allows for reduced intervention from experimenters for the monitoring of both electrophysiological (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>, upper panel) and analyzed behavioral (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>, lower panel).</p>

<title>The lacking Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 increases ethanol resistance in mice</title>
<p>Mice lacking Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 exhibited delayed anesthetic induction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> and impairment in maintenance of low conscious level <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> as well as increased ethanol preference <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. We tested the sensitivity of Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 null mutant mice for various acute hypnotic doses of ethanol.</p>
<p>We confirmed that the lack of Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 resulted in a more delayed and fragmented LOM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>-C1 and C2), and a reduction in the total time spent in LOM compared to Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 WT mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>-C3). We observed that Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 null mutant mice showed increased latency to and decreased duration of the first episode of loss of motion (fLOM) for ethanol injection doses of 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 g/Kg (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). The total time spent in LOM during one hour of recording was also significantly reduced (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>-A3 and -B3) compared with WT mice. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed a significant effect for the main factor genotype and dose for the latency to and duration of fLOM, and total time in LOM (Table S1), indicating a dose dependency in both wild and mutant mice. In particular, an I.P. Injection of 3.0 g/Kg induced a significant difference between wild and mutant mice in latency to (t(16) =-4.1965, p = 0.002; Student t-test) and duration of fLOM (t(16) =2.3908, p = 0.0294; Student t-test), and total time spent in LOM (t(16) =3.9065, p = 0.0012; Student t-test).</p>
<p>These results indicate that ethanol induces a dose-dependent sedative effect on mice and Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 mutant mice had an increased resistance to ethanol sedation compared to WT mice.</p>

<title>Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 silencing in the MD, but not VB, increased ethanol resistance in mice</title>
<p>A great majority of Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 expression is found in the thalamic region <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> and was shown to specifically correlate with the modulation of thalamocortical-related rhythms and stability of sleep level <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. To identify a possible role of the thalamic region in ethanol resistance, we knocked down the expression of Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 in the MD and a ventral basal nucleus (VB) region, two regions possibly involved in a thalamic control of consciousness <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, using a lentivirus (LV)-mediated short hairpin (shRNA) delivery.</p>
<p>We found that compared to shControl injected mice, shCa<sub>v</sub>3.1 knock-down of MD resulted in an increased latency to (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>-A1; t(27) = −3.0045, p = 0.0057; Student t-test) and duration of (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>-A2; t(27) =2.1448, p = 0.0411; Student t-test) fLOM, and total time spent in LOM (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>-A3; t(27) =2.6641, p = 0.0128, two-tailed test) for 3.0g/Kg I.P.

However, we found that compared to shControl-injected mice, Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 KD of VB did not change the latency to (t(8) =-1.0093 p = 0.3423, two-tailed test), duration of (t(8) =-0.0983, p = 0.9241, two-tailed test) fLOM and total time spent in LOM (t(8) =-0.6317, p = 0.5452, two-tailed test) for the same 3.0g/Kg I.P. Injection of ethanol (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>). Representative traces of mice activity showed that mice with Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 KD in MD (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4-A</xref>) had a more delayed and fragmented early period of LOM compared to MD LV-shControl and VB injected mice, as in mutant mice.</p>

<p>We observed two major populations of neuronal spike waveform present in MD single unit recordings of Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 (+/+) mice: 1) a majority of regular spiking (RS) cells characterized by wide spike waveform (36/39 neurons, 92.3%), i.e. spike-to-valley width &gt;250 μsec (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>) and high bursting propensity; 2) a minority of narrow spiking (NS) cells showing short spike-to-valley width, i.e. &lt;250 μsec, lower bursting characteristics (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and S6-A3 and -A4) and fast-paced tonic firing (10-50Hz; data not shown). The RS and NS neurons were found in MD of WT and mutant mice; however, MD RS mutant neurons showed an absence of short inter-spike intervals (ISI, i.e. indicative of the absence of burst) in auto cross-correlogram (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>) and a clear reduction in total bursting (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3-B</xref>; ratio of spikes count &lt;10 ms and &gt;50 ms based on auto-cross-correlogram).

Assuming an ordering from higher to lower state of consciousness, these results indicate that MD firing is associated with level of consciousness independently from the Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 T-type channels in wild type and mutant mice. Importantly, this result indicates that Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 t-type calcium channels are critical excitatory ion channels that control the overall neural activity along with the brain state.

<title>Under ethanol, MD neurons lacking Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 show no burst and a wake state-like neural activity</title>

<p>Notably, in WT, we observed that ethanol induced a significant decrease in total firing from walking to fLOM states (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4</xref>-A1 and -C; p &lt;0.0001, Rank Sum test with Holm-Bonferroni correction) and well below wakefulness level (Homecage awake state). As in sleep, we found that a majority of RS neurons showed decreased tonic firing (total number of spikes) together with an increase in burst firing, indicating a switch in firing mode under ethanol sleep. Interestingly, the mutant mice did not show a significant decrease in total firing (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4-C</xref>; p = 0.130, Ranksum test with Holm-Bonferroni correction) and showed no burst as in sleep.</p>
<p>We quantified the change in activity of individual neurons using Z-score normalized to the homecage wakeful state. Here, we also observed that WT RS neurons showed a significantly reduced Z-score under ethanol fLOM whereas in mutant mice cells did not (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>-D1; normalized from home cage wake state; t(62) = −5.1400, p &lt; 0.0001, student t-test). Remarkably, we found that a majority of WT MD neurons (29/31) showed individual significantly decreased Z-scores (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>-D2; z-threshold defined from a p-value of 0.05). During fLOM, mutant RS neurons subdivided into three populations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>-D2) with decreasing (12/33, 36.4%), maintaining (11/33, 30%) and increasing (10/33, 30.3%) activity as measured by the Z-score with respect to wakefulness (i.e. home cage wake state). These results were consistent in individual mice (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7A</xref>) and the distribution of neural population spiking (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7B</xref>), validating that significant drop in neural activity is associated with loss of movement.</p>
<p>Altogether, these results indicate that, in WT, ethanol induced a strong reduction in neural activity and a switch to bursting firing mode correlated with loss of consciousness. However, under ethanol, MD mutant neurons maintained their activity to a level within homecage wake state without switching to bursting. This indicates that the drop in neural activity under ethanol is modulated by Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 t-type calcium channels. In its absence, MD mutant neurons display an overall reduced activity in all brain states, however, under ethanol, remain within state wakeful levels.</p>

<title>Under ethanol, 20 Hz neurostimulation of MD induces mutant-like resistance to loss of consciousness in WT mice</title>
<p>We observed that the maintenance of neural activity in MD excitatory neurons might be at the origin of the ethanol resistance in mutant mice. We hypothesized that artificially maintaining MD neural activity within the wakeful level would sustain consciousness under ethanol. In addition, we hypothesized that the triggering of burst firing under ethanol would potentiate loss of consciousness under ethanol. To test this possibility, we used electric and optogenetic stimulations during the FWT in WT mice under an hypnotic dose of ethanol.</p>
<p>MD neurons in WT mice showed a spike firing range 0-50 Hz with an average neural firing around ∼20 Hz during homecage wakefulness (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7-B</xref>).

<p>In order to validate this observation, we then bilaterally implanted mice with twisted wires for bipolar, local electric stimulation of MD (<xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Fig. S11</xref>). As in the optogenetics experiment, we used a continuous pulse train of 20Hz electric stimulation (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10-A</xref>; upper panel; inter-pulse interval = 50 msec, pulse width = 1 msec) in addition to a burst-like stimulation (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10-A</xref>; lower pane; 4 pulses at 4 ms interval and interburst interval of 1 sec) that showed, respectively, tonic-like and burst-like entrainment in thalamic neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. We observed that our 20Hz tonic-like stimulation significantly increased the latency to fLOM (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10</xref>-B1; tonic-like vs no stim.: p = 0.008; tonic-like vs burst-like: p = 0.007; Ranksum test with Holm-Bonferroni correction) and significantly decreased the total time spent in LOM (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>-B3; tonic-like vs no stim.: p = 0.008; tonic-like vs burst-like: p = 0.007, Ranksum test with Holm-Bonferroni correction). No significant changes in the duration of the first LOM was observed (duration of fLOM (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>-B2; tonic-like vs no stim.: p = 0.917; tonic-like vs burst-like: p = 0.606; Ranksum test with Holm-Bonferroni correction).</p>
<p>Interestingly, we observed that burst-like electrical stimulation (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10-A</xref>; lower panel; inter-spike interval = 4 msec, inter-burst interval = 1 sec, pulse width = 1 msec) did not induce any significant change in ethanol sensitivity compared to the no stimulation group (Latency to fLOM: p = 0.365; duration of fLOM: p = 0.835; total time spent in LOM: p = 1; Ranksum test with Holm-Bonferroni correction). This result suggests that burst firing alone might not have a role in ethanol resistance.</p>
<p>Altogether, these results suggest that the maintenance of MD firing at wakefulness level (20Hz) causally drives resistance to loss of consciousness after a hypnotic dose of ethanol. Burst-like stimulation alone did not promote or reduce loss of consciousness. This result supports the idea that neural activity maintenance in MD promotes the maintenance of consciousness even under heavy sedatives.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this work, we identified that the MD plays a causal role in the loss or maintenance of consciousness. The whole body Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 KO and MD-specific Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 KD resulted in the resistance to the transition to the unconscious state that was induced by hypnotic dose of ethanol in mice. In WT mice, the MD neurons demonstrated a clearly reduced firing rate in natural and ethanol-induced unconscious states compared to conscious states. This neural activity reduction was obscured in KO mice. In particular, transition to an unconscious state was accompanied with a switch of firing mode from tonic firing to burst firing in WT mice whereas this mode-shift disappeared in KO mice. Notably, the optogenetic and electric stimulation of the MD after the ethanol injection was sufficient to cause the resistance to the transition to unconscious state, supporting our conclusion that the level of neural firing in the MD is critical to maintain conscious state or resist to unconscious state, and the Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 calcium channel is causally involved in this process.</p>

<title>Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 T-type calcium channels drive thalamic firing mode and activity</title>
<p>The decrease of absolute firing rate observed in thalamic neurons of Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 mutant mice supports the polyvalent role of Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 in controlling both burst and tonic firing in the thalamus. Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 channels are major contributors of excitability, and in their absence or blockade, leads to a reduced neural excitability and stability and lower tonic relay of thalamocortical cells under wake-like state <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. The burst and tonic firing-mediated response of thalamic neurons under sensory stimulation and under the control of thalamocortical layer 6 projecting neurons was found to recruit Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 t-type calcium channels to differentiate salient novel stimuli versus complex coded information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Therefore, the nonlinear amplification and regularization of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) by Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 T-type calcium channels through complexes such as with metabotropic-glutamatergic receptor 1 (mGluR1) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> or the role of a “T window” <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> would explain how the lack of T-current in mutant mice could result in an overall reduced excitation of thalamic neurons.

<title>The lower variability in MD Firing reflects Ethanol Resistance in Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 mutant mice</title>
<p>Under acute hypnotic dose of ethanol, two mechanisms might favor the reduction in firing in MD: 1) an increase in synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAergic inhibition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> and/or 2) reduced NMDA synaptic transmission <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. The presence of burst firing during fLOM, and during LOM in general, supports that MD neurons might have been subject to GABA receptor-mediated hyperpolarization, a necessary condition for the de-inactivation of Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 T-type burst. However, considering the dramatic difference in tonic firing observed during the FWT following I.P. injection of ethanol, the change in tonic firing in MD was the focus of our analysis.</p>
<p>We observed a reduction in neural firing under ethanol sleep conditions in WT mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4-C</xref>, -D1 and -D2) suggesting that low firing level should be associated with a state of low consciousness as observed during NREM sleep. Although, mutant RS neurons in MD showed an overall decrease in excitability and variability of firing in various natural conscious and unconscious states, Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 mutant mice did not exhibit a decreased arousal level (i.e. increased locomotor activity), rather they exhibited increased resistance to ethanol and increased locomotor activity, suggesting relative change from state to state in tonic firing in MD, and not the absolute value of firing, might be a better correlate of arousal in the mice. Our optogenetic and electrical stimulation showed that a sustained tonic-like stimulation in the MD at 20Hz (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5-A</xref>), a physiological relevant firing rate in wake state (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), could increase ethanol resistance in WT mice. Reducing MD firing using phasic inhibition under ethanol, potentially leading to inhibition and rebound burst <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, could also increase the duration of the fLOM in WT mice injected with a lower dose of ethanol (Figure S12; 2.0 g/kg). We propose that the relative change in firing rate in MD RS neurons might be an important driver and indicator of the change of transition in and out of consciousness as demonstrated for other nuclei of the dMT <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.

We found that the propensity for burst during ethanol-induced LOM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>-A1, -B1 and -B2; fLOM: 20/33 bursting neurons; 0.79±1.63 Burst event/min) was lower than in NREM (NREM: 34/34 bursting neurons; 5.76 ± 5.51 burst events/min) and higher than during wakefulness (Wake: 5/36 bursting neurons; 0.16±0.31 Burst event/min). In addition, burst-like electrical stimulation of MD did not significantly affect ethanol resistance (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10</xref>).

<p>Interestingly, under lower doses of ethanol (I.P. injection of 2.0g/kg of ethanol) mutant and WT alike showed similar levels of resistance to ethanol. We observed a phasic inhibition of MD neurons in WT, capable of inducing partial silencing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> and rebound bursts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> (<xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Fig. S12</xref>; 1sec ON-OFF using archaerhodopsin-mediated inhibition), did increase fLOM duration mostly (Z(13) = −2.214, p = 0.022, Ranksum test). This result supports that in the context of hypnotic dose of ethanol, the apparition of burst might correlate with unconscious state stability rather than induction. Burst stimulation without inhibition did not have this effect (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10</xref> and S11). Currently, our data does not allow us to formulate any clear conclusion on the direct role of burst events during fLOM. We propose that the absence of burst and an accompanying effect of maintenance of tonic firing under ethanol in MD was responsible for the observed increase in resistance and maintenance of activity in Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 mutant mice.</p>

<title>A bidirectional modulation of Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 expression and alcoholism</title>
<p>In human mutation of Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 T-type channels exhibit mental disorders including cerebellar ataxia, absence seizure, schizophrenia and autism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Remarkably, mutation in voltage-gated calcium channels, including Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 leads to ethanol resistance and alcohol-seeking behavior <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Reversibly, chronic exposure to ethanol intake is known to impair sleep <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> and increase ethanol resistance. Previous studies have found an alteration in T-type calcium channel expression following chronic exposure to ethanol in non-human primates <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> suggesting that a reduced T-current and the resulting sustained thalamic tonic firing could be a possible mechanism for early stage ethanol resistance in alcoholic subjects, which increases the conversion probability from casual to compulsive consumption of ethanol. The lack of burst and sustained tonic firing might impair the stabilization of sleep, and in turn chronic sleep impairments might engage addiction related networks. Mechanisms such as adenosine receptor depreciation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup> or GABA-receptor potentiation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup> would enhance ethanol resistance and addiction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup> spiraling into further sleep fragmentation, memory consolidation deficit, impulsivity and other impairments associated with alcoholism.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 heterozygous mice (Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1<sup>+/−</sup>) were maintained in two genetic backgrounds, 129/svjae and C57BL/6J. All experiments used Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1<sup>-/−</sup> mice and their WT littermates in the F1 hybrid generated by mating CaV3.1+/− mice from these two genetic backgrounds. Mice were maintained with free access to food and water under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle, with the light cycle beginning at 8:00 AM. Animal care was provided and all experiments were conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Institute of Basic Science and the Korean Institute of Science and Technology. All experiments were conducted using 12- to 16-wk-old male mice.</p>

<title>Surgery for electrophysiological recordings and neurostimulation</title>
<p>The surgical implantation of electrodes (EEG, EMG and/or tetrode Microdrive) and virus injection procedures were performed under 0.2% tribromoethanol (Avertin) anesthesia (20 mL/kg i.p.). Following anesthetic administration, mice (11-week-old for electrode implantation; 10 weeks for virus injection) were fixed in a stereotaxic device (David Kopf Instruments). For chronic recording of EEG and EMG, a stainless-steel screw electrode was fixed into the skull over the right parietal hemisphere and an uncoated stainless-steel wire was tied to the nuchal muscle, respectively. For in vivo freely moving single unit recording, we used a Harlan 4 Drive (Neuralynx inc.) mounted with 3 to 4 tetrode wires inserted to the caudal region of the right mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (anteroposterior, −1.4; lateral, +0.4; depth: 3.2 mm). Single tetrode wires were prepared from 4 twisted nichrome-formvar/PAC wires (Kanthal precision technology, OD 0.0127 mm) and gold plated to achieve an impedance range of 150-400kΩ (1kHz, in saline solution). A period of 7 days was given to allow a complete recovery from the surgical procedure. For all chronic implantation of electrodes, an additional screw was positioned over the occipital region and used as a reference.</p>

<title>Optogenetic neurostimulation</title>
<p>For optogenetic experiment, 16 mice were bilaterally injected with aav9-syn-ChR2-sfGFP virus in the mediodorsal thalamus and implanted with optic fiber guides (125 μm core diameter, Doric Lenses inc.) positioned at 30 degree angle from the transverse plane. The mice were given 2∼3 weeks to recover and to allow for the viral expression. These mice were then randomly assigned to a no stimulation (n = 8) and a 20 Hz stimulation group (n = 6). The mice received the stimulation immediately after being placed in the treadmill, then received the i.p. injection of 3.0 g/kg of ethanol as in other experiments. We discarded 2 mice due to a low viral expression found after histological analysis.</p>
<p>In order to measure the neural response to optogenetic stimulation, we implanted one mouse unilaterally (right MD) with a Harlan 4 Drive (4 tetrodes) converging with a single optic fiber (right side, 30 deg inclination). This mouse received optogenetic stimulation in a homecage resting condition and at frequency 1-5-10-20-40 Hz with a fixed stimulation pulse of 6.5 ms (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8</xref>). Using these recordings, we verified the fidelity between the triggered laser stimulation and the single unit response in the vicinity of the laser illumination. The spike per stimulation trial, spike initiation success rate and the delayed triggered spiking (jittering) were estimated from these recordings. For all simulations, we used a high stability 473 nm (blue, MFB-III-473-AOM; Changchun New Industries Optoelectronics Technology Co., Ltd.) fiber coupled (FC) at an intensity of 6.0 mW. Laser triggering was performed using a pulsepall (gen1, open-source; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://open-ephys.org/pulsepal">https://open-ephys.org/pulsepal</ext-link>) or Master-8 (A.M.P. Instruments, Israel) pulse stimulator.</p>

<title>Electric neurostimulation</title>
<p>For experiments using electrical stimulation, 18 mice were implanted with bilateral twisted dual stainless-steel wires (A-M systems, PFA coated, 50 um diameter) targeting MD (anteroposterior, −1.4; lateral, +/-0.4; depth: 3.2 mm; from bregma). The wires were minted on a custom made 4×1 pin header connector and cemented. As in the optogenetic experiment, the mice received the stimulation immediately after being placed in the treadmill, then received the i.p. injection of 3.0 g/kg of ethanol. The mice were randomly distributed into 3 groups, Sham no stimulation (n = 6), 20 Hz tonic stimulation (n = 5; 100 μsec pulse duration with inter pulse interval of 50 msec), and Burst stimulation (n = 7; 4x pulses of 100 μsec duration at 250 Hz; inter burst interval of 1 sec). All stimulation were performed in a bipolar configuration (twisted wire, bilateral implants) and biphasic pulse (100 μA, current stimulation) using a 2100 isolated pulse stimulator (A-M Systems, inc.).</p>

<title>Virus Injection</title>
<p>WT mice (10-week-old) were placed in the stereotaxic device following 0.2% tribomoethanol anesthesia (20 mL/kg i.p.). Custom elongated (Sutter Instrument Co.) borosilicate pipette (ID: 0.05 mm, OD: 0.07mm, World Precision Instruments, inc.) was used to inject 0.2 to 0.5 μL of virus solution at a rate of 0.1μL/min (Hamilton syringe, pump) bilaterally in to the mediodorsal thalamic nuclei (anteroposterior, −1.4; lateral, +/-0.4; depth: 3.2 mm). The injection pipette was then removed slowly after a diffusion period of 10min. A period of 2 to 3 weeks was given to allow viral infection to settle and a complete recovery from the surgical procedure.</p>

<title>Channelrhodopsin virus</title>
<p>Channelrhodopsin fused with superfolder GFP (ChR2-sfGFP) was designed and synthesized from published sequences using codon optimization for M. musculus (DNA 2.0). To express ChR2-sfGFP in the mouse brain, the AAV vector under a control of the human synapsin promoter (aav-Syn) was generated using PCR-amplified human synapsin promoter. Viruses were produced with Serotype 1 or DJ (Cell Biolabs, Inc.) and purified by CsCl gradients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. The virus was injected at a volume of 0.5 μL in each side of the MD, followed by a bilateral implantation of optical fibers (100/125 μm, DP, doric lens). The mice were given a period of 3 weeks to allow a strong expression of the channelrhodopsin channel following viral infection, as well as to recover from the surgical procedures.</p>

<title>Drugs</title>
<p>Tribromoethanol (Avertin) and Ethanol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All drugs were administered by i.p. injection. The surgical implantation and virus injection procedures were performed under 0.2% tribromoethanol (Avertin) anesthesia (20 mL/kg i.p.). Ethanol injections were based from a prepared stock mixture of ethanol (26%) and saline and dosage were adjusted according to the experiments and the animal body weight (i.e. 2.0 g/Kg, 3.0 g/Kg and 4.0 g/Kg).</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>All statistical analyses were performed using Matlab and SPSS 17.0 (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences). Group differences were assessed using the Student t-test. In the case of low sample number (i.e. n&lt;7) or distribution comparison of non-normal and/or non-equal variance number group difference were additionally confirmed using a nonparametric test (i.e. Wilcoxon Ranksum test/Signrank test). Multiple comparison p-value corrections were performed using a Holm-Bonferroni method. General longitudinal and group difference analysis were performed using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and one/two-way ANOVA when advised.</p>

<title>Mouse activity classification</title>
<p>Mouse activity was obtained using either accelerometer or video analysis. For the accelerometer, a zero-phase 5<sup>th</sup> order Butterworth band-pass filter with cut off frequency of 0.5-20 Hz was used in order to remove the DC component; the activity was derived as the root mean square (RMS) of x-, y- and z-axis filtered signals. For video analysis, after histogram filtering of the mouse’s body color, the frame by frame intensity difference was derived and summed to quantify the mouse activity as the number of displaced pixels on camera. The RMS and standard deviation of the mean (STD) of the activity was estimated in moving windows of 4sec duration (50% overlap). The normalized activity index was obtained from the product of RMS x STD (i.e. sustained activity and variability). Normalization was performed so that 1) complete cessation of activity approximate a value of 0 and 2) the 10 min walking baseline prior I.P. injection average a value of 1. A mouse was classified as not walking if its normalized activity was lower than the 95% confidence interval of baseline activity for a duration of at least 60 sec, and classified as walking otherwise. Non-walking states were reclassified as loss of motion (LOM) if the mouse’s normalized activity was maintained below 0.25 (lower quartile) for a duration of at least 30 sec. Adjustments were performed after manual video verification.</p>

<title>Surgery for electrophysiological recordings</title>
<p>The surgical implantation of electrodes (EEG, EMG and/or tetrode Microdrive) and virus injection procedures were performed under 0.2% tribromoethanol (Avertin) anesthesia (20 mL/kg i.p.). Following anesthetic administration, mice (11-week-old for electrode implantation; 10 weeks for virus injection) were fixed in a stereotaxic device (David Kopf Instruments). For chronic recording of EEG and EMG, a stainless-steel screw electrode was fixed into the skull over the right parietal hemisphere and an uncoated stainless-steel wire was tied to the nuchal muscle, respectively. For in vivo freely moving single unit recording, we used a Harlan 4 Drive (Neuralynx inc.) mounted with 3 to 4 tetrode wires inserted to the caudal region of the right mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (anteroposterior, −1.4; lateral, +0.4; depth: 3.2 mm). Single tetrode wires were prepared from 4 twisted nichrome-formvar/PAC wires (Kanthal precision technology, OD 0.0127 mm) and gold plated to achieve an impedance range of 150-400kΩ (1kHz, in saline solution). A period of 7 days was given to allow a complete recovery from the surgical procedure.</p>

<sec id="s7b">
<title>EEG/EMG recordings</title>
<p>EEG signals were amplified and band-pass filtered in the range 0.1-100 Hz. EMG signals were high-pass filtered at 70 Hz. All recordings were digitized at a sampling rate of 1kHz (Grass Amplifiers, pClamp 9.2-Molecular devices) or at 32kHz (Cheetah 6.5-Neuralynx) and downsampled in post-processing.</p>

<title>Single Unit recording, sorting and analysis</title>
<p>Electrophysiological data obtained from tetrodes bundles were acquired using Digital Lynx hardware and Cheetah 6.5 (Neuralynx) at a sampling frequency of 32 kHz. Online band-pass filtering (LFP for spike sorting: 600-6000 Hz; EEG: 0.5-70 Hz; EMG: 70-4000 Hz) and spike sorting was performed using cheetah 6.5. Off-line spike clustering and sorting was performed semi automatically using KlustaKwik (K.D. Harris, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://klustakwik.sourceforge.net">http://klustakwik.sourceforge.net</ext-link>) and MClust 3.5 (A.D. Redish, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://redishlab.neuroscience.umn.edu">http://redishlab.neuroscience.umn.edu</ext-link>) in Matlab (R) (the MathWorks, inc.) or SpikeSort3D 2.5. The time stamps or spike trains associated with each identified single unit were analyzed using a customized algorithm through Matlab (R). Single unit characterization was performed by means of using inter-spike interval distribution (ISI), cross- and autocross-correlation histograms (e.g. bursting index, bursting mode, spectral distribution), inter- and intra-burst property analysis (e.g. intra-burst ISI, number of spikes per burst, burst spike rate) and associated spike waveform indices (e.g. peak, peak-to-valley spike width, first and second principal component). Population spiking was analyzed by means of peri-event histogram, normalized cross-correlation pairs and phase coherency, using chronux toolbox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://chronux.org">chronux.org</ext-link>) and custom-made codes.</p>

<title>Archaerhodopsin-mediated inhibition of MD neurons</title>
<p>For our phasic inhibition experiment, 16 mice were injected in MD with aav5.hSyn.eArch3.0-eYFP (University of North Carolina, Vector Core). 3 mice were discarded post histological analysis due to low viral expression. This construct was favored over the halorhodopsin channel due to the long duration of the stimulation intended (60 min, 1sec pulse with a duty cycle of 50%, 0r 1 s ON-OFF sequence) and low toxicity. The mice were implanted with optic fiber guides (125 μm core diameter, Doric Lenses inc.) positioned at 30 degree angle from the transverse plane. The mice were given 2∼3 weeks to recover and to allow for the viral expression. For Arch-mediated inhibition we used a 532 nm (Green, MGL-S-532-OEM, Changchun New Industries Optoelectronics Technology Co., Ltd) laser to deliver at ∼2mW to each fiber guide through a patch cord (SMA end-to-end; Thorlabs Inc.). These mice were then randomly assigned to a no stimulation (n = 7) and a 1 s ON-OFF stimulation group (n = 6). The mice received the stimulation immediately after being placed in the treadmill, then received the i.p. injection of 3.0 g/kg of ethanol as in other experiments.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This an interesting and valuable study that uses multiple approaches to understand the role of bursting involving voltage-gated calcium channels within the mediodorsal thalamus in the sedative-hypnotic effects of alcohol. Given its unique functional roles and connectivity pattern, the idea that the mediodorsal thalamus may have a fundamental role in regulating alcohol-induced transitions in consciousness state would be both important for researchers investigating thalamocortical dynamics and more broadly interesting for understanding brain function. In addition, the author's examination of the role of the voltage-gated calcium channel Cav3.1 provides some evidence that burst-firing mediated by this channel in the thalamus is functionally important for behavioral-state transitions. While many previous studies have suggested an analogous role for sleep-state regulation, the evidence for an analogous role of this type of bursting in sedative-induced transitions is more limited. Despite the importance of these results, however, there is some concern that the manipulations and recording approaches employed by the authors may affect other thalamic nuclei adjacent to the MD, such as the central lateral nucleus, which has also been implicated in controlling state transitions. The evidence for a specific role of the mediodorsal thalamus is therefore somewhat incomplete, and so additional validation is needed.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This study employs multiple, complementary research approaches including behavioral assays, sh-RNA-based localized knockdown, single-unit recordings, and patterned optogenetic interventions to examine the role of activity in the mediodorsal thalamus in the sedative-hypnotic effects of alcohol. Experiments and analyses included in the manuscript generally appear well conceived and are also generally well executed. Sample sizes are sufficiently large and statistical analysis appears generally appropriate though in some cases additional quantification would be helpful. The findings presented are novel and provide some interesting insight into the role of the thalamus as well as voltage-gated calcium channels within this region in controlling behavioral state transitions induced by alcohol. In particular, the observed effects of selective knockout along with recordings in total knockout of the voltage-gated calcium channel, Cav3.1, which has previously been implicated in bursting dynamics as well as state transitions, particularly in sleep, together suggest that the transition of thalamic neurons to a bursting pattern of firing from a more constant firing is important for transition to the sedated state produced by ethanol intoxication. While previous studies have similarly implicated Cav3.1 bursting in behavioral state transitions, the direct optogenetic interventions and single-unit recordings provide valuable new insight. These findings may also have interesting implications for the relationship between sleep process disruption associated with ethanol dependence, although the authors do not appear to examine this directly or extensively discuss these implications of their findings.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
A key claim of the study is that the mediodorsal thalamus is specifically important for the sedative-hypnotic effect of ethanol and that a transition to a bursting pattern of firing in this circuit facilitates these effects due to a loss of a more constant tonic firing pattern. Despite the generally clear observed effects across the included experiments, however, the evidence presented does not fully support that the mediodorsal thalamus, in particular, is involved. This distinction is important because some previous studies have suggested that another thalamic nucleus which is very close to the mediodorsal thalamus, the central-lateral thalamus, has previously been suggested to play a role in preventing sedative-induced transitions. Despite its proximity to the mediodorsal thalamus, the central-lateral thalamus has a substantially different pattern of connectivity so distinguishing which region is impacted is important for understanding the findings in the manuscript. While sh-RNA knockdown appears to be largely centered in the mediodorsal thalamus in the example shown, (Figure 2) this is rather minimal evidence and it is also not well explained (indeed, the relevant panels do not even appear to be referenced in the text of the manuscript) and the consistency of the knockdown targeting is not quantified. Additional evidence should be provided to validate this approach. Similarly, while an example is shown for the expression of ChR2 (Fig. 5) there seems to be some spread of expression outside of the mediodorsal thalamus even in his example raising a concern about how regionally specific this effect.</p>
<p>The recordings targeting the mediodorsal thalamus could provide evidence of a direct association between changes in activity specifically in this part of the thalamus with the behavioral measures but there are currently some issues with making this link. One difficulty is that, although lesions are shown in Figure S5 to validate recording locations, this figure is relatively unclear and the examples appear to be taken from a different anterior/posterior location compared to the reference diagram. A larger image and improved visualization of the overall set of lesion locations that includes multiple anterior/posterior coronal sections would be helpful. Moreover, even for these example images, it is difficult to evaluate whether these are in the mediodorsal thalamus, particularly given the small size of the image shown. Ideally, an example image that is more obviously in the mediodorsal thalamus would also be included. Finally, an assessment of the relationship between the approximate locations of recorded neurons across the tetrode arrays and the behavioral measures would be very helpful in supporting the unique role of the mediodorsal thalamus. The lack of these direct links, in combination with the histological issues, reduces the insight that can be gained from this study.</p>
<p>In addition to the key experimental issues mentioned above, there are often problems in the text of the manuscript with reasoning or at least explanation as well as numerous minor issues with editing. The most substantial such issue is the lack of clarity in discussing the mediodorsal thalamus and other adjacent thalamic nuclei, such as the central-lateral nucleus, in the author's discussion of previous findings. Given that at last one of the manuscripts cited by the authors (Saalman, Front. Sys. Neuro. 2014) has directly claimed that central-lateral, rather than the mediodorsal, thalamus is important for arousal regulation related to a conscious state, this distinction should be addressed clearly in the discussion rather than papered over by grouping multiple thalamic nuclei as being medial. As part of this discussion, it would be important to consider additional relevant literature including Bastos et al., eLife, 2021 and Redinbaugh et al., Neuron, 2020 which are quite critical but currently do not appear to be cited. Considering additional literature relevant to the function of the mediodorsal thalamus would also be beneficial.</p>

While the methods employed generally seem sound, the description in the methods section is lacking in detail and is often difficult to follow. Analysis methods such as the burst index appear to only be given a brief explanation in the text and appear not to be mentioned in the methods section. Similarly, the staining method used in Figure 2 does not appear to be described in the methods section. The most substantial case is for the UMAP approach used in Figure 4-E which does not appear to be described in the methods or even described in the main text. The lack of detailed descriptions makes it difficult to evaluate the applicability and quality of the experimental and analytical approaches. Citations justifying the use of methods such as the approach to separate regular spiking and narrow spiking neuron subtypes are also needed.</p>
<p>Beyond the problems with content and reasoning discussed above, there are also some relatively minor issues with the clarity of writing throughout the paper (for example, in the abstract the authors refer to &quot;the ethanol resistance behavior in WT mice&quot; but it is difficult to parse what they mean by this statement. Similarly, the next sentence &quot;These results support that the maintenance...&quot; while clearer, is not well phrased. Though individually minor, issues like this re-occur throughout the manuscript and sometimes make it difficult to follow so the text should be revised to correct them. There are also some problems with labels such as the labels of A1/A2 in Figure 4, which appear to be incorrect. Also, S7 has no label on the B panels. Finally, some references are not included (only a label of [ref]).</p>

<p>In the current study, Latchoumane and collaborators focus on the Cav3.1 calcium channels in the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus as critical players in the regulation of brain-states and ethanol resistance in mice. By combining behavioural, electrophysiological, and genetic techniques, they report three main findings. First, KO Cav3.1 mice exhibit resistance to ethanol-induced sedation and sustained tonic firing in thalamocortical units. Second, knocked-down Cav3.1 mice reproduce the same behaviour when the mediodorsal, but not the ventrobasal, thalamic nucleus is targeted. Third, either optogenetic or electric stimulation of the mediodorsal thalamus reduces ethanol-induced sedation in control animals.</p>
<p>Overall, the study is well designed and performed, correctly controlled for confounds, and properly analysed. Nonetheless, it is important to address some aspects of the report. The results support the conclusions of the study. These results are likely to be relevant in the field of systems neuroscience, as they increase the molecular evidence showing how the thalamus regulates brain states.</p>
