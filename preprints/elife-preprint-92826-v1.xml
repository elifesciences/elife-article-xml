<title>Abstract</title><p>Diabetes is the second most frequent chronic comorbidity for COVID-19 mortality, yet the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Previous studies suggest that Cathepsin L (CTSL) is implicated in diabetic complications such as nephropathy and retinopathy. Our previous research identified CTSL as a critical protease that promotes SARS-CoV-2 infection and a potential drug target. Here, we show that individuals with diabetes have elevated blood CTSL levels, which facilitates SARS-CoV-2 infection. Chronic hyperglycemia, as indicated by HbA1c levels, is positively correlated with CTSL concentration and activity in diabetic patients. Acute hyperglycemia induced by a hyperglycemic clamp in healthy individuals increases CTSL activity. <italic>In vitro,</italic> high glucose, but not high insulin, promotes SARS-CoV-2 infection in wild-type (WT) cells, while <italic>CTSL</italic> knockout (KO) cells show reduced susceptibility to high glucose-promoted effects. Using lung tissue samples from diabetic and non-diabetic patients, as well as db/db diabetic and control mice, our findings demonstrate that diabetic conditions increase CTSL activity in both humans and mice. Mechanistically, high glucose levels promote CTSL maturation and CTSL translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the lysosome via the ER-Golgi-lysosome axis. This study emphasizes the significance of hyperglycemia-induced cathepsin L maturation in the development of diabetic comorbidities and complications.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cysteine proteases, including cathepsin L (CTSL), are crucial in human pathobiology due to their diverse biological activities inside and outside cells. Recent studies suggest that cathepsins, including CTSL, play a role in metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Crawford et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ding et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Limonte et al., 2022</xref>), as well as diabetic complications. In previous studies, CTSL has been linked to proteinuria in podocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Reiser et al., 2004</xref>) and intraocular angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Shimada et al., 2010</xref>), making it a potential target for diabetic nephropathy and vision-threatening diseases such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Shimada et al., 2010</xref>). Selective inhibition of CTSL may hold potential for therapeutic interventions.</p>
<p>More recently, CTSL has been implicated in the cleavage and processing of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which is necessary for the virus to enter and replicate in host cells, as reported by our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Zhao et al., 2021b</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Jackson et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Muralidar et al., 2021</xref>). Our previous studies show that elevated CTSL concentrations are associated with increased disease severity and CTSL is crucial for activation of all emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, making it a potential drug target for future mutation-resistant therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Zhao et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Zhao et al., 2022</xref>). However, the role of CTSL in COVID-19 infection among diabetic patients has not been explored.</p>
<p>Patients with diabetes have been identified as a high-risk group for developing severe COVID-19 and experiencing increased mortality rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Khunti et al., 2021</xref>). Several studies have reported that patients with diabetes are 1.23 - 5.87 times more likely to experience severe COVID-19 and death compared to those without diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Dennis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Shi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Williamson et al., 2020</xref>). According to data from the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), diabetes is the second leading chronic comorbidity contributing to COVID-19 deaths, after hypertension . Even among patients with diabetes, after full adjustment, those with higher blood glucose (HbA1c ≥ 7.5%) had higher hazard ratio (HR) (1.95 <italic>vs.</italic> 1.31) than those with lower blood glucose (HbA1c &lt; 7.5%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Williamson et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>This study investigates, for the first time, the impact of high glucose levels on CTSL maturation and diabetic comorbidities and complications, with a focus on SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with diabetes. Our findings suggest that high glucose levels promote CTSL maturation and translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum to the lysosome, potentially contributing to diabetic comorbidities and complications.</p>

<title>Diabetic COVID-19: severe, high CTSL</title>
<p>In COVID-19 patients, we conducted a case-control study to examine the association of diabetes and COVID-19 severity in 207 COVID-19 inpatients from two hospitals. We matched 62 patients by gender and age, 31 with diabetes and 31 without (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref> summarizes the demographic and clinical characteristics of these diabetic and non-diabetic COVID-19 patients. We found that diabetic patients had a significantly higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 than non-diabetic patients according to the clinical classification criteria (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nhc.gov.cn/">http://www.nhc.gov.cn/</ext-link>), and had more symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and dyspnea (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Diabetic COVID-19 patients showed higher levels of inflammation and infection markers (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). These results suggest that diabetes is strongly associated with severity of COVID-19.</p>

<p>To explore the mechanisms of hyperglycemia and SARS-CoV-2 infection, we collected plasma samples from Beijing Youan Hospital on Day 0 (the admission day), Day 14, and Day 28 after discharge from the hospital (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells through the virus spike protein binding with ACE2 receptor. It uses host proteases, such as CTSL and cathepsin B (CTSB) to activate its spike protein by cleavage, which enhances its cell entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Jackson et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Muralidar et al., 2021</xref>). We measured the plasma levels of COVID-19 related proteins, ACE2, CTSL, and CTSB in diabetic and non-diabetic COVID-19 patients. Only CTSL levels were significantly higher in diabetic patients than in non-diabetic patients and changed with the course of COVID-19. CTSL peaked on admission day and decreased significantly after discharge from the hospital (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d-f</xref>). These results indicate that CTSL is strongly associated with COVID-19, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Zhao et al., 2022</xref>), and may be involved in diabetes in COVID-19 patients.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Impact of hyperglycemia on CTSL activity</title>
<p>In non-COVID-19 participants, we investigated the correlation of CTSL with chronic and acute hyperglycemia using two studies. First, to examine the impact of chronic hyperglycemia on CTSL, we performed a case-control study in 61 patients with type 2 diabetes and 61 euglycemic subjects, matched for sex and age (<xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). We found that plasma CTSL activity and concentration were strongly positively correlated with chronic hyperglycemia indicated by HbA1c, and were significantly higher in diabetic patients than in euglycemic individuals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a-d</xref>). Second, to examine the impact of acute hyperglycemia on CTSL, we performed a hyperglycemic clamp study in 15 healthy male subjects (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e-g</xref>). We observed that CTSL activity increased parallelly with blood glucose levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h, i</xref>). However, CTSL concentration did not change with blood glucose levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2j</xref>). Therefore, chronic hyperglycemia is strongly associated with both CTSL concentration and activity, while acute hyperglycemia only affects CTSL activity.</p>

</fig>
<p>We also observed a strongly correlation between CTSL activity/concentration and other chronic comorbidities like hypertensin and coronary heart disease (CHD), except for diabetes (<xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Additionally, elevated blood glucose levels also accompanied with an increase in insulin and proinsulin C-peptide levels in acute hyperglycemic individuals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f, g</xref>) and diabetic patients (insulin resistance) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Gerich, 2003</xref>). It is unclear whether the increased CTSL activity/concentration is solely a result of hyperglycemia or the corresponding hyperinsulinemia, and further clarification is needed.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Glucose enhances SARS-CoV-2 via CTSL</title>
<p>To validate our hypothesis that diabetic patients are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection results from higher CTSL levels, we conducted <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments using a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus system, which indicates the virus invasion rate instead of replication, and utilized the SARS-CoV-2 susceptible human hepatoma cell line Huh7, given that the liver is a primary target of SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Gupta et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>First, to examine if cells cultured with serum from diabetic patients are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we compared the infectivity of cells cultured with healthy and diabetic sera exposed to SARS-CoV-2 using a luciferase assay. The results showed that cells cultured with diabetic serum had higher infection rate than cultured with healthy serum (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>), indicating diabetic serum facilitated SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells.</p>

<p>Huh7 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. <bold>a</bold> Wildtype (WT) cells cultured in sera from healthy and diabetic individuals were infected with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (1.3 × 10<sup>4</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml).

<graphic xlink:href="23297013v1_fig3.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>Next, we investigated whether elevated blood glucose or insulin level promoted SARS-CoV-2 infection by culturing Huh7 cells in cell media with various concentrations of glucose or insulin. Consistent with our clinical data, the results showed that infection was more severe in Huh7 cells at high glucose levels, while insulin levels had a minimal impact on SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b, c</xref>).</p>
<p>Given that hyperglycemia increased CTSL levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) and facilitated SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>), we hypothesized that high blood glucose promoted SARS-CoV-2 infection through CTSL. To investigate the requirement of CTSL in SARS-CoV-2 infection, we used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to establish a stable <italic>CTSL</italic> knockout (KO) Huh7 cell line. The knockout efficiency of CTSL protein of <italic>CTSL</italic> KO Huh7 cell line was confirmed in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>. Compared with wild-type (WT) cells, knockout of <italic>CTSL</italic> led to a significant reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>), suggesting that CTSL is crucial for SARS-CoV-2 infection as we previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Zhao et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>We then conducted a <italic>CTSL</italic> KO Huh7 cell infection experiment under different glucose conditions, to illustrate the impact of glucose level on SARS-CoV-2 infection via CTSL. The results showed that WT Huh7 cell cultured in high glucose medium exhibited a much higher infective rate than those in low glucose medium. However, <italic>CTSL</italic> KO Huh7 cells maintained a low infective rate of SARS-CoV-2 regardless of glucose or insulin levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f-h</xref>). Therefore, hyperglycemia enhanced SARS-CoV-2 infection dependent on CTSL. Considering that CTSL realizes its proteolytic function through its enzyme activity and protein concentration, subsequent studies aimed to reveal whether the CTSL activity or concentration changed under high glucose condition.</p>

<title>High glucose boosts CTSL activity</title>
<p>To investigate the impact of hyperglycemia on CTSL activity, we conducted a series experiments. Our findings showed that elevated glucose levels significantly stimulated both intracellular and extracellular CTSL activity in a dose-dependent manner in Huh7 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a, b</xref>), which was consistent with our clinical data (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, h</xref>).

<title>High glucose stimulates CTSL maturation</title>
<p>To investigate the impact of high blood glucose on CTSL expression, we first measured the mRNA levels of CTSL under different glucose concentrations using D-glucose and L-glucose (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). While D-glucose is commonly used as a major energy source, L-glucose cannot be absorbed by cells but has similar physical properties to D-glucose, making it an ideal control. Surprisingly, our results showed that glucose or insulin levels did not affect CTSL mRNA levels in Huh7 cells, mouse tissues or human tissues (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), indicating that glucose did not influence CTSL transcription. CTSL undergoes several forms during its translation and post-translational maturation process. The immature pro-cathepsin L (proCTSL, 39 kDa) possesses an N-terminal proregion, which acts as an autoinhibitor. The protein is translocated through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi apparatus-lysosome axis, and the proregion is removed in the acidic environment in lysosome results in either single chain mature cathepsin L (sc-mCTSL, 31 kDa) or double chain mature cathepsin L (dc-mCTSL, 24 kDa) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Coutinho et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Ishidoh and Kominami, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Reiser et al., 2010</xref>).

<p>Interestingly, we found that high glucose levels promoted CTSL maturation, whereas insulin had no effect on this process, as shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>. Our results indicated that high D-glucose levels reduced proCTSL and increased sc-mCTSL and dc-mCTSL in a glucose dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). The results also confirmed that only D-glucose induced CTSL maturation from proCTSL to mCTSL, while L-glucose had no such effects (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b, c</xref>). Similar effects of high glucose on CTSL maturation were also observed in diabetic mice and human tissues compared with their healthy counterparts (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d, e</xref>). These results suggested that hyperglycemia rather than hyperinsulinemia or other physical parameters associated with CTSL maturation. This was consistent with our previous data that elevated glucose levels enhanced CTSL activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>), since only mature CTSL has enzymatic activity.</p>

<sec id="s2f">
<title>High glucose promotes CTSL translocation</title>
<p>We have shown that high glucose promoted CTSL maturation by converting proCTSL into mCTSL (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). However, the mechanism underlying this process remained unclear. As mentioned previously, CTSL maturation depends on structural activation via the ER-Golgi apparatus-lysosome axis and acid activation at low pH environment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Ishidoh and Kominami, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Reiser et al., 2010</xref>). Only the CTSL in lysosome is processed into mature form and has proteolytic activity, while the CTSL in the ER or Golgi apparatus is immature and does not have enzymatic activity. Based on this, we hypothesized that high blood glucose may drive CTSL maturation via the ER-Golgi apparatus-lysosome axis. We labeled specific proteins in each organelle: calreticulin for ER, GM130 for Golgi apparatus and lamp1 for lysosome (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). We also confirmed CTSL expression in Huh7 cells (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Confocal microscopy results revealed that under low glucose conditions, CTSL tended to co-localize within the ER rather than lysosomes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b, e</xref>). This finding suggests that CTSL primarily existed in an immature form under low glucose conditions. As glucose level increased, CTSL in the Golgi apparatus remained unchanged (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c, f</xref>), while co-localized largely increased in the lysosomes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d, g</xref>), suggesting CTSL predominantly existed in mature form under high glucose conditions. Therefore, we concluded that high glucose facilitated CTSL translocation through the ER-Golgi apparatus-lysosome axis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Almost immediately after the SARS-CoV-2 emerged, it became apparent that individuals with chronic conditions, including diabetes, were disproportionately affected, with a heightened risk of hospitalization and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Williamson et al., 2020</xref>). Diabetes may increase susceptibility to severe SARS-CoV-2 infections for various suggested reasons. These include higher viral titer, relatively low functioning T lymphocytes that lead to decreased viral clearance, vulnerability to hyperinflammation and cytokine storm syndrome, and comorbidities associated with type 2 diabetes, such as cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, hypertension, and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Mazucanti and Egan, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Moradi-Marjaneh et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, other risk factors that may contribute to the severity of infection include increased expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Rao et al., 2020</xref>) and furin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Fernandez et al., 2018</xref>). However, most current studies on COVID-19 and diabetes focus on epidemiological evidence and biomarker features, but few investigate the causal link and underlying mechanisms of how hyperglycemia enhances SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed by human body fluids, biopsies, and animal models. The underlying mechanisms by which diabetes or hyperglycemia exacerbates COVID-19 remain to be fully elucidated.</p>
<p>This study identified that CTSL maturation induced by hyperglycemia may contribute to the higher mortality and severity of COVID-19 in patients with diabetes. Our clinical data showed that human plasma CTSL activity and concentration were strongly correlated with acute (in euglycemic participants under high glucose clamp conditions) and chronic (in diabetic patients, both with and without COVID-19) hyperglycemia, respectively. Using lung tissue samples from diabetic and non-diabetic patients, as well as db/db diabetic and control mice, we found that diabetic conditions increased CTSL activity in both humans and mice. High glucose promoted SARS-CoV-2 infection in WT cells, while <italic>CTSL</italic> KO cells showed reduced susceptibility to high glucose promoting effects. Mechanistically, we proposed that hyperglycemia promoted CTSL maturation by accelerating its translocation from the ER to lysosome via Golgi apparatus. This condition increased the functionality of CTSL, which cleaved the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, promoting virus membrane fusion and infection (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6h</xref>).</p>
<p>To date, there have been limited studies investigating the relationship between cathepsin maturation and glucose. In 1998, Tournu C, et al. reported that D-glucose did not impact mRNA levels for CTSB or CTSL or secretion of proCTSL. However, D-glucose did significantly enhance the amount of mature forms of CTSB and CTSL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Tournu et al., 1998</xref>). More recently, Shi Q, et al. found that increased glucose metabolism promotes O-GlcNAcylation of the lysosome-encapsulated protease CTSB, leading to elevated levels of mature CTSB in macrophages and secretion in the tumor microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Shi et al., 2022</xref>). These findings support our evidence that hyperglycemia drives CTSL maturation and enhances SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
<p>ACE2 has previously been identified as a critical host cell surface receptor that enables SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Wrapp et al., 2020</xref>). While some studies have reported that glucose can increase ACE2 expression in cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Hardtner et al., 2013</xref>), numerous other studies have found that ACE2 is downregulated in diabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Mizuiri et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Reich et al., 2008</xref>). Garreta et al. recently conducted a study using a human kidney organoid system to investigate the impact of diabetes on SARS-CoV-2 infections. The study revealed that hyperglycemia enhanced SARS-CoV-2 infection and hyperglycemic human kidney organoids had elevated ACE2 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Garreta et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, it remains controversial whether diabetes results in up- or downregulation of ACE2. In our study, we evaluated plasma levels of ACE2, CTSL, and CTSB in COVID-19 patients with and without diabetes. We found that only CTSL levels were significantly increased in diabetic patients compared to non-diabetic patients and varied during the course of COVID-19.</p>
<p>In addition to CTSL, there may be other bioactive factors involved in mediating SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with diabetes. A recent study revealed that diabetic patients have lower levels of serum 1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol (1,5-AG), a small-molecule metabolite in human blood that exhibits potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. The reduced levels of 1,5-AG have been associated with increased viral loads and severe respiratory tissue damage caused by SARS-CoV-2. Mechanistically, the study found that 1,5-AG binds directly to the S2 subunit of the spike protein, which disrupts virus-host membrane fusion and inhibits infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Tong et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, we propose that diabetes may promote COVID-19 infection through multiple factors, and CTSL is only one of several important factors.</p>
<p>Apart from diabetes, other comorbidities such as hypertension and CHD are also prevalent in COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, our study revealed a strong correlation between CTSL activity and concentration with hypertension and CHD in these patients. Using an angiotensin II-induced hypertension model, researchers observed an increase in blood pressure and CTSL activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Lu et al., 2020</xref>). Whether these chronic comorbidities contribute to increased morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 by increasing CTSL activity and concentration requires further investigation in the future.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study demonstrates that hyperglycemia drives the maturation and activation of CTSL, for only mature form of CTSL gains its function of proteolysis. Therefore, targeting CTSL may be a promising therapeutic strategy for diabetic comorbidities and complications.</p>

Next, Cas9 protein (1 μg) and sgRNA (0.2 μg) were added to each sample and mixed gently (Cas9 protein: sgRNA at a 1:1 molar ratio). Huh7 cells were electroporated for 5 times to minimize the <italic>CTSL</italic> gene on a Neon Transfection device (Invitrogen, USA).</p>

<title>Generation of <italic>CTSL-</italic>KO monoclonal Huh7 cell line</title>
<p>Cells were isolated from the stable <italic>CTSL</italic>-KO Huh7 cell pool by trypsinization and any cell clumps were broken up into individual cells. Cells concentration was quantitated in this homogenized cell solution with a cell counter. Then, 100 µL of the 5 cells/mL solution was transferred into each well of a 96-well plate. By doing this, the average density of 0.5 cells/well of the plate was seeded. Seeding an average of 0.5 cells/well ensured that some wells received a single cell, while minimizing the likelihood that any well receives more than one cell. Then we observed and recorded the cell growth in the plate for the following 30 days. Once the cells have expanded but before they become over-confluent, we trypsinized the cells and expanded them to larger culture dishes.</p>

<title>RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR analyses</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted and purified from the cultured Huh7 cells, human and mouse tissues using RNAprep Pure Cell/ Bacteria kit (Tiangen, Cat. No DP430) and RNAprep Pure Tissue kit (Tiangen, Cat. No DP431) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA (0.5 μg) was reverse transcribed to cDNA in a final volume (20 μL) using TransScript First-Strand cDNA Synthesis SuperMix (Transgen, Cat. No AT301). RT-PCR analyses were performed with TransStart Tip Green qPCR SuperMix (Transgen, Cat. No 1). Gene expression values were normalized to the control (β-actin) level. <xref rid="tbls5" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 5</xref> provides a list of all primer sequences.

<title>Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT)</title>
<p>The db/db and db/m mice were subjected to an overnight fast lasting 16 hours, during which they were permitted unrestricted access to water. Subsequently, they received an intraperitoneal injection of 1 g/kg body weight glucose. Blood samples were obtained at 0, 15-, 30-, 60-, and 120-minutes post-glucose injection. Blood glucose levels were determined using an automatic glucometer (One Touch, LifeScan, USA), while insulin concentrations were evaluated using a highly sensitive mouse insulin ELISA kit (Millipore, Cat. No EZRMI-13K), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>

<sec id="s5h">
<title>Western blot analysis</title>
<p>Total protein was extracted from Huh7 cells and human and mouse tissues. The protein amount was assessed using the BCA protein assay kit (Thermo, Cat. No WH333441). Samples of 30-50 µg of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore, Cat. No 0000167358), and detected using enhanced chemiluminescent reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Zhao et al., 2021a</xref>).

<title>Analysis of CTSL activity</title>
<p>The activity of CTSL in plasma, human and mouse tissues, Huh7 cells and cell medium was evaluated using its specific substrate, Ac-FR-AFC (R&amp;D, Cat. No ES009). Prior to measurement, the cell medium was concentrated using the ultra-tube (Milipore, Cat. No UFC501096). The test samples were evaluated in the presence of a reaction buffer (100mM NaAc, 5mM EDTA, pH 5.3). The reaction was conducted in 100 µL system (50µL sample containing CTSL protein+ 47µL reaction buffer + 1 µL DTT (1 mM) + 2 µL substrate Ac-FR-AFC (10 mM)) in 96-well black plates. The plated was cultured at 37℃ for 2 h in light avoidance incubator. The fluorescence emitted from the samples was then measured using a fluorescence plate reader (Infinite 200, TECAN, China) at the Ex = 380 nm, Em = 460 nm wavelengths.</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence assay</title>
<p>The CTSL, calreticulin, Golgi membrane protein 130 (GM130) and lysosomal associated membrane protein 1 (Lamp 1) distributions in the Huh7 cells were visualized by immunofluorescent staining. The CTSL, calreticulin, GM130 and Lamp1 antibody species source IgG were used as negative control (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Briefly, Huh7 cells was cultured in 35mm confocal dishes after poly-l-lysine coating. After high/low glucose treatment for 96 h, Huh7 cells were then fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and permeabilized by a detergent 0.25% triton X-100. A specific primary antibody is applied on the Huh7 cell surface at 4 ℃ overnight. After wash out, the secondary antibody is applied at room temperature for 1 hour avoid from light. All pictures were captured under Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy (FV3000RS, Olympus, Japan).

<title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title>
<p>Clinical data are shown as percentage or median, as appropriate. Comparison of continuous data between two independent groups was performed using the Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test. An unpaired <italic>t</italic> test was used for comparing the averages/means of two independent or unrelated groups. A paired t-test was used to test whether the mean difference between pairs of measurements is existing. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for checking if the means of two or more categories are significantly different from each other. Spearman’s rho test (two-tailed) was used to analyze nonparametric correlations of parameters correlated with CTSL levels and diabetes. Fluorescence intensity was calculated by Plot Profile tool in Image J software. Graphpad prism 7.0 software and SPSS for Windows 17.0 were used for statistical analysis, with statistical significance set at two-sided. *<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, **<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, ***<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, ****<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study advances our understanding of why diabetes is a risk factor for more severe Covid-19 disease. The authors offer <bold>solid</bold> evidence that cathepsin L is more active in diabetic individuals, that this higher activity is recapitulated at the cellular level in the presence of high glucose, and that high glucose leads to higher cathepsin L maturation. While not all aspects of the relationship between diabetes and cathepsin L (e.g., effects of metabolic acidosis) have been investigated, the work should be of interest to researchers in diabetes, virology, and immunology.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The study by He et al. investigates the relationship of an increased susceptibility of diabetes patients to COVID-19. The paper raises the possibility that hyperglycemia-induced cathepsin L maturation could be one of the driving forces in this pathology, suggesting that an increased activity of CTSL leads to accelerated virus infection rates due to an elevated processing of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.</p>
<p>In a clinical case-control study, the team found that the severity of corona infections was higher in diabetic patients, and their CTSL levels correlated well with the progression of the disease. They further showed an increase in CTSL activity in the long term as well as acute hyperglycemia. SARS-CoV-2 increasingly infected cells that were cultured in serum from diabetic patients, the same was observed using high glucose medium. No effect was observed in the medium with increased concentrations of insulin. CTSL knockout abolished the glucose-dependent increase in infection.</p>
<p>Increased glucose levels did not correlate with an increase in CTSL transcription. Rather He et al. could show that high glucose levels led to CTSL translocation from the ER into the lysosome. It was the glucose-dependent processing of the protease to its active form which promoted infection.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
It is a complete study starting from a clinical observation and ending on the molecular mechanism. A strength is certainly the wide selection of experiments. The clinical study to investigate the effect of glucose on CTSL concentrations in healthy individuals sets the stage for experiments in cell culture, animal models, and human tissue. The effect of CTSL knockout cell lines on glucose-induced SARS-CoV2 infection rates is convincing. Finally, the team used a combination of Western blots and confocal microscopy to identify the underlying molecular mechanisms. The authors manage to keep the diabetic condition at the center of their study and therefore extend on previous knowledge of glucose-induced CTSL activation and their consequences for COVID-19 infections. By doing so, they create a novel connection between CTSL involvement in SARS-CoV2 infections and diabetes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The authors suggest that hyperglycemia as a symptom of diabetes leads to an increased infection rate in those patients. Throughout their study, the team focuses on two select symptoms of a diabetic condition, hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. The team acknowledges in the discussion that there could be various other reasons. Hyperglycemia can lead to metabolic acidosis and a shift in blood pH. As CTSL activity is highly dependent on pH, it would have been crucial to include this parameter in the study.</p>
<p>The study rarely differentiates between cellular and extracellular CTSL activity. A more detailed explanation for the connection between the intracellular CTSL and serum CTSL in diabetic individuals, presumably via lysosomal exocytosis, could be helpful with regard to the final model to give a more complete picture.</p>
<p>In the early result section, an effect of hyperglycemia on total CTSL concentrations is described, but the data is not very convincing. Over the course of the manuscript, the hypothesis shifts increasingly towards an increase in protease trans-localization and processing to the active form rather than a change in total protease amounts. The overall importance of CTSL concentrations remains questionable.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this study, the authors hypothesized that individuals with diabetes have elevated blood CTSL levels, which facilitates SARS-CoV-2 infection. The authors conducted in vitro experiments, revealing that elevated glucose levels promote SARS-CoV-2 infection in wild-type cells. In contrast, CTSL knockout cells show reduced susceptibility to high glucose-promoted effects. Additionally, the authors utilized lung tissue samples obtained from both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, along with db/db diabetic and control mice. Their findings indicate that diabetic conditions lead to an elevation in CTSL activity in both humans and mice.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors have effectively met their research objectives, and their conclusions are supported by the data presented. Their findings suggest that high glucose levels promote CTSL maturation and translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum to the lysosome, potentially contributing to diabetic comorbidities and complications.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
1. In Figure 1e, the authors measured plasma levels of COVID-19 related proteins, including ACE2, CTSL, and CTSB, in both diabetic and non-diabetic COVID-19 patients. Notably, only CTSL levels exhibited a significant increase in diabetic patients compared to non-diabetic patients, and these levels varied throughout the course of COVID-19. Given that the diabetes groups encompass both male and female patients, it is essential to ascertain whether the authors considered the potential impact of gender on CTSL levels. The diabetes groups comprised a higher percentage of male patients (61.3%) compared to the non-diabetes group, where males constituted only 38.7%.</p>
<p>2. Lines 145-149: &quot;The results showed that WT Huh7 cell cultured in high glucose medium exhibited a much higher infective rate than those in low glucose medium. However, CTSL KO Huh7 cells maintained a low infective rate of SARS-CoV-2 regardless of glucose or insulin levels (Fig. 3f-h). Therefore, hyperglycemia enhanced SARS-CoV-2 infection dependent on CTSL.&quot; However, this evidence may be insufficient to support the claim that hyperglycemia enhances SARS-CoV-2 infection dependent on CTSL. The human hepatoma cell line Huh7 might not be an ideal model to validate the authors' hypothesis regarding high blood glucose promoting SARS-CoV-2 infection through CTSL.</p>
<p>3. The Abstract and Introduction sections lack effective organization.</p>
