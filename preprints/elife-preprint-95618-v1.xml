<abstract>
<p>The accurate perception of innocuous temperatures, particularly those experienced as pleasantly warm, is essential for achieving thermal comfort and maintaining thermoregulatory balance. Warm-sensitive neurons (WSN) innervating the skin play a central role in non-painful warmth detection. The TRP ion channels TRPV1 and TRPM2 have been suggested as sensors of warm temperature in WSNs. However, the precise contribution of these channels to the process of warmth detection is not fully understood.</p>
<p>A significant challenge in analysing WSNs lies in their scarcity: fewer than 10 % of sensory neurons in the rodent dorsal root ganglion (DRG) respond to innocuous warm temperatures. In this study, we examined &gt;20,000 cultured mouse DRG neurons using calcium imaging and discovered distinct contributions of TRPV1 and TRPM2 to warm-temperature sensitivity. TRPV1 and TRPM2 affect the abundance of WSNs, with TRPV1 mediating the rapid, dynamic response to warmth.</p>
<p>By carefully tracking animal movement in a whole-body thermal preference paradigm, we observe that these cellular differences correlate with nuanced thermal behaviours. Utilizing a driftdiffusion model to quantitatively analyse the decision-making process of animals exposed to different environmental temperatures, we found that: TRPV1 primarily impairs the precision of evidence accumulation, whereas TRPM2 significantly increases the total duration of exposure to uncomfortably warm environments.</p>
<p>Our findings provide valuable insights into the distinct molecular responses to warmth stimuli, and underpin the subtle aspects of thermal decision-making when encountering minor temperature variations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The detection of temperature, and the related behavioural responses, are an integral part of our sensory interaction with the outside world. Thus, it is not surprising that temperature detection was one of the first sensory modalities to be studied in contemporary neuroscience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Early studies concentrated on the characterization of temperature-specific sensory fibres, covering the range from noxious cold, through innocuous cold and warm, to noxious heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). However, the molecular mechanism by which temperature activates these fibres remained elusive for decades.</p>
<p>A major breakthrough in the field of somatosensory research was the identification of temperature-sensitive ion channels that belong to the transient-receptor potential (TRP) super family as the molecular sensors responsible for the detection of noxious cold and heat in sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). However, the temperatures in-between noxious cold and heat (25 °C to 43 °C), which are often perceived as non-painful, received less attention. This innocuous temperature range also contains the so-called thermoneutral point (TNP); an ambient temperature (29 °C to 33 °C) at which mice do not exert additional energy to maintain their body temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). This makes the innocuous temperature range crucial for thermoregulation and the animal’s subsequent thermal or comfort choice. Recent studies began to uncover the mechanisms behind innocuous warm-temperature detection, thereby mainly converging on two candidate cation channels, namely TRPV1 and TRPM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Interestingly, the evidence for the involvement of both channels is seemingly contradictory.</p>
<p>TRPV1 is traditionally associated with the response to noxious temperature stimuli (&gt; 42 °C), with the ability to become sensitive to lower temperatures in inflammatory contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). However, <italic>in vivo</italic> calcium imaging of trigeminal sensory neurons in animals lacking TRPV1 showed a complete absence of responses to warm stimuli applied to the oral cavity of mice, while responses to hot temperatures were unchanged. Furthermore, acute inhibition of TRPV1 in animals trained to discriminate innocuous cold from warmth through a nose port led to a reduction in their performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). These results stand in contrast to other studies that showed no involvement of TRPV1 in warm-temperature detection, neither in thermal preference assays nor in an operant behaviour task with stimuli applied to the paws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>).</p>
<p>TRPM2 has reported <italic>ex vivo</italic> activation temperatures between 35 °C and 40 °C, depending on the cellular context, and was first described as a physiological temperature sensor in pancreatic islet cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Calcium imaging of DRG cultures from animals lacking TRPM2 showed a reduction in the proportion of warm- and heat-responsive neurons in comparison to wildtype sensory neuron cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Trpm2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> animals are unable to differentiate temperatures across the innocuous warm range in thermal preference tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>), while their ability to avoid noxious temperatures is not affected. However, this result is challenged by the minor deficits observed in the <italic>Trpm2</italic>-deficient animals trained to report warming of their paws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, both for TRPV1 and TRPM2, there is an apparent disconnect between the observations in cellular assays and the behavioural tasks assessing temperature detection. <italic>In vivo</italic> calcium imaging coupled with warm-temperature stimuli only shows a relevance of TRPV1, but not TRPM2 in the innocuous temperature range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Contrary to that, the lack of TRPM2, but not TRPV1, more consistently affects warm-temperature detection in assays of temperature preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), but not for operant behavioural assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>).</p>
<p>One main challenge for the analysis of WSNs, neurons that respond to innocuous temperature stimuli between 25 °C and 43 °C, is the low abundance of this neuronal population, which represents about 3 % to 10 % of sensory neurons in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Using in-depth functional analysis of 1000s of sensory neurons from multiple animals, we here describe that TRPV1 and TRPM2 are both involved in the detection of innocuous (warm) temperature stimuli. Furthermore, we demonstrate the diverging roles both channels play in warm-temperature detection through a novel thermal preference behaviour assay.</p>

<title>Mice prefer 31 °C to warmer temperatures when ambient and floor temperature are controlled</title>
<p>The ability to avoid uncomfortable environmental temperatures or move toward pleasant thermal conditions is fundamental to sustaining life. This process is known as behavioural thermoregulation and can be found in most groups of animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). The preference of rodents for temperature is traditionally assessed via paradigms that challenge the animals with differing floor temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). This leads to preference development that is based on temperature detection through glabrous skin, such as the paws, tail, and nose. Animals, however, are capable of integrating temperature from glabrous and non-glabrous skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). With the aim to probe behavioural thermoregulation in a more holistic context, we developed a thermal discrimination assay where both the floor and ambient temperature are controlled, termed the thermal chamber preference test (CPT) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-D</xref>, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>). When presented with warm ambient temperatures (34 °C and 38 °C) and 31 °C as control temperature, mice significantly preferred the 31 °C chamber over the warmer chambers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">F</xref>, Table S2). Compared to the classic two-plate preference test (TPT), wildtype animals developed a stronger preference for the 31 °C side in the CPT (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1I</xref>). Additionally, animals showed a clear preference for 31 °C when given 34 °C as an option in the CPT. This is not observed in the classic TPT (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1I</xref>). This observation suggests that more subtle ambient temperature differences, relating to comfort and thermoregulation, are more faithfully assessed in the CPT assay.</p>

<title>TRPM2 is necessary for establishing a preference in the warm-temperature range</title>
<p>Previous studies assessing warmtemperature detection using the TPT with animals lacking TRPV1 or TRPM2 showed that <italic>Trpm2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> animals failed to differentiate between 31 °C and 38 °C while <italic>Trpv1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> animals, similar to wildtypes, preferred the 31 °C side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Similarly, when using the newly developed CPT, <italic>Trpv1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> animals showed a similar temperature preference to wildtypes while <italic>Trpm2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> animals failed to develop a preference for the thermoneutral (31 °C) side (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E-F</xref>), without affecting their preference at 25 °C ( <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A-B</xref>). In addition to the previously described phenotype at 38 °C, <italic>Trpm2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> animals were also unable to discriminate 34 °C from 31 °C, emphasizing the relevance of TRPM2 at milder warm temperatures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E-F</xref>, and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>). Notably, the phenotype of <italic>Trpm2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> animals was similar to that of animals lacking most, if not all, peripheral (heat and cold) thermosensors (<italic>Trpv1</italic><sup><italic>Abl</italic></sup>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>), <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1J-L</xref>). These results confirm previous data demonstrating the requirement for TRPM2 rather than TRPV1, in preference development in the warm-temperature range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2a3">
<title>TRPV1 and TRPM2 affect different aspects of warm-temperature detection</title>
<p>Traditionally, analyses of temperature preference are limited to reporting the proportion of time an animal spent at the test temperature, without assessing more finegrained thermal preference behaviour, such as the sequence of chamber crossings and intermittent pauses (visit lengths, (23– 25)). We observed that in the CPT, animals cross from one chamber to the other, probing the chamber, before crossing back (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). We quantified the number of crossings and the lengths of these episodes throughout the experiments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). At the start of the experiment, mice of all genotypes crossed more often than at the end of the experiment while maintaining similar durations of their visits to the warmer chamber (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1C-D</xref>). <italic>Trpv1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> animals showed a significantly higher crossing rate compared to wildtype animals at both 34 °C and 38 °C (Table S2). <italic>Trpm2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> animals, on the other hand, had significantly longer visits to the warmer chamber compared to wildtype animals, while having either similar (at 38 °C) or a reduced crossing rate (at 34 °C) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>, Table S2).</p>
<p>Notably, animals lacking TRPM8, a cold-sensitive TRP-channel that was shown to be critical for reporting warming in an operant behavioural assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>), showed similar behaviour to wildtype animals across the warm-temperature range, but deficits at 25 °C (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2F-G</xref> and Table S2).</p>
<p>Together, these observations suggest that, contrary to previous findings using the TPT, both TRPV1 and TRPM2 contribute to the animals’ ability to detect warm temperatures and to drive associated thermal preference behaviours, albeit through different mechanisms.</p>

<sec id="s2b1">
<title>A small subpopulation of cultured primary sensory neurons responds to warm temperatures</title>
<p><italic>Trpv1</italic> and <italic>Trpm2</italic> are highly expressed in peripheral sensory neurons that reside bilaterally in so-called dorsal root ganglia (DRG) along the spinal cord. To assess the individual contribution of both channels to ambient warm-temperature detection, and to account for the integration of temperature across the whole body of the animal, we cultured primary DRG neurons pooled from across the whole length of the spine.</p>
<p>Historically, experiments studying temperature responses in sensory neurons are performed with DRG neurons cultured for a few hours to overnight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). However, these cultures did not reflect the distribution of WSNs described from <italic>in vivo</italic> studies, with 26 ± 9 % of all cells responding to warm temperatures, contrary to 3 % to 10 % of WSNs observed <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A-C</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>)). We speculated that this expansion in the proportion of WSNs might reflect a post-injury state in which heat-sensitive neurons become sensitised to lower thermal stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Since sensory neuron dissociation resembles an axotomy which activates injury-related pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>), we extended the commonly used DRG primary culture protocol to three days, to allow the cells to recover from the procedure. Three-day cultures harboured approximately 6 ± 3 % WSNs, compared to overnight culture’s 26 ± 9 % (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3C</xref>). Furthermore, three-day cultures showed a reduced calcium inflow upon stimulation, and an improved capacity to return to baseline calcium levels upon termination of the stimulus, counteracting hallmarks of post-injury states of sensory neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3D-E</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>)). These observations are in line with data collected from <italic>in vivo</italic> calcium imaging preparations of both dorsal root and trigeminal ganglion cells in response to warm temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>) and suggest that three-day cultures – rather than acute/short-term preparations – more accurately reflect the functional properties and abundance of warm-responsive sensory neurons that are found in behaving animals.</p>

<title>Trpv1 and Trpm2 deletion reduces the proportion of warmth responders</title>
<p>To investigate the effects of TRPV1 and TRPM2 loss on the response of sensory neurons to warm-temperature stimulation, we applied the same stimulation protocol to cultures from <italic>Trpv1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> and <italic>Trpm2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> animals. Lack of TRPV1 or TRPM2 led to a significant reduction in the proportion of WSNs, compared to wildtype cultures (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, Table S2). Cultures from <italic>Trpv1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> animals had reduced proportions of responders across the whole range of warm-temperature stimuli (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and D), but showed similar proportions of heat responders (neurons responding to <italic>T</italic> ≥43 °C) when compared to cultures obtained from wildtype animals (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3J</xref>). In contrast to a previous study describing WSNs <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>), our <italic>Trpv1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> cultures did not show a complete absence of response to warm temperatures, with some cells in the <italic>Trpv1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> cultures retaining their ability to respond to warm stimuli (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and D). Lack of TRPM2, on the other hand, affected the proportions of responders across both the warm and the hot temperature range (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3J</xref>). This is the first cellular evidence for the involvement of TRPM2 on the response of DRG sensory neurons to warm-temperature stimuli, given that previous studies had only assessed noxious/painful heat responses (<italic>T ≥</italic> 45 °C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>)).</p>

<title>WSNs vary in their response characteristics</title>
<p>Consistent with the behavioural data (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), the absence of TRPV1 or TRPM2 led to deficits in the response to warm temperatures in primary sensory neurons. However, how these cellular deficits contribute to the difference in behavioural phenotypes was still unclear.

<title>TRPV1 drives the dynamic phase of a warm-temperature response</title>
<p>Each temperature stimulus has two distinct phases: an initial, dynamic phase, in which the temperature rises rapidly. And a second, static phase, in which the temperature stabilizes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). The majority of WSNs from wildtype animals respond during the rising, dynamic phase of the stimulus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). In comparison, WSNs from animals lacking TRPV1 predominantly responded during the static phase of the stimulus, while <italic>Trpm2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> cells did not significantly differ in their response onset from wildtype cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">E</xref> and <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A-C</xref>). Additionally, TRPV1-positive cells in wildtype cultures – identified by their response to the TRPV1 activator capsaicin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) – predominantly responded during the dynamic phase of the stimulus, compared to TRPV1-negative cells (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4D-F</xref>).

<p>Given the strong modulation of the intracellular calcium dynamics observed in <italic>Trpv1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> DRGs exposed to warm stimuli, we speculate that over-expression of <italic>Trpv1</italic> would alter the response dynamics of WSNs, particularly during the rising phase of the stimulus.

<title>An evidence-accumulation model uncovers differences in evidence accumulation across genotypes</title>
<p>In the previous sections, we have detailed the distinct effects that TRPV1 and TRPM2 exert on the temperature responses of sensory neurons.

To bridge this gap, we conceptualized the temperature preference assay as a continuous decision-making process (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), allowing the use of established evidence accumulation frameworks.

<p>In our experimental setup, an animal enters a chamber and begins to accumulate evidence (i.e., it continuously collects and computes spatial temperature information) that drives its decision to stay or leave the chamber (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The resulting time spent in each chamber varies from visit to visit (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), highlighting the need to account for a dynamic decision-making process. Crucially, temperature perception is not static; this is particularly evident at the beginning of each visit, when the temperature difference is most pronounced, and changes over time until a threshold is reached that causes the animal to leave (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1H</xref>). Traditional approaches to analysing these behaviours have largely overlooked these nuances, focusing instead on final outcomes or mean stay time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>), without considering the fluctuating nature of sensory perception and the variability of decision-making across visits and between individual animals.</p>
<sec id="s2d1">
<title>A drift diffusion model recapitulates the animals’ behaviour in the CPT</title>
<p>To model this decision-making process, we opted for a drift diffusion model (DDM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>)). This model provides a quantitative framework to delve into how animals integrate sensory information over time, leading to their decision to stay or leave a chamber (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>).</p>
<p>When an animal enters a chamber, it starts at a certain point (<italic>z</italic>) from which the evidence accumulation begins (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Over time, and while the temperature information is integrated, the evidence is accumulated at a certain rate (drift rate, <italic>v</italic>) and noise level (<italic>sv</italic>), which represents the variability in evidence accumulation. This process evolves until the decision bound (<italic>a</italic>) is reached, which prompts the animal to leave the chamber. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">D</xref> show simulations of the DDM, which allow an intuition into how varying levels of drift and noise (while keeping the starting point and decision bound fixed) alters the distribution of visit lengths throughout an experiment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5E</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). Higher rates of drift (with fixed noise levels) led to overall shorter visit lengths (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). High noise levels (with fixed drift rates) also led to shorter visit lengths, albeit with larger variability (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>).</p>
<p>We fit a model with varying drift rate and noise onto the visit length distributions of wildtype animals recorded for each temperature combination in the CPT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref> and <xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>). The model suggests higher drift rates at temperatures below and above 31 °C in wildtype animals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>). Notably, the drift rates in the corresponding neutral chambers (31 °C) are lower than in the test chambers. Both observations are in line with the development of preference for the 31 °C chamber in the varying temperature conditions. The model also suggests an increase in noise in the test temperatures, hinting that the evidence accumulation at 31 °C is particularly stable (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2d2">
<title>Varying effects of TRPM2 and TRPV1 on evidence accumulation</title>
<p>We fit the model onto all behavioural data collected in this study (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref> and <xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>). For animals lacking TRPM2, the model yields a lower drift rate at 34 °C and 38 °C compared to wildtypes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>). This suggests that loss of TRPM2 leads to a slower evidence accumulation at warm temperatures, reflecting an overall failure to develop a preference for 31 °C throughout the experiment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). In <italic>Trpv1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> animals, on the other hand, we observed higher drift rates as well as higher noise levels in the warmer (34 °C and 38 °C) chambers. These findings suggest that <italic>Trpv1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> animals accumulate environmental temperature evidence faster than wildtype animals, but the fidelity of the thermal inputs is compromised. We speculate that the balance of these two variables might lead to a similar overall preference development compared to wildtype animals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Interestingly, the over-expression of TRPV1 also leads to an increased drift rate at warm temperatures, albeit with a similar noise level to wildtypes. This combination leads to greater avoidance of 34 °C and 38 °C (as observed in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
<p>Notably, all genotypes show similar drift and noise estimates at 25 °C, consistent with their behavioural preference (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>, suggesting that TRPV1 and TRPM2 mainly control responses to warm temperatures (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>). In summary, we find that the DDM successfully parametrizes the behavioural data obtained from the CPT. Furthermore, the model allowed a more in-depth insight into how the loss of either TRPV1 or TRPM2 differentially alters the detection of warm temperatures, highlighting their importance in behavioural adaptation to innocuous temperatures.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Environmental temperatures are detected by sensory nerve fibres innervating the skin. The mechanisms behind warmtemperature detection have recently gained increased attention, with two ion channels, TRPV1 and TRPM2, as the main candidates. In this study, we developed a novel temperature preference assay, integrating ambient and floor temperatures, to investigate the roles of TRPV1 and TRPM2 in temperature detection. Our results reveal distinct behavioural responses to warm temperatures mediated by these channels. Applying a modelling framework to the animal’s behaviour, we observed unique deficits in TRPV1 and TRPM2 knockout animals, compared to wildtype mice. On the cellular level, the loss of either TRPV1 or TRPM2 resulted in a decreased proportion of WSNs, with TRPV1 playing a pivotal role in detecting rapid, dynamic temperature changes.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Behavioural analysis in temperature preference assays</title>
<p>The introduced chamber preference assay, integrating both ambient and floor temperatures, improves on the conventional temperature preference assays. Notably, at 34 °C, a temperature that is close to the thermoneutral 31 °C, animals demonstrated a clear avoidance of the 34 °C in the CPT, but failed to do so in the conventional TPP assay (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>). This preference underscores the importance of integrating multiple sensory inputs — ambient “air” and contact temperatures — in forming a coherent thermal perception, a complexity often overlooked in simpler thermal assays.</p>
<p>Consistent with previous findings, our results reveal that the absence of TRPM2 impedes the development of a preference for warmer temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). In contrast, animals lacking TRPV1 exhibited behavioural patterns similar to their wildtype counterparts, spending comparable amounts of total time in the warm chamber (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E-F</xref>).</p>
<p>Intriguingly, a finer characterization of the dynamics of the animal behaviour in the assay revealed differences between <italic>Trpv1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> and <italic>Trpm2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> animals, particularly in the frequency of crossings between chambers and the time spent in each chamber (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G-H</xref>). These behavioural nuances were further elucidated by modelling the behaviour with a drift-diffusion model (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). This model, a novel approach for such behavioural assays in general and for temperature as a sensory modality in particular, uncovered an impaired process of evidence accumulation within the warm chambers in <italic>Trpm2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> animals. Moreover, we could explain the more frequent chamber crossings of <italic>Trpv1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> animals by the fact that they accumulated evidence more erratically (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>).</p>

<title>Cellular insights into warm-temperature sensation</title>
<p>Cultures from <italic>Trpv1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> animals exhibited a substantial decrease in the proportion of WSNs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). This is similar to previous studies from trigeminal neurons, where the loss of TRPV1 led to a complete loss of warm-temperature responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). While the role of TRPV1 was more salient in the warm-temperature range, <italic>Trpm2</italic> knockouts displayed a reduction in temperature responsiveness across a broader spectrum, extending into hotter temperatures (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref>). This is in line with previous studies highlighting a loss in warmand heat-responsive cells in <italic>Trpm2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, in initial experiments using DRG neurons from <italic>Trpm2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> and <italic>Trpv1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> animals cultured overnight, we were only able to show the necessity of TRPM2 for heat responses but failed to reproduce the previously reported reduction in WSNs in <italic>Trpm2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> and <italic>Trpv1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> sensory neurons (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3F</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>)). The inability to reproduce the aforementioned cellular phenotypes in cultured sensory neurons might be due to two factors: the abundance of WSNs and the variability in their proportions between experiments and animals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref>). These require a larger sampling of sensory neurons from multiple animals for a reliable estimation of effects, something that is often lacking in previous studies of cellular warm-temperature-detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Furthermore, overnight cultures, which are the <italic>de facto</italic> standard in the field, might be more akin to an injury model (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref>). The three-day cultures presented in this study allow the cells the time to partially regenerate from the harsh dissociation procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>), and pose an alternative that more closely resembles the physiological condition.</p>

<title>TRPV1: bridging cellular data with behavioural patterns</title>
<p>The cellular data predict that animals lacking TRPV1 would have large deficits in their ability to detect warm temperatures. Yet, overall, <italic>Trpv1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> animals stay in the thermoneutral chamber for a similar proportion of time as wildtype controls. Analysis of the remaining WSNs in <italic>Trpv1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> animals revealed a critical insight: these neurons predominantly respond during the static phase of the temperature stimuli.</p>
<p>In the CPT, animals frequently transition between chambers, experiencing rapid temperature changes upon crossing, but then spend most of their time in an isothermal environment (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1H</xref>). This suggests that <italic>Trpv1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> animals primarily rely on static temperature information for thermal detection, rather than rapidly fluctuating temperatures. This is reflected in the higher number of crossings between the different thermal chambers, coupled with shorter visits to the hotter chambers. This set of results led us to hypothesize that rapidly changing thermal information perceived during the transitions of the animals is not properly detected by <italic>Trpv1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> animals. This hypothesis is further supported by the behavioural model (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). It indicates that, <italic>Trpv1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> animals exhibit a higher drift rate in warmer test chambers, suggesting an avoidance of these temperatures. However, the increased noise in the driftdiffusion model points to a less reliable temperature detection mechanism. This implies that, despite the substantial loss of WSNs, the remaining neuronal population provides sufficient information for the detection of warmer temperatures, albeit with reduced precision.</p>
<p>The reduced precision might stem from the loss of dynamic temperature responders (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). These WSNs might be crucial in detecting a rapid change of temperature (e.g. when the animals move across different thermal environments). This is highlighted by findings from TRPV1-overexpressing animals. These animals, equipped with an enhanced ability to respond to dynamic temperature changes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), have a higher drift rate and lower noise levels in warmer chambers in the model (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). These characteristics lead to a faster and more precise choice in the CPT. Combined, these results highlight the direct role of TRPV1, and its expression levels, in the precise temporal detection of warm temperatures.</p>

<title>TRPM2: cellular mechanisms and behavioural implications</title>
<p>A reversed scenario unfolds for TRPM2. The behavioural data suggests a strong deficit of sensory neurons to report warm temperatures. <italic>Trpm2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> WSNs, while less abundant compared to WSNs from wildtype DRG cultures, do not exhibit marked differences in response dynamics. It is tempting to hypothesize, given the results from <italic>Trpv1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>-cultures, that TRPM2 affects the static phase of temperature detection. We conducted various analyses on the static responses of <italic>Trpm2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> WSNs (data not shown), but failed to uncover significant differences to wildtype WSNs. This persistent discrepancy raises several hypotheses:</p>
<p>One explanation involves the specific population of WSNs reliant on TRPM2. Single-cell sequencing and functional analyses of dorsal root ganglia suggest that WSNs form two, genetically distinct populations, one of which prominently expresses <italic>Trpm2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). Different genetic/functional populations of sensory neurons often show diverging spinal innervation, with different upstream processing pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). The genetic separation could hint at multiple neural innervation routes for innocuous temperature information. In this context, the loss of TRPM2 might specifically impair warm-temperature perception in thermoregulation-specific innervation pathways, without significantly affecting perceptual temperature discrimination performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>).</p>
<p>The second explanation implies that the role of TRPM2 in temperature detection might extend beyond its expression in sensory neurons. Particularly, it is possible that TRPM2 mediates part of its effect via the hypothalamic preoptic area (POA), a temperature sensitive brain region involved in body temperature regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Preoptic TRPM2 has been shown to mediate autonomic thermoregulatory responses upon warmtemperature stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). Preoptic temperature pathways may not only drive autonomic thermoregulatory responses, but can also influence temperature preference behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Considering that, within the time frame of the chamber preference test, ambient temperature changes are directly transferred to the POA, it is possible – but not yet tested – that preoptic TRPM2 is involved in the choice of comfort-temperature.</p>

<p>M.A. and J.S. conceptualized the study. M.A. and G.K. designed, tested, and collected data with the CPT. M.A. analysed all the data from the CPT and modelling for the DDM. M.A. performed calcium imaging experiments, processed, and performed analysis for all cellular data. A.T. was involved in the analysis of the response characteristics of WSNs, as well as with model choices of the DDM. M.A. prepared the figures, with input from A.T. and J.S.. J.S. and G.K. acquired funding for the project. M.A. and J.S. wrote and edited the manuscript with input from G.K. and A.T..</p>

<title>Animals and housing</title>
<p>All animal care and experimental procedures were approved by the local council (Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe, Germany) under protocol numbers G-201/16 and T05-19. Animals were kept under specific-pathogen-free (SPF) conditions and a 12-hour day-night cycle. Housing temperature and humidity were maintained at 22 ± 2 °C and 50 % to 60 %, respectively. Animals were fed ad-libitum with Altromin Rod 16 or Rod 18 animal food. The housing environment was enriched using Crincklets Nest-Pads and ABBEDD LT-E-001 bedding. For this study, only male animals were used, as we aimed to compare our results with previous studies which exclusively used male animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). Mice between 6 and 25 weeks of age were used for the experiments.</p>

<title>Thermal preference chamber design, operation, and video capture</title>
<p>The thermal preference chamber consisted of two expanded polystyrene boxes connected using plastic glue and sealed with silicone (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>) with dimensions of 26.1 cm x 60.3 cm x 19.8 cm (w x l x h). The 4.3 cm-thick Styrofoam walls provided the necessary thermal insulation for the experiments. Inside the enclosure, the animals’ movement was limited by a 13 cm x 31.4 cm x 15.5 cm steel cage placed on top of a stainlesssteel baseplate. To create two thermally isolated chambers, the enclosure, cage, and baseplate were adjusted to form a 4.3 cm x 6.3 cm x 6.3 cm tunnel. The baseplate and cage were custom-built by our institute’s mechanical workshop. The cover combined foam and wood as insulators, with an acrylic glass inset for observation purposes.</p>
<p>Temperature within the chamber was regulated by two Peltier elements attached to heat sinks, each connected to a generic computer fan for efficient temperature distribution. To avoid overheating, the Peltier elements were connected to a Multitemp III circulating water pump (Amersham Biosciences) set to 28 °C. These elements were managed by a modified Siemens LOGO TD! controller, programmed for precise temperature adjustments, and accessed using the LOGO! Soft Comfort (Siemens) software. For monitoring, two Physitemp IT-18 flexible thermocouples were attached to the chamber walls, serving as reference thermometers. Data capture was conducted using a customer-grade webcam (Spedal), linked to the UCLA miniscope project’s capture software, operating at 20 Hz to 30 Hz. The output files from each recording session were concatenated using <italic>ffmpeg</italic> software for subsequent processing. For control experiments using the two-plate temperature preference test (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>, we used the BIO-T2CT system by BioSeb with the same camera setup as described above.</p>
<sec id="s10b1">
<title>Thermal preference tests, processing, and analysis</title>
<p>Animals were transported to and acclimatized in the experimental room for at least 24 h before the experiments. The room maintained a dim light setting and a 12-hour day-night cycle. To ensure temperature stability, the setup was allowed to stabilize for 90 min before starting an experiment (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B-D</xref>). Once the setup reached a stable temperature, the lid was briefly opened (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>), and an animal was placed into the enclosure, the lid closed again, and allowed to roam freely for at least 30 min, before replacing it with the next animal.</p>
<p>Due to the dim light conditions and the reflections on the cover of the enclosure (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> for an example), conventional animal tracking approaches that rely on image contrast failed to provide robust outputs (data not shown). Therefore, we employed a neural-network based approach, namely <italic>DeepLabCut</italic>, for tracking the animals in the setup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). For this purpose, we trained a ResNet50 network to track specific points on the animal: the snout, right ear, left ear, body centre, tail base, and tail tip (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Additionally, we tracked eight reference points (four cage corners and four cage tops) in the cage for normalization purposes. The same model was also trained on reference frames acquired using the BIO-T2CT system. The resulting model generalized well to both setups, ensuring comparability of the outputs.</p>
<p>The DeepLabCut predictions were then further curated by replacing bad predictions (&lt; 95% likelihood) with missing values, and removing recording sessions where &gt; 25% were missing (usually due to the animal escaping the inner cage). Furthermore, we removed sessions in which the animals showed excessive climbing behaviour (&gt; 95% of time between upper and lower cage corners). For the remaining sessions, the missing values were linearly interpolated and the centroid of the ears, body centre, and tail-base was used as the position of the animals. The X- and Y-positions of the centroid were then scaled to the tracked cage corner points to correct for minor movements of the camera or the setup. The resulting X- and Y-position time courses were then downsampled to 1 Hz. Only the first 30 min of the recording were kept. Shorter sessions were removed.</p>

<title>Primary sensory neuron culture</title>
<p>Adult primary DRG cultures were prepared from 6-15 week old animals as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Briefly, the animals were culled via isoflurane overdose, and their spinal columns excised and separated from muscle tissue. The spinal column was then cut lengthwise and the DRGs collected, freed from nerve branches, halved, and treated with a collagenase solution (1.25 mg/mL in Ringer’s solution) for 1 h at 37 °C with gentle inversion every 15 min. This was followed by a 15 min trypsin digestion (2.5 mg/mL) at 37 °C, repeated trituration and suspension in complete culturing medium (DMEM/F12 w/o Glutamin,10% heat-inactivated FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine (Glutamax), 1x Anti-biotic/mitotic), and centrifugation at 900 rpm for 10 min over a BSA solution (150 mg/mL) to pellet the cells. The supernatant was discarded, the pellet was resuspended in culturing media, and spotted onto PDL- and Laminin-coated glass coverslips (5 mm). The cells were then left to settle onto the coverslip in the incubator for 1 h at 37 °C, and then covered with culturing media. Cultures were either used the following day (overnight) or kept for three days, with a medium change after the first day.</p>

<title>Calcium imaging recordings</title>
<p>For calcium imaging, cells cultured on coverslips were incubated for either one or three days. Before imaging, cells underwent a washing process with Ringer’s solution (140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM glucose, and 10 mM HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4.), followed by loading with the calcium-sensitive dye Cal520-AM (10 µM) and Pluronic acid F-127 (0.05 %) in Ringer’s solution. The cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, then the dye solution was replaced with Ringer’s solution for a further 30 min at room temperature, minimizing light exposure.</p>
<p>The perfusion system, a ValveBank II (Automate) to control multiple inflows, and an air200 aquarium pump (Eheim) for outflow, was set to a maximum flow rate of 3 mL/min, facilitating laminar flow in the imaging chamber (RC-22, Warner Instruments). The coverslip was placed near the outlet to minimize movement artefacts. An IT-18 thermocouple (physitemp) was placed close to the coverslip to record the chamber temperature. Imaging settings varied based on the camera used: for CoolSnapHQ2 (Photometrics), exposure was set at 5 ms with 3x gain and 3×3 binning, whereas for Zyla 4.2 (Andor Technology), it was 80 ms with 2×2 binning. We used a Lambda DG-4 as a light source, maintained at 30 % intensity to reduce bleaching.</p>
<p>Images were captured using <italic>MetaFluor</italic> software at 4 Hz or 10 Hz frequencies. Standard experiments involved a 1 min baseline, 25 s stimuli, followed by a 3 min to 5 min recovery period with room-temperature Ringer’s solution (Figures <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref>). To identify TRPV1-positive neurons, we used the agonist Capsaicin (1 µM, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>)). A Ringer’s solution with a high potassium concentration (100 mM KCl) was used as a final stimulus to identify neurons. Solutions were heated via glass coils connected to a heated water bath. Each FOV was imaged for a maximum of 60 min, and the usage of coverslips was limited to 2 h post-loading with the dye.</p>

<title>Calcium imaging preprocessing and analysis</title>
<p>Calcium imaging data were motion-corrected and pre-processed using <italic>Suite2p</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Cell regions of interest (ROIs) were identified using the <italic>Cellpose</italic> package integrated into <italic>Suite2p</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). The mean fluorescence of cells and surrounding neuropil was calculated by <italic>Suite2p</italic>, and neuropil contamination was corrected by subtracting 70 % of the background neuropil traces from each cell’s fluorescence trace. The corrected data was then imported into a custom R-package, <italic>neuroimgr</italic>, for further analysis in R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/hummuscience/neuroimgr">https://github.com/hummuscience/neuroimgr</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Normalization was performed using the Δ<italic>F/F</italic><sub>0</sub> method, where baseline fluorescence (<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>) is calculated as the mean fluorescence of the baseline, and Δ<italic>F</italic> is the change in fluorescence over time. For heatmaps, <italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> was estimated using the first 10 s of the experiments. For individual stimuli, the mean of the first 10 frames was used as <italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>. Heatmaps were generated using the <italic>ComplexHeatmap</italic> R package. Cells were sorted by the earliest time point where they cross 10 % of their cumulative Δ<italic>F/F</italic><sub>0</sub> in a given FOV and clustered using the Ward D2 algorithm. Δ<italic>F/F</italic><sub>0</sub> values smaller than the 0.1 and larger than the 99.9 percentile were clipped.</p>
<p>Due to the temperature-sensitivity and loading variability of the calcium dye, a threshold-based approach failed to reliably identify responding cells across experimental days and FOVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). Therefore, we used time series classification to identify temperature-responsive cells. For this, calcium traces for each cell and stimulus were normalized, downsampled to 4 Hz, and a sample of 1000 traces across stimuli was manually labelled to create a training dataset. This ground-truth dataset was used to evaluate multiple time series classification algorithms, with MINIROCKET (as implemented in the <italic>sktime</italic> Python package, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>)) yielding the best results (data not shown). The trained classifier was then applied to the remaining cells to identify temperature-responsive cells. A similar approach was used to identify capsaicin-responsive cells. Cells that did not respond to any of the applied stimuli were excluded from the analysis.</p>

<title>Drift-diffusion model</title>
<p>We employed a Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM) to analyse the behaviour of mice in thermal chamber experiments. The DDM was preferred over simpler models like the Markov switching model, as the latter did not provide satisfactory fits to our data (data not shown). Each parameter in the model can either be fit as a predictor (dependent on genotype, temperature combination, and temperature), fit to the entire data (floating), or fixed to a certain value. A typical drift diffusion model as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>) can drift to the upper or lower bound (representing two choices), but our experimental design only offers one choice (to leave the chamber). To reduce the probability of reaching the lower bound, and thereby improve the fit, we fixed the starting point/bias (<italic>z</italic>) to 0.9. This ensures that the evidence accumulation starts at a point that is much closer to the upper bound (<italic>a</italic>) than to the lower bound (<italic>−a</italic>). To choose the best combination of parameters that fits the data, we fit all the data to all remaining combinations of <italic>v, sv</italic>, and <italic>a</italic> (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5A</xref> and <xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">B</xref>) and compared them via the expected log pointwise predictive density (ELPD) by Pareto smoothed importance sampling leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). Unreliable models as per (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>) were discarded. The chosen model was constructed to account for variations in both noise (<italic>sv</italic>) and drift rate (<italic>v</italic>) for each genotype, temperature comparison, and chamber/temperature (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5A</xref> and <xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Equation 1</xref>). To accommodate individual differences among animals, we introduced a random effect for each animal in the model. This approach enabled us to capture the unique behavioural patterns of each subject while assessing the general trends across the population.

To fit the model, we applied a hierarchical Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling approach as implemented in the <italic>HSSM</italic> python package. For the implementation of the hierarchical MCMC, we utilized the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) as implemented in <italic>NumPyro</italic>, a robust algorithm for efficiently sampling from high-dimensional probability distributions. The tuning phase for all fit models involved 2000 samples, ensuring adequate exploration of the parameter space and helping to achieve convergence. The final model was run with four chains, each drawing 2000 samples.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors use an innovative behavior assay (chamber preference test) and standard calcium imaging experiments on cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons to evaluate the consequences of global knockout of TRPV1 and TRPM2, and overexpression of TRPV1, on warmth detection. They find a profound effect of TRPM2 elimination in the behavioral assay, whereas elimination of TRPV1 has the largest effect on neuronal responses. These findings are of importance, as there is still substantial discussion in the field regarding the contribution of TRP channels to different aspects of thermosensation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The chamber preference test is an important innovation compared to the standard two-plate test, as it depends on thermal information sampled from the entire skin, as opposed to only the plantar side of the paws. With this assay, and the detailed analysis, the authors provide strong supporting evidence for the role of TRPM2 in warmth avoidance. The conceptual framework using the Drift Diffusion Model provides a first glimpse of how this decision of a mouse to change between temperatures can be interpreted and may form the basis for further analysis of thermosensory behavior.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors juxtapose these behavioral data with calcium imaging data using isolated DRG neurons. Here, there are a few aspects that are less convincing.</p>
<p>(1) The authors study warmth responses using DRG neurons after three days of culturing. They propose that these &quot;more accurately reflect the functional properties and abundance of warm-responsive sensory neurons that are found in behaving animals.&quot; However, the only argument to support this notion is that the fraction of neurons responding to warmth is lower after three days of culture. This could have many reasons, including loss of specific subpopulations of neurons, or any other (artificial?) alterations to the neurons' transcriptome due to the culturing. The isolated DRGs are not selected in any way, so also include neurons innervating viscera not involved in thermosensation. If the authors wish to address actual changes in sensory nerves involved in warmth sensing in TRPM2 or TRPV1 KO mice without disturbing the response profile as a result of the isolation procedure, other approaches would be needed (e.g. skin-nerve recordings or in vivo DRG imaging).</p>
<p>(2) The authors state that there is a reduction in warmth-sensitive DRG neurons in the TRPM2 knockout mice based on the data presented in Figure 2D. This is not convincing for the following reasons. First, the authors used t-tests (with FDR correction - yielding borderline significance) whereas three groups are compared here in three repetitive stimuli. This would require different statistics (e.g. ANOVA), and I am not convinced (based on a rapid assessment of the data) that such an analysis would yield any significant difference between WT and TRPM2 KO. Second, there seems to be a discrepancy between the plot and legend regarding the number of LOV analysed (21, 17, and 18 FOV according to the legend, compared to 18, 10, and 12 dots in the plot). Therefore, I would urge the authors to critically assess this part of the study and to reconsider whether the statement (and discussion) that &quot;Trpm2 deletion reduces the proportion of warmth responders&quot; should be maintained or abandoned.</p>
<p>(3) It remains unclear whether the clear behavioral effect seen in the TRPM2 knockout animals is at all related to TRPM2 functioning as a warmth sensor in sensory neurons. As discussed above, the effects of the TRPM2 KO on the proportion of warmth-sensing neurons are at most very subtle, and the authors did not use any pharmacological tool (in contrast to the use of capsaicin to probe for TRPV1 in Figures S3 and S4) to support a direct involvement of TRPM2 in the neuronal warmth responses. Behavioral experiments on sensory-neuron-specific TRPM2 knockout animals will be required to clarify this important point.</p>
<p>(4) The authors only use male mice, which is a significant limitation, especially considering known differences in warmth sensing between male and female animals and humans. The authors state &quot;For this study, only male animals were used, as we aimed to compare our results with previous studies which exclusively used male animals (7, 8, 17, 43).&quot; This statement is not correct: all four mentioned papers include behavioral data from both male and female mice! I recommend the authors to either include data from female mice or to clearly state that their study (in comparison with these other studies) only uses male mice.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors of the study use a technically well-thought-out approach to dissect the question of how far TRPV1 and TRPM2 are involved in the perception of warm temperatures in mice. They supplement the experimental data with a drift-diffusion model. They find that TRPM2 is required to trigger the preference for 31{degree sign}C over warmer temperatures while TRPV1 increases the fidelity of afferent temperature information. A lack of either channel leads to a depletion of warm-sensing neurons and in the case of TRPV1 to a deficit in rapid responses to temperature changes. The study demonstrates that mouse phenotyping can only produce trustworthy results if the tools used to test them measure what we believe they are measuring.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors tackle a central question in physiology to which we have not yet found sufficient answers. They take a pragmatic approach by putting existing experimental methods to the test and refining them significantly.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>It is difficult to find weaknesses. Not only the experimental methods but also the data analysis have been refined meticulously. There is no doubt that the authors achieved their aims and that the results support their conclusions.</p>
<p>There will certainly be some lasting impact on the future use of DRG cultures with respect to (I) the incubation periods, (II) how these data need to be analyzed, and (III) the numbers of neurons to be looked at.</p>
<p>As for the CPT assay, the future will have to show if mouse phenotyping results are more accurate with this technique. I'm more fond of full thermal gradient environments. However, behavioural phenotyping is still one of the most difficult fields in somatosensory research.</p>

<p>Summary and strengths:</p>
<p>In the manuscript, Abd El Hay et al investigate the role of thermally sensitive ion channels TRPM2 and TRPV1 in warm preference and their dynamic response features to thermal stimulation. They develop a novel thermal preference task, where both the floor and air temperature are controlled, and conclude that mice likely integrate floor with air temperature to form a thermal preference. They go on to use knockout mice and show that TRPM2-/- mice play a role in the avoidance of warmer temperatures. Using a new approach for culturing DRG neurons they show the involvement of both channels in warm responsiveness and dynamics. This is an interesting study with novel methods that generate important new information on the different roles of TRPV1 and TRPM2 on thermal behavior.</p>
<p>Open questions and weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Differences in the response features of cells expressing TRPM2 and TRPV1 are central and interesting findings but need further validation (Figures 3 and 4). To show differences in the dynamics and the amplitude of responses across different lines and stimulus amplitudes more clearly, the authors should show the grand average population calcium response from all responsive neurons with error bars for all 3 groups for the different amplitudes of stimuli (as has been presented for the thermal stimuli traces). The authors should also provide a population analysis of the amplitude of the responses in all groups to all stimulus amplitudes. Prior work suggests that thermal detection is supported by an enhancement or suppression of the ongoing activity of sensory fibers innervating the skin. The authors should present any data on cells with ongoing activity.</p>
<p>(2) The authors should better place their findings in context with the literature and highlight the novelty of their findings. The introduction builds a story of a 'disconnect' or 'contradictory' findings about the role of TRPV1 and TRPM2 in warm detection. While there are some disparate findings in the literature, Tan and McNaughton (2016) show a role for TRPM2 in the avoidance of warmth in a similar task, Paricio et al. (2020) show a significant reduction in warm perception in TRPM2 and TRPV1 knock out lines and Yarmolinksy et al. (2016) show a reduction in warm perception with TRPV1 inactivation. All these papers are therefore in agreement with the authors finding of a role for these channels in warm behavior. The authors should change their introduction and discussion to more correctly discuss the findings of these studies and to better pinpoint the novelty of their own work.</p>
<p>(3) The responses of 60 randomly selected cells are shown in Figure 2B. But, looking at the TRPM2-/- data, warm responses appear more obvious than in WTs and the weaker responders of the WT group appear weaker than the equivalent group in the TRPV1-/- and TRPM2-/- data. This does not necessarily invalidate the results, but it may suggest a problem in the data selection. Because the correct classification of warm-sensitive neurons is central to this part of the study more validation of the classifier should be presented. For example, the authors could state if they trained the classifier using equal amounts of cells, show some randomly selected cells that are warm-insensitive for all genotypes, and show the population average responses of warm-insensitive neurons.</p>
<p>(4) The interpretation of the main behavioral results and justification of the last figure is presented as the result of changes in sensing but differences in this behavior could be due to many factors and this needs clarification and discussion. (i) The authors mention that 'crucially temperature perception is not static' and suggest that there are fluctuating changes in perception over time and conclude that their modelling approach helps show changes in temperature detection. They imply that temperature perceptual threshold changes over time, but the mouse could just as easily have had exactly the same threshold throughout the task but their motivation (or some other cognitive variable) might vary causing them to change chamber. The authors should correct this. (ii) Likewise, from their fascinating and high-profile prior work the authors suggest a model of internal temperature sensing whereby TRPM2 expression in the hypothalamus acts as an internal sensory of body temperature. Given this, and the slow time course of the behavior in chambers with different ambient temperatures, couldn't the reason for the behavioral differences be due to central changes in hypothalamic processing rather than detection by skin temperature? If TRPM2-/- were selectively ablated from the skin or the hypothalamus (these experiments are not necessary for this paper) it might be possible to conclude whether sensation or body temperature is more likely the root cause of these effects but, without further experiments it is tough to conclude either way. (iii) Because the ambient temperature is controlled in this behavior, another hypothesis is that warm avoidance could be due to negative valence associated with breathing warm air, i.e. a result of sensation within the body in internal pathways, rather than sensing from the external skin. Overall, the authors should tone down conclusions about sensation and present a more detailed discussion of these points.</p>
<p>(5) It is an excellent idea to present a more in-depth analysis of the behavioral data collected during the preference task, beyond 'the mouse is on one side or the other'. However, the drift-diffusion approach is complex to interpret from the text in the results and the figures. The results text is not completely clear on which behavioral parameters are analyzed and terms like drift, noise, estimate, and evidence are not clearly defined. Currently, this section of the paper slightly confuses and takes the paper away from the central findings about dynamics and behavioral differences. It seems like they could come to similar conclusions with simpler analysis and simpler figures.</p>
<p>(6) In Figure 2D the % of warm-sensitive neurons are shown for each genotype. Each data point is a field of view, however, reading the figure legend there appear to be more FOVs than data points (eg 10 data points for the TRPV1-/- but 17 FOVs). The authors should check this.</p>
<p>(7) Can the authors comment on why animals with over-expression of TRPV1 spend more time in the warmest chamber to start with at 38C and not at 34C?</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors use an innovative behavior assay (chamber preference test) and standard calcium imaging experiments on cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons to evaluate the consequences of global knockout of TRPV1 and TRPM2, and overexpression of TRPV1, on warmth detection. They find a profound effect of TRPM2 elimination in the behavioral assay, whereas elimination of TRPV1 has the largest effect on neuronal responses. These findings are of importance, as there is still substantial discussion in the field regarding the contribution of TRP channels to different aspects of thermosensation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The chamber preference test is an important innovation compared to the standard two-plate test, as it depends on thermal information sampled from the entire skin, as opposed to only the plantar side of the paws. With this assay, and the detailed analysis, the authors provide strong supporting evidence for the role of TRPM2 in warmth avoidance. The conceptual framework using the Drift Diffusion Model provides a first glimpse of how this decision of a mouse to change between temperatures can be interpreted and may form the basis for further analysis of thermosensory behavior.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors juxtapose these behavioral data with calcium imaging data using isolated DRG neurons. Here, there are a few aspects that are less convincing.</p>
<p>(1) The authors study warmth responses using DRG neurons after three days of culturing. They propose that these &quot;more accurately reflect the functional properties and abundance of warm-responsive sensory neurons that are found in behaving animals.&quot; However, the only argument to support this notion is that the fraction of neurons responding to warmth is lower after three days of culture. This could have many reasons, including loss of specific subpopulations of neurons, or any other (artificial?) alterations to the neurons' transcriptome due to the culturing. The isolated DRGs are not selected in any way, so also include neurons innervating viscera not involved in thermosensation. If the authors wish to address actual changes in sensory nerves involved in warmth sensing in TRPM2 or TRPV1 KO mice without disturbing the response profile as a result of the isolation procedure, other approaches would be needed (e.g. skin-nerve recordings or in vivo DRG imaging).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that there could be several reasons as to why the responses of cultured DRGs are reduced compared to the acute/short-term cultures. It is possible ––and likely–– that</p>
<p>transcriptional changes happen over the course of the culturing period. It is also possible that it is a mere coincidence that the 3-day cultures have a response profile more similar to the in vivo situation than the acute cultures. In the revised manuscript, we will therefore tone down the claim that the 3-day cultures mirror the native conditions more appropriately.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, our results clearly show that acute cultures have a response profile that is much more similar to damaged/”inflamed” neurons, irrespective of any comparison to the 3 daycultures. Therefore, we believe, it is helpful to include this data to make scientists aware that acute cultures are very different to non-inflamed native/in vivo DRG neurons that many researchers use in their experiments.</p>
<p>In some experiments not shown in the first version of our manuscript, we applied the TRPchannel agonists Menthol, Capsaicin and AITC (mustard oil) consecutively in a few 3-day</p>
<p>cultures. We also have Capsaicin responses from overnight cultures. We will attempt to correlate the percentage of the neurons responsive to these TRPV1, TRPM8 and TRPA1</p>
<p>ion channel agonists in our cultures to the percentages of neurons found to express the respective TRP ion channels (TRPM8, TRPV1 and TRPA1) in vivo. While this type of</p>
<p>analysis won’t prove that 3-day cultures are similar to the in vivo situation (even if there is good correlation between the in vitro and in vivo results), it might support the usage of 3-day cultures as a model.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors state that there is a reduction in warmth-sensitive DRG neurons in the TRPM2 knockout mice based on the data presented in Figure 2D. This is not convincing for the following reasons. First, the authors used t-tests (with FDR correction - yielding borderline significance) whereas three groups are compared here in three repetitive stimuli. This would require different statistics (e.g. ANOVA), and I am not convinced (based on a rapid assessment of the data) that such an analysis would yield any significant difference between WT and TRPM2 KO. Second, there seems to be a discrepancy between the plot and legend regarding the number of LOV analysed (21, 17, and 18 FOV according to the legend, compared to 18, 10, and 12 dots in the plot). Therefore, I would urge the authors to critically assess this part of the study and to reconsider whether the statement (and discussion) that &quot;Trpm2 deletion reduces the proportion of warmth responders&quot; should be maintained or abandoned.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, we agree that the statistical tests indicated by the referee are more appropriate/robust for the data shown in Figures 1F, 2D, and 4G.</p>
<p>When we perform 2-way repeated measures ANOVA and subsequent multiple comparison test (with Dunnets correction) against Wildtype, for data shown in Fig. 2D, both the main effect (Genotype) and the interaction term (Stimulus x Genotype) are significant. The multiple comparison yields very similar result as in the current manuscript, with the difference that the TRPM2-KO data for the 2nd stimulus (~36°C) is borderline significant (with a p-value of p=0.050).</p>
<p>Due to the possible dependence of the repeated temperature stimuli and the variability of each stimulus between FOVs (Fig. 2C), it is possible that a mixed-effect model that accounts for these effects is more appropriate.</p>
<p>Similarly, for plots 1F and 4G, Genotype (either as main effect or as interaction with Time) is significant after a repeated measures two-way ANOVA. The multiple comparisons (with Bonferroni correction) only changed the results marginally at individual timepoints, without affecting the overall conclusions. The exception is Fig. 4G at 38°C, where the interaction of Time and Genotype is significant, but no individual timepoint-comparison is significant after Bonferroni correction.</p>
<p>The main difference between the results presented above and the ones presented in the manuscript is the choice of the multiple comparison correction. We originally opted for the falsediscovery rate (FDR) approach as it is less prone to Type II errors (false negatives) than other methods such as Sidaks or Bonferroni, particularly when correcting for a large number of tests. However, we are mainly interested in whether the genotypes differ in their behavior in each temperature combination and the significant ANOVA tests for Fig. 1F and 4G support that point. The statistical test and comparison used in the current version of the manuscript, comparing behavior at individual/distinct timepoints, are interesting, but less relevant (and potentially distracting), as we do not go into the details about the behavior at any given/distinct timepoint in the assay.</p>
<p>Therefore, and per suggestion of the reviewer, we will update the statistics in the revised version of the manuscript. Also, we will report the correct number of FOVs in the legend.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) It remains unclear whether the clear behavioral effect seen in the TRPM2 knockout animals is at all related to TRPM2 functioning as a warmth sensor in sensory neurons. As discussed above, the effects of the TRPM2 KO on the proportion of warmth-sensing neurons are at most very subtle, and the authors did not use any pharmacological tool (in contrast to the use of capsaicin to probe for TRPV1 in Figures S3 and S4) to support a direct involvement of TRPM2 in the neuronal warmth responses. Behavioral experiments on sensory-neuron-specific TRPM2 knockout animals will be required to clarify this important point.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned above, we will tone down the correlation between the cellular and behavioral data and further stress the possibility that the Trpm2-KO phenotype is possibly related to the function of the ion channel outside of DRGs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors only use male mice, which is a significant limitation, especially considering known differences in warmth sensing between male and female animals and humans. The authors state &quot;For this study, only male animals were used, as we aimed to compare our results with previous studies which exclusively used male animals (7, 8, 17, 43).&quot; This statement is not correct: all four mentioned papers include behavioral data from both male and female mice! I recommend the authors to either include data from female mice or to clearly state that their study (in comparison with these other studies) only uses male mice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the studies by Tan et al. And Vandevauw et al. Only male animals were used for the behavioral experiments. Yarmolinsky et al. And Paricio-Montesinons et al. used both males and females while, as far as we can tell, only Paricio-Montesions et al. Reported that no difference was observed between the sexes. This is a valid point though -- when our study started 6-7 years ago, we only used male mice (as did many other researchers) and this we would now do differently. Nevertheless, we included some female mice in these experiments and will reevaluate if the numbers are sufficient so that we can generalize the phenotypes to both sexes or report differences in the revised ms.</p>
<p>Wildtypes are all C57bl/6N from the provider Janvier. Generally, all lines are backcrossed to C57bl/6 mice and additionally inbreeding was altered every 4-6 generations by crossing to C57bl/6. Exactly how many times the Trp channel KOs have been backcrossed to C57bl/6 mice we cannot exactly state.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We will include grand average population analysis of the different groups in the revised version.</p>
<p>Concerning the point about ongoing activity: We are not sure if it is possible in neuronal cultures to faithfully recapitulate ongoing activity. Ongoing activity has been mostly recorded in skinnerve preparations (or in older studies in other types of nerve recordings) and there are only very few studies that show ongoing activity in cultured experiments and then the ongoing activity only starts in sensory neuron cultures when cultured for even longer time periods than 3 days (Ref.: doi: 10.1152/jn.00158.2018). We have very few cells that show some spontaneous activity, but these are too few to draw any conclusions. In any case, nerve fibers might be necessary to drive ongoing activity which are absent from our cultures.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Paricio-Montesinos et al. argue that TRPM8 is crucial for the detection of warmth, as TRPM8-KO animals are incapable of learning the operant task. TRPM2-KO animals and, to a smaller extent TRPV1-KO animals, have reduced sensitivity in the task, but are still capable of learning/performing the task. However, in our chamber preference assay this is reversed: TRPM2-KO animals lose the ability to differentiate warm temperatures while TRPM8 appears to play no major role. A commonality between the two studies is that while TRPV1 affects the detection of warm temperatures in the different assays, this ion channel appears not to be crucial.</p>
<p>Similarly, Yarmolinsky et al. show that Trpv1-inactivation only increases the error rate in their operant assay (from ~10% to ~30%), without testing TRPM2. And Tan et al. show the</p>
<p>importance of TRPM2 in the preference task, without testing for TRPV1.</p>
<p>More generally, the choice of the assay, being either an operant task (Paricio-Montesinos et al. and Yarmolinsky et al.) or a preference assay without training of the mice (Tan et al. and our data here), might be important and different TRP receptors may be relevant for different types of temperature assays, which we will extend on in the discussion in the revised manuscript. While our results generally agree with the previous studies, they add a different perspective on the analysis of the behavior (with correlation to cellular data). We will adjust the manuscript to highlight the advances more clearly.</p>

<p>The classifier was trained on a balanced dataset of 1000 (500 responders and 500 nonresponders), manually labelled traces across all 5 temperature stimuli. The prediction accuracy was 98%. We will describe more clearly how the classifier was trained and include examples and also show the population average responses in the revised manuscript.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We are sorry that the statement including the phrase “crucially temperature perception is not static” is ambiguous; what we meant to say is that with the mouse moving across the two chambers, the animal experiences different temperatures over time (not that the perceptual threshold of the mouse changes). We will clarify this stament in the revised version of the manuscript.</p>
<p>But even so, it could be that some other variable (motivation etc) makes the mouse change the chamber; we hypothesize that this variable (whatever it might be) is still modulated by temperature (at least this would be the likeliest explanation that we see).</p>
<p>As for the aspect of internal/hypothalamic temperature sensing: we have included this possibility already in the discussion but will further emphasize this possibility in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>As for the point of negative valence mediated by breathing in warm air: yes, presumably this could also be possible. The aspect of valence is in interesting aspect by itself: would the mice be rather repelled from the (uncomfortable) hot plate or more attracted to the (more comfortable) thermoneutral plate, or both? Something to elucidate in a different study.</p>

<p>We will reassess the description of the drift diffusion model and explain it more clearly. Additionally, we will assess whether we can introduce the drift diffusion model and analysis better at the beginning of the study, subsequent to Figure 1 to have the model and this type of analysis coherent with the first behavior results (instead of introducing the model only at the very end).</p>

<p>(7) Can the authors comment on why animals with over-expression of TRPV1 spend more time in the warmest chamber to start with at 38C and not at 34C?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an interesting observation that we did not consider before. A closer look at Figure 4H reveals that the majority of the TRPV1-OX animals, have a proportionally long first visit to the 38°C room. We can only speculate why this is the case. We cannot rule out that this a technical shortcoming of the assay and how we conduced it – but we don’t observe this for the wildtype mice, thus it is rather unlikely a technical problem. It is possible that this is a type of “freezing-” (or “startle-“) behavior when the animals first encounter the 38°C temperature. Freezing behaviors in mice can be observed when sudden/threatening stimuli are applied. It is possible that, in the TRPV1-overexpressing animals, the initial encounter with 38°C leads to activation of a larger proportion of cells (compared to WT ctrls), possibly signaling a “painful” stimulus, and thus leading to this startle effect. It is noteworthy, however, that with more stringent repeated measure statistics applied as suggested by the referees, the difference at the first measured time point in Fig. 4G is not significantly different anymore (see comment #2 above. This does not rule out that this might be a true effect, but such a claim would benefit from additional experiments that test such and hypothesis more rigorously.</p>
