<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) is an eicosanoid lipid mediator that regulates a plethora of homeostatic functions including vascular permeability, immune response, and mucosal integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Narumiya, 2007</xref>). The metabolic pathway of PGE<sub>2</sub> production, which is a major branch of the arachidonic acid cascade, was extensively studied in the mid to late 20th century. This cascade starts from the activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Park et al., 2006</xref>). Increased intracellular calcium induces the translocation and activation of cPLA2 from the cytosol to the Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, and perinuclear membrane, where cPLA2 cleaves arachidonic acid out of the membrane phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Clark et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Evans et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hirabayashi et al., 1999</xref>). The arachidonic acid is then presented to cyclooxygenases, COX1 and COX2, to yield PGH<sub>2</sub>, which is further converted to PGE<sub>2</sub> by prostaglandin E synthases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Smith &amp; Langenbach, 2001</xref>). PGE<sub>2</sub> synthesized <italic>de novo</italic> is secreted to the extracellular space either by passive diffusion or by active transport by multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Reid et al., 2003</xref>). The secreted PGE<sub>2</sub> exerts its actions by acting on four G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), EP1 to EP4, expressed in neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Narumiya, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Regan, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Although it is largely believed that the PGE<sub>2</sub> action is primarily regulated by the expression and activation of COX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Kalinski, 2012</xref>), cPLA2 appears to play a more important role in the short-term regulation of PGE<sub>2</sub> production and secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Leslie, 2015</xref>). It was shown that the secretion of arachidonic acid is induced within a few minutes after the calcium-dependent translocation of cPLA2 to endo-membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Evans et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hirabayashi et al., 1999</xref>). Moreover, ERK and p38 MAP kinases also contribute to the activation of cPLA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lin et al., 1993</xref>), which may be calcium-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Gijón et al., 2000</xref>). Importantly, these earlier biochemical studies did not elucidate the dynamics of the production and secretion of PGE<sub>2</sub> at the single-cell level, leaving many questions unanswered. For example, do all cells contribute to the production of PGE<sub>2</sub>? Does each cell keep secreting PGE<sub>2</sub> upon stimulation?</p>
<p>Genetically encoded biosensors based on the principle of Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) allow us to visualize the dynamics of intracellular signaling molecules at the single-cell resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Greenwald et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Miyawaki &amp; Niino, 2015</xref>). The development of transgenic mice expressing FRET biosensors has opened a window to the visualization of signaling molecule activity in live tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Terai et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, by using the activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and ERK MAP kinase as surrogate markers, we can also visualize the intercellular communications mediated by Gs-coupled receptors and tyrosine kinase receptors in live tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Hino et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Konishi et al., 2021</xref>). In this study, we show that PGE<sub>2</sub> discharged from a single cell causes radial spread of PKA activation (RSPA) in neighboring cells in tissue culture and the mouse epidermis. By combining a chemical biology approach, optogenetic stimulation, and a simulation model, we quantitatively analyzed the PGE<sub>2</sub> secretion and found that the PGE<sub>2</sub> discharge is regulated temporally by calcium transients and quantitatively by growth factor signaling and cell density.</p>

<title>PGE<sub>2</sub> mediates radial spread of PKA activation (RSPA)</title>
<p>In an attempt to understand intercellular communication under physiologic conditions, we observed the PKA activity of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells by using the FRET biosensor Booster-PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Watabe et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>)(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). We noticed that PKA activation propagates from a single cell to neighboring cells under a confluent condition. We named this phenomenon radial spread of PKA activation (RSPA) and pursued underlying mechanisms (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, Video 1). In a typical example, approximately 100 neighboring cells located within a 100 µm distance exhibit firework-like spread of PKA activation, which decays within several minutes. To characterize this phenomenon without preoccupations, we developed a program to identify and characterize RSPA under various conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). The frequency, but not the radius, of RSPA depended on the cell density; i.e., RSPA was observed only when cells were maintained at more than 6×10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D, 1E</xref>). The probability of RSPA in each cell was also increased in a cell density-dependent manner (Fig. S1A). To examine whether the PKA activation correlates with increased intracellular cAMP concentration, we employed another FRET biosensor for cAMP, hyBRET-Epac, and performed a similar experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ponsioen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Watabe et al., 2020</xref>)(Fig. S1B, S1C). Although the increment of the FRET ratio was not so remarkable as that of Booster-PKA (Fig. S1D), we found that the pattern of cAMP concentration change is very similar to the activity change of PKA, indicating that a Gs protein-coupled receptor (GsPCR) mediates RSPA (Fig. S1E). This discrepancy between hyBRET-Epac and Booster-PKA may be partially explained by the difference in the dynamic ranges for cAMP signaling in each FRET biosensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Watabe et al., 2020</xref>). Previous transcriptome analysis of MDCK cells showed that ATP receptor and PGE<sub>2</sub> receptor EP2 are the most abundant GsPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Shukla et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, we examined the contribution of the ATP receptor and PGE<sub>2</sub> receptors EP2 and EP4 by using specific inhibitors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Inhibitors against EP2, EP4, and COX, but not the ATPase apyrase, abolished RSPA, indicating that PGE<sub>2</sub> mediates RSPA.</p>

<title>RSPA is also observed in the epidermis of the PKAchu mice</title>
<p>To clarify the physiological relevance of RSPA, we used PKAchu mice, which are transgenic mice expressing a FRET biosensor for PKA, AKAR3EV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kamioka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Sato et al., 2020</xref>)(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). We previously observed that ERK MAP kinase activation is propagated radially among the basal layer cells of the mouse epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hiratsuka et al., 2015</xref>), but we failed to observe a similar propagation of PKA activation. We reasoned that this failure was due to the low frequency and short duration of this phenomenon. When we observed a region of over 1 mm square at 1 min intervals, we successfully observed RSPA in the basal layer of the mouse auricular epidermis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, Video 2). Upon i.p. injection of a COX inhibitor, RSPA almost completely disappeared within 10 min (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), indicating that RSPA in the epidermis is mediated by prostaglandins, presumably PGE<sub>2</sub>. The cell density in the basal layer is approximately 2×10<sup>6</sup> cells cm<sup>−2</sup>, which is markedly higher than that in MDCK cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D, 2E</xref>). It is not clear whether this may be related to the lower frequency (~300 cm<sup>−2</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>) and smaller radius of RSPA in the basal layer cells compared to MDCK cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>).</p>

<title>RSPA is triggered by calcium transients</title>
<p>What causes RSPA? In agreement with the principal role of calcium in cPLA2 activation, dual imaging of calcium and PKA showed that an intracellular calcium transient precedes RSPA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). As anticipated, the frequency of RSPA was suppressed by the calcium chelator BAPTA-AM (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Note that not all of the calcium transients induced RSPA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3C</xref>, arrowheads). Approximately only one-tenth of calcium transients evoke RSPA (compare <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). Moreover, the frequency of calcium transients was also cell density-dependent (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). To further pursue the relationship between calcium transient and RSPA, we employed the Gq-DREADD system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Armbruster et al., 2007</xref>). The Gq-DREADD-expressing producer cells were plated with the reporter cells expressing Booster-PKA at a 1:1,200 ratio (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>). Upon activation of the Gq protein-coupled receptor by the DREADD ligand CNO, we observed RSPA with almost the same size and time course as observed under the non-stimulated condition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). Among cells with the calcium transient, 76% exhibited RSPA, significantly higher than in the unstimulated state. Because the average calcium signal intensity was higher in RSPA (+) cells than in RSPA (-) cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>), the peak value of calcium transients appears to be important for the following induction of RSPA.</p>

<p>To further explore the relationship between the peak value of the calcium transient and RSPA, we employed OptoSTIM1, an optogenetic tool to activate the calcium influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kyung et al., 2015</xref>)(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). As anticipated, a blue light flash caused a calcium transient, followed by RSPA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). In a preliminary experiment, a 30 min interval was sufficient to restore the calcium response; therefore, we repeated the blue light flash every 30 min to 1 hour with increasing light intensity. As the light intensity was increased, the amplitude of calcium transients represented by the R-GECO signal also increased linearly (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). In stark contrast, RSPA occurred in an all-or-nothing manner. We repeated this experiment for 13 cells to find any correlations between the calcium concentration and the size of RSPA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). The R-GECO signal intensity ratio (F/F0) that evoked RSPA ranged from 1.5 to 2.1 among the different cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, left), but the size of RSAP did not show a clear correlation with the R-GECO signal intensity ratio (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, right). This observation indicates that there is a threshold of the cytoplasmic calcium concentration for the triggered PGE<sub>2</sub> secretion.</p>

<title>High cell density increases the sensitivity to PGE<sub>2</sub></title>
<p>We next explored the mechanism that determines the size of RSPA. First, taking advantage of the reproducibility of DREADD system, we examined the involvement of EP2/EP4, cPLA2, and COX1/2 in the calcium-induced RSPA by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). As anticipated, we did not observe any RSPA by using the reporter MDCK cells deficient from EP2 and EP4. Knockout of COX2 and cPLA2, but not COX1, in the producer cells almost completely abolished CNO-induced RSPA. These results support the idea that RSPA is mediated by PGE<sub>2</sub> via the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-cPLA2-COX2-EP2/4-cAMP-PKA pathway (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p>

(<bold>C</bold>) COX-DKO MDCK cells expressing Booster-PKA were plated at the indicated cell density, treated with increasing concentrations of PGE<sub>2</sub>, and analyzed for PKA activity.

The average intensity of the whole view field of mKate2 or mKOκ, at 20 to 30 min after the addition of PGE<sub>2</sub>, was applied to calculate the mKate2/mKOκ ratio. Three or four independent experiments were performed. (<bold>D</bold>) COX-DKO MDCK cells were seeded at the indicated cell densities and subjected to RNA-Seq analysis.

</fig>
<p>Next, because the size of RSPA depends on the cell density (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>), we reasoned that the sensitivity of MDCK cells to PGE<sub>2</sub> may also be regulated by cell density. To avoid the effect of PGE<sub>2</sub> produced by the cells, the COX1/2-deficient MDCK cells were challenged by the bath application of PGE<sub>2</sub>. We found an approximately 10-fold difference in the EC50 between the high and low cell densities (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>), suggesting that increased sensitivity to PGE<sub>2</sub> underlies the increased RSPA size under the confluent condition. Transcriptome analysis showed a 2-fold increase in guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(s) subunit alpha (GNAS) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>), but it is not clear whether this difference is sufficient to explain the difference in RSPA frequency. We did not observe any cell density dependence in the transcription of EP2, EP4 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>), phosphodiesterases, or adenylyl cyclases (Fig. S2). Thus, the cell density appears to increase the sensitivity to PGE<sub>2</sub> mostly in a transcription-independent manner.</p>

<title>ERK activity is required for RSPA</title>
<p>Previously, we reported that ERK activation is propagated among confluent MDCK cells in a wave-like fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aoki et al., 2013</xref>). To examine whether ERK activity also regulates RSPA, we simultaneously observed ERK and PKA activities by using EKAREV-NLS and Boobser-PKA, respectively (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). It appeared that the center of RSPA was localized primarily in areas of high ERK activity. Further quantitative analysis has shown that the ERK activity of the cells locating in the center of RSPA was significantly higher than that of the randomly chosen cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, left). However, the size of RSPA did not correlate with the ERK activity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, right). We next examined the timing of RSPA and the passage of ERK activation waves by aligning the events at the highest PKA activity. It appears that RSPA was evoked when the cells exhibited the highest ERK activity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C, 6D</xref>, S4). Cross-correlation analysis of PKA activity and ERK activity revealed that ERK activation preceded PKA activation by approximately 3 min (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). The ERK activation wave is known to be mediated by EGFR and EGFR ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lin et al., 2022</xref>). Accordingly, the addition of EGF faintly increased the frequency of RSPA in our experiments, while the MEK and EGFR inhibitors almost completely abrogated RSPA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>), representing that ERK activation or basal ERK activity is essential for RSPA. Collectively, these results obtained with MDCK cells showed that RSPA is triggered by calcium transient in cells with high ERK activity.</p>

<title>PGE<sub>2</sub> discharge causes radial spread of PKA activation in neighboring cells</title>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, only one study has visualized PGE<sub>2</sub> secretion from a single cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Zonta et al., 2003</xref>). In this study, HEK cells expressing the Gq-coupled PGE<sub>2</sub> receptor EP1 and a calcium indicator were used to monitor PGE<sub>2</sub> release from agonist-stimulated astrocytes. However, the spontaneous release of PGE<sub>2</sub> has never been visualized in either tissue culture cells or live animals. Here we have shown that PGE<sub>2</sub> is discharged after calcium transients in MDCK cells at high cell densities (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). This PGE<sub>2</sub> discharge leads to the radial spread of PKA activation, which we named RSPA, in the neighboring EP2-expressing cells. By using transgenic mice expressing the PKA biosensor, RSPA was also observed in the mouse auricular epidermis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2</xref>). RSPA in the epidermis is almost completely shut off by COXi, strongly suggesting that prostaglandin(s), most likely PGE<sub>2</sub>, mediates RSPA in the skin. Notably, we failed to observe RSPA in melanoma tissues in which calcium transients were frequently observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Konishi et al., 2021</xref>). We reasoned that repetitive PGE<sub>2</sub> secretion from tumor cells maintains a high PGE<sub>2</sub> concentration in the tumor microenvironment, which prevented us from observing pulsatile PKA activation. In fact, the PGE<sub>2</sub> concentration in melanoma tissue is known to reach as high as 10 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Konishi et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, RSPA in the skin may function as an alert signal in an early phase of cellular stress.</p>

<title>PGE<sub>2</sub> is discharged in a switch-like manner in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients</title>
<p>Soon after the identification of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent translocation domain within cPLA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Clark et al., 1991</xref>), Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent cPLA2 arachidonic acid release from cells has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Gijón et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hirabayashi et al., 1999</xref>); therefore, it is not surprising to find that the PGE<sub>2</sub> discharge in our present experiments was due to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent cPLA2 activation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). However, visualization of PGE<sub>2</sub> secretion at the single-cell resolution revealed a switch-like response of PGE<sub>2</sub> discharge to the increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Recruitment of cPLA2 to the ER and perinuclear membrane requires a higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration than that to Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Evans et al., 2001</xref>). If so, cPLA2 may be sequestered at Golgi at low intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, and, only when the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration exceeds the threshold, cPLA2 may reach the ER to liberate arachidonic acids.</p>

<title>ERK also regulates the probability of RSPA</title>
<p>In the cell density-dependent RSPA of MDCK cells, ERK activity regulates the probability, but not the size, of RSPA. Of note, the MEK inhibitor did not significantly decrease the frequency of calcium transients (Fig. S3), suggesting that ERK had a direct effect on the production of PGE<sub>2</sub>. Because ERK positively regulates cPLA2 by phosphorylating Ser<sup>505</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cook &amp; McCormick, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Qiu et al., 1993</xref>), it is reasonable that the RSPA is regulated by ERK activity.</p>
<p>The ERK activation wave is operated by a positive feedforward mechanism in which ERK promotes EGFR ligand shedding and the following EGFR activation increases ERK activity in the neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aoki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Hino et al., 2020</xref>). Here we found that the ERK activation functions as the “AND gate” for PGE<sub>2</sub> production together with the calcium transients (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Notably, the propagation of PKA activation, ~100 µm/min (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), is markedly faster than that of ERK activation, 2–4 µm/min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hiratsuka et al., 2015</xref>). Because PKA antagonizes Ras-dependent ERK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Burgering et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cook &amp; McCormick, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wu et al., 1993</xref>), the EGFR ligand-ERK and PGE<sub>2</sub>-PKA pathways fit the Turing diffusion reaction model consisting of slow positive and fast negative signaling cascades.</p>

<title>RSPA may not directly affect cell competition</title>
<p>Recently, PGE<sub>2</sub> was shown to regulate cell competition among MDCK cells. Interestingly, extrusion of Ras-transformed MDCK cells has been shown to be suppressed by PGE<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Sato et al., 2020</xref>), whereas extrusion of MDCK cells expressing constitutively active YAP was dependent on PGE<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ishihara et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, the effect of PGE<sub>2</sub> in cell competition could be markedly different according to the signaling cascades that cause the oncogenic changes of MDCK cells.</p>
<p>Importantly, PGE<sub>2</sub> promotes the extrusion of MDCK cells expressing the constitutively active YAP by internalization of E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ishihara et al., 2020</xref>), which is a relatively slow process. Since RSPA causes PKA activation for only several minutes in each cell, multiple RSPA events may be needed to reach the concentration required for the induction of extrusion.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We have shown that the PGE<sub>2</sub> discharge from a single cell is a stochastic and switch-like event in the confluent MDCK cells and mouse epidermis. The secreted PGE<sub>2</sub> can transiently activate PKA in cells within a few hundred micrometers from the producer cell. The question of why cells adopt this pulsatile rather than continuous secretion of PGE<sub>2</sub> awaits the future.</p>

The producer and reporter cells were mixed at a ratio of 1:400 to 1:1,200 and plated on collagen-coated glass-bottom 96-well plates (Matsunami Glass Ind.) or 24-well plates (AGC Inc). After 16 to 32 h of incubation, the culture media were replaced with phenol red-free M199 (ThermoFisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum or M199 supplemented with 0.1% w/v bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were imaged by wide-field fluorescence microscopy, as described above. During the observation, OptoSTIM1 was activated with 475 nm LED for 200 msec to trigger calcium influx into the cell. To control the calcium influx from small to large, the excitation light was modulated from 0.8 to 67 μW mm<sup>−2</sup>. To prevent cell division, MDCK cells with 3 µg/ml of mitomycin C for 1 h one day before passage.</p>

<title>Titration of PGE<sub>2</sub> sensitivity</title>
<p>COX-1 and COX-2 depleted (COX-DKO) MDCK cells expressing Booster-PKA were seeded on a 96-well glass-base plate at the indicated densities. Before imaging, the culture media were replaced with phenol red-free M199 (ThermoFisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for MDCK. The 96-well plate was imaged by an inverted microscope as described earlier. mKate2 and mKOκ images were obtained in one position for every well at around 5 min intervals. Cells were stimulated with PGE<sub>2</sub> at the indicated concentrations. The mKate2/mKOκ ratio was quantified from the average intensity of the whole field of view at around 20 to 30 min after the addition of PGE<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<title>Quantification of RSPA</title>
<p>The program code for image analysis is available via GitHub at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/TetsuyaWatabe-1991/RSPAanalysis">https://github.com/TetsuyaWatabe-1991/RSPAanalysis</ext-link>.</p>
<p>Ratio images of MDCK cells expressing Booster-PKA were created after background subtraction. A median filter and a Gaussian 2D filter were applied to each image for noise reduction. The ratio image was normalized by a minimum intensity projection along the time axis. The processed images were binarized with a predetermined threshold and processed by morphological opening and closing to refine the RSPA area. Center coordinates and equivalent circle radii were obtained from each RSPA area. If the distance between the center coordinates of RSPA between successive frames was less than 100 μm, they were considered to be the same RSPA. For MDCK cells expressing hyBRET-Epac and mouse ear skin expressing AKAR3EV, the center coordinates of each RSPA were manually determined due to the low signal-to-noise ratio.</p>
<p>To obtain the time course of the RSPA radius, concentric regions were defined at the center of each RSPA. The median FRET ratio in each concentric ROI was calculated. The radius of the outermost concentric region where the median ratio value exceeds a predetermined threshold was defined as the radius of the RSPA.</p>

<title>Cross-correlation analysis of ERK and PKA activity</title>
<p>Cross-correlation analysis was performed with Python using the scientific library SciPy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.scipy.org">http://www.scipy.org</ext-link>). The centers of each spontaneous RSPA in MDCK cells expressing both EKAREV and Booster-PKA were detected automatically as described above. The regions of interest were defined at the center of each RSPA with a radius of 10 µm, and the average ERK and PKA activity from 2 to 5 cells was quantified. The program code for this analysis is available via GitHub as described above.</p>

<title>RNA-Seq</title>
<p>COX1 and COX2-deficient MDCK cells expressing Booster-PKA were seeded in collagen-coated glass-bottom 96-well plates (AGC Inc.) at a density of 1.5 × 10<sup>4</sup> or 6.0 × 10<sup>4</sup> or 2.4 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. After 24 h of incubation, the culture media were replaced with phenol red-free M199 (ThermoFisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Three hours after medium replacement, RNA was extracted from each sample using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Libraries for RNA-Seq were prepared using an NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs) and sequenced on the NextSeq500 (Illumina) as 75 bp single-end reads. RNA-Seq data were trimmed using Trim Galore version 0.6.6 (Krueger 2015) and Cutadapt version 2.8 (Martin 2011). The quality of reads was checked and filtered using FastQC version 0.11.9 (Andrews 2010). The reads were mapped to a reference genome canFam3.1 (Lindblad-Toh 2005, Hoeppner 2014) using HISAT2 version 2.2.1 (Kim 2019), and the resulting aligned reads were sorted and indexed using SAMtools version 1.7 (Li 2009). Relative abundances of genes were measured in FPKM using StringTie version 2.1.4 (Kovaka 2019, Pertea 2015). Plots were created in Python using the pandas, matplotlib, NumPy, and seaborn libraries.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All statistical analyses and visualizations were performed in Python using the libraries NumPy, pandas, SciPy, pingouin, matplotlib, and seaborn. No statistical analysis was used to predetermine the sample size. Welch’s t-test was used to evaluate statistically significant diLJerences. The p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study reports on the dynamics of PKA investigated at the single-cell level in vitro and in epithelia in vivo. Using different fluorescent biosensors and optogenetic actuators, the authors dissect the signaling pathway responsible for PKA waves, finding that PKA activation is a consequence of PGE2 release, which in turn is triggered by calcium pulses, requiring high ERK activity. The evidence supporting the claims is <bold>solid</bold>. At this stage the work is still partly descriptive in nature, and additional measurements would increase the strength of mechanistic insights and physiological relevance.</p>

<p>This research article by Watabe T and colleagues characterizes PKA waves triggered by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). What the author discovered is that waves of PKA occur both in vitro, in MDCK epithelial monolayers, and in vivo, in the ear epidermis in mice. The PKA waves are the consequence PGE2 discharge, that in turn is triggered by Calcium bursts. Calcium level and ERK activity intensity control that mechanism by acting at different levels.</p>
<p>
This article is a technological tour de force using different biosensors and optogenetic actuators. However, what makes this article interesting is the ability of combining these tools together to dissect a complex signaling pathway at the single-cell level and with highly dynamic processes. For this reason, this paper represents the essence of modern cell biology and paves the way for the cell biology of the future.</p>
<p>However, we think that the paper in this stage is still partly descriptive in its nature, and more measurements are needed to increase the strength of the mechanistic insights. Here below the points that we believe that need some improvement.</p>
<p>1)Even though the phenomenon of PGE2 signal propagation is elegantly demonstrated and well described, the whole paper is mostly of descriptive nature - the PGE2 signal is propagated via intercellular communication and requires Ca transients as well as MAPK activity, however function of these RSPAs in dense epithelium is not taken into consideration.</p>
<p>
What is the function of these RSPAs in cellular crowding? - Does it promote cell survival or initiate apoptosis? Does it feed into epithelial reorganization during cellular crowding? Still something else? The authors discuss possible roles of this phenomenon in cell competition context, but show no experimental or statistical efforts to answer this question. I believe some additional analysis or simple experiment would help to shed some light on the functional aspect of RSPAs and increase the importance of all the elegant demonstrations and precise experimental setups that the manuscript is rich of. Monolayer experiments using some perturbations that challenge the steady state of epithelial homeostasis - drug treatments/ serum deprivation/ osmotic stress/ combined with live cell imaging and statistical methods that take into account local cell density might provide important answers to these questions. The authors could consider following some of these ideas to improve the overall value of the manuscript.</p>
<p>1. In the line 82-84 the authors claim: &quot;We found that the pattern of cAMP concentration change is very similar to the activity change of PKA, indicating that a Gs protein-coupled receptor (GsPCR) mediates RSPA&quot;. In our opinion, this conclusion is not well-supported by the results. The authors should at least show that some measurement of the two patterns show correlation. Are the patterns of cAMP of the same size as the pattern of PKA? Do they have the same size depending on cell density? Do they occur at the same frequency as the PKA patterns, depending on the cell density? Do they have an all or nothing activation as PKA or their activation is shading with the distance from the source?</p>
<p>2. In general, the absolute radius of the waves is not a good measurement for single-cell biology studies, especially when comparing different densities or in vivo vs in vitro experiments. We suggest the authors to add the measurement of the number of the cells involved in the waves (or the radius expressed in number of cells).</p>
<p>3. In 6D, the authors should also show the single-cell trajectories to understand better the correlation between PKA and ERK peaks. Is the huger variability in ERK activity ratio dues to different peak time or different ERK activity levels in different cells? The authors should show both the variability in the time and intensity.</p>
<p>4. In lines 130-132, the authors write, &quot;This observation indicates that the amount of PGE2 secretion is predetermined and that there is a threshold of the cytoplasmic calcium concentration for the triggered PGE2 secretion&quot;. How could the author exclude that the amount of PGE2 is not regulated in its intensity as well? For sure, there is a threshold effect regarding calcium, but this doesn't mean that PGE2 secretion can be further regulated, e.g. by further increasing calcium concentration or by other mechanisms.</p>
<p>5. The manuscript shows that not all calcium transients are followed by RSPAs. Does the local cell density/crowding increase the probability of overlap between calcium transients and RSPAs?</p>
<p>The revision of the Watabe T paper provides additional data and analyses in response to the reviewers' comments. On our side, we are satisfied by these improvements.</p>
<p>
In the answer to our first question, the authors claim that they did multiple experiments to understand the function of RSPA in MDCK cell, all providing negative results. The authors could consider publishing the negative results as well, as they can be useful for the community.</p>
<p>In sum, we are convinced of the value of this article, and we thank the authors for the work that has been done.</p>

<p>This study visualizes a specific localized form of cell-to-cell communication and conveys very well with what dynamics and sensitivity this biological phenomenon occurs.</p>
<p>
Using a FRET-based PKA biosensor, the authors observed that radial localized kinase activity changes spontaneously occur in adjacent cells of certain cell density. This phenomenon of radial propagation of PKA activity changes in groups of cells was further mechanistically elucidated and characterized. Interestingly, the authors found that individual cells in the cell groups form spontaneous Ca2+ transients, which at a certain strength can trigger the biosynthesis and release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). PGE2 then acts on the neighboring cells and triggers the increase of cAMP levels and the associated activation of the PKA via G-protein-coupled receptors (EP2 and EP4). In systematic, well-structured experiments, it was then found that the frequency of occurrence of such radial activations depends not only on the cell density but also on the activation state of the ERK MAP kinase pathway.</p>
<p>Strength</p>
<p>
In this study, the authors skillfully used various modern genetically encoded biosensors and other tools such as optogenetic tools to visualize and characterize an interesting biological phenomenon of cell-to-cell communication. The insights gained with these investigations produce a better understanding of the dynamics, sensitivity, and spatial extent with which such communications can occur in a cell network. It is also worth noting that the authors have not limited the studies to 2D cell culture in vitro, but were also able to confirm the findings in an animal model.</p>
<p>Weakness</p>
<p>
The work is hardly conclusive as to the actual biological significance of the phenomenon. It would be interesting to know more under which physiological and pathological conditions PGE2 triggers such radical PKA activity changes. It is not well explained in which tissues and organs and under what conditions this type of cell-to-cell communication could be particularly important.</p>
<p>
The authors also do not explain further why in certain cells of the cell clusters Ca2+ signals occur spontaneously and thus trigger the phenomenon. What triggers these Ca2+ changes? And why could this be linked to certain cell functions and functional changes?</p>
<p>
What explains the radius and the time span of the radial signal continuation? To what extent are these factors also related to the degradation of PGE2? The work could be stronger if such questions and their answers would be experimentally integrated and discussed.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p>
<p>This important study reports investigation of the dynamics of PKA at the single-cell level in in vitro and in epithelia in vivo. Using different fluorescent biosensors and optogenetic actuators, the authors dissect the signaling pathway responsible for PKA waves, finding that PKA activation is a consequence of PGE2 release, which in turn is triggered by calcium pulses, requiring high ERK activity. The evidence supporting the claims is solid. At this stage the work is still partly descriptive in nature, and additional measurements would increase the strength of mechanistic insights and physiological relevance.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We deeply appreciate Dr. Alejandro San Martín and Dr. Jonathan Cooper  and the reviewers. Each comment is valuable and reasonable. We will revise our paper as much as possible.</p>
<p>We have described what we will do for the reviewer’s comments one by one in the below section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank the reviewer’s comment. Although we have intensively tried to identify the physiological relevance of RSPA, we could not detect the function at present.</p>
<p>In the case of MDCK, the treatment of NSAIDs, which cancels RSPA, did not affect its cell growth, ERK wave propagation during collective migration,  migration velocity, cell survival, or apoptosis. In mouse epidermis, the frequency of RSPA was NOT affected by inflammation and collective cell migration, evoked by TPA treatment and wound, respectively.</p>
<p>Notably, RSPA also occurs in the normal epidermis, implying its relevance in homeostasis. However, at the current stage, we believe that the PGE2 dynamics and its regulation mechanism in the normal epidermis would be worth reporting to researchers in the field.</p>

<p>We have modified the text (line85)</p>
<p>“Although the increment of the FRET ratio was not so remarkable as that of Booster-PKA, Wwe found that the pattern of cAMP concentration change is very similar to the activity change of PKA, indicating that a Gs protein-coupled receptor (GsPCR) mediates RSPA. This discrepancy may be partially explained by the difference in the dynamic ranges for cAMP signaling in each FRET biosensor (Watabe2020). “</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. We have analyzed our results to demonstrate the number of cells as in Fig2E, which would be easy for readers to understand.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. We have also hypothesized the model. However, we did not see the correlation that the reviewer pointed out. Currently, the increment of the RSPA frequency at high density is partially caused by the increment of calcium transients.</p>

It is not well explained in which tissues and organs and under what conditions this type of cell-to-cell communication could be particularly important.</p>
<p>The greatest weakness of the study seems to be that the biological significance of the phenomenon is not clearly clarified. Although it can be deduced that PKA activation has many implications for cell signaling and metabolism, the work lacks the actual link to physiological or pathological significance.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We deeply appreciate the reviewer’s comment. Similar to the reseponse of reviewer#1, although we have intensively tried to identify the physiological relevance of RSPA, we could not detect the function.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we believe that the PGE2 dynamics and its regulation mechanism in the normal epidermis would be worth reporting to researchers in the field.</p>

<p>At this moment, we do not have a clear answer or model for the comment although the calcium transients have been reported in the epidermis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-24899-7">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-24899-7</ext-link>).

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment. Although we have intensively studied that point, we have omitted the results because of its complications.  In HeLa cells, but not MDCK cells, we demonstrate the meaning of the radius of RSPA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37813623/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37813623/</ext-link>)</p>

<p>1. The authors could consider whether they could investigate the subcellular translocation of cPLA2 in correlation with cytosolic Ca2+ signals using GFP technology and high-resolution fluorescence microscopy with their cell model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Actually, we tried to monitor the cPLA2 translocation using GFP-tagged cPLA2. However, the translocation of GFP-cPLA2 was detected, only when the cells were stimulated by calcium ionophore. At this point, we have concluded that the quantitative analysis of cPLA2 translocation would be difficult.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>1. &quot;The cell density in the basal layer is approximately 2x106 cells cm-2, which is markedly higher than that in MDCK cells (Fig. 2D). It is not clear whether this may be related to the lower frequency (~300 cm-2 h-1) and smaller radius of RSPA in the basal layer cells compared to MDCK cells (Fig. 2E).&quot; Wasn't the relationship with cell density the opposite, higher density higher frequency? Isn't then this result contradicting the &quot;cell density rule&quot; that the authors argue is there in the in vitro system? The authors need to revise their interpretation of the data obtained.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment. Currently, we do not find the &quot;cell density rule&quot; in mouse epidermis.  It would be difficult to identify common rules between mouse epidermis and MDCK cells. However, although it is descriptive, we believe it is worth comparing the MDCK results at this moment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Similarly, the authors over conclude on the explanation of lack of change in the size of RSPA size when the change in fluorescence for the calcium reporter surpasses a threshold by saying that &quot;This observation indicates that the amount of PGE2 secretion is predetermined and that there is a threshold of the cytoplasmic calcium concentration for the triggered PGE2 secretion.&quot; First, the study does not really measure directly PGE2 secretion. Hence, there is no way that they can argue that the level of PGE2 secreted is &quot;predetermined&quot;. Instead, there could be an inhibitory mechanism that is triggered to limit further activation of PGE2 signaling/PKA in neighboring cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment. We have omitted the context.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. To rule out a transcription-dependent mechanism in the apparent cell density-regulated sensitivity to PGE2, the authors need to inhibit transcription.
We agree that our RNA-seq analysis would not 100% rule out the transcription-dependent mechanism. However, we believe that shutting down all transcription will show a severe off-target effect that indirectly affects the calcium transients and the PGE2-synthetase pathway. Therefore, our conclusion is limited.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>1. EGF is reported to increase the frequency of RSPA but the change shown in Fig. 6F is not statistically significant, hence, EGF does not increase RSPA frequency in their experiments.</p>
<p>We have toned down the claim that EGF treatment increases the frequency (line172).</p>
<p>&quot;Accordingly, the addition of EGF faintly increased the frequency of RSPA in our experiments, while the MEK and EGFR inhibitors almost completely abrogated RSPA (Fig. 6F), representing that ERK activation or basal ERK activity is essential for RSPA.“</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The Discussion section is at times redundant with the results section. References to figures should be kept in the Results section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to argue in opposition to this comment.  For readers, we believe that the reference to figures would be helpful and kind. However, if eLife recommends removing the reference from the Discussion section, we will follow the publication policy.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. &quot;Notably, the propagation of PKA activation, ~100 μm/min (Fig. 1H), is markedly faster than that of ERK activation, 2-4 μm/min (Hiratsuka et al., 2015).&quot; The 2 kinase reporters are based on different molecular designs. Thus, it does not seem appropriate to compare the kinetics of both reporters as a proxy of the comparison of the kinetics of propagation of both kinases.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We think that we should discuss the comparison of the activity propagation between ERK and PKA. First, among many protein kinases, only ERK and PKA activities have been shown to spread in the epithelial cells. Second, both pathways are considered to be intercellular communication. Finally, crosstalk between these two pathways has been reported in several cells and organs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. In Figure 1E it is unclear what is significantly different from what. Statistical analysis should be added and reporting of the results should reflect the results from that analysis.</p>
<p>1. In Figure 3F and G the color coding is confusing. In F pink is radius and black is GCaMP6 and in G is RSPA+ and - cells. The authors should change the color to avoid ambiguity in the code.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have amended the panels.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. In Fig. 5C, how do they normalize per cell density if they are measuring radius of the response?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In Fig5C, we just measure the increment of FRET ratio in the view fields.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. In Fig. 5D, what is the point of having a label for PTGER3 if data were not determined (ND)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added what N.D. means.</p>
<p>“N.D. represents Not Detected.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. It is important to assess whether ERK activation depends of PGE2 signaling to better place ERK in the proposed signaling pathway. In fact, the authors argue that &quot;ERK had a direct effect on the production of PGE2.&quot; But it could be that ERK is downstream PGE2 signaling instead.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It could be possible in other experimental conditions via EP1 and/or EP3 pathways. However, we never detected an effect of RSPA on ERK activity by analyzing our imaging system. In addition, treatment with NSAIDs or COX-2 depletion, which completely abolishes RSPA, did not affect ERK wave propagation. Thus, in our context, we concluded that ERK is not downstream of PGE2. This notion is also supported by the NGS results in Fig. 5D.</p>
<p>We have refrained from discussing the pathway of  PGE2-dependent ERK activation because it would be redundant.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The authors need to explain better what they mean by &quot;AND gate&quot; if they want to reach a broad readership like that of eLife</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have modified the legend to explain the “AND gate” as much as possible (line639).</p>
<p>“Figure 7: Models for PGE2 secretion.</p>
<p>The frequency of calcium transients is cell density-dependent manner. While the ERK activation wave is there in both conditions. Because both calcium transient and ERK activation are required for RSPA, the probability for PGE2 secretion is regulated as “AND gate”. ”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. In Fig. 5D, &quot;The average intensity of the whole view field of mKate2 or mKOκ, at 20 to 30 min after the addition of PGE2, was applied to calculate the mKate2/mKOκ ratio.&quot; But this means that overlapping/densely plated cells in high density will show stronger changes in fluorescence. This should be done per cell not per field of view. It is obvious that the higher density will have more dense/brighter signal in a given field of view.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are sorry for the confusion. The cell density does not affect the FRET ratio, although the brightness could be changed. A typical example is Fig1D. Thus, we are sure that our procedures represent the PKA activity in plated cells.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. In Fig. 6B the authors need to explain how were the &quot;randomly set positions&quot; determined.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have modified the legend section as below (line618).</p>
<p>“The ERK activities within 10 µm from the center of RSPA and within 10 µm from randomly set positions with a random number table generated by Python are plotted in the left panel. Each colored dot represents an average value of an independent experiment.”</p>
