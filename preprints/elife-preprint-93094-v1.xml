<title>Abstract</title><p>Vitamin B6 deficiency has been linked to cognitive impairment in human brain disorders for decades. Still, the molecular mechanisms linking vitamin B6 to these pathologies remain poorly understood, and whether vitamin B6 supplementation improves cognition is unclear as well. Pyridoxal phosphatase (PDXP), an enzyme that controls levels of pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP), the co-enzymatically active form of vitamin B6, may represent an alternative therapeutic entry point into vitamin B6-associated pathologies. However, pharmacological PDXP inhibitors to test this concept are lacking. We now identify a PDXP and age-dependent decline of PLP levels in the murine hippocampus that provides a rationale for the development of PDXP inhibitors. Using a combination of small molecule screening, protein crystallography and biolayer interferometry, we discover and analyze 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) as a direct and potent PDXP inhibitor. 7,8-DHF binds and reversibly inhibits PDXP with low micromolar affinity and sub-micromolar potency. In mouse hippocampal neurons, 7,8-DHF increases PLP in a PDXP-dependent manner. These findings validate PDXP as a druggable target. Of note, 7,8-DHF is a well-studied molecule in brain disorder models, although its mechanism of action is actively debated. Our discovery of 7,8-DHF as a PDXP inhibitor offers novel mechanistic insights into the controversy surrounding 7,8-DHF-mediated effects in the brain.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Vitamin B6 is an essential micronutrient that plays an important role in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>), with the vitamin B6 status affecting cognitive function at any age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Population studies indicate that low vitamin B6 levels are common among older people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>), and suggest that vitamin B6 deficiency may influence memory performance and may contribute to age-related cognitive decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Vitamin B6 deficiency is also associated with other conditions characterized by impaired learning and memory, including neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>) and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Nevertheless, the exact molecular mechanisms linking vitamin B6 to these pathologies are often insufficiently understood, and whether vitamin B6 supplementation improves cognition is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>).</p>
<p>The term vitamin B6 encompasses the enzymatically interconvertible compounds pyridoxine, pyridoxamine, pyridoxal (referred to as B6 vitamers) and their phosphorylated forms. Among these, only pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) is co-enzymatically active. In humans, PLP is known to be required for 44 distinct biochemical reactions, including the biosynthesis and/or metabolism of neurotransmitters, amino acids, lipids, and glucose. In addition, B6 vitamers display antioxidant and anti-inflammatory functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>).</p>
<p>Cellular PLP availability in the brain depends on numerous factors, including the intestinal absorption of B6 vitamers, extracellular phosphatases, inter-organ transport and intracellular enzymes and carriers/scavengers involved in PLP formation and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Specifically, intracellular PLP is formed by the pyridoxal kinase (PDXK)-catalyzed phosphorylation of pyridoxal, or the pyridox(am)ine-5’-phosphate oxidase (PNPO)-catalyzed oxidation of pyridox(am)ine 5’-phosphate to PLP. PLP is highly reactive and can undergo condensation reactions with e.g., primary amino groups or thiol groups in proteins or amino acids. Although the mechanisms of PLP delivery within the cells are still largely unknown, it is clear that the intracellular availability of PLP for co-enzymatic functions depends on PLP carriers/scavengers and on the hydrolytic activity of pyridoxal 5’-phosphate phosphatase (PDXP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>).</p>
<p>We have previously shown that the genetic knockout of PDXP (PDXP-KO) in mice increases brain PLP levels and improves spatial memory and learning, suggesting that elevated PLP levels can improve cognitive functions in this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). We therefore reasoned that a pharmacological inhibition of PDXP may be leveraged to increase intracellular PLP levels and conducted a high-throughput screening campaign to identify small-molecule PDXP modulators. Here, we report the discovery and the structural and cellular validation of 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) as a selective PDXP inhibitor. 7,8-DHF is a well-studied molecule in brain disorder models characterized by impaired cognition, and widely regarded as a tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) agonist with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-mimetic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). However, a direct TrkB agonistic activity of 7,8-DHF has been called into question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Our serendipitous discovery of 7,8-DHF as a direct PDXP inhibitor provides an alternative mechanistic explanation for 7,8-DHF-mediated effects. More potent, efficacious, and selective PDXP inhibitors may be useful future tools to explore a possible benefit of elevated PLP levels in brain disorders.</p>

<title>PDXP activity controls PLP levels in the hippocampus</title>
<p>The hippocampus is important for age-dependent memory consolidation and learning, and impaired memory and learning is associated with PLP deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). To study a possible contribution of PDXP and/or PDXK to age-related PLP homeostasis in the hippocampus, we performed Western blot analyses in young versus older mice. Unexpectedly, we found that both PDXP and PDXK expression levels were markedly higher in hippocampi of middle-aged than of juvenile animals (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref></bold>). These data suggest an accelerated hippocampal PLP turnover in older mice, consistent with previous findings in senescent mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>).</p>

<p>An analysis of total hippocampal PLP levels in PDXP-WT and PDXP-KO mice showed an age-dependent profile. PLP levels appeared to peak around 3 months of age (possibly reflecting PLP-dependent neurotransmitter biosynthesis and metabolism during the postnatal developmental period) and descended back to juvenile levels by 12 months of age in both genotypes. Although total hippocampal PLP levels in PDXP-KO mice also decreased with age, they consistently remained above PLP levels in control mice (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref></bold>; two-tailed, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test of PLP levels in PDXP-WT vs. PDXP-KO hippocampi, all ages combined: <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001).</p>
<p>PLP is protected from hydrolysis by binding to proteins, and PDXP is expected to dephosphorylate only non-protein-bound PLP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). To test this, we prepared protein-depleted PLP fractions from PDXP-WT and PDXP-KO hippocampal lysates using 3 kDa molecular weight cutoff centrifugal filters. The quantification of PLP in these fractions demonstrated that PDXP loss indeed only increased the pool of protein-depleted PLP, both in young (18-42 days old) and older mice (252-352 days old, corresponding to mature/middle-aged mice), whereas the levels of protein-bound PLP remained unchanged (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref></bold>). While the hippocampal levels of non-protein-bound PLP dropped by about 60% over this time span in PDXP-WT mice, they remained elevated in PDXP-KO mice ∼2-fold higher in younger, and ∼5-fold higher in older PDXP-KO compared to the respective PDXP-WT; see <bold><xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 – figure supplement 1</xref></bold> for exact mouse ages). We conclude that hippocampi of older mice are characterized by a specific decrease in the levels of non-protein-bound PLP, and that this age-dependent PLP loss is dependent on PDXP activity. These observations establish that PDXP is a critical determinant of PLP levels in the murine hippocampus and suggest that intracellular PLP deficiency may be alleviated by PDXP inhibition.</p>

<title>A high-throughput screening campaign identifies 7,8-dihydroxyflavone as a PDXP inhibitor</title>
<p>Pharmacological small-molecule PDXP inhibitors are currently lacking. To identify PDXP inhibitor candidates, we screened the FMP small molecule repository containing 41,182 compounds for molecules able to modulate the phosphatase activity of recombinant, highly purified murine PDXP (see <bold><xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 – figure supplement 1</xref></bold> for a schematic of the screening campaign). Difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (DiFMUP) was used as a fluorogenic phosphatase substrate in a primary screen. Compounds that altered DiFMUP fluorescence by ≥50% (activator candidates) or ≤25% (inhibitor candidates) were subjected to EC<sub>50</sub>/IC<sub>50</sub> value determinations. Of these, 46 inhibitor hits were selected and counter-screened against phosphoglycolate phosphatase (PGP), the closest PDXP relative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Fourteen of the PDXP inhibitor hits (with an IC<sub>50</sub> PDXP &lt;20 µM, and IC<sub>50</sub> PDXP &lt; IC<sub>50</sub> PGP or no activity against PGP) were subsequently validated in a secondary assay, using PLP as a physiological PDXP substrate (see <bold><xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 – figure supplement 2</xref></bold> for all 14 inhibitor hits). Only two PDXP-selective inhibitor hits (FMP-1 and 7,8-dihydroxyflavone/7,8-DHF, a naturally occurring flavone) blocked PDXP-catalyzed PLP dephosphorylation. FMP-1 (IC<sub>50</sub> ∼1 µM) was obtained from an academic donor, and its structure is undisclosed for intellectual property reasons. Further characterization was therefore only possible for 7,8-DHF (IC<sub>50</sub> ∼1 µM).</p>
<p>In vitro activity assays using PLP as a substrate confirmed that 7,8-DHF directly blocks murine and human PDXP activity with submicromolar potency and an apparent efficacy of ∼50% (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, b</xref></bold>). The efficacy of 7,8-DHF under these conditions may be limited by the poor solubility of this flavone (see also <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref></bold>). This interpretation is supported by Todd et al. who established a solubility profile of 7,8-DHF and demonstrated that only ⁓20% of the compound remains in solution beyond a concentration of 5 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>).</p>

<p>We next examined whether commercially available 7,8-DHF analogs might be more potent PDXP inhibitors. We tested flavone, 3,7-dihydroxyflavone, 5,7-dihydroxyflavone (also known as chrysin), 3,5,7-trihydroxyflavon (galangin), 5,6,7-trihydroxyflavone (baicalein) and 3,7,8-trihydroxyflavone-4’-hydroxyphenyl. <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref></bold> shows that of the tested 7,8-DHF analogs, only 3,7,8-trihydroxyflavone-4’-hydroxyphenyl was able to inhibit PDXP, albeit with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 2.5 µM and thus slightly less potently than 7,8-DHF. These results suggest that hydroxyl groups in positions 7 and 8 of the flavone scaffold are required for PDXP inhibition.</p>
<p>We used a biolayer interferometry (BLI) optical biosensing technique to further characterize the binding of 7,8-DHF to PDXP (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref></bold>). Consistent with a specific interaction, 7,8-DHF binding to PDXP was concentration-dependent and fully reversible. Steady-state analysis of a 7,8-DHF serial dilution series yielded an affinity (K<sub>D</sub>) value of 3.1 ± 0.3 µM (data are mean values ± S.E. of <italic>n</italic>=4 measurements; see <bold><xref rid="fig2s3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 – figure supplement 3</xref></bold> for the three other measurements) using a 1:1 dose-response model. Global analysis of the sensorgrams assuming a 1:1 binding model resulted in an affinity of 2.6 ± 0.5 µM, in line with the steady-state results (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref></bold>). Due to the aforementioned poor solubility of 7,8-DHF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>), concentrations higher than 12.5 µM could not be evaluated. As expected, 5,7-dihydroxyflavone showed no signal in the BLI, in line with previous experiments (see <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref></bold>). With its molecular size of 254 Da and its physicochemical properties, 7,8-DHF is a typical fragment-like molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). Typical association rate constants (k<sub>on</sub>) for fragments are limited by the rate of diffusion and are higher than 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>. Interestingly, 7,8-DHF showed a slow k<sub>on</sub> of 1050 M<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>, which is atypical and rarely found for fragment-like molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>), and a k<sub>off</sub> rate of 0.03 s<sup>−1</sup>. With the commonly used estimation of ΔG ∼ pK<sub>D</sub> and a heavy atom number of 19, 7,8-DHF shows a high ligand efficiency of 0.39, which makes it an interesting molecule for further medicinal chemistry optimization. Taken together, these data support a direct and reversible physical interaction between 7,8-DHF and PDXP that leads to PDXP inhibition.</p>

<title>Selectivity of 7,8-DHF</title>
<p>PDXP is a member of the large family of haloacid dehalogenase (HAD)-type hydrolases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). HAD phosphatases are Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent phospho-aspartate transferases that consist of a Rossman-like catalytic core linked to a cap domain. The insertion site, structure and size of the cap define the substrate selectivity of the respective enzyme. The “capless” C0-type HAD phosphatases contain either a very small or no cap, resulting in an accessible catalytic cleft that enables the dephosphorylation of macromolecular substrates. Larger C1 or C2 caps act as a roof for the entrance to the active site; most C1/C2-capped HAD phosphatases consequently dephosphorylate small molecules that can gain access to the catalytic cleft. Cap domains also contain so-called substrate specificity loops that contribute to substrate coordination. Hence, caps are distinguishing features of HAD phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>).</p>
<p>To probe the selectivity of 7,8-DHF for PDXP, a C2-capped HAD phosphatase, we tested five additional mammalian HAD phosphatases, including two other C2- and two C1-capped phosphatases and one C0-type enzyme. When assayed at a (nominal) concentration of 5, 10 and 40 µM (i.e., up to ∼40-fold above the IC<sub>50</sub> value for PDXP-catalyzed PLP-dephosphorylation), 7,8-DHF was inactive against four of the tested enzymes. 7,8-DHF inhibited PGP, the closest PDXP relative, with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 4.8 µM (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref></bold>). This result is consistent with the criteria applied during the initial counter-screen (see above). Together, our data show that 7,8-DHF selectively inhibits PDXP, and that higher 7,8-DHF concentrations can also target the PDXP paralog PGP.</p>

<title>Mode of PDXP inhibition</title>
<p>To probe the mechanism of PDXP inhibition, we assayed the steady state kinetics of PLP dephosphorylation in the presence of increasing 7,8-DHF concentrations (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). Analysis of the derived kinetic constants demonstrated that 7,8-DHF increased the K<sub>M</sub> up to ∼2-fold, and slightly reduced v<sub>max</sub> values ∼0.7-fold. Thus, 7,8-DHF mainly exhibits a mixed mode of PDXP inhibition, which is predominantly competitive.</p>

<p>Like apo-PDXP, 7,8-DHF-bound PDXP homodimerizes via its cap domain. The alignment of the structures representing apo-PDXP, the inhibitor-free protomer B, and the 7,8-DHF-bound PDXP protomer A resulted in root mean square deviations (RMSDs) of 0.42 Å (A vs. B in this structure), 0.35 Å (A vs. B in 4BX3), 0.41 Å (A in this structure vs. A in 4BX3, <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref></bold>), 0.49 Å (A in this structure vs. B in 4BX3), 0.45 Å (B in this structure vs. A in 4BX3) and 0.37 Å (B in this structure vs. B in 4BX3) based on Cα atoms, which indicate that binding of the inhibitor did not result in significant changes in the backbone conformations. In particular, we did not discern distinct open and closed active site conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>) or a tilting of the substrate specificity loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>) in 7,8-DHF-bound PDXP compared to apo-PDXP. All catalytic core residues and the Mg<sup>2+</sup> cofactor are correctly oriented in the presence of the inhibitor. Hence, 7,8-DHF binding does not appear to impact the overall fold or the open/closed dynamics of PDXP.</p>
<p>7,8-DHF was observed to only bind to one subunit (the A-chain; <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref></bold>) with well-defined density (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref></bold>) and full occupancy since its average B-factor of 45.8 Å<sup>2</sup> closely matches the B-factors of the surrounding atoms. Binding to the other subunit (B-protomer) is prevented by a salt bridge between Arg62 and Asp14 of a symmetry-related A-protomer (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref></bold>). The χ<sub>1</sub> and χ<sub>2</sub> torsion angles of the Arg62 side chain observed in the B-protomer correspond to those observed for this side chain in both protomers of the apo-structure (4BX3). To allow binding of the inhibitor, the side chain of Arg62 needs to adopt a completely extended conformation, which is prevented by the salt bridge.</p>
<p>It is currently unclear whether the PDXP crystal state with only a single inhibitor bound per dimer reflects the state in solution. Due to the limited solubility of 7,8-DHF, we were unable to address the stoichiometry of 7,8-DHF binding to the PDXP dimer with isothermal calorimetry. It is conceivable that the PDXP crystal packing is very stable (indeed, 7,8-DHF-bound PDXP crystallized in the same cubic space group as apo-PDXP, see ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>), including the aforementioned salt bridge between Arg62 of the B-subunit and Asp14 of a symmetry-related molecule), and that the free energy generated by the formation of the crystal lattice is higher than the free energy generated upon inhibitor binding. Further inspection of 7,8-DHF-bound PDXP indicated that the crystallographic neighbors of protomer A and B are dissimilar. While the 7,8-DHF binding site is readily accessible in protomer A, the corresponding site in protomer B is shielded by two crystallographic neighbors (<bold><xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 – figure supplement 1</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>In protomer A, 7,8-DHF binds directly in the PDXP active site, with its phenyl ring at a distance of 8.3 Å from the Asp25 nucleophile, and 3.8 Å from Asp27, which functions as a general acid/base in the two partial reactions of the catalytic cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). The introduction of PLP from PDB code 2CFT (human PDXP in complex with PLP) for visualization purposes revealed a partial overlap between the PLP and 7,8-DHF binding sites (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref></bold>). While PLP is deeply buried in the catalytic cleft, the bulkier 7,8-DHF molecule obstructs the active site entrance with its 1,4-benzopyrone moiety and its phenyl ring protrudes into the catalytic cleft.</p>
<p>7,8-DHF is embedded in a cavity of the PDXP active site that is exclusively formed by the active site of protomer A, without a contribution of the dimerization interface with protomer B. One side of this cavity is formed by the more polar residues Asp27, Asn60, Ser61 and Arg62, whereas the opposite side is established by the more hydrophobic residues Tyr146, His178, Pro179, and Leu180. Adjacent to this hydrophobic stretch, the polar residue Glu148 is located at the active site entrance, directly opposite of Arg62 on the more polar side of the 7,8-DHF binding channel (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref></bold>). Inhibitor binding appears to be primarily stabilized by two hydrogen bonds, as well as polar and non-polar interactions. The side chain hydroxyl group of Ser61 forms a direct hydrogen bond with the ketone group of the inhibitor, which is additionally coordinated by the Ser61 backbone nitrogen atom. Furthermore, Glu148 forms a direct hydrogen bond via its carboxylic acid with the 7-hydroxyl group of 7,8-DHF. The side chains of the polar residues Asp27, Asn60, and Arg62 engage in van der Waals interactions with 7,8-DHF. The two hydroxyl groups of the 7,8-DHF benzyl ring engage in van der Waals interactions with the guanidinium group of Arg62 and the carboxylic acid function of Glu148. On the more hydrophobic side of the binding cavity, Tyr146 forms π-electron stacking interactions with the pyrone ring of 7,8-DHF. In addition, the His178 imidazole group coordinates the 7,8-DHF phenyl ring via π-π stacking. His178, located in the substrate specificity loop, and Asn60 and Arg62 are also important for PLP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). All PDXP residues found to engage in 7,8-DHF interactions are identical in murine and human PDXP (<bold><xref rid="fig3s2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 – figure supplement 2</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>To verify the putative 7,8-DHF – PDXP interactions, we introduced single mutations into the binding interface. Asn60, Arg62, Tyr146, Glu148 and His178 were each exchanged for Ala (PDXP<sup>N60A</sup>, PDXP<sup>R62A</sup>, PDXP<sup>Y146A</sup>, PDXP<sup>E148A</sup>, or PDXP<sup>H178A</sup>, respectively). Since the carboxamide group of Asn60 can form a hydrogen bond with the carboxylate moiety of the Asp27, and a loss of this interaction in the PDXP<sup>N60A</sup> variant is predicted to alter the PDXP structure, we additionally mutated Asn60 to Ser (PDXP<sup>N60S</sup>). PDXP variants were recombinantly expressed and purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> (see <bold><xref rid="fig3s3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 – figure supplement 3</xref></bold> for protein purity). <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3g</xref></bold> (left panel) shows that all PDXP variants were enzymatically active. As expected, the phosphatase activities of PDXP<sup>N60A</sup> and of PDXP<sup>H178A</sup> were reduced. The somewhat elevated phosphatase activity of PDXP<sup>Y146A</sup> and PDXP<sup>E148A</sup> is currently unexplained. Importantly, all variants except PDXP<sup>N60A</sup> and PDXP<sup>N60S</sup> were resistant to 7,8-DHF, supporting the essential role of each of these residues for inhibitor binding (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref></bold>, right panel).</p>
<p>Based on the inhibitor-bound structure and the predominantly competitive component of PDXP inhibition by 7,8-DHF (increased K<sub>M</sub>, see <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>), it seems likely that 7,8-DHF sterically hinders substrate access to the active site, and competes with PLP coordination. In addition, BLI measurements (see <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref></bold>) showed a relatively slow association rate and extended residence time of 7,8-DHF (τ=30.3 s). This may indicate a possible reorganization of the amino acids and water molecules within the binding site as a function of slow-onset 7,8-DHF binding. The reduced rate of product formation may account for the observed non-competitive component of 7,8-DHF-mediated PDXP inhibition (reduction of v<sub>max</sub>, see <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>7,8-DHF functions as a PDXP inhibitor in hippocampal neurons</title>
<p>To investigate cellular target engagement of 7,8-DHF, we isolated primary hippocampal neurons from PDXP-WT and PDXP-KO embryos. PDXP deficiency increased total PLP levels 2.4-fold compared to PDXP-WT neurons (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref></bold>). This finding is in good agreement with the PLP increase resulting from PDXP loss in total hippocampal extracts (see <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref></bold>). The larger absolute PLP values in cultured neurons are likely attributable to the high concentration of the PLP precursor pyridoxal (20 µM) in the culture medium. We did not observe PDXP-dependent changes in pyridoxal kinase (PDXK) expression (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref></bold>) and could not detect pyridox(am)ine-5’-phosphate oxidase (PNPO) in hippocampal neuronal cultures, suggesting that the PLP increase was primarily caused by the constitutive PDXP loss.</p>

</fig>
<p>To assess the consequences of 7,8-DHF treatment on PLP levels in hippocampal neurons, we chose short-term incubation conditions (45 min, 20 µM) to avoid possible secondary effects of the inhibitor. As expected, the acute effect of 7,8-DHF treatment in WT cells was much more subtle (⁓9% increase in total PLP) than the impact of long-term PDXP-deficiency (441.3 ± 62.6 nmol PLP/g protein in DMSO solvent control-treated cells versus 482.7 ± 130.4 nmol PLP/g protein in 7,8-DHF treated cells; data are mean values ± S.E. of <italic>n</italic>=4 independent experiments). However, this effect is likely underestimated because only the PDXP-accessible pool of non-protein-bound PLP may be impacted by 7,8-DHF (see <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref></bold>). Due to the limited number of available hippocampal neurons, we were unfortunately unable to obtain sufficient quantities of protein-depleted PLP pools to address this question.</p>
<p>Acute changes in the PLP/PL ratio may be a more sensitive indicator of PDXP activity than changes in total PLP levels alone, because PDXP inhibition is expected to increase cellular levels of PLP (the PDXP substrate) and to concomitantly decrease the levels of PL (the product of PDXP phosphatase activity). The PLP/PL ratio is also independent of the exact protein concentration in a given extract of hippocampal neurons, thus optimizing comparability between samples. As shown in <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref></bold>, 7,8-DHF significantly increased the PLP/PL ratio in PDXP-WT, but not in PDXP-KO hippocampal neurons (+18% versus +1% compared to the respective DMSO controls). Together, these data indicate that 7,8-DHF can modulate cellular PLP levels in a PDXP-dependent manner and validate PDXP as a 7,8-DHF target in primary hippocampal neurons.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>PLP deficiency has been associated with human brain disorders for decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>), yet causal links remain unclear. Aside from vitamin B6 administration, pharmacological strategies to elevate intracellular PLP levels are lacking. Here, we identify 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) as a direct PDXP inhibitor that increases PLP levels in hippocampal neurons, validating PDXP as a druggable target to control intracellular PLP levels in the brain. We also present a high-resolution 7,8-DHF/PDXP co-crystal structure that could facilitate the design of more potent, efficacious, and selective PDXP inhibitors in the future. Such molecules might improve the control of intracellular PLP levels and help to elucidate a possible contribution of PLP to the pathophysiology of brain disorders. Our observation that the expression of PDXP is substantially upregulated in hippocampi of middle-aged mice suggests that a therapeutic vitamin B6 supplementation alone may not suffice to elevate intracellular PLP levels under conditions where the PLP-degrading phosphatase is hyperactive.</p>
<p>The discovery of 7,8-DHF as a direct PDXP inhibitor was unexpected. Interestingly, numerous in vivo studies have reported the effectiveness of 7,8-DHF in brain disorder models, including rodent models of Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>), depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>), schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>), or epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>), as well as in rodent models of autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>). Although PLP deficiency is thought to contribute to the respective human conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>), PLP-dependent processes have not yet been considered in the context of 7,8-DHF-induced effects.</p>
<p>7,8-DHF was initially discovered as a small-molecule TrkB agonist with BDNF-mimetic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>). BDNF, a high-affinity TrkB ligand, is an important neuropeptide for nervous system function and pathology. Consensus is emerging that BDNF plays a key role in the treatment response to neuropsychiatric drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Therapeutics that target BDNF/TrkB-signaling are thus of interest as disease-modifying agents in several brain disorders. Since BDNF does not cross the blood-brain barrier, attempts have been made to develop small molecule BDNF mimetics. Several candidates have been reported, including 7,8-DHF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>). Nevertheless, the on-target selectivity and efficacy of these compounds is actively debated. Using quantitative and direct assays to measure TrkB dimerization and activation, TrkB downstream signaling pathways, TrkB-dependent gene expression and cytoprotection, 7,8-DHF and other reported small-molecule TrkB agonists failed to activate TrkB in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). An electrophysiological study in acute hippocampal slice preparations demonstrated that 7,8-DHF potentiates hippocampal mossy fiber-CA3 synaptic transmission in a TrkB receptor-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>). Overall, it appears that the mechanism of action of 7,8-DHF is incompletely understood, but 7,8-DHF targets other than TrkB so far have remained elusive. The identification of 7,8-DHF as a PDXP inhibitor reported here indicates that this flavone may modulate vitamin B6-dependent processes and suggests that PDXP could be explored as a pharmacological entry point into brain disorders.</p>

<title>Preparation of hippocampi and hippocampal neurons and immunocytochemistry</title>
<p>Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and brains were immediately placed on a pre-cooled metal plate and dissected under a Leica M80 binocular (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Hippocampi were weighed and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The entire procedure was performed in &lt;3 min. Hippocampal lysates were prepared by the addition of ice-cold PBS (200 µL PBS/10 mg hippocampal wet weight) and homogenized for 1 min in a TissueLyser II instrument (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). One fourth of the obtained volume of each lysate was used for the analysis of total PLP concentrations as described below. To determine protein-depleted PLP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), the remaining volume of each lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4°C.

The flow-through was collected and prepared for HPLC analysis (see below).</p>
<p>Primary hippocampal neuronal cultures were prepared from mouse embryos at embryonic day 17. Hippocampi were incubated with 0.5 mg/mL trypsin, 0.2 mg/mL EDTA and 10 µg/mL DNase I in PBS for 30 min at 37°C. Trypsinization was stopped by adding 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were dissociated by trituration, counted, and seeded at a density of 150,000 cells per 35 mm dish. Dissociated cells were grown in neurobasal medium supplemented with L-glutamine and B27 supplement (A3582801, Life Technologies, Dreieich, Germany) with an exchange of 50% of the medium after 6 days in culture. After 21 days of differentiation (day in vitro 21/DIV21), 7,8-DHF (20 µM) or DMSO (0.02%, v/v) was added to the hippocampal neuronal cultures for 45 min. Cells were rinsed once with PBS (37°C), lysed in 150 µL ice cold H<sub>2</sub>O, and placed at -80°C for at least 30 min.</p>
<p>For immunocytochemistry, DIV21 primary hippocampal neurons were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min at RT.

Cells were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-MAP2 antibodies (1:500 dilution, clone MAB3418, Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) for 1 h in 5% goat serum/PBS at 22°C.

<title>IC<sub>50</sub> determinations, enzyme kinetics, and compound selectivity</title>
<p>Buffer conditions for enzymatic assays were as previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Purified phosphatases were pre-incubated for 10 min at RT with serial dilutions of flavones. Dephosphorylation reactions were started by the addition of the indicated substrate; buffer with substrate and the respective flavone but without the enzyme served as a background control. Prior to compound testing, time courses of inorganic phosphate release from the respective phosphatase substrates were conducted to ensure assay linearity. Inorganic phosphate release was detected with malachite green solution (Biomol Green; Enzo Life Sciences, Lörrach, Germany); the absorbance at 620 nm (A<sub>620</sub>) was measured on an Envision 2104 multilabel reader (Perkin Elmer, Rodgau, Germany). Released phosphate was determined by converting the values to nmol P<sub>i</sub> with a phosphate standard curve. Data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism version 9.5.1 (GraphPad, Boston/Massachusetts, USA). For IC<sub>50</sub> determinations, log<sub>inhibitor</sub> versus response was calculated (four parameter). To derive K<sub>M</sub> and k<sub>cat</sub> values, data were fitted by nonlinear regression to the Michaelis-Menten equation.</p>

<title>Biolayer interferometry (BLI)</title>
<p>PDXP was biotinylated using the EZ-Link NHS-PEG4-Biotin kit, as recommended by the manufacturer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and loaded on Super Streptavidin Biosensors (SSA) (Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany) as follows. SSA sensors were equilibrated for 1 h at RT in BLI assay buffer (250 mM triethanolamine, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 250 mM NaCl, 0.005% (v/v) TWEEN-20; pH 7.5), loaded with 200 µg/mL biotinylated PDXP, blocked with 2 µg/mL biocytin, and washed in BLI assay buffer. Reference SSA sensors were blocked with 2 µg/mL biocytin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>). Six point 1:1 serial dilution series of 7,8-DHF and 5,7-DHF were prepared in DMSO, and BLI assay buffer was added to the wells to obtain a 7,8-DHF starting concentration of 25 µM. The final DMSO concentration was 5% (v/v). Buffers for baseline, dissociation, and buffer correction wells were supplemented with the same amount of DMSO for identical buffer conditions. Four measurements were carried out per condition, using one sensor set for two measurements. All measurements were conducted on an Octet K2 device (Sartorius) using 96-well plates. Assay settings were as follows: baseline measurement 45 sec, association time 90 sec, dissociation time 150 sec. The resulting data were processed using the double reference method of the Octet analysis software for removal of drifts and well-to-well artefacts. Kinetic analyses were performed using the Octet analysis software. The steady state analysis was carried out with OriginPro 2021b (OriginLab, Northampton/Massachusetts, USA), using a dose-response model for regression.</p>

<title>PDXP crystallization and data collection</title>
<p>For co-crystallization with 7,8-DHF, full-length murine PDXP (10 mg/mL in 50 mM triethanolamine; 250 mM NaCl; 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>; pH 7.4) was supplemented with a three-fold molar excess of the flavone. Prism-shaped crystals of 7,8-DHF-bound PDXP were grown at 20°C in 0.1 M phosphate citrate (pH 4.2) and 40% (v/v) PEG 300 using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method. Crystals were cryoprotected for flash-cooling in liquid nitrogen by soaking in mother liquor 25% (v/v) glycerol. Diffraction data were collected from flash-cooled crystals after addition of 25% glycerol at a temperature of 100 K on beamline BL 14.1 at the BESSY (Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin, Germany) synchrotron.

These results are <bold>important</bold> since they offer an alternative mechanism for the effects of 7,8 dihdroxyflavone in cognitive improvement in several mouse models. This paper is also significant due to the interest in the phosphatases and neurodegeneration fields.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Zink et al set out to identify selective inhibitors of the pyridoxal phosphatase (PDXP). Previous studies had demonstrated improvements in cognition upon removal of PDXP, and here the authors reveal that this correlates with an increase in pyridoxal phosphate (PLP; PDXP substrate and an active coenzyme form of vitamin B6) with age. Since several pathologies are associated with decreased vitamin B6, the authors propose that PDXP is an attractive therapeutic target in the prevention/treatment of cognitive decline. Following high throughput and secondary small molecule screens, they identify two selective inhibitors. They follow up on 7, 8 dihydroxyflavone (DHF). Following structure-activity relationship and selectivity studies, the authors then solve a co-crystal structure of 7,8 DHF bound to the active site of PDXP, supporting a competitive mode of PDXP inhibition. Finally, they find that treating hippocampal neurons with 7,8 DHF increases PLP levels in a WT but not PDXP KO context. The authors note that 7,8 DHF has been used in numerous rodent neuropathology models to improve outcomes. 7, 8 DHF activity was previously attributed to activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase TrkB, although this appears to be controversial. The present study raises the possibility that it instead/also acts through modulation of PLP levels via PDXP, and is an important area for future work.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The strengths of the work are in the comprehensive, thorough, and unbiased nature of the analyses revealing the potential for therapeutic intervention in a number of pathologies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Potential weaknesses include the poor solubility of 7,8 DHF that might limit its bioavailability given its relatively low potency (IC50= 0.8 uM), which was not improved by SAR. However, the compound has an extended residence time and the co-crystal structure could aid the design of more potent molecules and would be of interest to those in the pharmaceutical industry. The images related to crystal structure could be improved.</p>

<p>Summary: In this study, the authors performed a screening for PDXP inhibitors to identify compounds that could increase levels of pyridoxal 5'- phosphate (PLP), the co-enzymatically active form of vitamin B6. For the screening of inhibitors, they first evaluated a library of about 42,000 compounds for activators and inhibitors of PDXP and secondly, they validated the inhibitor compounds with a counter-screening against PGP, a close PDXP relative. The final narrowing down to 7,8-DHF was done using PLP as a substrate and confirmed the efficacy of this flavonoid as an inhibitor of PDXP function. Physiologically, the authors show that, by acutely treating isolated wild-type hippocampal neurons with 7,8-DHF they could detect an increase in the ratio of PLP/PL compared to control cultures. This effect was not seen in PDXP KO neurons.</p>
<p>Strengths: The screening and validation of the PDXP inhibitors have been done very well because the authors have performed crystallographic analysis, a counter screening, and mutation analysis. This is very important because such rigor has not been applied to the original report of 7,8 DHF as an agonist for TrkB. Which is why there is so much controversy on this finding.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: As mentioned in the summary report the study may benefit from some in vivo analysis of PLP levels following 7,8-DHF treatment, although I acknowledge that it may be challenging because of the working out of the dosage and timing of the procedure.</p>

<p>This is interesting biology. Vitamin B6 deficiency has been linked to cognitive impairment. It is not clear whether supplements are effective in restoring functional B6 levels. Vitamin B6 is composed of pyridoxal compounds and their phosphorylated forms, with pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP) being of particular importance. The levels of PLP are determined by the balance between pyridoxal kinase and phosphatase activities. The authors are testing the hypothesis that inhibition of pyridoxal phosphatase (PDXP) would arrest the age-dependent decline in PLP, offering an alternative therapeutic strategy to supplements. Published data illustrating that ablation of the Pdxp gene in mice led to increases in PLP levels and improvement in learning and memory trials are consistent with this hypothesis.</p>
<p>In this report, the authors conduct a screen of a library of ~40k small molecules and identify 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (DHF) as a candidate PDXP inhibitor. They present an initial characterization of this micromolar inhibitor, including a co-crystal structure of PDXP and 7,8-DHF. In addition, they demonstrate that treatment of cells with 7,8 DHP increases PLP levels. Overall, this study provides further validation of PDXP as a therapeutic target for the treatment of disorders associated with vitamin B6 deficiency and provides proof-of-concept for inhibition of the target with small-molecule drug candidates.</p>
<p>Strengths include the biological context, the focus on an interesting and under-studied class of protein phosphatases that includes several potential therapeutic targets, and the identification of a small molecule inhibitor that provides proof-of-concept for a new therapeutic strategy. Overall, the study has the potential to be an important development for the phosphatase field in general.</p>
<p>Weaknesses include the fact that the compound is very much an early-stage screening hit. It is an inhibitor with micromolar potency for which mechanisms of action other than inhibition of PDXP have been reported. Extensive further development will be required to demonstrate convincingly the extent to which its effects in cells are due to on-target inhibition of PDXP.</p>
