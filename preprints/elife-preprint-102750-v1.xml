<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Hybridization is common among lineages in the genus <italic>Bos</italic>, often mediated through human management for the selection of adaptive or desirable traits. A recent example is the American Beefalo cattle breed, which was developed in the 1970s and defined as a hybrid between American bison (<italic>Bison bison</italic>) and cattle (<italic>Bos taurus</italic>). The American Beefalo Association typically require ⅜ bison ancestry to qualify as Beefalo. Here, we sought to characterize admixed ancestry among Beefalo as a component of a larger project to understand the role of hybridization in shaping present-day diversity in bison and cattle. We generated genomic data from 50 historical and present-day Beefalo and bison hybrids, including several important founding animals, as well as from 10 bison originating from commercial herds that represent potential sources of bison ancestry in Beefalo. We found that most Beefalo did not contain detectable bison ancestry. No individual Beefalo within our data set satisfies the ancestry requirements specified by the American Beefalo Association (ABA), although several Beefalo had smaller proportions of bison ancestry (2-18%). Some beefalo had detectable indicine cattle ancestry (2-38%), suggesting that hybridization of taurine and zebu cattle may contribute to morphological similarity between some Beefalo and bison. Overall, ancestry profiles of Beefalo and bison hybrid genomes are consistent with repeated backcrossing to either parental species rather than the breeding between hybrids themselves, implying significant barriers to gene flow between bison and cattle. Our results call into question the ⅜ bison ancestry targeted by the breed association and demonstrate the value of genomic information in examining claims of interspecies gene flow among <italic>Bos</italic> species.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Gene flow has been common among lineages within the genus <italic>Bos</italic>, including among cattle (<italic>Bos taurus</italic>), bison (<italic>Bison bison</italic>), yak (<italic>Bos mutus</italic>), and gaur (<italic>Bos gaurus</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wu et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zhang et al. 2020</xref>). Much of this gene flow was facilitated by human livestock management and breeding. For example, hybridization led to gene flow between taurine (<italic>Bos taurus</italic>) and indicine (zebu; <italic>Bos indicus</italic>) cattle breeds in the Near East during the Bronze Age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Verdugo et al. 2019</xref>), and later in Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kim et al. 2020</xref>) and North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">McTavish et al. 2013</xref>). Human-mediated gene flow also occurred between more deeply diverged <italic>Bos</italic> lineages, including Chinese cattle and banteng (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al. 2018</xref>) and yak and Tibetan cattle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wu et al. 2018</xref>). In each case, gene flow is believed to have conferred genetic benefits that led to easier management of hybrid herds or enabled adaptation to local environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zhang et al. 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>While admixture is common among <italic>Bos</italic> lineages, genomic incompatibilities often induce reproductive challenges to the hybrids. These incompatibilities are probably due to the considerable divergences across the <italic>Bos</italic> clade, with the oldest split between cattle and the other lineages dating to around three million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Wang et al. 2018</xref>). Except for hybrids of taurine and indicine cattle, hybrids of all other <italic>Bos</italic> species follow Haldane’s rule, in which male offspring of F1 crosses are sterile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zhang et al. 2020</xref>). While taurine-indicine cattle hybrids are fertile, hybrid African cattle have uneven proportions of indicine nuclear and mitochondrial ancestry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kwon et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ward et al. 2022</xref>), which may be due to mitonuclear incompatibilities. Analysis of the dynamics of speciation and recurrent gene flow among <italic>Bos</italic> would improve understanding of the evolutionary process of species divergence.</p>
<p>Beefalo are a purported example of interspecies <italic>Bos</italic> hybridization. The American Beefalo Association (ABA) defines Beefalo as a stable hybrid cross with ⅝ cattle and ⅜ bison ancestry (“American Beefalo Association”). The Beefalo breed was established in the early 1970s by Mr. D.C. “Bud” Basolo, a cattle rancher from California, through complex interbreeding of bison and cattle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Miller 1982</xref>). The establishment of this breed followed a long history of attempts to crossbreed bison and cattle for commercial production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Boyd 1908</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Goodnight 1914</xref>). As early 20th century breeders had been unable to create a viable hybrid population due to reproductive difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Deakin et al. 1942</xref>), the establishment of the beefalo breed was both surprising and celebrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Miller 1982</xref>; “Business” 1973).</p>
<p>Basolo did not reveal the pedigree for his original Beefalo, but subsequent analyses had allowed better understanding of the breed origins. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Paim et al. 2020</xref>) illustrated two pedigree approaches that could create a 3/8 – 5/8 combination, both of which require first generation hybrid males to be fertile. However, analyses of Beefalo karyotypes showed that all Beefalo possess taurine Y chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lenoir and Lichtenberger 1978</xref>), such that the initial cross would have to have been a bison cow and a taurine bull. Intriguingly, Stormont et al. used blood typing to show that foundational Beefalo almost completely lack bison-specific markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Stormont et al. 1986</xref>), although the authors believed that bison ancestry became more prevalent in subsequent generations. Beefalo ancestry has not, however, been evaluated with genomic information, despite that the breed was granted a special roll stamp for voluntary federal inspection by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA, 1984, 9 CFR part 352) and the ongoing sale and purchase of pedigreed animals.</p>
<p>Here, we present results of the first genome-wide investigation of the ancestry composition of the Beefalo breed. We generate whole-genome shotgun (WGS) data from 47 Beefalo, three bison hybrids reported to carry majority bison ancestry, and ten commercial bison that represent a source of bison ancestry in Beefalo, and co-analyze this data along with publicly available genomes from a range of bovids. These samples were donated to the USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) National Animal Germplasm Program (NAGP) collection and include ancestors from the early establishment of the breed, such as Joe’s Pride, a foundational Beefalo bull that Mr. Basolo sold to a Canadian breeder’s firm for $2.5 million in 1975 (“Most Expensive Cattle”). We find that most Beefalo, including key founding individuals, contain no detectable bison ancestry, while bison hybrids have approximately their reported bison ancestry. Indicine cattle ancestry is common among Beefalo, suggesting that breeding with indicine cattle, which share a number of phenotypic similarities with bison in commercially-relevant traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Zeder 2006</xref>), was an early strategy in the establishment of the Beefalo breed. Finally, we find that some Beefalo contain small amounts of bison ancestry, ranging from 2-18%. While this is less bison ancestry than the targeted 37.5%, these genomes prove that bison and cattle can hybridize in some circumstances. However, we always infer minor parental ancestry to be in a heterozygous state, providing evidence only of backcrossing to either parent, rather than of breeding between hybrids themselves. This is inconsistent with a scenario in which a stable bison-cattle hybrid Beefalo population had been established.</p>

<title>Sequencing Beefalo genomes</title>
<p>We generated genomic data from 47 registered Beefalo and three bison hybrids using preserved semen samples. Beefalo semen samples were obtained from the USDA, ARS, NAGP (Supplementary Table 1). Most of the NAGP Beefalo samples were collected during the 1970s and 80s, around the time when the breed was founded, and donated to NAGP around 2007. We retrieved bison ancestry composition for each sample from metadata accompanying NAGP samples. These 50 Beefalo and bison hybrids had reported bison ancestry ranging from 75% in a bison hybrid to 12.5% in several Beefalo, with the bison ancestry of most Beefalo reported as the breed-standard 37.5%. We sequenced each sample to 2.7x median genomic coverage (range: 1.1-39x; Supplementary Table 1). Seven prominent Beefalo were selected for higher coverage sequencing (&gt;30x), including animals from the Basolo foundation herds and others with different proportions of reported bison ancestry.</p>
<p>We generated high coverage (&gt;17.5x) genomes of ten bison from commercial herds (Supplementary Table 1). We added these to a larger data set of previously published bison genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Yang et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Stroupe et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wu et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Shirazi et al. 2022</xref>) and genomes from several breeds of zebu and taurine cattle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Heaton et al. 2016</xref>); Supplementary Table 1), as well as the genome of Buzz, an F1 Yellowstone bison-Simmental cattle hybrid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Oppenheimer et al. 2021</xref>). Our final data set included 41 bison, 26 cattle, and 51 Beefalo and bison hybrid genomes. For some analyses we also incorporated published genomes from outgroups, including yak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Qiu et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">2015</xref>), gaur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Heaton et al. 2016</xref>), banteng (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Heaton et al. 2016</xref>), and water buffalo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Sun et al. 2020</xref>).</p>

<title>Estimating bison ancestry in Beefalo</title>
<p>Most Beefalo samples cluster with taurine cattle in principal component analysis (PCA) conducted on bison and both cattle subspecies, indicating they do not contain appreciable bison ancestry (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). This includes several foundational individuals, such as Joe’s Pride (NAGP5887). The first principal component (PC1) separates bison from cattle, with the F1 hybrid Buzz falling halfway along this axis, while PC2 distinguishes taurine and indicine cattle. While most Beefalo samples cluster with taurine cattle, bison hybrids (&gt;50% bison ancestry) fall in an intermediate position between bison and cattle (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). These hybrids are closer to bison than is Buzz, confirming their majority bison ancestry. The few Beefalo that are slightly shifted toward bison in the PCA are unlikely to contain the breed-standard 37.5% bison ancestry (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>, C). Beefalo formed a cline between taurine and indicine cattle on PC2, suggesting indicine ancestry is a widespread and variable ancestry component found in Beefalo.</p>

<p>One animal (NAGP9109) fell entirely within the indicine cluster and is likely of 100% indicine origin. The reported pedigree in the NAGP for this animal lists its composition as ½ Brahman, ¼ Charolais, ⅛ bison, 1/16th Hereford, and 1/16th Shorthorn, but the American Brahman Breeders Association records this animal (#309519) as purebred Brahman. We believe NAGP9109 was erroneously labeled as Beefalo by the contributors. This result highlights that PCA analyses of even low coverage genomes can uncover inconsistencies between genomic ancestry and animal metadata.</p>
<p>An unsupervised ADMIXTURE analysis supports the conclusion that most Beefalo have no bison ancestry. This analysis estimates the ancestry profiles present across all bison, cattle, bison hybrid, and Beefalo individuals examined for a given value of <italic>K</italic> source populations. At <italic>K</italic> = 3, bison, taurine cattle, and indicine cattle are divided into homogenous groups, with Beefalo assigned variable levels of these three ancestry types, mirroring the major patterns seen in the PCA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). As in the PCA, bison-cattle hybrid backcrosses have bison ancestry estimates consistent with their pedigrees, while most of the sampled Beefalo, including Basolo founding individuals, possess no bison ancestry. Eight of the 47 registered Beefalo tested are, however, inferred to have a small amount (&lt;18%) of bison ancestry, although less than was indicated by pedigrees and well below the breed standard defined by the ABA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). These eight individuals are those shifted toward bison in PCA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The unsupervised ADMIXTURE analysis correctly assigned the F1 bison-Simmental genome equal amounts of taurine and bison ancestry, demonstrating that this analysis is sensitive to the presence of large fractions of bison ancestry. Supervised ADMIXTURE clustering, which models Beefalo ancestry as coming specifically from bison, taurine, and indicine source panels, provides similar estimates to those obtained from the unsupervised ADMIXTURE analysis (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>).</p>
<p>Tests for excess allele sharing between Beefalo and bison relative to taurine cattle confirmed the results from PCA and ADMIXTURE, underscoring that most Beefalo have no appreciable bison ancestry, while those that do have bison ancestry have far less than that reported. <italic>D</italic>-statistics of the form <italic>D(taurus, Beefalo; bison, water buffalo)</italic>, which test whether Beefalo share more alleles with bison than taurine cattle, are consistent with 0 for most individual Beefalo, although the same eight Beefalo identified in PCA and ADMIXTURE as having bison ancestry also have an excess of bison alleles, confirming their bison ancestry (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). f4-ratios estimate that these Beefalo derive between 2-18% of their genomes from bison (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), consistent with estimates from ADMIXTURE and less than their reported bison ancestry, which ranged from 37.5-50%. <italic>D</italic>-statistics also confirm that many individual Beefalo have significantly more indicine alleles than is found in taurine breeds, demonstrating that indicine ancestry is widespread across Beefalo (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Excess affinity with indicine cattle is observed in many Beefalo individuals with no evidence of bison ancestry, suggesting that allele sharing with bison, which are deeply diverged from both taurine and indicine cattle, is detectable even in the presence of indicine ancestry, and vice versa.</p>

<p>Local ancestry inference across individual Beefalo and bison-cattle hybrid genomes provides similar estimates of overall Beefalo ancestry, inferring an absence of bison ancestry across most Beefalo (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). In Beefalo with bison ancestry, that ancestry tends to be present in large contiguous blocks, often tens of megabases in size, indicative of recent admixture (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A,B</xref>). Bison ancestry in Beefalo is always found in a heterozygous state, consistent with a scenario in which these individuals are the product of repeated backcrossing of an initial F1 hybrid to cattle. Most Beefalo also have indicine ancestry (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>), which, as with bison ancestry, is found in large blocks, but with many smaller blocks than seen with bison ancestry, suggesting that more generations have passed since the initial onset of hybridization (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p>

<p>Several lines of evidence attest to the efficacy of using these source panels for modeling ancestry. The F1 bison-taurine cattle hybrid was inferred to be almost entirely heterozygous for bison and taurine cattle across the genome (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>) demonstrating the sensitivity of this approach to distinguishing diploid ancestry states between these groups. Further, the method assigned largely uniform and correct ancestry proportions to individual bison and cattle that were not part of the source panels, while Brangus cattle, a known taurine-indicine hybrid breed, were assigned large fractions of ancestry to both cattle groups in the expected amounts (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). For the seven Beefalo sequenced to high coverage, we also modeled ancestry using downsampled read counts and called genotypes, which yielded nearly identical results (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Beefalo sex chromosomal ancestry</title>
<p>Analyses of sex chromosomes reveal that the main mechanism for introducing bison ancestry into Beefalo was breeding with bison bulls. Most Beefalo have Y chromosomes associated with taurine cattle, while the bison hybrid backcrosses have bison Y chromosomes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Further, those Beefalo with evidence of bison ancestry have less bison ancestry on X chromosomes compared to autosomes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A,C</xref>). This is the opposite of what would be expected if bison ancestry were introduced maternally, which would result in an excess of bison rather than cattle ancestry on the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lenoir and Lichtenberger 1978</xref>). Unfortunately, as semen was the source of genomic DNA, we could not assemble mitochondrial genomes to assess whether the Beefalo maternal line would provide any additional insight into these patterns.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Only eight of the 47 Beefalo that we sampled contained detectable bison ancestry, and those eight had substantially less (2-18%) than the 37.5% specified as the breed standard set by the ABA. Our samples represent a complete survey of individuals in the USDA NAGP biobank, and include important foundational animals, such as those from original Basolo herds. Notably, important foundational individuals, including Joe’s Pride (NAGP5887), which was sold for $2.5 million to a Canadian breeders group (“Most Expensive Cattle”), lack bison ancestry. While these results show that interbreeding between bison and cattle is possible, they also prove bison ancestry encompasses a much smaller portion of the Beefalo breed than has been claimed.</p>
<p>Our finding of little to no bison ancestry in founding Beefalo individuals is aligned with challenges hybridizing <italic>Bison</italic> and <italic>Bos</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Goodnight 1914</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Murdoch 2018</xref>). Artificial insemination of taurine cows with bison semen results in 77% calf mortality and sterile male calves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anstey 1986</xref>). In fact, Canadian government research reported that no functional males carrying more than 12.5% bison ancestry were ever observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brower 2008</xref>). In Beefalo individuals with bison ancestry, such ancestry was found exclusively in a heterozygous state, implying that repeated backcrossing to parental species, rather than breeding of hybrids themselves. A depletion of bison ancestry on the X chromosome and the presence of taurine Y chromosomes in all Beefalo, with bison hybrids exclusively having bison Y haplotypes, is consistent with this scenario. Therefore, it seems that extensive reproductive barriers exist to establishing a hybrid bison-cattle population.</p>
<p>While bison ancestry was surprisingly underrepresented in our Beefalo sample, nearly half of the Beefalo genomes we sequenced contained some zebu cattle ancestry, suggesting zebu/taurine interbreeding may have been used as a mechanism to manipulate the Beefalo phenotype. Zebu cattle are known for heat and drought tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kumar et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Vajana et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hansen 2004</xref>), lower nutritional demands relative to taurine cattle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hunter and Siebert 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hennessy, Williamson, and Darnell 2000</xref>) and their humped appearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Heath 1979</xref>), and so share a number of desirable attributes with bison. The Beefalo breed standard does not require cattle ancestry to be of taurine origin, though if early breeders intentionally incorporated indicine ancestry while creating the breed, they left this detail out of the animals’ reported pedigrees. For example, the Basolo founder individual Joe’s Pride has a recorded pedigree that attests Hereford, Charolais, and bison (37.5%) ancestry, but we estimated that he had ∼10.5% zebu ancestry.</p>
<p>This study is the first examination of Beefalo ancestry using whole genome data, but it is not the first to question claims surrounding bison ancestry in the breed. In an investigation of the paternal origins of Beefalo, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lenoir and Lichtenberger (1978)</xref> used karyotyping to determine that all 12 Beefalo bulls they examined had cattle Y chromosomes, in concordance with our results. While there are plausible scenarios for Beefalo with 37.5% bison ancestry to have cattle Y chromosomes, these require early-generation crosses to be fertile. In a later study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Stormont et al. (1986)</xref> used species-specific blood group markers to show that only one of the 148 Basolo Beefalo they tested had any alleles found predominantly in bison. However, they also note that some later Beefalo, separate from the initial founding herds, did display some bison-associated markers, perhaps agreeing with our finding of a small fraction of Beefalo possessing appreciable bison ancestry. Blood typing provides limited insight into ancestry proportions, however, demonstrating the utility of genomic information in validating specific breeding claims.</p>
<p>Our genome-wide analyses were primarily conducted on ∼2x coverage genomes with Beefalo samples obtained from the USDA NAGP, but we believe our Beefalo ancestry estimates are robust and representative of the breed at large. We derive highly concordant ancestry estimates across a range of approaches, including ADMIXTURE, f4-ratios, and local ancestry inference techniques, and for animals whose ancestry is known, such as an F1 bison-cattle hybrid, these methods assign the correct ancestry proportions. Additionally, we derive similar ancestry estimates in high coverage (30-42x) and downsampled data for the seven individuals we sequenced more deeply. We did not sample present-day sources of Beefalo exhaustively, instead choosing to focus largely on animals that originate at or near the founding of the breed. Beefalo herds are generally established by breeding with fullblood (37.5% bison) Beefalo individuals, rather than through backcrosses with bison (“American Beefalo Association”), so surveying breed founders is an effective way of documenting the bison ancestry across the breed. However, a larger sample of Beefalo across current producers would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the breadth and variation of bison ancestry in Beefalo.</p>
<p>The extent of gene flow and the existence of reproductive barriers among Bos species remain incompletely explored. Breeders worked throughout the 20th century to create commercially-viable bison-cattle hybrids using bulls and cows with different ancestries. All of these efforts, including Beefalo, failed to create a stable hybrid population, implying that considerable barriers to gene flow exist between these two species. Though genomic incompatibilities among bison and cattle are hinted at by these breeding efforts themselves, which reported sterility in male hybrids even after backcrossing to cattle for several generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Deakin et al. 1942</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brower 2008</xref>), they have not been detected directly. The general absence of bison ancestry in Beefalo also calls attention to several other examples of assumed gene flow among Bos species that have yet to be fully characterized. This includes introgression from cattle into wisent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wecek et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Soubrier et al. 2016</xref>) and American bison, the latter of which has been suggested to be widespread over the past two centuries and has led to the presence of cattle ancestry in all bison today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Stroupe et al. 2022</xref>; Halbert and Derr 2007), though has not been fully examined with genomic evidence.</p>

<title>Genomic data collection</title>
<p>Beefalo semen samples (n = 47) were obtained from the USDA, ARS, NAGP collection at Ft. Collins Colorado in the USA (Supplementary Table 1). The three bison hybrid semen samples were also obtained from the NAGP. Most of the NAGP samples were collected in the 1970s and 1980s, stored by breeders, and donated to NAGP circa 2007 as a geographically diverse set of Beefalo. Purebred bison meat samples (n = 10, tongue) were purchased from commercial processors and represent animals from three different commercial bison herds (Supplementary Table 1).</p>
<p>DNA was extracted from semen samples with a modified standard phenol-chloroform method. Briefly, one 0.5-ml straw of semen was diluted with 1.5 ml of a solution containing 10 mM TrisCl, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) with 1% wt/vol sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1 mg proteinase K, and 40 mM dithiothreitol. This lysis solution was incubated overnight at 37°C in a 15 ml conical tube preloaded with 2 ml of high-vacuum grease in preparation organic phase extractions. The lysed and digested solution was extracted twice with 1 vol of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and once with 1 vol of chloroform. For each extraction the sample was centrifuged for 10 minutes in a swinging bucket rotor at 3210 x g at 23C to partition the organic phase below the band of high-vacuum grease, while to the aqueous phase was held above. The DNA was precipitated with 0.1 vol of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 2 vol of 100% ethanol. The precipitated DNA was washed once in 70% ethanol, briefly air dried, and dissolved in a solution of 10 mM TrisCl, 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0). The bison tongue DNA was extracted with the Qiagen Blood and Cell Culture DNA Mini Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands).</p>
<p>We sheared extracted DNA using a Covaris ultrasonicator (Covaris, Inc. Woburn, MA) prepared into Illumina sequencing libraries using either the NEB Ultra II FS kit (NEB, Ipswich, MA) or the TruSeq PCR-free DNA kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA). We quantified libraries with a Qubit fluorometer using the 1x HS kit (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) or, for PCR-free libraries, via qPCR with the Kapa Complete Universal Kit (Roche Sequencing, Santa Clara, CA). Library fragment length distribution was assessed using either a Tapestation 2200 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) or a Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical Technologies Inc., Ames, IA). For whole genome sequence (WGS), 1 μg of genomic DNA was fragmented and used to make indexed, 350 bp, paired-end libraries.</p>
<p>Beefalo and bison libraries were sequenced with Illumina instruments using 2 × 150 bp paired-end kits, either on the NovaSeq 6000 for bison or on the NextSeq 2000 platform for Beefalo and bison hybrids.</p>

<title>Variant Calling</title>
<p>Remnant adapter sequences were trimmed from reads using Trimmomatic (v0.39) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bolger, Lohse, and Usadel 2014</xref>), requiring a minimum length of 30bp. Trimmed reads were then mapped to the cattle genome ARS-UCD1.2 with the Y chromosome from Btau5.1 appended (ARS-UCD1.2_Btau5.0.1Y) using BWA (v0.7.17-r1188) mem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Li 2013</xref>) with default parameters, except for 9 Beefalo samples that were mapped with BWA aln (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Li and Durbin 2009</xref>). These samples had a lower fraction of reads that were properly paired, with higher rates of interchromosomal mapping within read pairs, possibly suggesting chimera formation. As BWA aln conducts end-to-end alignment, it mitigates the effects of any spurious mapping of incompletely clipped chimeric sequences. Duplicate reads were removed with Picard MarkDuplicates (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/">https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/</ext-link>).</p>
<p>We called genotypes in four medium-to-high coverage (&gt;10x) gaur genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Heaton et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Verdugo et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wu et al. 2018</xref>) using GATK HaplotypeCaller (v4.1.8.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">DePristo et al. 2011</xref>) to ascertain a set of variants from an outgroup to both cattle and bison for use in downstream analyses. Variants were filtered variants for a minimum genotype quality of 30 and minimum and maximum depths of 1/3rd and 2x the mean coverage on a per-sample basis. We also performed mappability filtering with SNPable (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://lh3lh3.users.sourceforge.net/snpable.shtml">https://lh3lh3.users.sourceforge.net/snpable.shtml</ext-link>), using a <italic>k</italic>-mer length of 35 and stringency of 0.5 (gen_mask -l 35 -r 0.5).This yielded a set of 5.29M high-quality autosomal variants.</p>
<p>To accommodate the low sequencing depth we obtained from most Beefalo, we used psuedohaploid genotypes, in which a random read covering each gaur-ascertained variant was selected to represent genotypes at those sites. This approach mitigates biases arising from differential coverage across individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barlow et al. 2020</xref>). Pseudohaploid genotypes were called for all individuals using PileupCaller using samtools (v1.9) mpileup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Li et al. 2009</xref>) with BAQ disabled (-B) and pileupCaller (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/stschiff/sequenceTools.git">https://github.com/stschiff/sequenceTools.git</ext-link>), requiring a minimum map quality of 25 and minimum base quality of 30.</p>

<title>Modeling Beefalo ancestry</title>
<p>We visualized the relationships of Beefalo and bison hybrid individuals to bison and cattle using a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA was conducted by computing principal components with <italic>smartpca</italic> (v18140) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Patterson, Price, and Reich 2006</xref>) using medium and high coverage bison, taurine cattle, and indicine cattle, and then projecting all Beefalo and bison hybrids onto these axes, using our set of pseudohaploid genotypes. This approach allows for directly understanding the ancestry of Beefalo individuals relative to these three groups while mitigating the effects of the low sequencing depth obtained for many Beefalo.</p>
<p>We used ADMIXTURE (v1.3.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alexander, Novembre, and Lange 2009</xref>) to further model Beefalo ancestry. ADMIXTURE was run both in supervised and unsupervised modes, using the pseudohaploid dataset filtered for missingness (--geno 0.5) and minor allele frequency (--maf 0.05), and pruned for linkage disequilibrium (--indep-pairwise 50 5 0.5) using plink (v1.9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chang et al. 2015</xref>). Cross-validation was used to select the optimal value of K. For the supervised ADMIXTURE analysis, Beefalo and bison hybrid ancestry was fit as potentially coming from bison, taurine, or indicine sources.</p>
<p>We also sought to investigate Beefalo ancestry on the sex chromosomes. For the X chromosome, we used males from the overall set of samples and ran ADMIXTURE in haploid mode. We estimated the Y chromosomal phylogeny using males in the sample set with several additional species added as outgroups, including yaks, European bison, gaur, and banteng. The phylogeny was estimated with IQ-TREE (1.6.12) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Nguyen et al. 2015</xref>), using the GTR+ASC model and obtaining branch support values using ultrafast bootstrapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hoang et al. 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>After exploring overall autosomal Beefalo ancestry using model-free (PCA) and model-based (ADMIXTURE) approaches, we sought to specifically test for the presence of bison ancestry in Beefalo and bison hybrid genomes. The D-statistic <italic>D(Beefalo, taurus; bison, water buffalo)</italic> was used for this, which tests for excess allele sharing between Beefalo and bison, relative to taurine cattle, with water buffalo as an outgroup.</p>
<p>We had observed that Beefalo formed a cline between taurine and indicine cattle in PCA, so we also used the statistic <italic>D(Beefalo, taurus; indicus, water buffalo)</italic> to test for indicine ancestry among individual Beefalo. Finally, we quantified the proportion of bison ancestry in Beefalo genomes using the f4-ratio <italic>f4(yak, water buffalo; Beefalo, taurine)/f4(yak, water buffalo; bison, taurine)</italic>, which estimates the proportion of ancestry, α, in Beefalo that comes from a divergent lineage related to yak (the closest outgroup to bison). D- and <italic>f-</italic>statistics were calculated using ADMIXTOOLS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Maier et al. 2023</xref>) for each individual Beefalo and bison hybrid, grouping bison and taurine and indicine cattle.</p>

<sec id="s4d">
<title>Locating segments of differential ancestry within Beefalo</title>
<p>Diploid ancestry state across individual Beefalo genomes was modeled as coming from bison and cattle-related sources by using AncestryHMM (v1.0.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Corbett-Detig and Nielsen 2017</xref>). We used medium-to-high coverage genomes (&gt;10x) from bison (n=20), taurine cattle (n=20), and zebu (n=6) each as source panels. We called genotypes for each species separately using the same filtering procedure as with our outgroup-ascertained variants. We then merged these panels, requiring sites to be called in at least 6 bison, 6 taurine cattle, and 3 zebu, have a frequency difference of at least 90% between the two source panels, and be at least 500bp from the nearest variant. This gave a final set of 2.32M ancestry informative markers. We modeled local ancestry across the genome for each Beefalo using AncestryHMM with the parameters ’-e 0.02 -a 3 0.02 0.90 0.08 -p 0 -5 0.02 -p 1 10000 0.98 -p 2 -20 0.08’. This models two gene flow events, one 20 generations ago from indicine cattle at 8% and the second from bison 5 generations ago at 2%, though allows the exact timing of these admixture pulses to be inferred. We used read counts at ancestry informative markers for all Beefalo as input for ancestry inference. For seven individuals which were sequenced to high coverage, we performed additional ancestry inference using both read data downsampled to ∼2x coverage and genotypes at ancestry informative positions. Genotypes at ancestry informative markers were called using GATK HaplotypeCaller. We filtered posterior ancestry probabilities using a 0.9 threshold.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study used whole genome data to investigate Beefalo ancestry for the first time. It provides insight into the genetics of Beefalo cattle, definitively challenging the long-held claim of 37.5% buffalo ancestry reported by the American Beefalo Association. This results are <bold>convincing</bold>, with a comprehensive range of well-established population genomics methods being used to estimate ancestry in these animals. This work will be of significant interest to evolutionary biologists, population geneticists, animal breeders, and those involved in the conservation genetics of bovine species.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study used whole genome data to investigate Beefalo ancestry for the first time, filling the gap in the field of Beefalo ancestry. The authors used preserved semen samples to generate genomic data on 47 registered Beefalo and 3 bison hybrids, further questioning the ABA's stated goal of ⅜ bison ancestry. In addition, the authors also show that ancestry profiles of Beefalo and bison hybrid genomes are consistent with repeated backcrossing to either parental species, demonstrating the value of genomic information in examining gene flow between species in the genus Bison. This is an interesting study that still has some major weaknesses that exist, but overall, the work demonstrates the utility of genomic information in validating specific breeding claims for a more complete understanding of gene flow and genetic variation among bovine species.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Numerous genetic analysis methods such as PCA, ADMIXTURE, F4 ratios, and local ancestry inference techniques revealed that no single Beefalo set meets the ancestry requirements set by the American Beefalo Association (ABA) and some beefalo had detectable indicine cattle ancestry.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While this study contributes to our knowledge of Beefalo ancestry, there are some key issues that need to be addressed in terms of analysing the specific results as well as writing the article.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Shapiro et al. set out to verify the American Beefalo Association's claim that Beefalo cattle possess 37.5% bison ancestry. They employ a comprehensive range of well-established population genomics methods to estimate ancestry in these hybrid populations, including PCA, ADMIXTURE, D and F statistics, and local ancestry inference. Their findings conclusively demonstrate that most Beefalo lack the claimed bison ancestry, with only 8 out of 47 samples showing any detectable bison ancestry, ranging from 2 - 18%.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The primary strength of this analysis lies in the comprehensive dataset available to the authors, which includes important foundational Beefalo individuals and various reference populations. The rigorous and multi-faceted methodological approach employs several well-established techniques in population genomics for detecting and measuring admixture. Each method used has a firm basis in the field, providing consistent and robust results. The authors' approach of using PCA to initially assess the data within a global context, followed by more specific analyses using ADMIXTURE and D-statistics, provides a clear and logical progression of evidence. The presentation of these results in figures is particularly effective, clearly illustrating the key findings of the study. Additionally, the examination of both autosomal and sex chromosome ancestry offers a more complete understanding of Beefalo genetic composition and the mechanics of bison-cattle hybridisation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>One limitation of this analysis is the relatively low coverage (~2x) of many Beefalo samples. However, the authors have taken steps to mitigate biases that may arise from this. Another weakness is the limited sampling of contemporary Beefalo populations, as the study focuses primarily on historical samples. This may limit our understanding of how Beefalo genetics may have changed over time.</p>
<p>Appraisal:</p>
<p>The authors have clearly achieved their primary aim using a rigorous and comprehensive methodology. Their extensive dataset and multi-faceted analytical approach provide strong support for their conclusions. The study not only addresses its main research question but also reveals unexpected insights into Beefalo genetics, particularly the presence of zebu ancestry.</p>
<p>Discussion:</p>
<p>This study is valuable for several reasons beyond its primary findings. First, it definitively addresses and refutes the claim of 37.5% bison ancestry in Beefalo, providing crucial information for those studying these interspecies hybrids and the viability of their offspring. Second, it reveals the unexpected presence of zebu ancestry in many Beefalo, raising intriguing questions about the breed's development and the potential role of zebu cattle in achieving desired traits. This finding suggests that the distinctive appearance of Beefalo may be due in part to zebu admixture rather than bison ancestry. Third, the study highlights the significant barriers to admixture between bison and cattle, both in controlled breeding programs and potentially in wild populations. This has important implications for conservation genetics and our understanding of gene flow between these species. Lastly, the study demonstrates the power of genomic analysis in verifying breed claims and understanding the complex history of domestic animal breeds. These findings open new avenues for research in bovine genomics, breed development, and the dynamics of interspecies hybridisation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>I really like this topic and study. But I think much can be more focused and tightened up. All the components are here - just some more refining to really make the storyline clear, the journey of discovery, and the impact of such knowledge.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors dive directly into the question of genomic ancestry as compared to the breed club's reported ancestry with heavy, quantitative data and critical analytical methods. The questioning line is direct and does not meander. The reader learns about the challenges of breeding associations, and values of understood ancestry, and presents a clear need of re-evaluating the breed standards and expectations of beefalo (if ancestry is indeed the primary goal instead of a phenotype-driven breed mission).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Much of the quantitative results are only referred to in the main text with qualitative language. Please incorporate more written quantitative results to highlight evidence that underlines the study narrative because it is quite an interesting study!</p>
