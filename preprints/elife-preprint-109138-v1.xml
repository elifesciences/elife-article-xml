<abstract>
<p>FRG1 acts as a molecular double-edged sword: while its overexpression is linked to facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), it’s under expression activates tumorigenic signalling pathways—highlighting the importance of tightly regulated FRG1 levels. Although prior studies have hinted at FRG1’s involvement in RNA biogenesis, its core molecular functions have remained largely elusive. Our previous work identified FRG1 as a transcriptional regulator of genes in the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway; however, the underlying mechanisms were not fully delineated.</p>
<p>In this study, using a range of cellular models with altered FRG1 expression, we demonstrate that reduced FRG1 levels enhance NMD activity. We reveal that FRG1 is a structural component of both the spliceosome and the exon junction complex (EJC), and that it directly modulates NMD by interacting with UPF1—regulating its ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, we show that DUX4 inversely regulates the NMD machinery through FRG1, establishing a critical molecular axis. Despite its structural association with the EJC and spliceosome, the absence of FRG1 does not compromise the integrity of these complexes. Polysome profiling showed that FRG1 co-sediments with eIF4A3, a core EJC component, across translating ribosomal fractions. This interaction was further supported by proximity ligation assays confirming the close spatial proximity of FRG1 and eIF4A3. Importantly, we validated the impact of FRG1 perturbation on NMD efficiency and UPF1 levels in vivo using a transgenic FRG1 knockout zebrafish model.</p>
<p>Together, these findings establish a direct, DUX4-independent role for FRG1 in regulating the NMD pathway and uncover a previously unrecognized function for FRG1 in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Our work provides mechanistic insight into FRG1’s molecular roles and lays the groundwork for therapeutic strategies targeting diseases associated with its dysregulation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In eukaryotic organisms, gene expression undergoes quality control at various stages. One pivotal mechanism of RNA quality control is the Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. NMD plays a critical role in preserving cellular equilibrium by degrading messenger RNAs (mRNAs) containing premature termination codons (PTCs), thus preventing the synthesis of potentially harmful proteins. Interest in NMD has been further fuelled by the studies showing the regulation of half-life and, thereby steady-state abundance of nearly 5-10% of mammalian transcriptome having upstream open reading frame (uORFs) in the 5’UTR, presence of long 3’UTR or 3’UTR harboring an intron, presence of uORF that interferes with the expression of main ORF, and downstream EJCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. NMD is known to regulate various biological processes, including development, stress response, cell differentiation, and cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. The loss of key NMD factors-UPF1, UPF2, or SMG1-results in embryonic lethality in mice, highlighting their essential role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Evidence also suggests differential NMD activity across cell and tissue types. For instance, analysis of NMD reporters and various NMD substrates demonstrated higher NMD efficiency in HeLa cells compared to MCF7 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, RNAi-mediated depletion of NMD factors such as UPF1 or SMG1 led to DNA damage and inhibited the growth of HeLa cells, but not fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Together, these findings indicate that NMD is a highly regulated and context-dependent process.</p>
<p>The importance of NMD pathway has been highlighted as numerous genetic diseases that result from misexpression of faulty mRNAs escaping the mRNA surveillance pathway. Mutations in NMD factor UPF3B result in neurodevelopmental disorder, ADHD, autism, and schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Dysregulation of NMD factors like UPF2, UPF3A, SMG6, eIF4A3, RNPS1 results in intellectual disability (ID) disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Aberrant NMD is associated with cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. For example, mutations in UPF1 lead to inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMT) and pancreatic cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Deletion of one allele of SMG1 results in lung cancer and hematopoietic malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Upregulation of AKT results in increased cancer cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Additionally, tumors may benefit from NMD-mediated degradation by acquiring PTCs in tumor suppressor genes like WT1, TP53, RB, and BRCA1/2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>].</p>
<p>This dual role of NMD in degrading aberrant mRNAs and post transcriptionally targeting a subset of normal mRNAs is believed to occur through different pathways. Gehring et al. identified two branches of NMD - UPF2 and RNPS1 or EJC dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Subsequently, Chen et al. identified a branch of NMD pathway that is independent of UPF3B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Ultimately, the SURF complex assembles on the aberrant transcripts which are degraded via the DECID complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Despite significant progress in understanding the NMD pathway, critical gaps remain, particularly in deciphering the precise molecular mechanisms that govern its specificity and efficacy. The emerging evidence of a broader role for NMD in gene expression regulation raises pressing questions: How is the NMD response buffered? How are transcripts without PTCs selectively targeted by the NMD machinery? And, importantly, is the NMD pathway itself subject to regulatory control? Addressing these gaps is essential for a comprehensive understanding of NMD’s role in cellular processes and disease. In the past, with an intent to discover novel NMD genes that may aid in therapeutic interventions for genetic diseases, primary genetic screens were conducted in model organisms that resulted in identification of factors such as ROD1, ICE1, DHX34, NBAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. Immunoprecipitation to identify the interacting proteins of NMD factor ROD1 (EJC component) unveiled the binding of FRG1 with the former [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>], hinting towards a direct or indirect role played by FRG1 (FSHD Region Gene 1) in NMD.</p>
<p>FRG1 is a gene with increased expression leading to facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>] while reduced expression is linked to several types of cancer including oral, gastric, colorectal, prostrate, and breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. Some reports suggest potential role of FRG1 in RNA biogenesis. FRG1 has been found to localise within the nucleolus in HeLa cells and associates with Cajal bodies, nucleoli and nascent transcripts in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. RIP-based assay in HeLa and C2C12 cells shows the direct binding of FRG1 with FXR1 and Rbfox1 mRNA, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. Yeast two hybrid assays have shown FRG1 to be a part of spliceosome Bact/ C complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. In the same study, co-immunoprecipitation revealed binding of CWC22 with FRG1 and eIF4A3. CWC22 is an essential splicing factor that initiates EJC assembly via direct interaction with EJC core protein eIF4A3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. Cryo EM structure by Bertram et al. showed intricate spatial organisation of FRG1 within spliceosome C complex. Here, FRG1 was shown to interact with NTD (N-terminal domain) of splicing factor PRP8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. The aforementioned studies showing FRG1’s interaction with spliceosome and EJC gave a plausible hint of its role in the post transcriptional processing of transcripts. Additionally, our previous work revealed that FRG1 depletion affects transcript level of NMD factors (ICE1, PNN, MAGOH, ROD1, UPF3B, SMG1) having roles in different steps of the NMD pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. However, whether FRG1 affects NMD, and if so, whether FRG1 acts as a structural component of the NMD machinery, remains unclear, as does the exact mechanism by which FRG1 regulates the NMD pathway within the cell.</p>
<p>In this manuscript, we have employed NMD loss-of-function and gain-of-signal luciferase reporter systems, as well as an intron-retention splicing construct, to investigate the impact of altered FRG1 expression on nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) activity. We have utilized both FRG1 knockout and overexpression cellular models to systematically examine its role in modulating NMD efficiency. Additionally, we have performed transcriptome analyses to assess changes in the expression of known NMD target transcripts, particularly those harboring premature termination codons (PTCs). To probe the structural and functional associations of FRG1 within the spliceosome–EJC–NMD machinery, we conducted co-immunoprecipitation, polysome profiling, and proximity ligation assays. Furthermore, we evaluated the in vivo relevance of our in vitro experiments using a transgenic frg1 knockout zebrafish model. Our findings offer new insights confirming FRG1’s role in modulating the NMD pathway, and its underlying molecular mechanism.</p>

<title>Zebrafish maintenance</title>
<p>AB strain of zebrafish was used in this study. The animal work was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee. Inclusion criteria were fertilized one-cell stage embryos from healthy adult breeders (6–12 months; female:male ratio 2:1) with normal morphology and survival beyond 24 hpf. Exclusion criteria included unfertilized eggs, developmental arrest, abnormal morphology, or infection. Embryos were raised in E3 media (34.8 gm NaCl, 1.6 gm KCl, 5.8 gm CaCl2.2H2O, 9.78 gm MgCl2.6 H2O; pH-7.2) at 28°C. At 24 hpf, embryos were bleached using 0.001% sodium hypochlorite solution (Sigma Aldrich, MO, USA) to prevent any kind of infection. These were then transferred into a circulating water system tank (Techniplast, Odisha, India) at 5 dpf. Embryos were randomized by clutch, with microinjections performed by one investigator and phenotyping assessed by blinded evaluators.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>frg1 knockout generation</title>
    <p>To generate frg1 knockout transgenic zebrafish line, sgRNAs targeting frg1 exon1 and exon 9 (sequences mentioned in Supplementary Table S1) were designed following the protocol by Varsheney et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. The gene-specific oligos were annealed with the 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">AAAAGCACCGACTCGGTGCCACTTTTTCAAGTTGATAACGGACTAGCCTTATTTTAACTTGCTATTTCTAGCTCTAAAAC</named-content>-3’ (gRNA backbone) using Phusion polymerase (Thermo Scientific, IL, USA). The guide RNAs were in vitro transcribed using MEGAscript™ SP6 Transcription Kit (Invitrogen) and Megascript<sup>TM</sup> T7 transcription kit (Invitrogen, MA, USA), respectively. Cas9 mRNA was synthesized by linearizing the pCs2-nCas9n nanos 3’ UTR vector (Addgene, #62542) with XbaI-HF (NEB, MA, USA) followed by in vitro transcription using mMESSAGE mMACHINE<sup>TM</sup> transcription kit (Invitrogen). The adult male and female fishes were bred, and eggs were collected at 1-celled stage. A Femtojet microinjector (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) was used to inject embryos with a mixture containing 25 ng/µl each of exon1 and exon 9 sgRNAs, along with 100 ng/µl Cas9 mRNA.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Screening of frg1 knockout zebrafish embryos</title>
<p>Embryos were genotyped three months post-injection to screen for mutation incorporation, using caudal fin clipping across F0, F1, and F2 generations. Genomic DNA was isolated using 1x TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) along with proteinase K treatment (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), followed by PCR using exon-1 forward and exon-9 reverse primers with primers listed in Supplementary Table S1.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Whole mount in-situ hybridisation (WISH)</title>
<p>WISH was performed on zebrafish embryos as described earlier (Thisse and Thisse, 2008) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. Briefly, the zebrafish frg1 coding sequence (Supplementary Table S1) was amplified and cloned in pCR™-Blunt II-TOPO (Invitrogen). The DIG (Digoxigenin) labelled RNA probe was synthesized by linearizing the plasmid with BamH1 (NEB) and transcribing with T7 polymerase. The embryos were then fixed, dehydrated through methanol series (25% to 100%) and stored at -20°C in 100% methanol.-After rehydration, the embryos were incubated in a hybridization buffer containing 50% deionized formamide, 5X SSC, 50 µg/ml heparin, 0.5 mg/ml torula RNA, 9.2 mM citric acid, and 0.1% Tween-20, along with a zebrafish FRG1-specific probe. The following day, embryos were incubated in 2% blocking reagent (Roche-1109617600) for 2 hours at room temperature, to prevent non-specific binding. Staining of embryos was done by incubating them with anti-digoxigenin (Roche) FAB fragment coupled with alkaline phosphate diluted in blocking buffer. On the 3<sup>rd</sup> day, embryos were washed with MABT (Maleic Acid buffer with Tween) and pH9 buffer at room temperature and then transferred into BM purple dye (Roche) for color development, in dark.</p>

<title>Cell culture, Transfection and stable line generation</title>
<p>MCF7 cells were obtained from Cell Repository, NCCS, Pune, India. The cell line was authenticated by the repository using 16 STR markers (AmpFISTR Identifier Plus PCR Amplification Kit, Applied BioSystems). We checked mycoplasma contamination using MycoAlert Mycoplasma Assay kit (Lonza). The cell line was grown in DMEM media (Himedia, Mumbai, India) supplemented with 10% FBS (Himedia, US origin) and 1X Penicillium-Streptomycin-Amphotericin B (PSA; Himedia, Mumbai, India). Cells were cultured at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. FRG1 knockdown (pLKO.1_FRG1sh, TRCN0000075012, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:AB_259684">RRID:AB_259684</ext-link>) and expression (HsCD004 21091 PLX304_FRG1) vectors were procured from Sigma and Harvard repository, respectively. Transfection of the cells was done with the constructs using Lipofectamine 3000 according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen).</p>
<p>Single-cell colonies were selected for overexpression and knockdown using blasticidin (10 µg/ml) and puromycin (2 µg/ml) (Sigma Aldrich, MO, USA) antibiotics, respectively. Confirmation of the stable lines was done using Western Blotting.</p>

<sec id="s2f">
<title>NMD assay</title>
<p>NMD sensitive luciferase reporter (pCMV-3XFLAG-Fluc-betaglobin-39PTC) was purchased from Addgene repository (Addgene:#112084). pKC-4.06 plasmid was a kind gift from Dr. James Inglese’s lab (pKC-4.06 plasmid was a kind gift from Dr. James Inglese’s lab <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:Addgene_112084">RRID:Addgene_112084</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. The NMD sensor plasmid was microinjected into 1-cell stage zebrafish embryos. It was also transfected in MCF7 perturbed cells (MCF7_FRG1_overexpressed, MCF7_FRG1_Knockout and MCF7_FRG1_Knockdown) and their corresponding control cells (MCF7_Empty Vector, MCF7_Wild type and MCF7_Scrambled), respectively using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen, MA, USA) in a 12 well plate at 50% cell confluency. 48 h post transfection, cell lysate was prepared according to manufacturer’s protocol (Promega, WI, USA). Luciferase signal was recorded using <sup>®</sup>Varioska<sup>®</sup> Flash Multimode Reader (Thermo Scientific, MA, USA). Experiment was performed in triplicate.</p>

<title>Co Immunoprecipitation</title>
<p>MCF7 cells (11 million) were plated and grown in 150 mm dishes. The cells were washed with DPBS (Himedia) and fixed using 1% formaldehyde (Himedia) for 10 minutes at room temperature. Reaction was stopped using 1.25M glycine solution (MP Biomedicals, OH, USA). Cells were scrapped after adding ice-cold PBS and lysed using non-denaturing mammalian lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH-7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% NP-40) along with protease inhibitor (Invitrogen). Cell lysate was prepared by sonicating cells at 40% amplitude, 30 sec OFF/ON cycle, 5 times using a Ultrasonic Processor Sonicator (Cole-Parmer, IL, USA).

<title>FRG1 expression perturbation alters NMD efficacy</title>
    <p>Based on our previous publication showing FRG1 as a direct transcriptional activator of NMD genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>], we assessed the effect of its expression levels on NMD efficacy. To achieve this, we transiently transfected a specialized NMD sensor (pKC-4.06) in MCF7 cells having knockdown, knockout, and ectopic expression of FRG1. An increase in luciferase activity suggests impaired NMD machinery if PTCs are retained within transcripts in NMD sensor, and vice versa. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A-B</xref>, depletion and knockout of FRG1 resulted in decreased luciferase signal (0.8 and 0.83-folds, respectively) from the NMD sensor, indicating an increase in NMD efficiency. Ectopic expression of FRG1 resulted in increased luciferase signal (3.63-fold) from the NMD sensor, indicating reduced NMD efficiency (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). To validate our <italic>in vitro</italic> observation, evaluating FRG1 expression perturbation on NMD efficacy, we generated FRG1 knockout zebrafish model. For this, we used CRISPR-Cas9 method, injecting sgRNAs targeting exon-1 and 3’UTR regions of frg1 in AB strain zebrafish (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D-G</xref>). This was designed to delete most of the entire frg1 locus in zebrafish. The knockout of frg1 in zebrafish was validated using PCR and Whole-mount in situ hybridization (Suppl. Fig. 1). To carry out NMD assay, 1-cell stage embryos were collected and microinjected with NMD sensor construct. Reporter activity between knockout and control zebrafish embryos showed enhanced NMD efficiency 48hour post fertilization (lane-2) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 H</xref>). Microinjecting the NMD sensor construct along with FRG1 overexpression plasmid in the frg1<sup>-/-</sup> zebrafish embryos at 1-cell stage resulted in reduced NMD efficacy as observed at 48 hours post-fertilization (lane-3) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 H</xref>). These findings suggest that NMD is affected by FRG1.</p>

<title>DUX4 regulates NMD via FRG1</title>
<p>Feng et al. reported that DUX4, a transcriptional activator of FRG1, inhibits NMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>]. Mechanistically, we investigated whether FRG1 directly influences NMD, potentially exceeding the impact of DUX4, or whether DUX4 exerts its effects on NMD independently of FRG1. To ascertain this, we created a stable, inducible MCF7 cell line that expresses DUX4 upon doxycycline induction. As reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>], increased levels of DUX4 led to reduced NMD efficacy in MCF7 cells. Relative levels of luciferase signal obtained from the NMD sensor construct was 1.5-fold higher in the DUX4 overexpressing cells, showing the accumulation of PTC containing transcripts. However, NMD activity was restored (0.22-fold) with less intensity of luciferase signal from the NMD sensor construct due to decreased accumulation of PTC containing transcripts upon FRG1 depletion in DUX4 overexpressing cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).

<title>FRG1 Promotes Depletion of UPF1 Protein Independently of DUX4</title>
<p>Our previous publication demonstrated the direct binding of FRG1 to the promoter region of UPF1, establishing its role as a transcriptional regulator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. Building on these findings, we investigated whether FRG1 exerts a direct effect on UPF1 protein levels, a phenomenon previously reported in the context of DUX4. Consistent with earlier observations, DUX4 overexpression led to a marked reduction in UPF1 levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]. Interestingly, knockdown of FRG1 in a DUX4-overexpressing background restored UPF1 expression, indicating that FRG1 directly contributes to the downregulation of UPF1 protein levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). To further investigate this relationship, we overexpressed FRG1 in MCF7 cells, both with and without DUX4 overexpression. Notably, FRG1 overexpression alone led to a marked reduction in UPF1 levels—comparable to the reduction seen in cells already engineered to overexpress DUX4 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p>

<p>To further investigate the underlying mechanism, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation-based ubiquitination assay.

In contrast, ectopic expression of FRG1 enhanced UPF1 ubiquitination while diminishing its interaction with FRG1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). To validate these findings, we employed FRG1 knockout MCF7 cells and observed that ectopic re-expression of FRG1 in this background successfully restored UPF1 ubiquitination, confirming the role of FRG1 in regulating this process (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). Furthermore, a UPF1 pulldown assay performed under conditions of FRG1 overexpression—following treatment with 50 µM MG132 for 8 hours—showed reduced levels of ubiquitinated UPF1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>). This finding confirms a proteasome-mediated degradation pathway.</p>
<p>Collectively, these results demonstrate that FRG1 regulates UPF1 stability by promoting its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Thus, FRG1 acts as a negative regulator of UPF1 levels via a ubiquitin–proteasome mechanism (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G–I</xref>).</p>

<title>FRG1 is a structural component of the EJC and spliceosome complex</title>
<p>FRG1 is reported as a structural component of spliceosomal C complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. Overexpression of FRG1 leads to missplicing of transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>]. Since splicing and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay are closely interconnected processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>], and since components of the exon junction complex (EJC)—assembled during splicing—play a critical role in NMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>], we investigated whether FRG1 influences NMD by altering UPF1 levels or by disrupting the structural integrity of the spliceosome and EJC. To explore this, we assessed the stability of these complexes in FRG1-perturbed cells. PRP8, a core catalytic component of the spliceosomal C complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>], has been shown via cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) to interact with FRG1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. CWC22, a pre-mRNA splicing factor, bridges splicing and the EJC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. We performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments on nuclear extracts from cells with altered FRG1 expression, using an antibody against PRP8. Immunoblotting confirmed that FRG1 interacts with both PRP8 and CWC22 in FRG1-overexpressing cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> A). However, in FRG1-deficient cells, the interaction between PRP8 and CWC22 remained unaltered (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> B). These findings suggest that although FRG1 is a structural component of the human spliceosomal C complex, its absence does not compromise the complex’s structural integrity.</p>

<p>Next, we examined whether FRG1 affects the architecture of the EJC. We focused on eIF4A3, a core EJC component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>], and UPF3B, a key factor in the NMD pathway. Co-IP using an anti-eIF4A3 antibody on cytoplasmic extracts of FRG1-perturbed cells revealed interactions between eIF4A3, FRG1, and UPF3B (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> C). Notably, in FRG1-deficient cells, the interaction between eIF4A3 and UPF3B was maintained (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> D), indicating that FRG1 is not essential for EJC complex stability. To further probe the potential role of FRG1 in post-transcriptional regulation, we performed polysome sucrose gradient fractionation followed by immunoblotting. Remarkably, FRG1 co-sedimented with eIF4A3 across polysome fractions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 E</xref>), suggesting a previously unrecognized association of FRG1 with actively translating ribosomal complexes. This observation strongly supports a functional link between FRG1 and the translation-coupled phase of EJC activity, hinting at a novel regulatory role for FRG1 in mRNA surveillance or translation.</p>
<p>To validate the physical proximity suggested by co-sedimentation, we conducted a Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA) to test whether FRG1 and eIF4A3 are spatially close enough to imply direct or complex-mediated interaction. The PLA revealed distinct and abundant red fluorescent puncta in cells, confirming that FRG1 and eIF4A3 are localized within less than 40 nm of each other—a range consistent with direct protein-protein interaction (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> F). These compelling findings strongly support the conclusion that FRG1 either directly binds eIF4A3 or is stably associated within the same molecular complex. Altogether, this series of experiments unveils an exciting new aspect of FRG1 biology and firmly establishes its integration into key post-transcriptional gene regulatory pathways.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Research involving FRG1 has predominantly focussed on its association with FSHD and muscle function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>]. Over the past decade, there has been a substantial increase in understanding the additional roles of FRG1 in tumorigenesis and angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. Although few studies have indicated that FRG1 expression levels affect the RNA biogenesis of specific genes, but the exact mechanism is unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>]. The results presented in this study sheds light on FRG1’s role in modulating NMD processes, and its underlying molecular mechanism suggesting the need for maintaining its optimal levels.</p>
<p>Our previous finding revealed that FRG1 depletion decreases the expression levels of NMD factors such as MAGOH, PININ, ROD1, UPF3B, SMG1, and ICE1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. Another study demonstrated that ICE1 depletion reduces NMD efficiency, indirectly suggesting a potential role for FRG1 in regulating NMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. We observed that reduced FRG1 increased expression level of UPF1 transcriptionally as well as translationally, thereby increasing NMD efficiency. Thus, it is possible that FRG1, acting as a dual regulator of NMD genes may play a role in stabilizing the NMD pathway, ensuring its robustness in quality control and regulating normal gene expression. Previously, multiple studies have highlighted the role of NMD factors in maintaining cellular homeostasis. The first indication of a buffering mechanism came from a microarray profiling analysis on NMD deficient HeLa cells with depleted levels of the NMD factor UPF1. In this, amongst the 195 significantly upregulated transcripts, mRNA encoding the NMD factor SMG5 was identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. In yet another study, SMG5 mRNA was found to be regulated by the UPF3B-independent pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Huang et al. demonstrated the presence of a conserved feedback regulatory network wherein depletion of UPF1 in HeLa cells resulted in upregulation of NMD factors-UPF2, UPF3B, SMG1, SMG5, SMG6, and SMG7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>]. Study by Yepiskoposyan et al. showed that long 3’UTRs of NMD substrate mRNAs (UPF1, SMG6, and SMG7) trigger NMD, demonstrating autoregulation of NMD in human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>]. From all of these studies, we may speculate that along with the aforementioned NMD factors, FRG1 might be a part of the feedback regulatory network, preserving the integrity of NMD. NMD feedback loops are far more intricately regulated than currently understood. In future, genome-wide analysis may help elucidate new NMD factors that might provide versatile and subtle feedback control to achieve optimal NMD activity and protect NMD from perturbation.</p>
<p>DUX4 is a well-established transcriptional regulator of FRG1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>]. Previously Feng et al. reported that DUX4 reduces NMD efficiency triggering proteolytic degradation of UPF1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]. Consistent with this, our observation revealed that NMD efficiency is directly, but inversely modulated by FRG1. We ascertained that DUX4-mediated NMD inhibition is regulated by FRG1 expression. Delving into its molecular intricacy, we have shown that FRG1 mediates degradation of UPF1, which results in NMD inhibition. Thus, the close coupling between DUX4 and FRG1 expression levels might be providing a regulatory mechanism to maintain NMD homeostasis. However, it is yet to be determined if increased UPF1 protein levels are primarily responsible for FRG1-induced NMD regulation or merely one of the several contributing factors. Nonetheless, the expression levels of FRG1 in altering NMD efficiency surpassing DUX4 may prove useful to gain insight into the biological relevance of this mechanism. It is also tempting to speculate that FRG1-induced dysregulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system is responsible for triggering UPF1 protein degradation. The precise mechanism by which FRG1 induces UPF1 proteolysis or whether FRG1 itself acts as E3 ubiquitin ligase remains to be elucidated.</p>
<p>FRG1 serves as a structural component of spliceosome C complex by interacting with PRP8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>] and previous studies have linked increased FRG1 expression with abnormal splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>]. Herein, we aimed to investigate whether it regulates NMD by being a structural component of the Spliceosomal C complex. In this study, using FRG1 perturbed cell lines, carrying out co-immunoprecipitation assays, we have established it as a structural component of the Exon Junction Complex and Spliceosome Complex. However, we could also find that FRG1’s absence did not disrupt the interaction between CWC22 (a spliceosome molecule) and PRP8 or eIF4A3 (core EJC molecule) and UPF3B. However, in this context, the finer alterations in the spliceosome or exon junction complexes remain unexplored, leaving open the possibility that FRG1 may influence their functionality. Alternatively, other NMD factors might be compensating for the loss of FRG1 to maintain the structural integrity of the complexes. This requires further validation. A comprehensive mass spectrometry analysis conducted by Singh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>] using immunoprecipitation from HEK293 cells expressing FLAG-tagged eIF4A3 and mFLAG-Magoh, revealed a broad enrichment of EJC core and peripheral components, along with spliceosomal proteins, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), ribosomal subunits, and serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins. These findings underscore the complex and multifunctional nature of the EJC and its dynamic associations within the mRNP environment. In line with this, our polysome profiling data provide compelling evidence for a potential interaction between FRG1 and eIF4A3, strongly suggesting that FRG1 may associate with the EJC. This association further supports the emerging view of FRG1 as a participant in post-transcriptional gene regulatory pathways, possibly contributing to the coupling of splicing, translation, and mRNA surveillance mechanisms. Future studies will be needed to address the degree of FRG1-dependent interplay between splicing and NMD pathways.</p>
<p>In summary, this study provides mechanistic evidence that FRG1 inversely regulates the NMD machinery. Crucially, we demonstrated that FRG1 directly modulates the NMD pathway by influencing the ubiquitination of UPF1, an effect that surpasses the regulatory impact of DUX4. The identification of FRG1 as an upstream regulator of NMD genes offers valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying the fine-tuning of NMD. The findings from this study pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting diseases associated with FRG1 dysregulation.</p>

<p>This <bold>useful</bold> study by Palo et al proposes that FRG1 functions as a negative regulator of Nonsense-Mediated mRNA decay (NMD) by associating with the exon junction complex (EJC) and destabilizing UPF1 independently of DUX4.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Dixit and colleagues investigate the role of FRG1 in modulating nonsense-mediated mRNA decay using human cell lines and zebrafish embryos. They present data from experiments that test the effect of normal, reduced or elevated levels of FRG1 on NMD of a luciferase-based NMD reporter and on endogenous mRNA substrates of NMD. They also carry out experiments to investigate FRG1's influence on UPF1 mRNA and protein levels, with a particular focus on the possibility that FRG1 regulates UPF1 protein levels through ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of UPF1. The experiments described also test whether DUX4's effect on UPF1 protein levels and NMD could be mediated through FRG1. Finally, the authors also present experiments that test for physical interaction between UPF1, the spliceosome and components of the exon junction complex.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A key strength of the work is its focus on an intriguing model of NMD regulation by FRG1, which is of particular interest as FRG1 is positively regulated by DUX4, which has been previously implicated in subjecting UPF1 to proteosome-mediated degradation and thereby causing NMD inhibition. The data that shows that DUX4-mediated effect on UPF1 levels is diminished upon FRG1 depletion suggests that DUX4's regulation of NMD could be mediated by FRG1.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A major weakness and concern is that many of the key conclusions drawn by the authors are not supported by the data, and there are also some significant concerns with experimental design. More specific comments below describe these issues:</p>
<p>(1) Multiple issues lower the confidence in the experiments testing the effect of FRG1 on NMD.</p>
<p>(a) All reporter assays presented in the manuscript are based on quantification of luciferase activity, and in most cases, the effect on luciferase activity is quite small. This assay is the key experimental approach throughout the manuscript. However, no evidence is provided that the effect captured by this assay is due to enhanced degradation of the mRNA encoding the luciferase reporter, which is what is implied in the interpretation of these experiments. Crucially, there is also no control for the reporter that can account for the effects of experimental manipulations on transcriptional versus post-transcriptional effects. A control reporter lacking a 3'UTR intron is described in Barid et al, where the authors got their NMD reporter from. Due to small effects observed on luciferase activity upon FRG1 depletion, it is necessary to not only measure NMD reporter mRNA steady state levels, but it will be equally important to ascertain that the effect of FRG1 on NMD is at the level of mRNA decay and not altered transcription of NMD substrates. This can be accomplished by testing decay rates of the beta-globin reporter mRNA.</p>
<p>(b) It is unusual to use luciferase enzymatic activity as a measurement of RNA decay status. Such an approach can at least be justified if the authors can test how many-fold the luciferase activity changes when NMD is inhibited using a chemical inhibitor (e.g., SMG1 inhibitor) or knockdown of a core NMD factor.</p>
<p>(c) The concern about the direct effect of FRG1 on NMD is further amplified by the small effects of FRG1 knockout on steady-state levels of endogenous NMD targets (Figure 1A and B: ~20% reduction in reporter mRNA in MCF7 cells; Figure 1M, only 18 endogenous NMD targets shared between FRG1_KO and FRG1_KD).</p>
<p>(d) The question about transcriptional versus post-transcriptional effects is also important in light of the authors' previous work that FRG1 can act as a transcriptional regulator.</p>
<p>(2) In the experiments probing the relationship between DUX4 and FRG1 in NMD regulation, there are some inconsistencies that need to be resolved.</p>
<p>(a) Figure 3 shows that the inhibition of NMD reporter activity caused by DUX4 induction is reversed by FRG1 knockdown. Although levels of FRG1 and UPF1 in DUX4 uninduced and DUX4 induced + FRG1 knockdown conditions are similar (Figure 5A), why is the reporter activity in DUX4 induced + FRG1 knockdown cells much lower than DUX4 uninduced cells in Figure 3?</p>
<p>(b) In Figure 3, it is important to know the effect of FRG1 knockdown in DUX4 uninduced conditions.</p>
<p>(c) On line 401, the authors claim that MG132 treatment leads to &quot;time-dependent increase in UPF1 protein levels&quot; in Figure 5C. However, upon proteasome inhibition, UPF1 levels significantly increase only at 8h time point, while the change at 12 and 24 hours is not significantly different from the control.</p>
<p>(3) There are multiple issues with experiments investigating ubiquitination of UPF1:</p>
<p>(a) Ubiquitin blots in Figure 6 are very difficult to interpret. There is no information provided either in the text or figure legends as to which bands in the blots are being compared, or about what the sizes of these bands are, as compared to UPF1. Also, the signal for Ub in most IP samples looks very similar to or even lower than the input.</p>
<p>(b) Western blot images in Figure 6D appear to be adjusted for brightness/contrast to reduce background, but are done in such a way that pixel intensities are not linearly altered. This image appears to be the most affected, although some others have also similar patterns (e.g., Figure 5C).</p>
<p>(4) The experiments probing physical interactions of FRG1 with UPF1, spliceosome and EJC proteins need to consider the following points:</p>
<p>(a) There is no information provided in the results or methods section on whether immunoprecipitations were carried out in the absence or presence of RNases. Each RNA can be bound by a plethora of proteins that may not be functionally engaged with each other. Without RNase treatment, even such interactions will lead to co-immunoprecipitation. Thus, experiments in Figure 6 and Figure 7A-D should be repeated with and without RNase treatment.</p>
<p>(b) Also, the authors claim that FRG1 is a &quot;structural component&quot; of EJC and NMD complexes seems to be an overinterpretation. As noted in the previous comment, these interactions could be mediated by a connecting RNA molecule.</p>
<p>(c) A negative control (non-precipitating protein) is missing in Figure 7 co-IP experiments.</p>
<p>(d) Polysome analysis is missing important controls. FRG1 and EIF4A3 co-sedimentation with polysomes could simply be due to their association with another large complex (e.g., spliceosome), which will also co-sediment in these gradients. This possibility can at least be tested by Western blotting for some spliceosome components across the gradient fractions. More importantly, a puromycin treatment control needs to be performed to confirm that FRG1 and EIF4A3 are indeed bound to polysomes, which are separated into ribosome subunits upon puromycin treatment. This leads to a shift of the signal for ribosomal proteins and any polysome-associated proteins to the left.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Palo et al present a novel role for FRG1 as a multifaceted regulator of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Through a combination of reporter assays, transcriptome-wide analyses, genetic models, protein-protein interaction studies, ubiquitination assays, and ribosome-associated complex analyses, the authors propose that FRG1 acts as a negative regulator of NMD by destabilizing UPF1 and associating with spliceosomal, EJC, and translation-related complexes. Overall, the data, while consistent with the authors' central conclusions, are undermined by several claims-particularly regarding structural roles and mechanistic exclusivity. To really make the claims presented, further experimental evidence would be required.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The integration of multiple experimental systems (zebrafish and cell culture).</p>
<p>(2) Attempts to go into a mechanistic understanding of the relationship between FGR1 and UPF1.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Overstatement of FRG1 as a structural NMD component.</p>
<p>Although FRG1 interacts with UPF1, eIF4A3, PRP8, and CWC22, core spliceosomal and EJC interactions (PRP8-CWC22 and eIF4A3-UPF3B) remain intact in FRG1-deficient cells. This suggests that, while FRG1 associates with these complexes, this interaction is not required for their assembly or structural stability. Without further functional or reconstitution experiments, the presented data are more consistent with an interpretation of FRG1 acting as a regulatory or accessory factor rather than a core structural component.</p>
<p>(2) Causality between UPF1 depletion and NMD inhibition is not fully established.</p>
<p>While reduced UPF1 levels provide a plausible explanation for decreased NMD efficiency, the manuscript does not conclusively demonstrate that UPF1 depletion drives all observed effects. Given FRG1's known roles in transcription, splicing, and RNA metabolism, alterations in transcript isoform composition and apparent NMD sensitivity may arise from mechanisms independent of UPF1 abundance. To directly link UPF1 depletion to altered NMD efficiency, rescue experiments testing whether UPF1 re-expression restores NMD activity in FRG1-overexpressing cells would be important.</p>
<p>(3) Mechanism of FRG1-mediated UPF1 ubiquitination requires clarification.</p>
<p>The ubiquitination assays support a role for FRG1 in promoting UPF1 degradation; however, the mechanism underlying this remains unexplored. The relationship between FRG1-UPF1 what role FRG1 plays in this is unclear (does it function as an adaptor, recruits an E3 ubiquitin ligase, or influences UPF1 ubiquitination indirectly through transcriptional or signaling pathways?).</p>
<p>(4) Limited transcriptome-wide interpretation of RNA-seq data.</p>
<p>Although the RNA-seq data analysis relies heavily on a small subset of &quot;top 10&quot; genes. Additionally, the criteria used to define NMD-sensitive isoforms are unclear. A more comprehensive transcriptome-wide summary-indicating how many NMD-sensitive isoforms are detected and how many are significantly altered-would substantially strengthen the analysis.</p>
<p>(5) Clarification of NMD sensor assay interpretation.</p>
<p>The logic underlying the NMD sensor assay should be explained more clearly early in the manuscript, as the inverse relationship between luciferase signal and NMD efficiency may be counterintuitive to readers unfamiliar with this reporter system. Inclusion of a schematic or brief explanatory diagram would improve accessibility.</p>
<p>(6) Potential confounding effects of high MG132 concentration.</p>
<p>The MG132 concentration used (50 µM) is relatively high and may induce broad cellular stress responses, including inhibition of global translation (its known that proteosome inhibition shuts down translation). Controls addressing these secondary effects would strengthen the conclusion that UPF1 stabilization specifically reflects proteasome-dependent degradation would be essential.</p>
<p>(7) Interpretation of polysome co-sedimentation data.</p>
<p>While the co-sedimentation of FRG1 with polysomes is intriguing, this approach does not distinguish between direct ribosomal association and co-migration with ribosome-associated complexes. This limitation should be explicitly acknowledged in the interpretation.</p>
<p>(8) Limitations of PLA-based interaction evidence.</p>
<p>The PLA data convincingly demonstrate close spatial proximity between FRG1 and eIF4A3; however, PLA does not provide definitive evidence of direct interaction and is known to be susceptible to artefacts. Moreover, a distance threshold of ~40 nm still allows for proteins to be in proximity without being part of the same complex. These limitations should be clearly acknowledged, and conclusions should be framed accordingly.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Palo and colleagues demonstrates identification of FRG1 as a novel regulator of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), showing that FRG1 inversely modulates NMD efficiency by controlling UPF1 abundance. Using cell-based models and a frg1 knockout zebrafish, the authors show that FRG1 promotes UPF1 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, independently of DUX4. The work further positions FRG1 as a structural component of the spliceosome and exon junction complex without compromising its integrity. Overall, the manuscript provides mechanistic insight into FRG1-mediated post-transcriptional regulation and expands understanding of NMD homeostasis. The authors should address the following issues to improve the quality of their manuscript.</p>
<p>(1) Figure 7A-D, appropriate positive controls for the nuclear fraction (e.g., Histone H3) and the cytoplasmic fraction (e.g., GAPDH or α-tubulin) should be included to validate the efficiency and purity of the subcellular fractionation.</p>
<p>(2) To strengthen the conclusion that FRG1 broadly impacts the NMD pathway, qRT-PCR analysis of additional core NMD factors (beyond UPF1) in the frg1⁻/⁻ zebrafish at 48 hpf would be informative.</p>
<p>(3) Figure labels should be standardized throughout the manuscript (e.g., consistent use of &quot;Ex&quot; instead of mixed terms such as &quot;Oex&quot;) to improve clarity and readability.</p>
<p>(4) The methods describing the generation of the frg1 knockout zebrafish could be expanded to include additional detail, and a schematic illustrating the CRISPR design, genotyping workflow, and validation strategy would enhance transparency and reproducibility.</p>
<p>(5) As FRG1 is a well-established tumor suppressor, additional cell-based functional assays under combined FRG1 and UPF1 perturbation (e.g., proliferation, migration, or survival assays) could help determine whether FRG1 influences cancer-associated phenotypes through modulation of the NMD pathway.</p>
<p>(6) Given the claim that FRG1 inversely regulates NMD efficacy via UPF1, an epistasis experiment such as UPF1 overexpression in an FRG1-overexpressing background followed by an NMD reporter assay would provide stronger functional validation of pathway hierarchy.</p>

<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Dixit and colleagues investigate the role of FRG1 in modulating nonsense-mediated mRNA decay using human cell lines and zebrafish embryos. They present data from experiments that test the effect of normal, reduced or elevated levels of FRG1 on NMD of a luciferase-based NMD reporter and on endogenous mRNA substrates of NMD. They also carry out experiments to investigate FRG1's influence on UPF1 mRNA and protein levels, with a particular focus on the possibility that FRG1 regulates UPF1 protein levels through ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of UPF1. The experiments described also test whether DUX4's effect on UPF1 protein levels and NMD could be mediated through FRG1. Finally, the authors also present experiments that test for physical interaction between UPF1, the spliceosome and components of the exon junction complex.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A key strength of the work is its focus on an intriguing model of NMD regulation by FRG1, which is of particular interest as FRG1 is positively regulated by DUX4, which has been previously implicated in subjecting UPF1 to proteosome-mediated degradation and thereby causing NMD inhibition. The data that shows that DUX4-mediated effect on UPF1 levels is diminished upon FRG1 depletion suggests that DUX4's regulation of NMD could be mediated by FRG1.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A major weakness and concern is that many of the key conclusions drawn by the authors are not supported by the data, and there are also some significant concerns with experimental design. More specific comments below describe these issues:</p>
<p>(1) Multiple issues lower the confidence in the experiments testing the effect of FRG1 on NMD.</p>
<p>(a) All reporter assays presented in the manuscript are based on quantification of luciferase activity, and in most cases, the effect on luciferase activity is quite small. This assay is the key experimental approach throughout the manuscript. However, no evidence is provided that the effect captured by this assay is due to enhanced degradation of the mRNA encoding the luciferase reporter, which is what is implied in the interpretation of these experiments. Crucially, there is also no control for the reporter that can account for the effects of experimental manipulations on transcriptional versus post-transcriptional effects. A control reporter lacking a 3'UTR intron is described in Barid et al, where the authors got their NMD reporter from. Due to small effects observed on luciferase activity upon FRG1 depletion, it is necessary to not only measure NMD reporter mRNA steady state levels, but it will be equally important to ascertain that the effect of FRG1 on NMD is at the level of mRNA decay and not altered transcription of NMD substrates. This can be accomplished by testing decay rates of the beta-globin reporter mRNA.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising these points and for the careful evaluation of our experimental approach. Here we provide our response to comment (a) in three parts</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Reliance on luciferase-based reporter assays</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While luciferase-based NMD reporter assays represent an important experimental component of this study, our conclusions do not rely exclusively on this approach. The reporter-based findings are independently supported by RNA sequencing analyses of FRG1-perturbed cells, which demonstrate altered abundance of established PTC-containing NMD target transcripts. This genome-wide analysis provides an unbiased and physiologically relevant validation of FRG1 involvement in NMD regulation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>All reporter assays presented in the manuscript are based on quantification of luciferase activity, and in most cases, the effect on luciferase activity is quite small.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully disagree with the comment that the magnitude of the luciferase effects is low. Increased expression of FRG1, which leads to reduced UPF1 levels, results in a ~3.5-fold increase in relative luciferase activity (Fig. 1C), indicating a robust effect. Furthermore, in the in vivo zebrafish model, FRG1 knockout causes a pronounced decrease in relative luciferase activity (Fig. 1H), consistent with elevated UPF1 levels and enhanced NMD activity.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that FRG1 functions as a negative regulator of UPF1; therefore, its depletion is expected to increase UPF1 levels. However, excessive elevation of UPF1 is likely constrained by additional regulatory mechanisms, which may limit the observable effects of FRG1 knockdown or knockout. In line with this, our previous study (1) demonstrated that FRG1 positively regulates multiple NMD factors while exerting an inverse regulatory effect on UPF1. This dual role suggests that FRG1 may act as a compensatory modulator of the NMD machinery, which likely explains the relatively subtle net effects observed in FRG1 knockdown/knockout conditions in vitro (Fig. 1A and 1B). This interpretation is explicitly discussed in the manuscript (Discussion, paragraph para 4).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. We will test decay rates of the beta-globin reporter mRNA.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(b) It is unusual to use luciferase enzymatic activity as a measurement of RNA decay status. Such an approach can at least be justified if the authors can test how many-fold the luciferase activity changes when NMD is inhibited using a chemical inhibitor (e.g., SMG1 inhibitor) or knockdown of a core NMD factor.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully disagree that the use of luciferase enzymatic activity as a readout for NMD is unusual. Multiple prior studies have successfully employed identical or closely related luciferase-based/fluorescence-based reporters to quantify NMD activity (2–5). Importantly, the goal of our study was not to measure RNA decay kinetics per se, but rather to assess how altered FRG1 levels influence the functional efficiency of the NMD pathway. Given that FRG1 is a structural component of the spliceosome C complex (6) and is previously indirectly linked to NMD regulation (1,7) this approach was well-suited to address our central question.</p>
<p>As suggested by the reviewer, we will also assess luciferase activity following pharmacological inhibition of NMD to further validate the reporter system's responsiveness.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(c) The concern about the direct effect of FRG1 on NMD is further amplified by the small effects of FRG1 knockout on steady-state levels of endogenous NMD targets (Figure 1A and B: ~20% reduction in reporter mRNA in MCF7 cells; Figure 1M, only 18 endogenous NMD targets shared between FRG1_KO and FRG1_KD).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The modest changes observed upon FRG1 loss do not preclude a direct role in NMD. As detailed in our response to comment (a) and discussed in paragraph 4 of the Discussion, limited effects on steady-state levels of endogenous NMD targets are expected given the buffering capacity of the NMD pathway and the contribution of compensatory regulatory mechanisms.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(d) The question about transcriptional versus post-transcriptional effects is also important in light of the authors' previous work that FRG1 can act as a transcriptional regulator.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that distinguishing between transcriptional and post-transcriptional effects is important, particularly in light of our previous work demonstrating that FRG1 can function as a transcriptional regulator of multiple NMD genes (1). Consistent with this, the current manuscript shows that FRG1 influences the transcript levels of UPF1. In addition, we demonstrate that FRG1 regulates UPF1 at the protein level. We therefore conclude that FRG1 regulates UPF1 dually, at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, supporting a dual role for FRG1 in the regulation of NMD.</p>
<p>This conclusion is further supported by prior studies indicating post-transcriptional functions of FRG1. FRG1 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein(8), interacts with the NMD factor ROD1 (7), and has been identified as a component of the spliceosomal C complex (6). FRG1 has also been reported to associate with the hnRNPK family of proteins (8), which participate in extensive protein–protein interaction networks. Collectively, these observations are consistent with a role for FRG1 in regulating NMD components at multiple levels.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In the experiments probing the relationship between DUX4 and FRG1 in NMD regulation, there are some inconsistencies that need to be resolved.</p>
<p>(a) Figure 3 shows that the inhibition of NMD reporter activity caused by DUX4 induction is reversed by FRG1 knockdown. Although levels of FRG1 and UPF1 in DUX4 uninduced and DUX4 induced + FRG1 knockdown conditions are similar (Figure 5A), why is the reporter activity in DUX4 induced + FRG1 knockdown cells much lower than DUX4 uninduced cells in Figure 3?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. Figures 3 and 5A represent independent experiments in which FRG1 knockdown was achieved by transient transfection. As such, variability in transfection efficiency is expected and likely accounts for the quantitative difference. We want to highlight that compared to DUX4_induced lane (Fig. 5A, lane 2), when we knock down FRG1 on the DUX4_induced background, it shows a clear increase in the UPF1 level (Fig. 5A, lane 3). We will add one more replicate to 5 A with better FRG1_KD transfection to the experiment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(b) In Figure 3, it is important to know the effect of FRG1 knockdown in DUX4 uninduced conditions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this thoughtful suggestion. The effect of FRG1 knockdown under DUX4-uninduced conditions is presented in Figure 1A, where FRG1 levels are reduced without altering DUX4 expression. In contrast, Figure 3 is specifically designed to assess the rescue effect—namely, how reduction of FRG1 expression under DUX4-induced conditions influences NMD efficiency. Therefore, inclusion of an FRG1 knockdown–only group in Figure 3 was not relevant to the objective of this experiment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(c) On line 401, the authors claim that MG132 treatment leads to &quot;time-dependent increase in UPF1 protein levels&quot; in Figure 5C. However, upon proteasome inhibition, UPF1 levels significantly increase only at 8h time point, while the change at 12 and 24 hours is not significantly different from the control.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this observation and agree that the statement of a “time-dependent increase in UPF1 protein levels” was inaccurate. A significant increase is observed only at the 8 h time point following MG132 treatment, with no significant changes at 12 h or 24 h. The text will be revised accordingly to reflect Figure 5C.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) There are multiple issues with experiments investigating ubiquitination of UPF1:</p>
<p>(a) Ubiquitin blots in Figure 6 are very difficult to interpret. There is no information provided either in the text or figure legends as to which bands in the blots are being compared, or about what the sizes of these bands are, as compared to UPF1. Also, the signal for Ub in most IP samples looks very similar to or even lower than the input.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the ubiquitin blots in Figure 6 require clearer presentation. In the revised figure, we will annotate the ubiquitin immunoblots to indicate the region corresponding to UPF1 (~140 kDa), which is the relevant molecular weight for interpretation. Because UPF1 is polyubiquitinated, ubiquitinated species are expected to appear as multiple bands rather than a single discrete signal; therefore, ubiquitination was assessed across the full blot. Importantly, interpretation is based on comparisons between UPF1 immunoprecipitated samples within each panel (Fig. 6C–F), rather than between input and IP lanes. For example, in Figure 6 C UPF1 IP FRG1_KD compared to UPF1 IP FRG1_Ex, in Figure 6 D UPF1 IP FRG1_WT compared to UPF1 IP FRG1_KO, in Figure 6 E UPF1 IP FRG1_KO compared to UPF1 IP FRG1_KO+FRG1_Ex, and in Figure 6 F UPF1 IP FRG1_Ex compared to UPF1 IP FRG1_Ex+MG132 TRT.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(b) Western blot images in Figure 6D appear to be adjusted for brightness/contrast to reduce background, but are done in such a way that pixel intensities are not linearly altered. This image appears to be the most affected, although some others have also similar patterns (e.g., Figure 5C).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. The appearance noted in Figure 6D was not due to non-linear alteration of pixel intensities, but rather resulted from the poor quality of the ubiquitin antibody, which required prolonged exposure times. To address this, we replaced the antibody and repeated the ubiquitin immunoblots shown in Figures 6D, 6E, and 6F.</p>
<p>For Figure 5C, only uniform contrast adjustment was applied for clarity. Importantly, all adjustments were performed linearly and applied to the entire image. Raw, unprocessed images for all blots are provided in the Supplementary Information. Updated versions of Figures 5 and 6 will be included in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The experiments probing physical interactions of FRG1 with UPF1, spliceosome and EJC proteins need to consider the following points:</p>
<p>(a) There is no information provided in the results or methods section on whether immunoprecipitations were carried out in the absence or presence of RNases. Each RNA can be bound by a plethora of proteins that may not be functionally engaged with each other. Without RNase treatment, even such interactions will lead to co-immunoprecipitation. Thus, experiments in Figure 6 and Figure 7A-D should be repeated with and without RNase treatment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this important point. The co-immunoprecipitation experiments shown in Figures 6 and 7A–D were performed in the absence of RNase treatment; this information was inadvertently omitted and will be added to the Methods section and the relevant figure legends. To directly assess whether the observed interactions are RNA-dependent, we will repeat the key co-immunoprecipitation experiments in the presence of RNase treatment and include these results in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(b) Also, the authors claim that FRG1 is a &quot;structural component&quot; of EJC and NMD complexes seems to be an overinterpretation. As noted in the previous comment, these interactions could be mediated by a connecting RNA molecule.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment. As noted, previous studies have suggested that FRG1 interacts with components of the EJC and NMD machinery. Specifically, Bertram et al. (6) identified FRG1 as a component of the spliceosomal C complex via Cryo-EM structural analysis, and pull-down studies have shown direct interaction between FRG1 and ROD1, a known EJC component (7). These findings support a protein-protein interaction rather than one mediated solely by RNA. To further address the reviewer’s concern, we will perform key co-immunoprecipitation experiments in the presence of RNase treatment to distinguish RNA-dependent from RNA-independent interactions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(c) A negative control (non-precipitating protein) is missing in Figure 7 co-IP experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that including a non-precipitating protein as a negative control is important, and we will perform the co-IP experiment incorporating this control.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(d) Polysome analysis is missing important controls. FRG1 and EIF4A3 co-sedimentation with polysomes could simply be due to their association with another large complex (e.g., spliceosome), which will also co-sediment in these gradients. This possibility can at least be tested by Western blotting for some spliceosome components across the gradient fractions. More importantly, a puromycin treatment control needs to be performed to confirm that FRG1 and EIF4A3 are indeed bound to polysomes, which are separated into ribosome subunits upon puromycin treatment. This leads to a shift of the signal for ribosomal proteins and any polysome-associated proteins to the left.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As recommended, we will examine the distribution of a spliceosome component across the gradient fractions to assess potential co-sedimentation. Additionally, we will perform a puromycin treatment control to confirm that FRG1 and EIF4A3 are genuinely associated with polysomes.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Palo et al present a novel role for FRG1 as a multifaceted regulator of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Through a combination of reporter assays, transcriptome-wide analyses, genetic models, protein-protein interaction studies, ubiquitination assays, and ribosome-associated complex analyses, the authors propose that FRG1 acts as a negative regulator of NMD by destabilizing UPF1 and associating with spliceosomal, EJC, and translation-related complexes. Overall, the data, while consistent with the authors' central conclusions, are undermined by several claims-particularly regarding structural roles and mechanistic exclusivity. To really make the claims presented, further experimental evidence would be required.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The integration of multiple experimental systems (zebrafish and cell culture).</p>
<p>(2) Attempts to go into a mechanistic understanding of the relationship between FGR1 and UPF1.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Overstatement of FRG1 as a structural NMD component.</p>
<p>Although FRG1 interacts with UPF1, eIF4A3, PRP8, and CWC22, core spliceosomal and EJC interactions (PRP8-CWC22 and eIF4A3-UPF3B) remain intact in FRG1-deficient cells. This suggests that, while FRG1 associates with these complexes, this interaction is not required for their assembly or structural stability. Without further functional or reconstitution experiments, the presented data are more consistent with an interpretation of FRG1 acting as a regulatory or accessory factor rather than a core structural component.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this clarification. We would like to emphasize that we do not claim FRG1 to be a core structural component of either the spliceosome or the EJC. Consistent with the reviewer’s interpretation, our data indicate that FRG1 deficiency does not disrupt the structural integrity of these complexes. Our intended conclusion is that FRG1 functions as a regulatory or accessory factor in NMD rather than being required for complex assembly or stability. We will carefully revise the manuscript to remove any language that could be interpreted as an overstatement. In addition, we are currently performing further experiments to better define the association of FRG1 with the EJC.</p>

<p>(2) Causality between UPF1 depletion and NMD inhibition is not fully established.</p>
<p>While reduced UPF1 levels provide a plausible explanation for decreased NMD efficiency, the manuscript does not conclusively demonstrate that UPF1 depletion drives all observed effects. Given FRG1's known roles in transcription, splicing, and RNA metabolism, alterations in transcript isoform composition and apparent NMD sensitivity may arise from mechanisms independent of UPF1 abundance. To directly link UPF1 depletion to altered NMD efficiency, rescue experiments testing whether UPF1 re-expression restores NMD activity in FRG1-overexpressing cells would be important.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested, to directly test causality, we will perform rescue experiments to determine whether UPF1 re-expression restores NMD activity in FRG1-overexpressing MCF7 cells.</p>

<p>(3) Mechanism of FRG1-mediated UPF1 ubiquitination requires clarification.</p>
<p>The ubiquitination assays support a role for FRG1 in promoting UPF1 degradation; however, the mechanism underlying this remains unexplored. The relationship between FRG1-UPF1 what role FRG1 plays in this is unclear (does it function as an adaptor, recruits an E3 ubiquitin ligase, or influences UPF1 ubiquitination indirectly through transcriptional or signaling pathways?).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that the precise mechanism by which FRG1 promotes UPF1 ubiquitination remains to be defined. Our ubiquitination assays support a role for FRG1 in facilitating UPF1 degradation; however, whether FRG1 functions directly as an adaptor or E3 ligase, or instead influences UPF1 stability indirectly, is currently unclear. Notably, a prior study by Geng et al. reported that DUX4 expression alters the expression of numerous genes involved in protein ubiquitination, including multiple E3 ubiquitin ligases (9), and FRG1 itself has been reported to be upregulated upon DUX4 expression in muscle cells. We will expand the Discussion to address these potential mechanisms and place our findings in the context of indirect transcriptional or signaling pathways that may regulate UPF1 proteolysis. A detailed mechanistic dissection of FRG1-mediated ubiquitination is beyond the scope of the present study.</p>

<p>(4) Limited transcriptome-wide interpretation of RNA-seq data.</p>
<p>Although the RNA-seq data analysis relies heavily on a small subset of &quot;top 10&quot; genes. Additionally, the criteria used to define NMD-sensitive isoforms are unclear. A more comprehensive transcriptome-wide summary-indicating how many NMD-sensitive isoforms are detected and how many are significantly altered-would substantially strengthen the analysis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and agree that the current presentation may place a disproportionate emphasis on a limited subset of genes. These genes were selected as illustrative examples from an isoform-level analysis performed using IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR (ISAR) (10); however, we acknowledge that this approach does not fully convey the transcriptome-wide scope of the analysis.</p>
<p>Using quantified RNA-seq data, ISAR was employed to identify significant isoform switches and transcripts predicted to be NMD-sensitive. Isoforms were annotated using GENCODE v47, and NMD sensitivity was assigned based on the established 50-nucleotide rule, as described in the Materials and Methods. To address the reviewer’s concern, we will revise the Results section to include a transcriptome-wide summary derived from the ISAR analysis.</p>

<p>(5) Clarification of NMD sensor assay interpretation.</p>
<p>The logic underlying the NMD sensor assay should be explained more clearly early in the manuscript, as the inverse relationship between luciferase signal and NMD efficiency may be counterintuitive to readers unfamiliar with this reporter system. Inclusion of a schematic or brief explanatory diagram would improve accessibility.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer and would provide a schematic as well as the experimental setup diagram to improve accessibility to the readers.</p>

<p>(6) Potential confounding effects of high MG132 concentration.</p>
<p>The MG132 concentration used (50 µM) is relatively high and may induce broad cellular stress responses, including inhibition of global translation (its known that proteosome inhibition shuts down translation). Controls addressing these secondary effects would strengthen the conclusion that UPF1 stabilization specifically reflects proteasome-dependent degradation would be essential.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the reviewer’s concern regarding the relatively high concentration of MG132 used in this study. While proteasome inhibition can indeed induce global translation inhibition, our interpretation is based on the specific stabilization of UPF1 observed under these conditions. Since inhibition of global translation would generally reduce protein levels rather than cause selective accumulation, the observed increase in UPF1 is unlikely to result from translational effects. To address this point, we plan to repeat selected experiments using a lower MG132 concentration to further confirm that UPF1 stabilization reflects proteasome-dependent degradation.</p>

<p>(7) Interpretation of polysome co-sedimentation data.</p>
<p>While the co-sedimentation of FRG1 with polysomes is intriguing, this approach does not distinguish between direct ribosomal association and co-migration with ribosome-associated complexes. This limitation should be explicitly acknowledged in the interpretation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge that polysome co-sedimentation alone cannot definitively distinguish between direct ribosomal binding and co-migration with ribosome-associated complexes. Importantly, our interpretation does not rely solely on this assay; when combined with co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assay results, the data consistently support an association of FRG1 with the exon junction complex. We are also conducting additional experiments with appropriate controls to further validate the specificity of FRG1’s association with ribosomes and to address the possibility of nonspecific co-migration.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Limitations of PLA-based interaction evidence.</p>
<p>The PLA data convincingly demonstrate close spatial proximity between FRG1 and eIF4A3; however, PLA does not provide definitive evidence of direct interaction and is known to be susceptible to artefacts. Moreover, a distance threshold of ~40 nm still allows for proteins to be in proximity without being part of the same complex. These limitations should be clearly acknowledged, and conclusions should be framed accordingly.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this important point. We agree that PLA indicates close spatial proximity but does not constitute definitive evidence of direct interaction and can be susceptible to artefacts. We will explicitly acknowledge this limitation in the revised manuscript. Importantly, our conclusions are not solely based on PLA data; they are supported by complementary co-immunoprecipitation and polysome co-sedimentation assays, which provide biochemical evidence consistent with an association between FRG1 and eIF4A3.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>The manuscript by Palo and colleagues demonstrates identification of FRG1 as a novel regulator of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), showing that FRG1 inversely modulates NMD efficiency by controlling UPF1 abundance. Using cell-based models and a frg1 knockout zebrafish, the authors show that FRG1 promotes UPF1 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, independently of DUX4. The work further positions FRG1 as a structural component of the spliceosome and exon junction complex without compromising its integrity. Overall, the manuscript provides mechanistic insight into FRG1-mediated post-transcriptional regulation and expands understanding of NMD homeostasis. The authors should address the following issues to improve the quality of their manuscript.</p>
<p>(1) Figure 7A-D, appropriate positive controls for the nuclear fraction (e.g., Histone H3) and the cytoplasmic fraction (e.g., GAPDH or α-tubulin) should be included to validate the efficiency and purity of the subcellular fractionation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We will include appropriate positive controls for the nuclear fraction (Histone H3) and the cytoplasmic fraction (GAPDH or α-tubulin) in Figure 7A–D to validate the efficiency and purity of the subcellular fractionation.</p>

<p>(2) To strengthen the conclusion that FRG1 broadly impacts the NMD pathway, qRT-PCR analysis of additional core NMD factors (beyond UPF1) in the frg1⁻/⁻ zebrafish at 48 hpf would be informative.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comment. We will perform qRT-PCR analysis of additional core NMD factors in the frg1⁻/⁻ zebrafish at 48 hpf to further strengthen the conclusion that FRG1 broadly impacts the NMD pathway.</p>

<p>(3) Figure labels should be standardized throughout the manuscript (e.g., consistent use of &quot;Ex&quot; instead of mixed terms such as &quot;Oex&quot;) to improve clarity and readability.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for noticing the inconsistency. We will ensure that all figure labels are standardized throughout the manuscript (e.g., using “Ex” consistently) to improve clarity and readability.</p>

<p>(4) The methods describing the generation of the frg1 knockout zebrafish could be expanded to include additional detail, and a schematic illustrating the CRISPR design, genotyping workflow, and validation strategy would enhance transparency and reproducibility.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion and will expand the Methods section to provide additional detail on the generation of the frg1 knockout zebrafish. A schematic illustrating the CRISPR design, genotyping workflow, and validation strategy will also be included to enhance transparency and reproducibility.</p>

<p>(5) As FRG1 is a well-established tumor suppressor, additional cell-based functional assays under combined FRG1 and UPF1 perturbation (e.g., proliferation, migration, or survival assays) could help determine whether FRG1 influences cancer-associated phenotypes through modulation of the NMD pathway.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this thoughtful and constructive suggestion. While FRG1 is indeed a well-established tumor suppressor, incorporating additional cell-based functional assays under combined FRG1 and UPF1 perturbation would significantly broaden the scope of the current study. The present work is focused on elucidating the molecular relationship between FRG1 and the NMD pathway. Investigation of downstream cancer-associated phenotypes represents an important and interesting direction for future studies, but is beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p>

<p>(6) Given the claim that FRG1 inversely regulates NMD efficacy via UPF1, an epistasis experiment such as UPF1 overexpression in an FRG1-overexpressing background followed by an NMD reporter assay would provide stronger functional validation of pathway hierarchy.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer’s suggestion. To strengthen the functional validation of the proposed pathway hierarchy, we will perform an epistasis experiment by overexpressing UPF1 in an FRG1-overexpressing background and assess NMD activity using an established NMD reporter assay. The results of this experiment will be included in the revised manuscript.</p>
