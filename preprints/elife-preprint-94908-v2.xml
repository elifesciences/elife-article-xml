<title>Abstract</title>
<p>In congenital stationary night blindness type 2 (CSNB2)—a disorder involving the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 (L-type) Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel—visual impairment is mild considering that Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 mediates synaptic release from rod and cone photoreceptors. Here, we addressed this conundrum using a Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 knockout (KO) mouse and a knock-in (G369i KI) mouse expressing a non-conducting Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4. Surprisingly, Ca<sub>v</sub>3 (T-type) Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents were detected in cones of G369i KI mice and Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice but not in cones of wild-type mouse, ground squirrel, and macaque retina. Whereas Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice are blind, G369i KI mice exhibit normal photopic (i.e., cone-mediated) visual behavior. Cone synapses, which fail to form in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice, are present, albeit enlarged, and with some errors in postsynaptic wiring in G369i KI mice. While Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice lack evidence of cone synaptic responses, electrophysiological recordings in G369i KI mice revealed nominal transmission from cones to horizontal cells and bipolar cells. In CSNB2, we propose that Ca<sub>v</sub>3 channels maintain cone synaptic output provided that the nonconducting role of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 in cone synaptogenesis remains intact. Our findings reveal an unexpected form of homeostatic plasticity that relies on a non-canonical role of an ion channel.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>At the first synapse in the visual pathway, graded electrical signals produced in rod and cone photoreceptors gate the release of glutamate onto postsynaptic neurons. Photoreceptor synapses are specialized with a ribbon organelle, which helps prime synaptic vesicles, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> and postsynaptic neurites of horizontal and bipolar cells that invaginate deep within the terminal <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. A variety of proteins interact with the ribbon and synaptic vesicles near release sites (<italic>i.e.,</italic> active zones) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. The importance of these proteins for vision is illustrated by the numerous inherited retinal diseases linked to mutations in their encoding genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>One such gene is <italic>CACNA1F</italic>, which encodes the voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Ca<sub>v</sub>) channel expressed in retinal photoreceptors, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Among the sub-family of Ca<sub>v</sub>1 L-type channels, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 exhibits unusually slow inactivation that is well-matched for supporting the tonic, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent release of glutamate from photoreceptor synaptic terminals in darkness <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. More than 200 mutations in <italic>CACNA1F</italic> cause vision disorders including congenital stationary night blindness type 2 (CSNB2) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. These mutations are broadly categorized as producing a gain of function or loss of function in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. How these mutations in <italic>CACNA1F</italic> lead to the variable clinical phenotypes of CSNB2 is largely unknown. Symptoms may include strabismus, low visual acuity, and in many cases, night blindness <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. The latter suggests a primary defect in rod pathways, which is surprising given that Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 knockout (KO) mice are completely blind and lack any evidence of either rod or cone synaptic responses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. A major caveat is that rod and cone synapses do not form in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Thus, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice are not suitable for studies of how <italic>CACNA1F</italic> mutations differentially affect rod and cone pathways or for efforts to uncover how the biophysical properties of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 shape photoreceptor synaptic release properties.</p>
<p>Here, we overcome this hurdle with a knock-in mouse strain (G369i KI) expressing a non-conducting mutant form of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. We show that, although greatly impaired, cone synapses and downstream signaling through cone pathways can support photopic visual function in G369i KI mice. This novel mechanism requires the ability of the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 protein, independent of its Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductance, to nucleate the assembly of cone ribbon synapses and involves an aberrant Ca<sub>v</sub>3 (T-type) conductance that appears when Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are compromised.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Cone pedicles and ribbons are present in G369i KI mice but not in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice</title>
<p>The G369i mutation results in an insertion of a glycine residue in a transmembrane domain, which prevents Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeation through Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. The presence of rod synapses in G369i KI mice but not Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice indicates that the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 protein and not its Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductance is required for rod synapse assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. To test if this is also true for cones, we performed immunofluorescence and confocal analyses using antibodies against cone arrestin (CAR) and CtBP2 to label cone terminals (i.e., pedicles) and ribbons, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). In Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mouse retinas, cone pedicles were shrunken and retracted into the outer nuclear layer (ONL, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>) with little evidence of elongated ribbons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). In contrast, cone pedicles in G369i KI mice were normally localized in the outer plexiform layer (OPL, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>) and were populated by multiple ribbons that were associated with labeling for Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Some abnormalities were apparent in G369i KI cone pedicles, such as extremely elongated ribbons and telodendria extending towards the inner nuclear layer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1b</xref>). These results indicate that Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are dispensable for the integrity of ribbons and the pedicle but are necessary for their overall refinement.</p>

<title>Ca<sub>v</sub>3 channel activity is present in cones of G369i KI and Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice but not WT mice, ground squirrel, or macaque retina</title>
<p>A prevailing yet unsupported hypothesis regarding the relatively mild visual phenotypes in CSNB2 is that additional Ca<sub>v</sub> subtypes may compensate for Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 loss-of-function in cones. If so, then Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents (<italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic>) mediated by these subtypes should be evident in cones of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO and G369i KI mice. To test this, we performed patch clamp recordings of cones in retinal slices of adult WT, G369i KI, and Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice under conditions designed to isolate <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic>. During voltage ramps in WT cones, <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> activated around −50 mV and peaked near −20 mV, consistent with the properties of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a-d</xref>). While not observed in rods of G369i KI or Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, a small-amplitude <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> that activated around −60 mV and peaked near −35 mV was detected in cones of these mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2a-d</xref>). To uncover this low voltage-activated <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic>, we used a faster voltage ramp (0.5 mV/ms) than in the previous study of G369i KI rods (∼0.15 mV/ms)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. With this faster voltage ramp, <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> was not apparent in G369i KI rods (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supp.Fig.S1</xref>). Therefore, the aberrant <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> is an adaptation to Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 loss-of-function in cones but not rods.</p>

<p>We next used step depolarizations to identify the type of Ca<sub>v</sub> channel underlying <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> in G369i KI and Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO cones. Analysis of current-voltage (I-V) and conductance-voltage (G-V) relationships revealed a significant, hyperpolarizing shift (∼10 mV) in the voltage of half maximal activation (<italic>V<sub>h</sub></italic>) in G369i KI cones (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2c,d</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> in G369i KI cones was not sustained as in WT cones but inactivated rapidly during 500-ms step depolarizations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>).

<p>In a previous study, a Ca<sub>v</sub>3-like current was detected in patch clamp recordings of cone pedicles in WT mouse cones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. However, in recordings of WT mouse cone somas, we did not observe a low-voltage activated component in the I-V or G-V curves that would be indicative of a Ca<sub>v</sub>3 subtype (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2c,d</xref>). To further test for a Ca<sub>v</sub>3 contribution to <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> in WT mouse cones, we used a double pulse voltage protocol where <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> was evoked before (P1) and after (P2) a 500-ms step to −60 mV (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2g</xref>). With this protocol, the inactivation of Ca<sub>v</sub>3 channels by the −60 mV step should lead to a reduction in the amplitude of the P2 vs the P1 current. While such a reduction was clearly evident in cones of G369i KI mice (i.e., P2/P1 &lt; 1), there was no significant difference in the P2 and P1 currents in cones of WT mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2g-i</xref>).</p>
<p>We also used antagonists selective for Ca<sub>v</sub>1 and Ca<sub>v</sub>3 channels (isradipine and ML 218, respectively). As expected, <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> in WT cones was significantly but incompletely suppressed by isradipine (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). The <italic>V<sub>h</sub></italic> of the I-V was similar before (−36.5 ± 0.8 mV) and after (−38.3 ± 1.8 mV) perfusion of isradipine (t(3,4)=0.90, p = 0.43 by paired t-test), suggesting that the residual <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> after exposure to isradipine arose from unblocked Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 rather than Ca<sub>v</sub>3 channels. While ML 218 modestly inhibited <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> in some WT cones, the effect was not statistically significant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c,d</xref>) and could be attributed to weak activity on Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4. In transfected HEK293T cells, ML 218 modestly inhibited <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> and caused a negative shift in the <italic>V<sub>h</sub></italic> for Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4, in contrast to its strong inhibition of Ca<sub>v</sub>3.2 (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supp.Fig. S2</xref>). Like its effects on Ca<sub>v</sub>3.2, ML 218 nearly abolished <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> in cones of G369i KI mice whereas isradipine had little effect (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a-d</xref>).</p>

<p>Finally, we recorded from ground squirrel and macaque cones, where the large amplitude of <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> facilitates pharmacological and biophysical analyses. Consistent with its actions on Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 in WT mouse cones (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>) and transfected HEK293T cells (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supp.Fig. S2</xref>), ML 218 caused an insignificant inhibition of peak <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> (−7.0 ± 20.8%, n = 6 cones) as well as a negative shift in the voltage-dependence of activation in ground squirrel cones (<italic>Δ</italic>V<sub>1/2</sub> = −1.16 ± 0.94 mV, n = 6, mean ± SD, p = 0.029, t-test; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a,b</xref>). By contrast, application of isradipine dramatically suppressed <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> in cones in various regions of the ground squirrel retina (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c,d</xref>). Subsequent application of ML 218 did not reveal a Ca<sub>v</sub>3-like current: the I-V and G-V of the isradipine + ML 218-sensitive current were shifted in the positive rather than the negative direction relative to the isradipine-sensitive current (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4c-g</xref>). This result is consistent with the time- and voltage-dependent block of Ca<sub>v</sub>1 channels by dihydropyridine antagonists such as isradipine <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. As a positive control, we confirmed that ML 218 blocked a prominent Ca<sub>v</sub>3-type current in ground squirrel type 3a OFF cone bipolar cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4h,i</xref>). In recordings of macaque cone pedicles, we compared the properties of <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> using a holding voltage of −90 mV or −50 mV, the latter of which should inactivate Ca<sub>v</sub>3 channels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5a</xref>). There was no difference in the I-V or G-V relationships obtained at these holding voltages (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5b-e</xref>).

We conclude that Ca<sub>v</sub>3 channels do not normally contribute to <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> in cones of WT mice, ground squirrel, and macaque.</p>

<p>To test whether the appearance of the Ca<sub>v</sub>3-mediated <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> in G369i KI cones could result from an increase in the expression of a specific Ca<sub>v</sub>3 subtype (<italic>i.e.,</italic> Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1, Ca<sub>v</sub>3.2, or Ca<sub>v</sub>3.3), we initially tried labeling with commercially available antibodies against Ca<sub>v</sub>3.2. However, the data were unreliable since these antibodies produced a similar labeling pattern in Ca<sub>v</sub>3.2 KO retinal tissue (data not shown). As an alternative, we performed single cell RNA sequencing on cells isolated from the retina of WT and G369i KI mice (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig.S3</xref>). We sequenced 28,782 cells and, with unsupervised clustering at resolution=0.5, we grouped the cells into 20 clusters. Clusters 8 and 16 were identified as cones based on the expression of cone marker genes (e.g., Opn1sw, Opn1mw, Arr3, Gnat2).

<title>Cone synapses are enlarged with some errors in postsynaptic wiring in G369i KI mice</title>
<p>The replacement of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 with Ca<sub>v</sub>3 as the primary conduit for Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in G369i KI cones allowed us to dissect the importance of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals for the molecular and structural organization of the cone synapse. To this end, we first analyzed WT and G369i KI cone synapses by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. Presynaptic proteins such as bassoon and members of the postsynaptic signaling complex in depolarizing (ON) cone bipolar cells (GPR179, mGluR6, and TRPM1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>) were enriched near cone ribbons in G369i KI mice as in WT mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>).

Unlike in WT mice, the volume of presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins increased linearly with the volume of the pedicle in G369i KI mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e-i</xref>). These results show that the molecular determinants of the cone synapse can assemble in G369i KI mice but change in their sub-synaptic distribution in ways that correlate with the expansion of the cone pedicle.</p>

<p>The cone synapse is structurally complex, with the dendritic tips of two horizontal cells and an intervening ON cone bipolar cell invaginating deeply into the pedicle near the ribbon <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. To test how the switch in Ca<sub>v</sub> subtypes might affect this arrangement of postsynaptic partners, we generated 3D reconstructions of cone synapses by serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBFSEM; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). As with the enlarged synaptic contacts (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), structural modifications in G369i KI pedicles were evident. Compared to WT, ribbons in G369i KI pedicles appeared disorganized and were often parallel rather than perpendicular to the presynaptic membrane (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7a-c</xref>). Consistent with our confocal analyses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1</xref>), G369i KI cone pedicles extended telodendria in multiple directions rather than just apically (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>). In addition, a slightly larger fraction of synaptic sites in the G369i KI pedicle (35% vs 14% in WT) formed incorrect postsynaptic partnerships including with glia (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7b-d</xref>’; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Nevertheless, the number of ribbons is normal in G369i KI cones and about half of the ribbons make invaginating contacts with the appropriate cell types (<italic>i.e.,</italic> both horizontal cells and cone bipolar cells; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). On average, there were more vesicles associated with ribbons in cones of G369i KI mice (245 per ribbon) than of WT mice (178 per ribbon; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), but the difference did not reach statistical significance.

<title>Postsynaptic responses to light are present in horizontal cells of G369i KI mice but not Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice</title>
<p>Compared to Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice, the relative preservation of cone synapses in G369i KI mice allowed the unique opportunity to test whether a Ca<sub>v</sub> subtype other than Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 could support synaptic release. To this end, we analyzed synaptic transmission between cones and horizontal cells (HCs). In darkness, glutamate released from cones depolarizes horizontal cells via activation of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic (AMPA)/kainate receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. The resulting excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) undergoes a decline in response to light stimuli that hyperpolarize cones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. In WT HCs, a 1-s light flash (<italic>λ</italic>=410 nm) inhibited the standing EPSC, which is reflected as an outward (hyperpolarizing “ON”) current (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8a</xref>). Upon termination of the light, an inward (depolarizing “OFF”) current signaled the resumption of the EPSC (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8a</xref>). Both the ON and OFF responses in WT HCs increased with light intensity, reflecting the impact of luminance on the presynaptic membrane potential of cones and the subsequent change in glutamate release from their terminals (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8b</xref>).</p>

<p>Consistent with the lack of mature ribbons and abnormal cone pedicles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1</xref>), HC light responses were negligible in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig.8a,b</xref>). In contrast, the ON and OFF responses were present in G369i KI HCs although significantly lower in amplitude than in WT HCs (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8a,b</xref>). As expected, the EPSC in darkness and the light responses were abolished by the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist, DNQX, in both WT and G369i KI HCs (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8c,d</xref>). In addition to its smaller amplitude, the transient nature of the ON response in G369i KI HCs suggested inadequate cessation of cone glutamate release by light (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig.8b</xref>). Slow deactivation of Ca<sub>v</sub>3 channels and/or their activation at negative voltages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> could give rise to Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that support release following light-induced hyperpolarization of G369i KI cones.</p>
<p>To test if the diminished HC light responses correlated with lower presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in G369i KI cones, we performed 2-photon imaging of cone pedicles filled with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator Fluo3 and labeled with Alexa-568-conjugated peanut agglutinin. In WT cones, depolarization by K<sup>+</sup> (50 mM) caused a sustained increase of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> = 1.85 ± 0.1, n = 11 terminals) that was significantly lower after the addition of isradipine (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> = 1.44 ± 0.07, p = 0.0015 by repeated measures one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison posthoc test; F[1.608, 16.08] = 55.17; p &lt; 0.0001; <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig.9a,b</xref>). The Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal remaining in the presence of isradipine could arise from unblocked Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 channels and/or Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular stores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. In G369i KI cones, the peak amplitude of the K<sup>+</sup>-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> = 1.07 ± 0.02, n = 14 terminals) was significantly lower than in WT cones (t(23)=8.74, p &lt; 0.0001 by unpaired t-test, n = 14 terminals). The decrease in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in the G369i KI cone pedicles during isradipine exposure paralleled that during the depolarization (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig.9a</xref>), suggesting it was not a consequence of Ca<sub>v</sub>1 blockade. The lower amplitude and more transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals mediated by Ca<sub>v</sub>3 channels may be cleared more rapidly in G369i KI cones as compared to prolonged Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4-initiated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in WT cones. Taken together, our results suggest that Ca<sub>v</sub>3 channels nominally support Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and synaptic transmission in cones of G369i KI mice.</p>

<title>Light responses of bipolar cells and visual behavior are present in G369i KI but not Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice</title>
<p>While HCs play important roles in lateral inhibition of photoreceptor output, the vertical dissemination of visual information from cones to the inner retina is relayed by glutamate to ON and OFF cone bipolar cells (CBCs) which express mGluR6 and AMPA/kainate receptors, respectively. To test for the existence of cone to CBC transmission in G369i KI mice, we recorded electroretinograms (ERGs) under light-adapted conditions using Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice as a negative control (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10a-d</xref>). In these recordings, the light-induced response of photoreceptors and the postsynaptic response of ON CBCs corresponds to the a- and b-waves, respectively. Unlike in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice, the a-waves of G369i KI mice resembled those in WT mice, which indicates that cones do not degenerate in this mouse strain (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10a,b</xref>). While greatly reduced in amplitude, the b-wave was measurable in G369i KI mice and significantly larger than in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice at the highest light intensities (F(14,104)=41, p&lt;0.0001, post-hoc Tukey’s p=0.0038 at 2.3 log cd·s/m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>; <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10a,b</xref>). We also recorded flicker ERGs using 10 Hz light stimuli that can isolate cone pathways involving both ON and OFF CBCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. In WT mice, flicker responses exhibited two peaks, one at a lower irradiance (−2 log cd·s/m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>) and one at higher irradiance (0.5 log cd·s/m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>; <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig.10c,d</xref>). The peak at the lower irradiance is attributed to responses in both rod and cone pathways, and the peak at higher irradiance is attributed to responses exclusively in cone pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Flicker responses in G369i KI mice showed a similar non-monotonic relation as in WT mice but were significantly lower in amplitude (F(26,143)=51.18, p&lt;0.0001, post-hoc Tukey’s p=0.0237 at 2.5 log cd·s/m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>; <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig.10c,d</xref>). The inverted flicker responses at higher illuminations in G369i KI mice were absent in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice and may result from the hyperpolarizing contribution of cone-to-OFF CBC transmission (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig.10c</xref>).</p>
<p>To test whether the cone synaptic responses in G369i KI mice enable vision-guided behavior, we used a swim test that assesses the ability of mice to identify a visible platform<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Under scotopic (dark) conditions, G369i KI and Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice took significantly longer to find the platform compared to WT mice (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10e,f</xref>). These results are consistent with flicker response assays (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig.10c,d</xref>) as well as the absence of <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> in rods and rod-to-rod bipolar cell synaptic transmission in G369i KI mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Under photopic (light) conditions, G369i KI mice but not Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice performed as well as WT mice (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10e,f</xref>). Thus, G369i KI mice have enough visual function under photopic conditions to quickly find the platform. Collectively, our results suggest that Ca<sub>v</sub>3 channels can support cone synaptic responses that are sufficient for visual behavior in G369i KI but not Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The nervous system has remarkable abilities to adapt to pathological perturbations in neuronal activity. In the retina, ablation or degeneration of photoreceptors triggers various postsynaptic mechanisms that maintain some level of visual function in rod or cone pathways. These include remodeling of bipolar cell dendrites and their synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> as well as changes in the sensitivity of bipolar cells to photoreceptor input and inhibitory modulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence for a presynaptic form of homeostatic plasticity that originates within photoreceptors. Using Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO and G369i KI mice, we identify the upregulation of a Ca<sub>v</sub>3 conductance as a common response to Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 loss-of-function in cones. However, Ca<sub>v</sub>3 channels can only compensate for Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 loss-of-function if the basic aspects of cone synapse structure are maintained through expression of the G369i mutant channel. Thus, our results also highlight a crucial, non-conducting role for the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 protein that allows cone synapses to function in the absence of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals.</p>

<title>A non-canonical role for Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 in regulating cone synapse assembly</title>
<p>As shown for rod synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, ribbons and other components of the pre- and post-synaptic complex assemble at cone synapses in G369i KI mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>,<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>,<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Ca<sub>v</sub>3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are dispensable for this process since their presence in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO cones is not accompanied by any semblance of ribbon synapses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1b</xref>). An intimate relationship between Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 and ribbons is supported by the colocalization of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 and puncta resembling ribbon precursor spheres in the developing OPL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 interacts directly or indirectly with a variety of ribbon synapse associated proteins including RIM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, CAST/ERC2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, bassoon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, unc119<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, and a major component of the ribbon, RIBEYE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 could pioneer sites of ribbon assembly perhaps by serving as a docking or nucleation site for the active zone. At the same time, ribbon-associated proteins help cluster Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 near ribbons since knockout of these proteins in mice leads to fewer presynaptic Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 channels and in some cases shortened ribbons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Regardless of the mechanism, our findings show that the formation of photoreceptor synaptic complexes does not require Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 channels.</p>

<title>Functional Ca<sub>v</sub>3 channels are present in cones in the absence of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals</title>
<p>Our drop-seq analysis aligns with previous studies indicating that <italic>Cacna1h</italic> is expressed at extremely low levels compared to <italic>Cacna1f</italic> in WT mouse cones (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supp.Fig.S3</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. However, in contrast to recordings of WT mouse cone pedicles in a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, we found no evidence for Ca<sub>v</sub>3-mediated currents in somatic recordings of cones in WT mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs.2</xref>,<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). We do not feel the discrepancy results from the different recording configurations given the electrically compact nature of cones. Moreover, recordings from macaque cone pedicles and from the ellipsoids of cylindrically-shaped ground squirrel cones also did not reveal a Ca<sub>v</sub>3-mediated current (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs.4</xref>,<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). We acknowledge that there are caveats of the pharmacological approach used in our study as well as the previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. For example, dihydropyridine antagonists such as isradipine have relatively low affinity for some Ca<sub>v</sub>1 subtypes, including Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> and have strongly voltage-dependent blocking properties. At a holding voltage of −90 mV, isradipine at 1 μM causes only ∼80% inhibition of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 with greater block at depolarized voltages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, which agrees with our recordings of cones in WT mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3a</xref>) and ground squirrels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4b-e</xref>). Moreover, in the low micromolar range, Ca<sub>v</sub>3 blockers such as Z944 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> and ML 218 (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supp.Fig. S2</xref>) have nonspecific effects on Ca<sub>v</sub>1 current amplitude and activation voltage. Thus, Ca<sub>v</sub> channels mediating a <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> that is suppressed by Ca<sub>v</sub>3 blockers and spared by dihydropyridines at negative voltages may be mistakenly categorized as Ca<sub>v</sub>3 subtypes. In our experiments, the biophysical properties of the isradipine-sensitive <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> in cones of WT mice and ground squirrels resembled only those of Ca<sub>v</sub>1, whereas those of the ML 218-sensitive <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> in cones of G369i KI mice resembled only those of Ca<sub>v</sub>3. Therefore, we favor the interpretation that Ca<sub>v</sub>3 contributes to <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> in mouse cones only upon silencing of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 either by KO of the corresponding protein or by silencing its conductance.</p>
<p>Since <italic>Cacna1h</italic> expression was similar in WT and G369i KI cones (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supp.Fig.S3</xref>), what causes the increased Ca<sub>v</sub>3 channel activity in the latter? Among the Ca<sub>v</sub>3 subtypes, Ca<sub>v</sub>3.2 is uniquely sensitive to post-translational modifications that facilitate the opening of the channel and/or its cell surface trafficking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. For example, Ca<sub>v</sub>3.2 interacts with the deubiquitinating enzyme USP5 which enhances levels of Ca<sub>v</sub>3.2 protein levels by suppressing its proteasomal degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. In addition, Ca<sub>v</sub>3.2 is phosphorylated by calmodulin-dependent kinase II<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> and cyclin-dependent kinase 5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, which enhances channel activation and current density, respectively. Further interrogation of our drop-seq dataset could illuminate novel Ca<sub>v</sub>3.2-regulatory pathways that are modified in G369i KI cones.</p>

<title>Consequences of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 loss of function and relevance for CSNB2</title>
<p>Despite having the same complement of proteins as in WT mice, cone synapses in G369i KI mice were enlarged and made errors in postsynaptic partner selection (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs.6</xref>,<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). While I-V curves indicate similar peak <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> amplitudes in cones of WT and G369i KI mice near the membrane potential of cones in darkness (−45 to −50 mV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2a,c</xref>), the strong inactivation of Ca<sub>v</sub>3 channels and/or reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular stores likely account for the greatly diminished Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in G369i KI pedicles (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig.9</xref>). Paradoxically, reductions in presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in rod photoreceptors correlated with illumination-dependent shrinkage of ribbons <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. However, ribbon synapse size increases with low presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in zebrafish sensory hair cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. The mechanism involves decreased mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and increase in the redox state of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Ca<sub>v</sub>3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals may decay too quickly in G369i KI cones (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig.9</xref>) to enable mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake or other mechanisms that trim ribbons.</p>

<p>An intriguing result was the linear increase in ribbon synapse size with pedicle volume in G369i KI but not in WT mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e-i</xref>), which could represent a form of homeostatic synaptic scaling as has been demonstrated at the neuromuscular junction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Similarly, the presence of some non-invaginating contacts with incorrect partner pairings in G369i KI mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) could be an attempt to increase synaptic connectivity to compensate for weakened synaptic output. Consistent with this possibility, diminished presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and non-invaginating cone synapses also characterize the retina of mice lacking the extracellular <italic>α</italic><sub>2</sub><italic>δ−</italic>4 subunit of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. The cone synapses of G369i KI mice and <italic>α</italic><sub>2</sub><italic>δ−</italic>4 KO mice are clearly functional given that photopic visual behavior is preserved in both mouse strains (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig.10e,f</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> and, in the case of G369i KI mice, HCs exhibit EPSCs whose amplitude decreases with light and AMPA/kainate receptor blockade (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig.8</xref>). Defects in cone synaptic transmission that correlate with aberrant cone synapse morphology and connectivity also typify a mouse strain with a gain-of function mutation in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 linked to CSNB2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. Thus, balanced presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals may be needed to encode the correct post-synaptic wiring and structure of the cone synapse.</p>
<p>In addition to structural abnormalities in cone synapses, the inability of Ca<sub>v</sub>3 channels to support sustained presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry likely contributed to the impaired light responses in HCs and CBCs in G369i KI mice (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figs.8</xref>,<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). Due to their slow activation and strong inactivation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>, Ca<sub>v</sub>3 channels are not expected to fuel the Ca<sup>2+</sup> nanodomains that support fast and sustained components of release, both of which occur only at ribbon sites in cones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Ca<sub>v</sub>3 channels may also be located further from the ribbon than Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4, thus lowering the efficiency of coupling to exocytosis. Regardless of the features that differentiate the contributions of Ca<sub>v</sub>3 and Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 to cone synaptic release, our findings provide further support for the widely held view that Ca<sub>v</sub>1 channels are well-suited to support transmission at ribbon-type synapses.</p>
<p>Based on extremely heterogeneous clinical presentations, CSNB2 manifests as a spectrum of visual disorders that originate from various mutations in <italic>CACNA1F</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. Even though some CSNB2 mutant Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 channels may traffic normally to the plasma membrane, many of these mutations are expected to produce non-functional, non-conducting Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Yet, the visual phenotypes of CSNB2 patients are not as severe as the complete blindness in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice, which lack any Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 protein expression and exhibit no signs of visual behavior (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig.10e,f</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Collectively, our results suggest that G369i KI mice accurately model Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 channelopathies in CSNB2 patients that are characterized by a greater impairment in rod than in cone pathways. This interpretation is supported by our findings that G369i KI mice exhibit horizontal cell responses to bright but not dim illumination (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>), ERG responses under conditions of light adaptation (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig.10a-d</xref>) but not dark-adaptation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, and visual behavior under photopic but not scotopic conditions (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10e,f</xref>). Together with the enlargement of synaptic sites, modest levels of synaptic release from cones of G369i KI mice may support nominal transmission of visual information through cone pathways. G369i KI mice could also exhibit homeostatic alterations in the inner retina, which are known to support visual function when photoreceptor input is severely compromised <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Future studies of the retinal circuitry and visual behavior of G369i KI mice could identify compensatory pathways that are recruited upon Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 loss-of-function and how they might be targeted in novel therapies for CSNB2 and related disorders.</p>

Slides with mounted cryosections were warmed to room temperature, washed with 0.1 M PB for 30 min to remove the OCT/sucrose mixture and blocked with dilution solution (DS, 0.1 M PB/10% goat serum/0.5% Triton-X100) for 15 min or overnight at room temperature. All remaining steps were carried out at room temperature. All primary antibodies and appropriate secondary antibodies were diluted in DS at concentrations specified in the Key Resources Table (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Sections were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h or overnight and then washed five times with 0.1 M PB. Sections were then incubated with secondary antibodies for 30 min and then washed five times with 0.1 M PB. Trace 0.1 M PB was removed, and sections were then mounted with #1.5H coverslips (ThorLabs) using ProLong Glass Antifade Mountant with or without NucBlue (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p>

<p>For double labeling with other rabbit polyclonal antibodies, CAR antibodies were conjugated with the CF647 fluorophore (CAR-647) using the Mix-n-Stain antibody labeling kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Biotium). Sections were processed first with rabbit polyclonal Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 or EAAT2 antibodies and corresponding secondary antibodies as described above. To prevent CAR-647 from binding to any available sites on the anti-rabbit secondary antibodies previously added to the sections, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.4 or EAAT2 antibodies were readded to the sections and incubated for 30 min. After washing, the sections were incubated with CAR-647 for 1 h, followed by wash steps and cover glass mounting.</p>
<p>Immunofluorescence in labeled retinal sections was visualized using an Olympus FV3000 confocal microscope (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an UPlanApo 60x oil HR objective (1.5 NA). Images were captured using the Olympus FLUOVIEW software package. Acquisition settings were optimized using a saturation mask to prevent signal saturation prior to collecting 16-bit. All confocal images presented are maximum z-projections. Images (256 x 256 pixels) used in analyses of synaptic proteins were collected using a 30X optical zoom, 0.6 Airy disk aperture, and voxel size of 0.028 <italic>μm</italic> × 0.028 <italic>μm</italic> × 0.2 <italic>μm</italic> (<italic>X</italic> × <italic>Y</italic> × <italic>Z</italic>). Amira segmentation was used for generating 3D binary masks, and Amira 3D label analysis was used for quantification of immunofluorescent and masked images. Non-deconvolved images were used for all analyses. 3D binary masks of individual CAR-labeled pedicles were made by setting the threshold 1 standard deviation above mean fluorescence intensity of each 3D image. 3D binary masks of presynaptic labels (CtBP2, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.4, and Bassoon) or postsynaptic labels (GPR179, mGluR6, and TRPM1) within or associated with the pedicle, respectively, were made by setting the threshold 3 standard deviations above the mean fluorescence intensity. To aid in presentation, high-mag images displayed in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs.1b</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref> were deconvolved using cellSens software (Olympus), and any immunofluorescence corresponding to rod synaptic proteins was subtracted from the image.</p>

<title>Patch clamp electrophysiology</title>
<p>Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings of transfected HEK293T cells were performed 48 to 72 hrs after transfection using an EPC-10 amplifier and Patchmaster software (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany). Patch pipette electrodes with a tip resistance between 4 and 6 M<italic>Ω</italic> were pulled from thin-walled borosilicate glass capillaries (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) using a P-97 Flaming/Brown Puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA). A reference Ag/AgCl wire was placed into the culture dish mounted on an inverted Olympus IX70 microscope. Recordings were performed at room temperature. A pressurized perfusion pencil multi-barrel manifold controlled with Valve Bank II (AutoMate Scientific, Inc., Berkeley, CA) was used to deliver extracellular solutions. ML218 of different concentrations (0.5, 1, 5, 25 and 100 mM) was added to the extracellular solution the day of experiments. Series resistance was compensated up to 70%, and passive membrane leak subtraction was conducted using a P/−4 protocol. Whole-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents (<italic>I</italic><sub>Ca</sub>) of transfected HEK293T cells were evoked for 50 ms with incremental +5 mV steps from −80 mV to +65 mV. Current-Voltage (IV) data were fit with a single Boltzmann equation: <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> = <italic>G<sub>max</sub>(V<sub>m</sub>-V<sub>r</sub></italic>)/(1+exp[-(<italic>V<sub>m</sub>-V<sub>h</sub>))/k</italic>]), where G<sub>max</sub> is the maximal conductance, <italic>V<sub>m</sub></italic> is the test voltage, <italic>V<sub>r</sub></italic> is the Ca<sup>2+</sup> reversal potential, <italic>V<sub>h</sub></italic> is the membrane potential required to activate 50% of <italic>G<sub>max</sub></italic>, and k is the slope factor.

Patch pipette electrodes with a tip resistance between 10 and 14 M<italic>Ω</italic> for cones and 6-8 for horizontal cells were pulled from thick-walled borosilicate glass (1.5 mm outer diameter; 0.84 mm inner diameter; World Precision Instruments).</p>
<p>To prepare retinal slices, adult mice (6 – 8 weeks old) were anesthetized using isoflurane and euthanized by cervical dislocation. Eyes were enucleated, placed into cold Ames’ media slicing solution, and hemisected. Following removal of the vitreous, the eye cup was separated into dorsal and ventral halves using a scalpel. Ventral retina was isolated, molded into low-melt agarose and mounted in a Leica VT1200s vibratome (Leica Biosystems). Mouse retina slicing solution was continuously bubbled with 100% O<sub>2</sub> and contained the following: Ames’ Medium with L-glutamine supplemented with (in mM) 15 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 10 U/mL penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin, pH 7.4, osmolarity 300 mOsm/kg. Vertical (∼200 µm) or horizontal (∼160 µm) retinal slices were anchored in a recording chamber, placed onto a fixed stage, and positioned under an upright Olympus BX51WI microscope equipped with a 60X water-immersion objective (1.0 NA), and superfused with extracellular solution (flow rate of ∼1-2 ml/min) at room temperature.

<p>Cone somas were identified based on their morphology and location (outer ONL cell layer). Cone identity was confirmed by the whole-cell capacitance (∼3-4 pF), which is larger than rod whole-cell capacitance (∼0.7-1 pF). For cone voltage ramp recordings, cones were held at - 90 mV for 200 ms followed by a ramp of +0.5 mV/ms to +40 mV. To determine voltage activation of <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca</sub>, whole-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents in cones were evoked for 50 ms with incremental +5 mV steps from −80 mV to +40 mV. The activation voltage of <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca</sub> is reported as G/G<sub>max</sub>, where G is the conductance at each test voltage and G<sub>max</sub> is the maximum peak conductance for each cone.</p>
<p>Conductance was calculated using the equation <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> = G(V<sub>m</sub>-V<sub>r</sub>), where V<sub>r</sub> is +60 mV. To determine steady state inactivation of <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca</sub>, currents in cones were evoked for 500 ms with incremental +5 mV steps from −90 mV and −30 mV followed by a final step to −30 mV for 50 ms after each test voltage.

Data were sampled between 20 and 60 kHz and filtered at 3 kHz.</p>
<p>For horizontal cell light responses, horizontal slices were prepared from central mouse retina. The identity of horizontal cells was determined based on their larger soma diameter (∼15 μm) compared to bipolar cell somas (∼6 μm). During whole cell patch clamp recordings, horizontal cells were held at −70 mV. Light stimuli (1 s) at 410 nm (630 x 830 μm) were presented onto the retina (at a minimum of 5 s intervals) through the microscope’s condenser using a Polygon1000 DMD pattern illuminator (Mightex, Pleasanton, CA, USA) and a custom-built light path. Light intensity (in watts) was measured at the point on the microscope stage where the retina is placed using a power meter (Thorlabs, Newton, New Jersey, USA). Photon flux Ф<italic><sub>q</sub></italic> (photons/s) within the light stimulus area was calculated using the measured light intensities in the formula:

where <italic>h</italic> is Planck’s constant (J*s), <italic>c</italic> is the speed of light (m/s), and λ is the wavelength (m). Light stimulus intensity was increased in Log2 steps from 4.9×10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> to 2.1×10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> Ф<italic><sub>q</sub></italic>/μm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. For each light intensity step, both ON and OFF current amplitudes were measured from baseline (averaged 5 ms of current prior to light onset) to the maximum positive (after light onset) or maximum negative (after light offset) current, respectively. To confirm the identity of these horizontal cell light responses as AMPA-mediated currents, 1 s light stimuli (410 nm, 1.2×10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> Ф<italic><sub>q</sub></italic>/μm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>) were continuously delivered every 10 s before, during and after bath application of 20 μM DNQX.</p>
<p>For voltage clamp recordings of 13-lined ground squirrel cones, retinal slices were prepared as previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. The eyecup was divided along the dorsal to ventral axis into superior, middle, and inferior parts. The dorsal area above the line of the optic nerve head was defined as superior, the central region with a width of about 5 mm just ventral to the optic nerve head was middle, and the remaining ventral area was inferior. Isradipine and ML218, alone or in combination, were applied from separate puffer pipettes whose orifices were aimed at the cone synaptic region. Recordings were made with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices). Signals were electronically filtered at 5 kHz and digitized at a rate of 10 kHz. Additional Gaussian filtering was added (cutoff frequency of 500 Hz). Tissue was viewed through a 63x water immersion objective on a Zeiss Axioskop FS2 microscope and superfused with extracellular solution at room temperature. Drugs and their concentrations used during these experiments are described in <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Membrane potential was continuously maintained at −85 mV. During ramp stimulation, the membrane potential was depolarized to −85 to +35 mV at a rate of 1 mV/ms.</p>
<p>For rhesus macaque cone terminal recordings, a 12-year-old male was sedated with ketamine (5 mg/kg I.M.) and dexmedetomidine (0.015 mg/kg I.M.). Post-sedation, the animal received buprenorphine (0.02 mg/kg I.M.), atropine (0.02 mg/kg I.M.), and maropitant citrate (1 mg/kg S.Q.). The animal was intubated and maintained with inhaled isoflurane (0.75-2.0%) and propofol (7-8 mg/kg/hr I.V.). Crystalloid fluids (5 mL/kg/hr) were administered I.V., and phenylephrine (5-10 mcg/kg/hr I.V.) was used for blood pressure support. The animal was under anesthesia for approximately 3 hours prior to perfusion. Transcardial perfusion was approached through a midline thoracotomy. Immediately prior to perfusion, 5 mL of Euthasol® (sodium pentobarbital 390 mg/mL/phenytoin sodium 50 mg/mL) was administered I.V. The descending thoracic aorta was clamped, the pericardium was opened, and the right atrium was cut. The apex of the left ventricle was sharply incised, and a large bore cannula (Yankauer suction handle, 5 mm internal diameter) was inserted through the left ventricle until it could be palpated in the ascending aorta. The cannula was clamped in place at the apex of the left ventricle. The animal was perfused with 4 L of cold phosphate-buffered saline at ∼500 mL/min. Eyes were removed approximately 1 hour following perfusion. Eyes were dissected, and eye cups were allowed to dark adapt for ∼30 min and stored in bicarbonate buffered Ames’ media at 32°C equilibrated with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub> prior to slice preparations. Vertical sections of central retina were prepared from 5 mm retina punches as described for mice.</p>

Two retinas were incubated in a 2.5 ml of dissociation solution (40 U/ml papain, 2 mM L-cysteine, 200 U/ml DNAse in Earle’s Balanced Salt Solution, EBSS) for 8 min at 37 °C. Following aspiration, 2 ml of inactivation solution (ovomucoid protease inhibitor and bovine serum albumin (BSA), 10 mg/ml each in EBSS) was added prior to trituration with a series of fire-polished, siliconized glass Pasteur pipettes. The solution was passed through a 40 μm mesh (pluriStrainer, Cat# 43-50040-51, pluriSelect) prior to centrifugation (200 x <italic>g</italic> for 5 min, 4 °C).

<p>Eye cups were prepared from P42 WT and G369i KI littermates and fixed using 4% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, for 4 hours at room temperature followed by additional fixation overnight at 4°C. Glutaraldehyde-fixed eye cups were then washed 3 times in 0.1M cacodylate buffer. Retinas were thereafter isolated and embedded in Durcupan resin after staining, dehydration, and embedding as described previously (Della Santina et al., 2016). A Thermo Scientific VolumeScope serial block face scanning electron micrscope was used to image embedded retinas. Retinal regions comprising a 2×2 montage of 40.96 μm tiles were imaged at a resolution of 5nm/pixel and section thickness of 50 nm.

<title>Electroretinography</title>
<p>Retinal function was assessed using the Celeris system (Diagnosys, Inc.) paired with the Espion software (Diagnosys, Inc.). Mice were anaesthetized under red light (660 nm) via intraperitoneal (I.P.) injection with ketamine/xylazine mixture (100 mg/kg ketamine, 10 mg/kg xylazine). Tropicamide ophthalmic solution (1 %) and hypromellose lubricant eye gel (0.3 %) were administered topically to both eyes before the mouse was secured to a heated (37 °C) platform to maintain body temperature. Ag/AgCl corneal stimulators were placed on each eye. After collecting data from individual mice, atipamezole (Antisedan, 1-2 mg/kg) was I.P. injection administered to reverse the effects of the ketamine and xylazine. For photopic ERGs, eyes were light adapted using a background green light at 20 cd·s/m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> for 10 min.

WT, G369i KI, and Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO male and female mice (6-9 weeks old) were dark-adapted overnight and allowed to adapt to the procedure room for at least 1 h prior to beginning the experiments. A water-filled, 4-foot diameter galvanized steel tank and a visible white platform with a diameter of 10 cm was used for the swim test. Mice were subjected to 6 swim trials per day. Assays conducted under photopic (55 lux) and scotopic conditions (0 lux) were performed on days 1 and 2, respectively. Light intensity for photopic and scotopic conditions was measured at the platform using an Extech HD450 light meter (FLIR Systems, Nashua, New Hampshire). Mice were given 90 s to find the platform before being removed. After one trial was performed on all mice, the platform was moved to one of three different locations, top left, top center, and top right in relation to the initial site of mouse placement in tank. Each trial was recorded using an infrared camera (Basler AG, Ahrensburg, Germany) and EthoVision XT16 software (Noldus Information Technology). Locating the platform was considered successful when mice contacted the platform with a head-on approach, even if mice failed to escape onto the platform. Mice were allowed to rest on the platform for 15 s at the end of each trial before being returned to a pre-warmed cage. Latency to find the platform was manually recorded and confirmed using recorded videos. Male and female mice were tested separately, and no sex differences in performance were identified post-hoc using two-way RM-ANOVA (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).

High-K+ extracellular solution contained (in mM) 65 NaCl, 50 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 3 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10 Na Pyruvate, 22.5 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 5 HEPES, 10 Glucose, osmolarity 300 ± 5 mOsm/kg. Extracellular solutions were supplemented with 20 <italic>μ</italic>M CNQX, 25 <italic>μ</italic>M L-APV, and 100 <italic>μ</italic>M picrotoxin. Isradipine (10 <italic>μ</italic>M) was added to High-K+ extracellular solution. Images (512×512) were collected as 15-frame averages at 0.93 Hz using ScanImage (MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT, USA). Changes of Fluo-3 fluorescence in cone terminals were measured in ROIs drawn juxtaposed to PNA-CF568 labeling using Fiji<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Based on analyses of retinae from genetically modified mice, and from wild-type ground squirrel and macaque, employing microscopic imaging, electrophysiology, and pharmacological manipulations, this <bold>valuable</bold> study on the role of Cav1.4 calcium channels in cone photoreceptor cells (i) shows that the expression of a Cav1.4 variant lacking calcium conductivity supports the development of cone synapses beyond what is observed in the complete absence of Cav1.4, and (ii) indicates that the cone pathway can partially operate even without calcium flux through Cav1.4 channels, thus preserving behavioral responses under bright light. The evidence for the function of Cav1.4 protein in synapse development is <bold>convincing</bold> and in agreement with a closely related earlier study by the same authors on rod photoreceptors. The mechanism of compensation of Cav1.4 loss by Cav3 remains unclear but appears to involve post-transcriptional processes. As congenital Cav1.4 dysfunction can cause stationary night blindness, this work relates to a wide range of neuroscience topics, from synapse biology to neuro-ophthalmology.</p>

<p>Cav1.4 calcium channels control voltage-dependent calcium influx at photoreceptor synapses, and congenital loss of Cav1.4 function causes stationary night blindness CSNB2. Based on a broad portfolio of methodological approaches - genetic mouse models, immunolabeling and microscopic imaging, serial block-face-SEM, ERGs, and electrophysiology - the authors show that cone photoreceptor synapse development is strongly perturbed in the absence of Cav1.4 protein, and that expression of a nonconducting Cav1.4 channel mitigates these perturbations. Further data indicate that Cav3 channels are present, which, according to the authors, may compensate for the loss of Cav1.4 calcium currents and thus maintain cone synaptic transmission. These data, which are in agreement with a similar study by the same authors on rod photoreceptor synapses, help to explain what functional defects exactly cause CSNB2 and why it is accompanied by only mild visual impairment.</p>
<p>The strengths of the present study are its conceptual and experimental soundness, the broad spectrum of cutting-edge methodological approaches pursued, and the convincing differential analysis of mutant phenotypes. Weaknesses mainly concern the mechanism by which Cav3 channels might partially compensate for the loss of Cav1.4 calcium currents.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The authors should perform experiments to answer this question: does Cav3 transcription increase in the G369i-KI, or is there instead some post-transcriptional modulation that permits surface expression of functional Cav3-containing channels in the absence of typical HVA Ca conductances? Also, the authors should determine whether G369i-KI can mediate Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and whether release from stores is upregulated as Cav3-containing channel expression (or function) is increased.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We performed transcriptomic (drop-seq) analysis to test whether a Cav3 subtype is upregulated in cones of G369i KI mice. These experiments show that, consistent with previous studies (PMID 35803735, 26000488), Cacna1h appears to be the primary Cav3 subtype expressed mouse cones. However, as shown in new Supp.Fig.S3, there was no significant difference in the levels of Cacna1h transcripts in WT and G369i KI cones. Therefore, we propose that there may be some post-transcriptional modification, or alteration in a pathway that regulates channel availability, that enables the contribution Cav3 channels to the whole-cell Ca2+ current in the absence of functional Cav1.4 channels cones.</p>
<p>We also performed Ca2+ imaging experiments in WT vs G369i KI cone terminals to assess whether the diminutive Cav3 current in G369i KI cone terminals may be compensated by upregulation of a Ca2+ signal such as from intracellular stores. Arguing against this possibility, depolarization-evoked Ca2+ signals in G369i KI cones were dramatically reduced compared to WT cones (new Fig.9).</p>

<p>Major points-</p>
<p>(1) It is stated in too many places that cone features in the Cav1.4 knock-in are &quot;intact&quot;, preserved, or spared, but this representation is not accurate. There are two instances in this study that qualify as intact when comparing KI to WT: 1) the photopic a-waves in the Cav1.4 knock-in (also demonstrated in Maddox et al 2020) and 2) latency to the platform (current MS, Figure 7f). However, in the numerous instances listed below, the authors compared the Cav1.4 knock-in to the Cav1.4 knock-out, and then referred to the KI as exhibiting intact responses. The reference point for intactness needs to be wildtype, as appropriately done for Figures 2 and 3, and when comparing the KI to the KO the phrasing should be altered; for example: &quot;the KI was spared from the extensive degeneration witnessed in the KO....&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In most cases, we clearly note that there are key differences in the WT and the G369i KI cone synapses, which highlight the importance of Cav1.4-specific Ca2+ signals for certain aspects of the cone synapse. We disagree with the reviewer on the point that we did not often use the WT as a reference since most of our experiments involved comparisons of only WT and G369i KI (Figs. 3-6) or WT, G369i KI, and Cav1.4 KO (Figs.1,7—and in these cases comparisons specifically between WT and G369i KI mice were included). We used “intact” as a descriptor for G369i KI cone synapses since these are actually present, albeit abnormal in the G369i KI retina, whereas cone synapses are completely absent in the Cav1.4 KO retina. To avoid confusion, we modified our use of “intact” and “preserved” where appropriate.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>A. Abstract, line 34 to 35: &quot;.......preserved in KI but not in KO.&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Abstract was rewritten and this line was removed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>B. Line 36: &quot;....synaptogenesis remains intact&quot;. The MS documents many differences in the morphology of KI and WT cones (immunofluorescence and electron microscopy data), which is counter to an intact phenotype.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The sentence was: “In CSNB2, we propose that Cav3 channels maintain cone synaptic output provided that the Ca2+-independent role of Cav1.4 in cone synaptogenesis remains intact.”</p>
<p>Here the meaning of “intact” refers to the Ca2+ -independent role of Cav1.4, not synapses. Thus, we have left the sentence unchanged.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>C. This strikes the right balance, lines 67 to 68: &quot;....although greatly impaired.....&quot;.</p>
<p>D. Line 149, &quot;Cone signaling to a postsynaptic partner is intact in G369i KI mice&quot;. This description is inaccurate. Here there is only WT and KI, and the text reads as follows in line 162: &quot;terminals (Figure 6b). The ON and OFF components of EPSCs in G369i KI HCs were measurable, although lower in amplitude than in WT (Figure 6a,b).&quot; Neither &quot;measurable&quot; nor &quot;lower in amplitude&quot; meet the definition of &quot;intact&quot;, and actual numerical values are lacking in the text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added results showing that there are no light responses in the Cav1.4 KO horizontal cells and have modified the sentence to: “Cone synaptic responses are present in horizontal cells of G369i KI but not Cav1.4 KO mice”.</p>
<p>We have modified discussion of these results as (line 210-213): “Consistent with the lack of mature ribbons and abnormal cone pedicles (Fig.1), HC light responses were negligible in Cav1.4 KO mice (Fig.8a,b). In contrast, the ON and OFF responses were present in G369i KI HCs although significantly lower in amplitude than in WT HCs (Fig. 8a,b).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>E. Please add a legend to Figure 6a to indicate the intensities. The shape of the KI responses is different from the control which is worthy of discussion: i) there is no clear cessation of HC EPSCs in the KI during the light ON period (when release stops, Im fluctuations should be minimal), and ii) the &quot;peaked&quot; appearances of the initial 500ms of the On and Off periods are very similar in shape for the KI (hard to interpret in the same fashion as a control response). How were the On and Off amplitudes analyzed? Furthermore, the OFF current is not summarized in Figure 6D, but should not this be when Cav3 should be opening and triggering release: Off response-EPSC? Lastly, Figure 6b,d shows a ~70% reduction in On-current in the KI, and the KI example of 6b an 80% reduction in Off current compared to WT. Yet, the only place asterisks are used to indicate sig diff is the DNQX data within each genotype in Fig 6d. These data cannot be described as showing &quot;intact&quot; KI responses, and the absence of numerical and statistical values needs to be addressed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>New Fig.8a depicting the horizontal cell light responses has been modified to include the legend indicating light intensities. The ON and OFF amplitudes were analyzed as the peak current amplitudes. This information has been added to the legend.</p>
<p>The reviewer is correct in that the OFF response represents the EPSC whereas the ON response represents the decrease in the EPSC with light. To avoid confusion, we changed the y axis label for the averaged data to read ON or OFF “response” rather than “current” in new Fig.8b.</p>
<p>As the reviewer suggests, the more transient nature of the KI response during the light ON period could result from aberrant continuation of vesicular release during the light-induced hyperpolarization of cones in the KI mice, in contrast to the prolonged suppression of release by light which is evident in the WT responses. We speculated on this difference as follows (lines 237-241):</p>
<p>“In addition to its smaller amplitude, the transient nature of the ON response in G369i KI HCs suggested inadequate cessation of cone glutamate release by light (Fig.8b). Slow deactivation of Cav3 channels and/or their activation at negative voltages20 could give rise to Ca2+ signals that support release following light-induced hyperpolarization of G369i KI cones.”</p>
<p>We added astericks to new Fig.8b,d indicating statistical differences and description of the tests in the legend.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>As for Figure 6, the results text related to Figure 7a-d does not present real numbers for ERG responses, and there is no indication of significant differences there or in the Figure panels. For instance, in Figure 7b, b-waves are KI are comparable to KO, except at the two highest-intensity flashes that show KI responses ~20% the amplitude of WT. Presentation of KI and KO data on a 6- to 10-fold expanded scale higher than WT can be misleading: a quick read of these Figure panels might make one incorrectly conclude that the KI is intact while the KO is impaired when compared to WT. The Methods section needs more details on the ERG analysis (e.g. any filtering out of oscillatory potentials when measuring b-wave, and what was the allowable range of time-to-peak for b-wave amplitude, etc..).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The vertical scaling of the ERG results in new Fig.10c,d has been changed so as to reflect clearly diminished responses of the KO and KI vs the WT. Further details regarding the ERG analysis was added to the Methods section.</p>

<p>(2) The Maddox et al 2020 study does not safely address whether rods have a residual T-type Ca2+ current in the Cav 1.4 KO or KI. The study showed that membrane currents measured from rods in the KI and KO retina were distinct from WT, supporting their claim that L-type Ca2+ current is absent in the KI and KO. However, the recordings had shortcomings that challenge the analysis of Ca2+ currents: i) collected at room temp (22-24{degree sign}C), ii) at an unknown distance from the terminal (uncertain voltage clamp), iii) with a very slow voltage ramp rate that is not suitable for probing T-type currents (Figure 1d Maddox 2020, 140 mV over 1 sec: 7msec/1mV), and iv) at a signal-to-noise that does not allow to resolve a membrane current under 1 pA (avg wt rod Ca2+ current was -3.5 pA, and line noise ~1pA peak-to-peak in Maddox 2020). Suggestion: say T-type currents were not probed in Maddox et al 2020, but Davison et al 2022 did not find PCR signal for Cav3.2 in rods.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We disagree that recordings in the Maddox 2020 study were not sufficient to uncover a T-type current. The voltage ramps in that study were not much slower than that of the Davison et al. 2022 study (they used 0.19 mV/ms). Moreover, in new Supp. Fig.S1, we show that like the slower voltage ramp (0.15 mV/ms) used in the prior study of G369i KI rods, the voltage ramps we used in the present study (0.5 mV/ms), which clearly evoke currents with T-type properties in G369i KI cones (Fig.2a,b, Fig.3a,b) do not evoke currents in WT or G369i KI rods.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor comments.</p>
<p>(1) Suggestion: add an overview panel to Figure 1 that shows the rod terminals in the KI. The problem is that cropping out the ribbon and active zone signals from rods, to highlight cones, can give the impression that the cones are partially spared in the KI, and the rods are not spared at all. (yet you nicely clarify this in Figure 4 and in the legend and text, etc.).</p>

<p>We chose to modify the legend with this information as in Fig.4 rather than modify the figure.</p>

<p>(2) Mouse wt cone Ca2+ currents look like L-type currents, as do your monkey and squirrel cone recordings, and also much like those of mouse rods (see Figure S5, Hagiwara et al., 2018 or Grabner and Moser 2021). Your pharm data from mice and squirrels further supports your conclusion, and certainly took much effort. Davison et al 2022 J Neurosci showed PCR results that support their claim that a Cav3 current exists in wt cones. Questions: 1) have you tried PCR? 2) Can you offer more details on what Cav3 KO you tried and what antibodies failed to confirm the KO? As the authors know, one complication is that the deletion of one Cav can be compensated for by the expression of a new Cav. There are 3 types of Cav3s and removal of one type may be compensated for by another Cav3.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have included drop-seq data (new Supp.Fig.S3) implicating Cav3.2 as the main Cav3 subtype in cones and have modified our discussion of these results accordingly. These experiments did not reveal any changes in Cav3 subtype expression in G369i KI vs WT cones.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Lines 95/96- onward, spend more time telling the story. When working out the biophysical and pharmacological behavior of the Ca2+ currents, you might want to initially refer to the membrane current as a membrane current, and then state how your voltage protocols, intra- and extra-cell solutions, and drugs helped you verify 1) L-type and 2) T-type Ca2+ currents.</p>

<p>(4) If data is in hand, add a ramp I-V to Figure S2, which shows the response of the ground squirrel cone. The steps in S2a are excellent for making your point that a transient current is missing, and the bipolar is a great control to illustrate ML218 works. However, a comparison of a squirrel cone ramp to a bipolar ramp response could complete the figure.</p>

<p>(6) The nice electron microscopy reconstructions are not elaborated on in any detail, and there is no mention of ribbon size. Is the resolution sufficient to estimate ribbon size, the number of synaptic vesicles around the ribbon and in the adjacent cytosol? The images indicate major changes in the morphology of the terminals. Is the glial envelope similar in WT and KI?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Since ribbons were quantified extensively in the confocal analyses in Fig.6, we felt it unnecessary to add this to the EM analysis which focused mainly on aspects of 3D structure (i.e., arrangement of ribbons, postsynaptic wiring, cone pedicle morphology). We added further discussion of the change in morphology of the G369i KI cone pedicle (lines 200-203): “Compared to WT, ribbons in G369i KI pedicles appeared disorganized and were often parallel rather than perpendicular to the presynaptic membrane (Fig.7a-c). Consistent with our confocal analyses (Fig.1), G369i KI cone pedicles extended telodendria in multiple directions rather than just apically (Fig. 7a).”</p>
<p>While we did not opt to characterize the glial envelope in WT cones, we did add an analysis of synaptic vesicles around ribbons to Table 2.</p>

<p>(7) Discussion line 250: &quot;we found no evidence for a functional contribution of Cav3 in our recordings of cones in WT mice (Figures. 2,3), ground squirrels, or macaque (Supplementary Figures S2 and S3).&quot;. I would not use &quot;functional&quot; in this context because when comparing your work to Davison et al 2022, they defined functional as a separate response component driven by Cav3. For instance, they examined the influence of their T-type current on exocytosis (by membrane capacitance) and other features like spiking Ca2+ transients. Suggestion: substitute functional with &quot;detectable&quot;, and say &quot;we found no detectable Cav currents&quot;. Or if you had Ttype staining, but not T-type Ca2+ currents, then say &quot;no functional current even though there is staining...&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have modified the text as (lines 336-338): “However, in contrast to recordings of WT mouse cone pedicles in a previous study21, we found no evidence for Cav3-mediated currents in somatic recordings of cones in WT mice (Figs.2,3).”</p>
<p>We propose an alternative interpretation of the results in the Davison et al study concerning the conclusion that Cav3 channels contribute to Ca2+ spikes and exocytosis. That study used 100 µM Ni2+ to block a “T-type” contribution to spike activity in cones. In their Figs.4,5, the spikes are suppressed by 100 µM Ni2+ and 10 µM nifedipine, a Cav1 antagonist, and spared by the T-type selective drug Z944. This is problematic for several reasons. First, as shown by the authors</p>
<p>(their Fig.2A1,A2) and others (PMID: 15541900), 100 µM Ni2+ inhibits Cav1-type currents in photoreceptors. Second, Z944 potentiates Cav1 current in their mouse cones (their Fig.2C1,C2). Thus, both reagents are suboptimal for dissecting the contribution of either Cav subtype to spiking activity. With respect to Cav3 channels and exocytosis, these authors interpreted a reduction in exocytosis upon holding at -39 mV compared to at -69 mV as indicating a loss of a T-type driven component of release. However, Cav1 channel inactivation (PMID: 12473074) could lead to the observed reduction in exocytosis at -30 mV.</p>

<p>(8) Additional literature related to your Intro and Discussion. Regarding CSNB2, related mutations of active zone proteins, and what happens to Ca2+ currents when ribbons are deleted, you might want to consider the following studies that measure Ca2+ currents from rods: conditional KO of RIM1/2 (Grabner et al 2015 JN), KO of ELKS1/2 (Hagiwara et al, 2018 JCB), and KO of Ribeye (Grabner and Moser eLife 2021). In these studies, the Cav currents were absent in rods of the ELKS1/2 DKO, strongly reduced (80%) in the RIM1/2DKO, but altered in more subtle ways (activation-inactivation) without significantly changing steady-state Ca2+ current in the Ribeye KO. This does not seem to support some of the arguments you have made in the Introduction and Discussion regarding ribbon size and Ca2+ currents, yet the suggested literature is related to the topic at hand.</p>

<p>A description of these synaptic proteins as potential mediators of the effect of Cav1.4 on ribbon morphogenesis was added to the Discussion, lines 325-327.</p>

<p>(9) Line 129: &quot;Along with the major constituents of the ribbon, CtBP2, and RIBEYE&quot;, for clarity Ribeye has two domains, one that is identical to CtBP2 (B-domain) and the unique Ribeye domain (A-domain) that is only expressed at ribbon synapses. And, Piccolino is also embedded in the ribbon (Brandstaetter lab, Wichmann/Moser labs). In other words, Ribeye and Piccolino are the major constituents of the ribbon.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Cav1.4 voltage-gated calcium channels play an important role in neurotransmission at mammalian photoreceptor synapses. Mutations in the CACNA1f gene lead to congenital stationary night blindness that particularly affects the rod pathway. Mouse Cav1.4 knockout and Cav1.4 knockin models suggest that Cav1.4 is also important for the cone pathway. Deletion of Cav1.4 in the knockout models leads to signaling malfunctions and to abundant morphological re-arrangements of the synapse suggesting that the channel not only has a role in the influx of Ca2+ but also in the morphological organization of the photoreceptor synapse. Of note, also additional Cav-channels have been previously detected in cone synapses by different groups, including L-type Cav1.3 (Wu et al., 2007; pmid; Kersten et al., 2020; pmid), and also T-type Cav3.2 (Davison et al., 2021; pmid 35803735).</p>
<p>In order to study a conductivity-independent role of Cav1.4 in the morphological organization of photoreceptor synapses, the authors generated the knockin (KI) mouse Cav1.4 G369i in a previous study (Maddox et al., eLife 2020; pmid 32940604). The Cav1.4 G369i KI channel no longer works as a Ca2+-conducting channel due to the insertion of a glycine in the pore-forming unit (Madox et al. elife 2020; pmid 32940604). In this previous study (Madox et al. elife 2020; pmid 32940604), the authors analyzed Cav1.4 G369i in rod photoreceptor synapses. In the present study, the authors analyzed cone synapses in this KI mouse.</p>
<p>For this purpose, the authors performed a comprehensive set of experimental methods</p>
<p>including immunohistochemistry with antibodies (also with quantitative analyses), electrophysiological measurements of presynaptic Ca2+ currents from cone photoreceptors in the presence/absence of inhibitors of L-type- and T-type- calcium channels, electron microscopy (FIB-SEM), ERG recordings and visual behavior tests of the Cav G369i KI in comparison to the Cav1.4 knockout and wild-type control mice.</p>
<p>The authors found that the non-conducting Cav channel is properly localized in cone synapses and demonstrated that there are no gross morphological alterations (e.g., sprouting of postsynaptic components that are typically observed in the Cav1.4 knockout). These findings demonstrate that cone synaptogenesis relies on the presence of Cav1.4 protein but not on its Ca2+ conductivity. This result, obtained at cone synapses in the present study, is similar to the previously reported results observed for rod synapses (Maddox et al., eLife 2020, pmid 32940604). No further mechanistic insights or molecular mechanisms were provided that demonstrated how the presence of the Cav channels could orchestrate the building of the cone synapse.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully disagree regarding the mechanistic advance of our study. As indicated by Reviewer 2, a major advance of our study is in providing a mechanism that can explain the longstanding conundrum that congenital stationary night blindness type 2 mutations that would be expected to severely compromise Cav1.4 function do not produce complete blindness. Our study provides an important contrast to the Maddox et al 2020 study in showing that rods and cones respond differentially to loss of Cav1.4 function, which is also relevant to the visual phenotypes of CSNB2. How the presence of Cav1.4 orchestrates cone synaptogenesis is an important topic that is outside the scope of our present study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In the present study, the authors also propose a homeostatic switch from L-type to (newly occurring) T-type calcium channels in the Cav1.4 G369i KI mouse as a consequence of the deficient calcium channel conductivity in the Cav1.4 G369i Cav1.4 KI mouse. In cones of the Cav1.4 G369i, the high-voltage activated, L-type Ca2+-entry was abolished, in agreement with their previous paper (Maddox et al., eLife 2020, pmid 32940604). The authors found a lowvoltage activated Ca2+ current instead that they assigned to T-type Ca2+-currents based on pharmacological inhibitor experiments. T-type Ca2+-currents/channels were already previously identified in other studies by independent groups and independent techniques</p>
<p>(electrophysiology, RT-PCR, single-cell sequencing) in cones of wild-type mice (Davison et al.,</p>
<p>2021, pmid 35803735; Macosko et al., 2015, pmid 26000488; Williams et al., 2022, pmid 35650675). In the present manuscript (Figures 3a/b), the authors also observed a low-voltage activated, T-type like current in cones of wild-type mice, that is isradipine-resistant and affected by the T-type inhibitor ML218. This finding appears compatible with a T-type-like current in wildtype cones and is consistent with the published data mentioned above, although the authors interpret this data in a different way in the discussion.</p>
<p>Due to the noise inherent in whole cell voltage clamp measurements and some crossover effects in the pharmacology, we cannot completely exclude the presence of a T-type current in WT mouse cones. However, our results very clearly support a conclusion opposite to that stated by the reviewer. Namely, if WT mouse cones have T-type Ca currents, then they are far smaller than those in the Cav1.4 G369i KI and KO cones. In particular, while we identified message for Cav3.2 in WT mouse cones, we were unable to identify a functional T-type current by either voltage clamp measurements or pharmacology. See below for a detailed rebuttal.</p>
<p>This proposal of a homeostatic switch is not convincingly supported in this reviewer's opinion</p>
<p>(for further details, please see below). Furthermore, no data on possible molecular mechanisms were provided that would support such a proposal of a homeostatic switch of calcium channels. No mechanistic/molecular insights were provided for a proposed homeostatic switch between Ltype to T-type channels that the authors propose to occur between wild-type and Cav1.4 G369i as a consequence of conduction-deficient Cav1.4 G369i channels. Is this e.g. based on posttranslational modifications that switch on T-type channels or regulation at the transcriptional level inducing expression of T-type calcium channel or on other mechanisms? The authors remain descriptive with their central hypotheses. No molecular mechanisms/signaling pathways were provided that would support the idea of such a homeostatic switch.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Homeostatic plasticity refers to the maintenance of neuronal function in response to some perturbation in neuronal activity and can result from changes in the expression of ion channel genes (PMID: 36377048, 32747440, 19778903) or regulatory pathways that modulate ion channels (PMID: 15051886, 32492405). We present multiple lines of evidence showing that Cav3 currents appear in cones upon genetically induced Cav1.4 loss of function and can support cone synaptic responses and visual behavior if cone synapse structure is maintained. Our new transcriptomic studies show no difference between levels of Cav3 channel transcripts in WT and G369i KI cones, suggesting that the appearance of the Cav3 currents in G369i KI cones does not result from an increase in Cav3 gene expression. We are currently investigating our transcriptomic dataset to determine if Cav3 regulatory pathways are upregulated in G369i KI cones and will present this in a follow-up study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors show residual photopic signaling in the non-conducting Cav1.4 G369i KI mouse as judged by the recording of postsynaptic currents, ERG recordings and visual behavior tests though in a reduced manner. The residual cone-based signaling could be based on the nonaffected T-type Ca2+ channel conductivity in cone synapses. Given that the L-type current through Cav1.4 is gone in the Cav1.4 G369i KI as previously shown (Maddox et al., 2020, pmid 32940604), the T-type calcium current will remain. However as discussed above, this does not necessarily support the idea of a homeostatic switch.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A major point which we highlighted with new results is that despite the expression of Cav3 transcripts in WT mouse cones, Cav3 channels do not contribute to the cone Ca2+ current. This is at odds with the Davison et al study (PMID: 35803735, see our response to Reviewer 2, pt 7 for caveats of this study), but our results convincingly show that the Cav3 current appears only when Cav1.4 is genetically inactivated. Pharmacological or electrophysiological methods that should reveal the presence of Cav3 currents do not change the properties of the Ca2+ current in cones of WT mice, ground squirrel, or macaque:</p>
<p>• Figs.2-4: Voltage steps to -40 mV (Fig 2e) that activate a sizeable T-current in G369i KI mouse cones produce a negligible transient at pulse onset in WT mouse cones. Similarly, transient currents that are obvious in G369i KI mouse cones during the final step to -30 mV are absent in WT cones.  When we block Cav1.4 with isradipine either in cones of WT mice or ground squirrel, the current that remains does not resemble a Cav3 current but rather a scaled down version of the L-type current. ML218, which readily blocks Cav3 channels in HEK293T cells and in G369i KI cones, has only minor effects in cones of WT mice and ground squirrel; these effects of ML218 can be attributed to non-specific actions on Cav1.4 (new Supp.Fig.S2). New Fig.4 (moved from the supplementary data to the main article) clearly shows that the ML218-sensitive current in ground squirrel cones exhibits properties of Cav1.4 not Cav3 channels.</p>
<p>• Figs.2,5: Holding voltages that inactivate Cav3 channels have no effect on the Ca2+ current in cones of WT mice or macaque (recordings of macaque cones were moved from the supplement to the main article as new Fig.5).</p>

<p>In Figure 4 the authors measured an increase in the size of the active zone (as judged by the size of the bassoon cluster) and of the synaptic ribbons in the Cav1.4 G369i. A mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon was not provided and the underlying molecular mechanisms were not unraveled.</p>
<p>The FIB-SEM data uncover some ultrastructural alteration/misalignments of the synaptic ribbons and misalignments of the regular arrangement of the postsynaptic dendrites in the G369i KI mice. Also concerning this observation, the study remains descriptive and does not reveal the underlying mechanisms as it would be expected for eLife.</p>

<p>We respectfully disagree on the descriptive nature of our study and the need for a full characterization of the molecular mechanism underlying the cone synaptic defects in the G369i KI mouse.</p>

<p>An important study in the field (Zanetti et al., Sci. Rep. 2021; pmid 33526839) should be also cited that used a gain-of-function mutation of Cav1.4 to analyze its functional and structural role in the cone pathway.</p>

<p>We have added citation of this paper to the Discussion (lines 354-356).</p>

<p>In conclusion, the study has been expertly performed but remains descriptive without deciphering the underlying molecular mechanisms of the observed phenomena, including the proposed homeostatic switch of synaptic calcium channels. Furthermore, a relevant part of the data in the present paper (presence of T-type calcium channels in cone photoreceptors) has already been identified/presented by previous studies of different groups (Macosko et al., 2015; pmid 26000488; Davison et al., 2021; pmid 35803735; Williams et al., 2022; pmid 35650675). The degree of novelty of the present paper thus appears limited. I think that the study might be better suited in a more specialized journal than eLife.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for acknowledging the rigor of our study but disagree with their evaluation regarding the novelty of our work as outlined in our responses above.</p>
