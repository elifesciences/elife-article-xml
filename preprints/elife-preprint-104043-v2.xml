<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The transition from prebiotic chemistry to living systems requires the emergence of a scheme for enzyme-free genetic replication. Here, we analyze a recently proposed prebiotic replication scenario, the so-called Virtual Circular Genome (VCG) [Zhou et al., RNA 27, 1-11 (2021)]: Replication takes place in a pool of oligomers, where each oligomer contains a subsequence of a circular genome, such that the oligomers encode the full genome collectively. While the sequence of the circular genome may be reconstructed based on long oligomers, monomers and short oligomers merely act as replication feedstock. We observe a competition between the predominantly error-free ligation of a feedstock molecule to a long oligomer and the predominantly erroneous ligation of two long oligomers. Increasing the length of long oligomers and reducing their concentration decreases the fraction of erroneous ligations, enabling high-fidelity replication in the VCG. Alternatively, the formation of erroneous products can be suppressed if each ligation involves at least one monomer, while ligations between two long oligomers are effectively prevented. This kinetic discrimination (favoring monomer incorporation over oligomer–oligomer ligation) may be an intrinsic property of the activation chemistry, or can be externally imposed by selectively activating only monomers in the pool. Surprisingly, under these conditions, shorter oligomers are extended by monomers more quickly than long oligomers, a phenomenon which has already been observed experimentally [Ding et al., JACS 145, 7504-7515 (2023)]. Our work provides a theoretical explanation for this behavior, and predicts its dependence on system parameters such as the concentration of long oligomers. Taken together, the VCG constitutes a promising scenario of prebiotic information replication: It could mitigate challenges of in non-enzymatic copying via template-directed polymerization, such as short lengths of copied products and high error rates.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In order to delineate possible pathways toward the emergence of life, it is necessary to understand how a chemical reaction network capable of storing and replicating genetic information might arise from prebiotic chemistry. RNA is commonly assumed to play a central role on this path, as it can store information in its sequence and catalyze its own replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Joyce, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Robertson and Joyce, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Higgs and Lehman, 2015</xref>). While ribozymes capable of replicating strands of their own length have been demonstrated in the laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Attwater et al., 2013</xref>), it remains elusive how enzyme-free self-replication might have worked before the emergence of such complex ribozymes.</p>
<p>One possible mechanism is template-directed primer extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kervio et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Walton and Szostak, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Ding et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Leveau et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Welsch et al., 2023</xref>): In this process, a primer hybridizes to a template and is extended by short oligonucleotides, thereby forming a (complementary) copy of the template strand. Considerable progress has been made in optimizing template-directed primer extension, but challenges remain: (i) The produced copies are likely to be incomplete. So far, at most 12 nt have been successfully added to an existing primer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Leveau et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, as the pool of primer strands needs to emerge via random polymerization, the primer is likely to hybridize to the template at various positions, and not only to its 3<sup><italic>′</italic></sup>-end, leaving part of the 3<sup><italic>′</italic></sup>-end of the template uncopied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Szostak, 2011</xref>). (ii) Errors in enzyme-free copying are frequent due to the limited thermodynamic discrimination between correct Watson-Crick pairing and mismatches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kervio et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Leu et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">2013</xref>). While some activation chemistries (relying on bridged dinucleotides) have been shown to exhibit improved fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Duzdevich et al., 2021</xref>), the error probability still constrains the length of the genome that can be reliably replicated.</p>
<p>The issue of insufficient thermodynamic discrimination can, in principle, be mitigated by making use of kinetic stalling after the incorporation of a mismatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Rajamani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Leu et al., 2013</xref>). By introducing a competition between the reduced polymerization rate and a characteristic timescale of the non-equilibrium environment, it is possible to filter correct sequences from incorrect ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Göppel et al., 2021</xref>). To address the challenge of incomplete copies, Zhou <italic>et al</italic>. propose an new scenario of replication, the so-called Virtual Circular Genome (VCG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Zhou et al., 2021</xref>). In this scenario, genetic information is stored in a pool of oligomers that are shorter than the circular genome they collectively encode: Each oligomer bears a subsequence of the circular genome, such that the collection of all oligomers encodes the full circular genome virtually. Within the pool, each oligomer can act as template or primer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Zhou et al., 2021</xref>). The oligomers hybridize to each other and form complexes that allow for templated ligation of two oligomers, or for the extension of an oligomer by a monomer. Because the sequences of the ligated strands and the template are part of the genome, most of the products should also retain the sequence of the genome. That way, long oligomers encoding the circular genome can be produced at the expense of short oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Zhou et al., 2021</xref>). The long strands, in turn, can assemble into catalytically active ribozymes. With a continuous influx of short oligomers, the VCG might allow for continuous replication of the virtually encoded circular genome. Importantly, replication in the VCG is expected to avoid the issue of incomplete copies. Since the genome is circular, it does not matter which part of the genome an oligomer encodes, as long as the sequence is compatible with the genome sequence. An additional feature of the VCG scenario is that replication should be achievable without the need of adding many nucleotides to a primer: Provided the concentration of oligomers decreases exponentially with their length, the concentration of each oligomer in the pool can be doubled by extending each oligomer only by a few nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Zhou et al., 2021</xref>). The extension of an oligomer by a few nucleotides in a VCG pool has already been demonstrated experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Ding et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>A recent computational study points out that the VCG scenario is prone to loss of genetic information via “sequence scrambling” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chamanian and Higgs, 2022</xref>): If the genome contains identical sequence motifs at multiple different loci, replication in the VCG will mix the sequences of these loci, thus destroying the initially defined genome. It is currently unclear, which conditions could prevent this genome instability of VCGs, such that their genetic information is retained. Length distribution, sequence composition, oligonucleotide concentration and environmental conditions, such as temperature, all affect the stability of complexes and thus the replication dynamics of the VCG pool. Here, we characterize the replication fidelity and yield of VCG pools using a kinetic model, which explicitly incorporates association and dissociation of RNA strands as well as templated ligation. We study a broad spectrum of prebiotically plausible and experimentally accessible oligomer pools, from pools containing only monomers and long oligomers of a single length to pools including a range of long oligomers with uniform or exponential concentration profile. The length of the included oligomers as well as their concentration are free parameters of our model.</p>
<p>We find that, regardless of the pool composition, three competing types of template-directed ligation reactions emerge: (i) ligations between two short oligomers (or monomers), producing products too short to specify a unique genomic locus, (ii) ligations between a short and a long oligomer, typically generating longer products compatible with the genome sequence, and (iii) ligations between two long oligomers, which often yield sequences incompatible with the genome. These erroneous ligation of type (iii) are a key driver of sequence scrambling, as they covalently link oligomers originating from non-adjacent genomic loci, effectively “mixing” distant regions of the genome. Fidelity is primarily determined by the competition between the correct extension of a long oligomer and the erroneous ligation of two long oligomers. The likelihood of the latter can be reduced by decreasing the relative abundance of long oligomers, even though this increases the frequency of unproductive ligations between short oligomers. As a result, fidelity can be improved at the cost of reduced yield. The efficiency, meaning the yield attainable at a fixed high fidelity, thus depends on the length distribution of the oligomers in the pool.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the issue of erroneous ligations is mitigated if ligations of long oligomers are kinetically suppressed, such that each ligation incorporates only one monomer at a time, as in the experimental study by Ding <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Ding et al., 2023</xref>). In this case, the VCG concentration can be chosen arbitrarily large without compromising fidelity. Interestingly, our model predicts an un-expected feature: In the limit of high VCG concentrations, short oligomers are more likely to be extended than long oligomers, even though, intuitively, complexes containing longer oligomers are expected to be more stable and thus more productive. The same behavior was indeed observed experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Ding et al., 2023</xref>). We provide an explanation for this feature, and discuss its dependence on system parameters such as the length and the concentration of long oligomers in the pool.</p>

<title>Model</title>
<p>In the VCG scenario, a circular genome is stored in a pool of oligomers, with each oligomer shorter than the genome it helps encode. Each oligomer bears a subsequence of the circular genome, such that, collectively, the oligomers encode the full genome (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). As the spontaneous emergence of such VCG pools is expected to be rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chamanian and Higgs, 2022</xref>), our study focuses on the conditions under which an existing VCG pool can reliably replicate. We therefore begin with a known genome and an associated VCG pool, without addressing the question of origin. To set up our model of VCG dynamics, we specify (i) the circular genome used, (ii) the procedure by which the genome is mapped to a set of oligomers, and (iii) the chemical reactions governing the system’s evolution.</p>

<p><bold>(A)</bold> In the Virtual Circular Genome (VCG) scenario, a circular genome (depicted in green) as well as its sequence complement are encoded in a pool of oligomers (depicted in blue and orange). Collectively, the pool of oligomers encodes the whole sequence of the circular genome. Depending on their length, two types of oligomers can be distinguished: Long VCG oligomers specify a unique locus on the genome, while feedstock molecules (monomers or short oligomers) are too short to do so. <bold>(B)</bold> The length-distribution of oligomers included in the VCG pool is assumed to be exponential. The concentration of feedstock and VCG oligomers as well as their respective length scales of exponential decay <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline195.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline196.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> can be varied independently.

<title>Circular Genomes</title>
<p>For a given genome length, <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub>, there are <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> distinct circular genomes (the factor 1/2<italic>L</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub> accounts for the freedom to select the starting position and to choose the Watson or the Crick strand as reference sequence). A key property of the genome is its unique motif length, <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub>, defined as the shortest length such that all possible subsequences of length <italic>L</italic> ≥ <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub> appear at most once in the genome. In other words, all subsequences of length <italic>L</italic> ≥ <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub> specify a unique locus on the genome. In addition, each circular genome has another length scale, corresponding to the maximal motif length, up to which all possible motifs are contained in the genome. We refer to this length as the exhaustive coverage length, <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub>. We typically analyze unbiased genomes in which all possible subsequences of length <italic>L</italic> ≤ <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> are contained at equal frequency.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s1c">
<title>Construction of VCG Pools</title>
<p>To specify a VCG pool that encodes a genomic sequence, one must select which subsequences are included in the pool at which concentrations. We consider unbiased pools, where the concentration of subsequences, <italic>c(L)</italic>, depends only on their length, <italic>L</italic>, i.e., all subsequences of a given length are included at equal concentration. We refer to the length-dependent concentration profile as the length distribution of the pool. Depending on their length, oligomers fall into two categories (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>): (i) short feedstock molecules (monomers and oligomers) and (ii) long VCG oligomers. Feedstock oligomers are oligomers that are shorter than the unique motif length <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub>. Since their sequence appears multiple times on the genome, they do not encode a specific position on the genome. Thus, they serve as feedstock for the elongation of VCG oligomers rather than as information storage. Conversely, VCG oligomers, which are longer than the unique motif length <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub>, have a unique locus on the circular genome. Collectively, the VCG oligomers enable the reconstruction of the full genome.</p>
<p>The full length distribution, <italic>c(L)</italic>, can be decomposed into the contributions of feedstock and VCG oligomers,
<disp-formula id="ueqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v3_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
We assume that both <italic>c</italic><sub>F</sub> and <italic>c</italic><sub>V</sub> follow an exponential length distribution. In our model, the concentration of VCG oligomers can be varied independently of the concentration of feedstock, and the length scales for the exponential decay (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> vs. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>) may differ between feedstock and VCG oligomers. Additionally, we can restrict the set of oligomer lengths included in the pool by setting minimal and maximal lengths for feedstock and VCG oligomers individually,
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v3_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v3_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
For any other oligomer length, the concentrations equal zero. This parametrization includes uniform length distributions as a special case (<italic>κ</italic><sub>F</sub> = 0 and <italic>κ</italic><sub>V</sub> = 0), and also allows for concentration profiles that are peaked. Peaked length distributions can emerge from the interplay of templated ligation, (de)hybridization and outflux in open systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Rosenberger et al., 2021</xref>). We define the total concentration of feedstock, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, as well as the total concentration of VCG oligomers, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. Their ratio will turn out to be an important determinant of the VCG dynamics.</p>

<title>(De)hybridization Kinetics</title>
<p>Oligomers can hybridize to each other to form double-stranded complexes, or dehybridize from an existing complex. For simplicity, we do not include self-folding within a strand, which is a reasonable assumption for short oligomers. The stability of a complex is determined by its hybridization energy, with lower hybridization energy indicating greater stability. We use a simplified nearest-neighbor energy model to compute the hybridization energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Rosenberger et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Göppel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Laurent et al., 2024</xref>): The total energy equals the sum of the energy contributions of all nearest-neighbor blocks in a given complex (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). The energy contribution associated with a block of two Watson-Crick base pairs (matches) is denoted <italic>γ</italic> &lt; 0, and dangling end blocks involving one Watson-Crick pair and one free base contribute <italic>γ</italic>/2. Nearest-neighbor blocks with mismatches increase the hybridization energy by <italic>γ</italic><sub><italic>MM</italic></sub> &gt; 0 per block, thus reducing the stability of the complex. The rate constants of hybridization and dehybridization are related via
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v3_eqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>c</italic><sup>°</sup> = 1 M is the standard concentration, and <italic>ΔG</italic> is the free energy of hybridization. The association rate constant <italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub> is proportional to the encounter rate constant, <italic>k</italic><sub>enc</sub> = 1/<italic>(c</italic><sup>°</sup><italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub><italic>)</italic>. The encounter timescale <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub> serves as the elementary time unit of the kinetic model, with all reaction timescales measured relative to it.</p>

<title>Templated Ligation</title>
<p>Two oligomers A and B that are hybridized adjacently to each other on a third oligomer C can produce a new oligomer A-B via templated ligation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Depending on the length of A and B, we distinguish three types of ligation reactions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>): (i) F+F ligations, in which two feedstock molecules ligate, (ii) F+V ligations, where a VCG oligomer is extended by a feedstock molecules, and (iii) V+V ligations involving two VCG oligomers. The formation of a covalent bond via templated ligation is not spontaneous, but requires the presence of an activation reaction. Usually, these reactions add a leaving group to the 5<sup><italic>′</italic></sup>-end of the nucleotide, which is cleaved during bond formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kervio et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Walton and Szostak, 2016</xref>). We assume that the concentration of activating agent is sufficiently high for the activation to be far quicker than the formation of the covalent bond, such that activation and covalent bond formation can be treated as a single effective reaction. When not otherwise stated, we assume that all possible templated ligation reactions occur with the same rate constant <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>lig</italic></sub>.</p>

<p>Templated ligation in the pool forms longer oligomers at the expense of shorter oligomers and monomers. While the product of an F+V ligation (or V+V ligation) is always a VCG oligomer, F+F ligations can produce feedstock or VCG oligomers. In both cases, a produced VCG oligomer can be correct (compatible with the genome) or incorrect (incompatible). We quantify these processes by measuring extension fluxes in units of nucleotides ligated to an existing strand (counting the length of the shorter ligated strand as the number of incorporated bases). In particular, we define the fidelity <italic>f</italic> as the extension flux resulting in correct VCG oligomers relative to the flux resulting in any VCG oligomer,

This genome contains all possible monomers and dimers with equal frequency, ensuring that all motifs up to <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> = 2 nt are represented. Identifying a unique address on this genome requires at least three nucleotides. Therefore, the unique motif length is <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub> = 3 nt, and VCG oligomers need to be at least 3 nt long. Further below, we also explore genomes of different lengths <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub>, as well as varying characteristic sequence length scales <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> and <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub> (method for genome construction detailed in Supplementary Section S1).</p>
<p>Based on the genome, we construct the initial oligomer pool. As a first step, we focus on a simple scenario in which the pool contains only monomers (serving as feedstock) and VCG oligomers of a single, defined length. The VCG pools are evolved in time using a stochastic simulation based on the Gillespie algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Rosenberger et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Göppel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Laurent et al., 2024</xref>). Since the Gillespie algorithm operates on the level of counts of molecules instead of concentrations, we must assign a volume to each system (in the range 1 µm<sup>3</sup> to 10 000 µm<sup>3</sup>, see Supplementary Material Section S2). Besides the volume, we also need to choose the reaction rate constants appropriately: (i) The association time <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub> is the fundamental time unit in our kinetic model, and all other times are expressed relative to <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub>. Experimentally determined association rate constants are typically around 10<sup>6</sup> −10<sup>7</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wetmur and Davidson, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Braunlin and Bloomfield, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ashwood et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Todisco et al., 2024a</xref>). For the purpose of estimating absolute timescales, we assume a constant association timescale of <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub> ≈ 1 µ<italic>s</italic> in the following. (ii) The timescale of dehybridization is computed via <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">Eq. (3)</xref> using the energy contribution <italic>γ =</italic> −2.5 <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub><italic>T</italic> for a matching nearest-neighbor block and <italic>γ</italic><sub>MM</sub> = 25.0 <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub><italic>T</italic> in case of mismatches. The high energy penalty of nearest-neighbor blocks involving mismatches, <italic>γ</italic><sub>MM</sub>, is chosen to suppress the formation of mismatches, while the value of <italic>γ</italic> roughly matches the average energy of all matching nearest-neighbor blocks given by the Turner energy model of RNA hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Mathews et al., 2004</xref>). (iii) For templated ligation, we select a reaction rate constant of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline6.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. This choice of <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>lig</italic></sub> is consistent with ligation rates measured in enzyme-free template-directed primer extension experiments, which range from around <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Sosson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Leveau et al., 2022</xref>) to roughly <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline7a.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Walton and Szostak, 2017</xref>), depending on the underlying activation chemistry. This indicates that, for sufficiently short oligomers (up to about 11 nt long), hybridization and dehybridization occur much faster than ligation, so binding equilibrates before ligation takes place.</p>
<p>Based on the ligation events observed in the simulation, we compute the observables introduced above (Model section). Due to the small ligation rate constant, it is computationally unfeasible to simulate the time evolution for more than a few ligation time units. Consequently, ligation events are scarce, which leads to high variances in the computed observables. We mitigate this issue by calculating the observables based on the concentration of complexes that are in a productive configuration, even if they do not undergo templated ligation within the time window of the simulation (Supplementary Material Section S2).</p>
<p>From the ligation events, we compute the total flux of oligomer formation. The observable <italic>y</italic> (yield) quantifies the fraction of this total flux directed to producing VCG oligomers. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> shows how the yield depends on the concentration of VCG oligomers, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, at a fixed total monomer concentration, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline9.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. Here, the data points (with error bars) represent the simulation results with the different colors corresponding to different choices of initial VCG oligomer length, <italic>L</italic><sub>V</sub>. We observe that the yield increases monotonically with the concentration of VCG oligomers, and approaches 100% for high <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline10.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. The concentration at which the pool reaches a yield of 50% depends on the oligomer length <italic>L</italic><sub>V</sub>: Shorter VCG oligomers require higher concentrations for high yield. The concentration dependence of the yield can be rationalized by the types of templated ligations that are involved. For low VCG concentration, most templated ligation reactions are dimerizations (1+1) with the VCG oligomers merely acting as templates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). As dimers are shorter than the unique motif length <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub>, their formation does not contribute to the yield, which explains the low yield in the limit of small <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline10a.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. Conversely, for high VCG concentration, most of the templated ligations are F+V or V+V ligations, which produce oligomers of length <italic>L</italic> ≥ <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub>, implying high yield.</p>

The panel depicts the behavior for <italic>L</italic><sub>V</sub> = 6 nt. <bold>(D)</bold> Replication efficiency is limited by the small yield for small <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline202.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. In the limit of high <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline203.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, replication efficiency decreases due to the growing number of error-prone V+V ligations. Maximal replication efficiency is reached at intermediate VCG concentration. <bold>(E)</bold> V+V ligations are prone to the formation of incorrect products due to the short overlap between educt strand and template. In general, the probability of correct product formation, <italic>p</italic><sub>corr</sub>, depends on the choice of circular genome and as well as its mapping to the VCG pool. The probabilities listed here refer to a VCG pool with <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub> = 16 nt, <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> = 2 nt and <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub> = 3 nt. <bold>(F)</bold> The optimal equilibrium concentration ratio of free VCG strands to free feedstock strands, which maximizes replication efficiency, decays as a function of length (continuous line).

<p><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> also shows that the relative contribution of V+V ligations increases with increasing <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline11.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, with a large fraction of them producing incorrect products (denoted V+V,f). This reduces the fidelity of replication, <italic>f</italic>, and causes a trade-off between fidelity and yield, which causes replication efficiency, <italic>η = f</italic> · <italic>y</italic>, to reach a maximum at intermediate VCG concentrations(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Using hexamers as an example, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref> illustrates why V+V ligations are prone to forming incorrect oligomers: In order to ensure that two oligomers only ligate if their sequences are adjacent to each other in the true circular genome, both oligomers need to share an overlap of at least <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub> nucleotides with the template oligomer. Otherwise, the hybridization region is too short to identify the locus of the oligomer uniquely, and two oligomers from non-adjacent loci might ligate. The probability of forming incorrect products is a consequence of the combinatorics of possible subsequences in the VCG. Specifically, for a genome with <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub> <italic>=</italic> 16 nt, there are 32 different hexamers. For example, if the left educt hexamer only has one nucleotide of overlap with the template, there are 1/4 · 32 = 8 possible educt oligomers. However, only one out of those 8 hexamers is the correct partner for the right educt hexamer, implying an error probability of 1 − 1/8 = 7/8 (first example in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>).</p>
<p>Characterizing replication efficiency via full simulations is computationally expensive: Depending on parameters, obtaining a single data point in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B–D</xref> can require hundreds of simulations, each lasting several days. To explore a broad parameter space more easily, we introduce an approximate adiabatic method that (i) assumes ligation is much slower than any hybridization or dehybridization event, and (ii) relies on a coarse-grained sequence-independent representation of oligomers. Details are provided in Supplementary Material Sections S3 and S4. In brief, because ligation is rare, we first compute the equilibrium distribution of free and bound oligomers. Oligomers of the same length share a common concentration, and complex concentrations are determined via the mass action law using length-dependent dissociation constants. Combining the mass action law with a mass conservation constraint for each oligomer length allows us to compute the equilibrium concentrations of free VCG and feedstock strands, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline12.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline13.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, given total concentrations <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline14.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline15.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. With these equilibrium values, we determine the concentrations of productive complexes and thus obtain the desired ligation-based observables without running full stochastic simulations.</p>
<p>The results of the adiabatic approach agree well with the simulation data (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-D</xref>), supporting that the replication efficiency depends non-monotonously on the concentration of VCG oligomers, with a maximum at intermediate concentration. While the available simulation data only allows for a qualitative characterization of this trend, the adiabatic approach enables a quantitative analysis. For instance, we use the adiabatic approach to determine the equilibrium concentration ratio at which replication efficiency is maximal as a function of the VCG oligomer length <italic>L</italic><sub>V</sub> (solid line in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). As expected from the qualitative trend observed in the simulation, pools containing longer oligomers reach their maximum for lower concentration of VCG oligomers. The shaded area indicates the range of VCG concentrations within which the pool’s efficiency deviates by no more than one percent from its optimum. We observe that this range of close-to-optimal VCG concentrations increases with <italic>L</italic><sub>V</sub>. Thus, pools containing longer oligomers require less fine-tuning of the VCG concentration for replication with high efficiency.</p>
<p>In addition to the numerical results, we utilize the adiabatic approach to study the optimal equilibrium VCG concentration analytically (Supplementary Material Section S6). We find that, for any choice of <italic>L</italic><sub>V</sub>, replication efficiency reaches its maximum when the fractions of dimerization (1+1) reactions and erroneous V+V ligations are equal (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> for <italic>L</italic><sub>V</sub> <italic>=</italic> 6 nt). This criterion can be used to derive a scaling law for the optimal equilibrium concentration ratio <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline16.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> as a function of the oligomer length <italic>L</italic><sub>V</sub>,
<disp-formula id="eqn4">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v3_eqn4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
which is shown as a dashed line in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref> (the length-scale Λ<sub>F+F</sub> is defined in Supplementary Material Section S6). The optimal equilibrium concentration ratio decreases exponentially with <italic>L</italic><sub>V</sub>, while the hybridization energy <italic>γ</italic>/2 sets the inverse length-scale of the exponential decay. Analytical estimate and numerical solution agree well, as long as the hybridization is weak and oligomers are sufficiently short. For strong binding and long oligomers, complexes involving more than three strands play a non-negligible role, but such complexes are neglected in the analytical approximation.</p>
<p><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref> shows how the maximal replication efficiency depends on the VCG oligomer length. Consistent with the qualitative trend observed in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, longer oligomers enable higher maxima in replication efficiency. Regardless of the choice of <italic>γ</italic>, replication efficiency reaches 100% if <italic>L</italic><sub>V</sub> is sufficiently high. Starting from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">Eq. (4)</xref>, we find the following approximation for the maximal replication efficiency attainable at a given oligomer length (dashed lines in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>),
<disp-formula id="eqn5">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v3_eqn5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>η</italic><sup>°</sup> is a genome-dependent constant (Supplementary Material Section S7). This equation can provide guidance for the construction of VCG pools with high replication efficiency: Given a target efficiency, the necessary oligomer length and hybridization energy, i.e., temperature, can be calculated. In <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>, we determine the oligomer length necessary to achieve <italic>η</italic><sub>max</sub> <italic>=</italic> 95<italic>%</italic> for varying hybridization energies <italic>γ</italic>. At higher temperature (weaker binding), VCG pools require longer oligomers to replicate with high efficiency.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn5">Eq. (5)</xref> is not restricted to the specific example genome of length <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub> <italic>=</italic> 16 nt, but applies more generally to genomes of arbitrary length. Any genome of length <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub> can contain at most 2 <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub> distinct motifs. Consequently, the minimum length required to specify a unique address on the genome equals <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline17.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. By the same logic, the longest motif length for which all 4<sup><italic>L</italic></sup> possible sequences can be exhaustively represented within the genome is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline18.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>.Both of these characteristic lengths scale logarithmically with genome size. For genomes where <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> is taken to be maximal and <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub> minimal, we find that the characteristic VCG oligomer length <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline19.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> required for replication with high efficiency (<italic>η</italic><sub>max</sub> <italic>= 95%</italic>) also scales logarithmically with genome length (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>). Across genome lengths, the offset between <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline20.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is roughly constant.</p>
<p>In genomes with different choices of <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> and <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline21.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline22.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>), the characteristic VCG oligomer length required for efficient replication, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline23.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, is primarily determined by the unique motif length <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub>. Specifically, the length of VCG oligomers, <italic>L</italic><sub>V</sub>, must exceed <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub>, regardless of the value of <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub>. This is shown for genomes of length <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub> <italic>=</italic> 64 nt in Supplementary Material Section S8, where we generate genomes with specified length scales <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> and <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub> using a Metropolis–Hastings algorithm and analyze their replication efficiency. Intuitively, the required VCG oligomer length <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline24.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is set by <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub>, because <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub> defines the minimal hybridization region needed to ensure correct ligation via sequence-specific recognition. The precise offset between <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline25.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> depends on genome-specific features, such as the frequency distribution of motifs with lengths between <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> and <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub>. If this distribution is nearly uniform (noting that at least one motif must repeat, or else it would constitute a unique address), then <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline26.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> will be close to <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub> (Supplementary Material <xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9B</xref>). In contrast, strongly biased motif distributions require larger <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline27.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> to achieve reliable replication (Supplementary Material <xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9A</xref>), though even in this case, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline28.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> typically exceeds <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub> by only a few nucleotides.</p>

<title>Multi-length VCG pools are dominated by longest oligomers</title>
<p>In the previous section, we characterized the behavior of pools containing VCG oligomers of a single length. We observed that V+V ligations are error-prone due to insufficient overlap between the educt strands and the template, whereas F+V ligations extend the VCG oligomers with high efficiency. The F+V ligations will gradually broaden the length distribution of the VCG pool, raising the question of how this broadening affects the replication behavior. In principle, introducing multiple oligomer lengths into the VCG pool might even improve the fidelity of V+V ligations, since a long VCG oligomer could serve as a template for the correct ligation of two shorter VCG oligomers.</p>
<p>To analyze this question quantitatively, we first consider the simple case of a VCG pool that only contains monomers, tetramers, and octamers. The concentration of monomers is set to <italic>c</italic>(1) = 0.1 mM, while the concentrations of the VCG oligomers are varied independently (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Replication efficiency reaches its maximum at <italic>c</italic>(8) ≈ 0.1 µM and very low tetramer concentration, <italic>c</italic>(4) ≈ 7.4 pM, effectively resembling a single-length VCG pool containing only octamers. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, the maximal efficiency is surrounded by a plateau of close-to-optimal efficiency. The octamer concentration can be varied by more than one order of magnitude without significant change in efficiency. Similarly, adding tetramers does not affect efficiency as long as the tetramer concentration does not exceed the octamer concentration. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref> illustrates that the plateau of close-to-optimal efficiency coincides with the concentration regime where the ligation of a monomer to an octamer with another octamer acting as template, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline29.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, is the dominant ligation reaction. For high tetramer concentration and intermediate octamer concentration, templated ligation of tetramers on octamer templates, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline30.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, surpasses the contribution of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline31.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> ligations (green shaded area in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline32.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> reactions give rise to a ridge of increased efficiency, which, however, is small compared to the plateau of close-to-optimal efficiency (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Even though reactions of the type <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline33.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> produce correct products in most cases, they compete with error-prone ligations like <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline34.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline35.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, which reduce fidelity.

However, very strong hybridization energy, <italic>γ =</italic> −5.0 <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub><italic>T</italic>, is necessary for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline38.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> ligations to give rise to similar efficiency as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline39.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> ligations. Thus, in this example, high efficiency replication facilitated by the ligation of short VCG oligomers on long VCG oligomers is in theory possible, but requires unrealistically strong binding affinity. Moreover, this mechanism is only effective if educts and template differ significantly with respect to their length. If the involved VCG oligomers are too similar in size, templated ligation of two short oligomers tends to be error-prone, irrespective of the choice of binding affinity (Supplementary Material <xref rid="figS12" ref-type="fig">Fig. S12</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS13">S13</xref>). In that case, F+V ligations remain the most reliable replication mechanism.</p>

<p>In a realistic prebiotic scenario, the concentration profile of the VCG pool would not be uniform. Depending on the mechanism producing the pool and its coupling to the non-equilibrium environment, it might have a concentration profile that decreases or increases exponentially with length. We use the parameter <italic>κ</italic><sub>V</sub> to control this exponential length dependence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>): For negative <italic>κ</italic><sub>V</sub>, the concentration increases as a function of length, while exponentially decaying length distributions have positive <italic>κ</italic><sub>V</sub>. We find that replication efficiency is high if the concentration of long VCG oligomers exceeds or at least matches the concentration of short VCG oligomers (<italic>κ</italic><sub>V</sub> ≤ 0 in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). In that case, replication efficiency is dominated by the long oligomers in the pool, since these form the most stable complexes. As the concentration of long oligomers is decreased further (<italic>κ</italic><sub>V</sub> &gt; 0), the higher stability of complexes formed by longer oligomers is eventually insufficient to compensate for the reduced concentration of long oligomers. Replication efficiency is then governed by short VCG oligomers, which exhibit lower replication efficiency.

In both cases, pools that are rich in VCG oligomers exhibit low efficiency of replication. As erroneous V+V ligations are the dominant type of reaction in this limit, all pools achieve the same efficiency regardless of the presence of dimers. In contrast, when the pool is rich in feedstock (small <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline52.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>), pools with and without dimers behave differently: If only monomers are included, the efficiency approaches zero, as dimerizing monomers do not contribute to the yield, and thus not to the efficiency. However, the presence of dimers enables the ligation of monomers and dimers to form trimers and tetramers, which lead to a non-zero yield. Given the low VCG concentration, the ligations are likely to proceed using dimers as template. As a consequence, educt oligomers can only hybridize to the template with a single-nucleotide-long hybridization region, leading to frequent formation of incorrect products and, consequently, low efficiency.</p>
<p>Replication efficiency reaches its maximum at intermediate VCG concentrations, where replication is dominated by F+V ligations. Notably, the maximal attainable efficiency is significantly lower for pools with dimers than without, as dimers increase the number and the stability of complex configurations that can form incorrect products (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Without dimers, ligation products are only incorrect if the overlap between the VCG educt oligomer and template is shorter than the unique motif length, <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub>. With dimers, however, dangling end dimers can cause incorrect products even in case of long overlap of educt oligomer and template (right column in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). The stability of the latter complexes depends on the length of the VCG oligomers, <italic>L</italic><sub>V</sub>, whereas the stability of complexes facilitating incorrect monomer addition is independent of oligomer length (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p>

<title>Kinetic suppression of error-prone VCG oligomer ligation</title>
<p>In all scenarios considered so far, the efficiency of replication is limited by a common mechanism, regardless of the specifics of the VCG pool: Ligations involving two oligomers that hybridize to the template over a region shorter than <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub> are prone to generate incorrect products. In previous sections, we minimized these erroneous ligations by fine-tuning the concentration and length of VCG oligomers. However, such control may become unnecessary if the typically error-prone ligation of two oligomers (V+V) is kinetically suppressed. Kinetic suppression can be an intrinsic property of the activation chemistry: Templated ligation of two oligomers can be several orders of magnitude slower than the extension of an oligomer by a single monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Prywes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Ding et al., 2021</xref>). As a result, V+V ligations are disfavored purely by their slower kinetics. In addition, it is conceivable that only monomers are chemically activated while longer oligomers remain inactive, which would further reduce the likelihood of erroneous ligations. This scenario has already been explored experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Ding et al., 2023</xref>). In natural environments, it could occur, for instance, when activated monomers are produced externally and then diffuse into compartments containing the VCG but lacking internal activation pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Toparlak et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kriebisch et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>Within our model, we capture the kinetic suppression by introducing two different rates of ligation, <italic>k</italic><sub>lig,1</sub> for ligations involving a monomer and <italic>k</italic><sub>lig,&gt;1</sub> for ligations involving no monomer, allowing for kinetic discrimination between these processes. We explore the resulting replication efficiency in the limit of perfect kinetic discrimination (<italic>k</italic><sub>lig,&gt;1</sub>/<italic>k</italic><sub>lig,1</sub> → 0) where only monomers are reactive for ligation. We first consider a pool where the reactive monomers are mixed with VCG oligomers of a single length as well as non-reactive dimers (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). We vary the concentration of VCG oligomers, but keep the feedstock concentrations constant. For small VCG concentrations, we observe low efficiencies (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>), as the ligation of two monomers, or one monomer and one dimer, are most likely. Conversely, high <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline55.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> facilitates the formation of complexes in which VCG oligomers are extended by monomers, which implies high efficiency (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). Note that, unlike in systems where all oligomers are reactive, replication efficiency does not decrease for high VCG concentration, as erroneous V+V ligations are impossible. Instead, perfect replication efficiency (100%) is reached for sufficiently high <italic>L</italic><sub>V</sub>.</p>

To illustrate this, we examine an ensemble containing VCG oligomers ranging from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline60a.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline61.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, along with the same feedstock as previously (reactive monomers and non-reactive dimers, see <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). For simplicity, we assume that the length-distribution of VCG oligomers is uniform. We study the fraction of oligomers in a monomer-extension-competent state as a function of oligomer length,
<disp-formula id="ueqn10">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v3_ueqn10.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline62.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> denotes the equilibrium concentration of all complexes that allow monomer-extension of VCG oligomers of length <italic>L</italic>. At low VCG concentration, longer oligomers are more likely to be extended by monomers than shorter ones (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). This behavior is intuitive, as longer oligomers tend to form more stable complexes, which lead to higher productivity. Surprisingly, increasing the VCG concentration reverses the length-dependence of the productivity, such that short oligomers are more likely to be extended by monomers than long ones (note the three crossings of the curves in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). For example, 8-mers are more likely to undergo primer-extension than 9-mers once the VCG concentration exceeds ≈ 0.5 µM. We derived a semi-analytical expression for the threshold VCG concentrations at which oligomers of two different lengths have equal productivity (dashed lines in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>, Supplementary Material Sections S12 and S13).</p>

<p><bold>(A)</bold> The pool contains reactive monomers as well as non-reactive dimers and VCG oligomers. The concentrations of monomers and dimers are fixed, <italic>c</italic>(1) = 0.091 mM and <italic>c</italic>(2) = 9.1 µM, adding up to a total feedstock concentration of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline227.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, while the total concentration of VCG oligomers, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline228.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, is varied. All VCG oligomers are assumed to have the same concentration. <bold>(B)</bold> At low VCG concentration, long oligomers are more likely in a monomer-extension-competent state than short oligomers, whereas at high VCG concentration, the trend reverses and short oligomers are more likely to be extended by monomers (“inversion of productivity”). The threshold concentration at which a short oligomer starts to outperform a longer oligomer depends on the lengths of the compared oligomers (dashed lines). <bold>(C)</bold> The mechanism underlying inversion of productivity can be understood based on the pair-wise competition of different VCG oligomers, e.g., 8-mers vs. 9-mers. Over the entire range of VCG concentrations, complexes with 8-mer templates have a lower relative equilibrium concentration than complexes with 9-mer templates (bottom two curves vs. top two curves). As the concentration of VCG oligomers is increased, ligations of type <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline229.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> exceed ligations of type <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline230.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, i.e., the extension fraction of 8-mers that are extended by monomers using a 9-mer as a template exceeds the fraction of extended 9-mers. <bold>(D)</bold> The equilibrium concentration of free oligomer decreases with increasing <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline231.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. For longer oligomers, the equilibrium fraction of free oligomers is lower, as they can form more stable complexes with longer hybridization sites. <bold>(E)</bold> Complexes in which 8-mers serve as template are less stable than complexes with 9-mer templates, explaining why complexes with 8-mer template are more abundant than complexes with 9-mer template (see panel C). Complexes with 9-mer template have similar stability regardless of the length of the educt oligomer, i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline232.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline233.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> are similarly stable. This similar stability together with the higher concentration of free 8-mers compared to 9-mers (see panel D) is the reason why the fraction of monomer-extended 8-mers exceeds the one of 9-mers (see panel C).</p></caption>

<p>To understand the mechanism underlying the inversion of productivity, we analyze how different complex types contribute to <italic>r</italic><sub>1+V</sub><italic>(L)</italic>. We introduce
<disp-formula id="ueqn11">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v3_ueqn11.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
which denotes the fraction of oligomers of length <italic>L</italic><sub>E</sub> that are in a monomer-extension-competent complex configuration that uses an oligomer of length <italic>L</italic><sub>T</sub> as template. The term <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline63.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> includes the sum over all possible configurations of complexes with the given lengths. Focusing on 8-mers and 9-mers as an example, we observe that complexes utilizing the 9-mer as template are responsible for the inversion of productivity (top two curves in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>): As the VCG concentration increases, the fraction of monomer-extendable 8-mers eventually surpasses the fraction of monomer-extendable 9-mers, i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline64.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). Two factors give rise to this feature: (i) Ternary complexes of type <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline65.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline66.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> have similar stability (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>), and (ii) the equilibrium concentration of free 8-mers is higher than that of 9-mers (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). As a result, 8-mers are more likely than 9-mers to hybridize to an existing duplex <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline66a.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, and, given the stability of the complex <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline67.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, 8-mers remain bound almost as stably as 9-mers. In summary, short oligomers sequester long oligomers as templates to enhance their monomer-extension rate, while long oligomers cannot make use of short oligomers as templates due to the relative instability of the corresponding complexes.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that Ding <italic>et al</italic>. have already observed the inversion of productivity experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Ding et al., 2023</xref>). In their study, they included activated monomers, activated imidazolium-bridged dinucleotides and oligomers up to a length of 12 nt, and observed that the primer extension rate for short primers is higher than the extension rate of long primers. Even though our model differs from their setup in some aspects (e.g., different circular genome, no bridged dinucleotides) evaluating our model using parameters similar to those of the experimentally studied system predicts inversion of productivity that qualitatively agrees with the experimental findings (Supplementary Material Section S14). We therefore assume that the mechanism underlying inversion of productivity described here also applies to the experimental observations.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>While significant progress has been made in understanding the prebiotic formation of ribonucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Powner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Benner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Becker et al., 2016</xref>) and characterizing ribozymes that might play a role in an RNA world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Mutschler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Attwater et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Pressman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Tjhung et al., 2020</xref>), a convincing scenario bridging the gap between prebiotic chemistry and ribozyme-catalyzed replication is still missing. Here, we studied a scenario proposed by Zhou <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Zhou et al., 2021</xref>) (the ‘Virtual Circular Genome’, VCG) using theoretical and computational approaches. We analyzed the process whereby template-directed ligation replicates the genomic information that is collectively stored in the VCG oligomers. Our analysis revealed a trade-off between the fidelity and the yield of this process: At low concentration of VCG oligomers, most of the ligations produce oligomers that are too short to specify a unique locus on the genome, resulting in a low yield of replication (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-C</xref>). At high VCG concentration, erroneous templated ligations cause sequence scrambling and consequently limit the fidelity of replication (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C-D</xref>). We considered two solutions to these issues: (i) a VCG pool composition that optimizes its replication behavior within the bounds of the fidelity-yield trade-off, and (ii) breaking the fidelity-yield trade-off given that error-prone ligations can be kinetically suppressed.</p>
<p>The first solution maximizes the yield of replication for fixed fidelity. In pools containing only monomers and VCG oligomers of a single length, replication efficiency can be maximized by increasing the length of VCG oligomers and decreasing their concentration (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F-G</xref>). This reduces the likelihood of error-prone templated ligation of long oligomers. When the pool contains VCG oligomers of multiple lengths, replication efficiency is typically governed by the longest oligomer in the pool (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Including dimers as feedstock for the replication increases the error fraction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B-C</xref>), as dimers that bind to a template with a dangling end are prone to form an incorrect product (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>The second solution eliminates the error-prone templated ligation of two VCG oligomers by suppressing them kinetically, e.g., by assuring that only monomers are chemically activated. This enables both fidelity and yield to remain high at high VCG concentrations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>), effectively breaking the fidelity-yield trade-off. Longer VCG oligomers are then more likely to be extended than shorter oligomers at equal concentration, (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). However, this is only true for pools with VCG oligomers of a single length — once multiple VCG oligomer lengths compete with each other, shorter oligomers can be more productive than longer ones (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). This feature, which has also been observed experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Ding et al., 2023</xref>), is caused by an asymmetry in the productive interaction between short and long oligomers (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>): While short oligomers can sequester longer oligomers as templates for their extension by a monomer, short oligomers are unlikely to serve as templates for longer oligomers (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D-E</xref>).</p>
    <p>As we intended to study the pathways responsible for sequence scrambling and to explore possible mitigation strategies, we based our analysis on a coarse-grained model which neglects some experimental details. First, we assumed that a complex instantaneously dehybridizes if it contains a non-complementary base pair, whereas in reality, short duplexes can tolerate a limited number of mismatches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Todisco et al., 2024a</xref>). While such mismatches can facilitate incorrect hybridization and introduce additional replication errors, we expect this effect to be moderate: Mismatches preferentially occur near the ends of the hybridized region, where their destabilizing effect on binding is weakest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Todisco et al., 2024a</xref>). However, such terminal mismatches have also been shown to significantly reduce ligation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Rajamani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Leu et al., 2013</xref>), which in turn limits the likelihood of forming incorrect products.</p>
    <p>Second, we simplified the hybridization dynamics by assuming that all oligomers bind to each other at equal rates, and that dehybridization rates are determined by the hybridization energy computed via a nearest-neighbor model. However, recent work has shown that hybridization to a gap flanked by two oligomers proceeds more slowly than binding to an unoccupied template. Moreover, the resulting nicked complexes (two oligomers hybridized adjacently on a template) are more stable than predicted by standard nearest-neighbor models due to enhanced stacking interactions at the nick site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Todisco et al., 2024b</xref>). While this added stability is not expected to affect overall replication efficiency of the VCG (since all productive complexes, correct or incorrect, contain a nick), it can impact the kinetics of the system. In particular, the extended lifetime of such complexes may challenge the adiabatic approximation used in much of our analysis, which assumes ligation is always slower than hybridization and dehybridization.</p>
<p>Third, we do not model the activation chemistry explicitly, but instead assume that all monomers (and, depending on the scenario, also oligomers) are always reactive. As a result, some activated intermediates that are known to form in experiments, such as imidazolium-bridged dinucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Walton and Szostak, 2016</xref>), are not modeled. Nonetheless, we include aspects of activation chemistry in a coarse-grained manner. Specifically, to capture the experimentally observed difference in reactivity between monomer incorporation and templated ligation of oligomers under aminoimidazolium activation, we introduce two distinct ligation rate constants. With this approach, we describe the experimental setup well enough to qualitatively reproduce features observed in experiments, for example, the preferential extension of shorter oligomers by monomers in pools containing VCG oligomers of varying lengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Ding et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>The VCG scenario was proposed to close the gap between prebiotic chemistry and ribozyme-catalyzed replication. To this end, VCG pools need to be capable of replicating (parts of) ribozymes that play a role in the emergence of life. While there are cases of small ribozymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Pressman et al., 2019</xref>) or ribozymes with small active sites (e.g., the Hammerhead ribozyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Scott et al., 2013</xref>)), ribozymes obtained experimentally via <italic>in vitro</italic> evolution are often more than a hundred nucleotides long (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Johnston et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Müller and Bartel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Wochner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Attwater et al., 2013</xref>). Remarkably, our model suggests that the VCG scenario enables high-fidelity replication of long genomes, even in pools containing relatively short VCG oligomers. For a genome of length <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub>, a sequence of at least <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline68.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> nucleotides is required to uniquely specify a position within the genome. If the oligomers in the pool exceed this length by about three nucleotides, accurate replication becomes feasible (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>). For example, genomes of length <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline69.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> can be replicated in VCG pools containing 10 nt oligomers. However, <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub> equals <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline70.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> only for a restricted set of genome sequences; more generally, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline71.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. In such cases, reliable replication requires correspondingly longer oligomers. While the precise margin between oligomer length and <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub> depends on genome-specific features (particularly the motif distribution at sub-<italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub> scales), it typically amounts to only a few additional nucleotides (Section S8 in the Supplementary Material).</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that replication in the VCG scenario imposes a selection pressure on prebiotic genomes to reduce their unique motif length, <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub>. A circular genome requiring many nucleotides to specify a unique locus (high <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub>) replicates less efficiently than one with a shorter <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub>, assuming all other properties of the VCG pool — particularly the oligomer length distribution — remain identical. This length distribution arises from the interplay between the chemical kinetics and molecular transport governed by the physical environment. For instance, templated ligation in an open system with continuous oligomer influx and outflux can produce a non-monotonic length distribution, with a concentration peak at a characteristic oligomer length <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>, determined by the interplay between dehybridization and outflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Rosenberger et al., 2021</xref>). Through this emergent length scale, the environment shapes replication in the VCG scenario. If the environment facilitates long oligomers (<italic>L</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> <italic>&gt; L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub>), replication proceeds efficiently. Conversely, in environments with a small <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>, repeating motifs longer than <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> are selected against. In such cases, mutational errors may replace long repeated motifs with functionally equivalent sequences composed of shorter unique motifs, thereby increasing replication efficiency.</p>
<p>Given the broad range of prebiotically plausible non-equilibrium environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ianeselli et al., 2023</xref>), it is reasonable to expect that some environments provide the required conditions for efficient replication. The constraints formulated in this work can help to guide the search for self-replicating oligomer pools, in the vast space of possible concentration profiles and non-equilibrium environments.</p>

    <title>Constructing circular genomes</title>
<p>In the Virtual Circular Genome (VCG) scenario, genomes are encoded in a pool of oligomers. The encoded genomes are assumed to be circular sequences of length <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub>, containing both the original sequence and its reverse complement. Each genome is characterized by two fundamental length scales that reflect different aspects of motif distribution along the sequence. The minimal unique motif length, <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub>, is defined as the shortest subsequence length for which all motifs of length <italic>L</italic> ≥ <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub> appear at most once in the genome. In contrast, the exhaustive coverage length, <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub>, denotes the largest motif length for which all <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline72.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> possible motifs are present within the genome. Since only 2<italic>L</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub> distinct motifs can be encoded in a genome (including its complement), it follows that <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> cannot exceed
<disp-formula id="ueqn12">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v3_ueqn12.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Similarly, for a motif to be uniquely addressable on the genome, its length must be at least
<disp-formula id="ueqn13">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v3_ueqn13.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
We note that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline73.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline74.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> are essentially the same length scale (differing by at most one nucleotide), such that they can be summarized into a single characteristic subsequence lengthscale <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub> for convenience.</p>
<p>The characteristic length scales <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> and <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub> impose constraints on how motifs are distributed. For example, when <italic>L</italic> = <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub>, all motifs of length <italic>L</italic> must appear at most once, while at least one motif of length <italic>L</italic> − 1 must occur more than once. To quantify motif distributions, we introduce the motif entropy,
<disp-formula id="ueqn14">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v3_ueqn14.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> denotes the relative frequency of motif <italic>i</italic> across the genome and its reverse complement. Motif entropy ranges from zero (a homogeneous sequence with only one motif) to a maximum value that depends on the subsequence length,
<disp-formula id="ueqn15">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v3_ueqn15.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
For a motif length <italic>L</italic> to qualify as the unique motif length <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub>, its entropy must be maximal, <italic>S</italic>(<italic>L</italic>) = <italic>S</italic><sup>max</sup>(<italic>L</italic>), while <italic>S</italic>(<italic>L</italic> − 1) must be smaller than its respective maximum, <italic>S</italic>(<italic>L</italic> − 1) <italic>&lt; S</italic><sup>max</sup>(<italic>L</italic> − 1).</p>
<p>The correspondence between characteristic length scales and motif entropy provides a way to construct genome sequences with specified motif characteristics. By treating the entropy function as an effective “Hamiltonian” ℋ, we can generate genome sequences through Metropolis–Hastings sampling. Each update step in the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm involves either a single-nucleotide mutation or a cut-and-paste operation that relocates a segment of the genome to a new position (the cut-and-paste operation is 10 times more likely than the single nucleotide mutation). The acceptance criterion follows the standard Metropolis rule: modifications that reduce the Hamiltonian are always accepted, while increases in energy are accepted with probability exp [−<italic>β</italic>(<italic>E</italic><sub>old</sub> − <italic>E</italic><sub>new</sub>)], where <italic>β</italic><sup>−1</sup> is an effective temperature chosen to be small compared to the typical energy to ensure convergence to the minimum. Simulations are either run until a predefined entropy target is reached or until the energy converges to a plateau.</p>

<disp-formula id="ueqn17">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v3_ueqn17.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
using two different sampling protocols. In the first, the simulation is terminated as soon as the genome reaches the desired values of <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> and <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub>. The resulting motif distributions on the intermediate length scales (<italic>L</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> <italic>&lt; L &lt; L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub>) remain close to uniform, with only minor biases sufficient to enforce the length-scale constraints. In the second protocol, entropy minimization continues beyond the point at which the target values are achieved, leading to more strongly biased motif distributions on intermediate length scales. These construction strategies allow us to systematically tune genome complexity and motif structure, enabling controlled investigations of how the characteristic length scales influence replication dynamics (Section S8).</p>

    <title>Computing replication observables based on the kinetic simulation</title>
<p>We simulate the dynamics of VCG pools using a kinetic simulation that is based on the Gillespie algorithm. In the simulation, oligomers can hybridize to each other to form complexes, or dehybridize from an existing complex. Moreover, two oligomers can undergo templated ligation if they are hybridized adjacent to each other on a third oligomer. At each time <italic>t</italic>, the state of the system is determined by a list of all single-stranded oligomers and complexes as well as their respective copy number. We refer to the state of the system at the time <italic>t</italic> as the ensemble of compounds ℰ<sub><italic>t</italic></sub>. Given the copy numbers, the rates <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> of all possible chemical reactions <italic>i</italic> ∈ ℐ can be computed. To evolve the system in time, we need to perform two steps: (i) We sample the waiting time until the next reaction, <italic>τ</italic>, from an exponential distribution with mean <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline80.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, and update the simulation time, <italic>t</italic> → <italic>t</italic> + <italic>τ</italic>. (ii) We pick which reaction to perform by sampling from a categorical distribution. Here, the probability to pick reaction <italic>i</italic> equals <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline81.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. The copy numbers are updated according to the sampled reaction, yielding ℰ<sub><italic>t</italic>+<italic>τ</italic></sub>. Steps (i) and (ii) are repeated until the simulation time <italic>t</italic> reaches the desired final time, <italic>t</italic><sub>final</sub>. A more detailed explanation of the kinetic simulation is presented in [12, 33].</p>
<p>Our goal is to compute observables characterizing replication in the VCG scenario based on the full kinetic simulation. For clarity, we focus on one particular observable (yield) for the derivation. The results for other observables are stated directly, as their derivations follow analogously. Recall the definition of the yield introduced in the main text,

As we are interested in the initial replication performance of the VCG, we compute the yield based on the ligation events that take place until the characteristic timescale of ligations <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline82.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. We would like to compute the yield based on the templated ligation events that we observe in the simulation. Unfortunately, for reasonable system parameters, it is impossible to simulate the system long enough to observe sufficiently many ligation events to compute <italic>y</italic> to reasonable accuracy. For example, for a VCG pool containing monomers at a total concentration of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline83.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and VCG oligomers of length <italic>L</italic> = 8 at a total concentration of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline84.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, it would take about 1700 hours of simulation time to reach <italic>t</italic> = 5 <italic>·</italic> 10<sup>12</sup> <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub>. Multiple such runs would be needed to estimate the mean and the variance of the observables of interest, rendering this approach unfeasible.</p>
<p>Instead, we compute the replication observables based on the copy number of complexes that could potentially perform a templated ligation, i.e., complexes, in which two strands are hybridized adjacent to each other, such that they could form a covalent bond. It can be shown analytically that the number of potentially productive complexes is a good approximation for the number of incorporated nucleotides. The number of incorporated nucleotides can be computed as the integral over the ligation flux, weighted by the number of nucleotides that are added in each templated ligation reaction,

where ⟨… ⟩ denotes the average over realizations of the ensembles ℰ<sub><italic>t</italic></sub> within the time interval <italic>t</italic> ∈ [<italic>τ</italic><sub>eq</sub>, <italic>τ</italic><sub>lig</sub>]. Note that, at this point, we made the additional assumption that no templated ligations are taking place between [0, <italic>τ</italic><sub>eq</sub>]. This assumption is reasonable, as (i) the equilibration process is very short compared to the characteristic timescale of ligation, and (ii) the number of complexes that might allow for templated ligation during equilibration is lower than in the equilibrium (we start the simulation with an ensemble of single-stranded oligomers), implying that the rate of templated ligation is small.</p>
<p>In order to compute the average over different realizations of ensembles ℰ, we need to sample a set of uncorrelated ensembles that have reached the hybridization equilibrium. For this purpose, we run a full kinetic simulation. The simulation starts with a pool containing only single-stranded oligomers, and reaches the (de)hybridization equilibrium after a time <italic>τ</italic><sub>eq</sub>. We identify this timescale of equilibration by fitting an exponential function to the total hybridization energy of all complexes in the system, Δ<italic>G</italic><sub>tot</sub> (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>). In the set of ensembles used to evaluate the average in Eq. (S1), we only include ensembles for time <italic>t &gt; τ</italic><sub>eq</sub> to ensure that the ensembles have reached (de)hybridization equilibrium. To ensure that the ensembles are uncorrelated, we require that the time between two ensembles that contribute to the average is at least <italic>τ</italic><sub>corr</sub>. The correlation time, <italic>τ</italic><sub>corr</sub>, is determined via an exponential fit to the autocorrelation function of Δ<italic>G</italic><sub>tot</sub> (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>). Besides computing the expectation value (Eq. S1), we are also interested in the “uncertainty” of this expectation value, i.e., in the standard deviation of the sample mean <italic>σ</italic><sub>⟨<italic>X</italic>⟩</sub>. (We use <italic>X</italic> as a short-hand notation for ∑<sub>C∈<italic>ℰ</italic></sub> <italic>N</italic>(<monospace>C</monospace>) min(<italic>L</italic><sub>e,1</sub>, <italic>L</italic><sub>e,2</sub>) 𝟙 (<monospace>C</monospace> allows for templated ligation).) The standard deviation of the sample mean, <italic>σ</italic><sub>⟨<italic>X</italic>⟩</sub>, is related to the standard deviation of <italic>X, σ</italic><sub><italic>X</italic></sub>, by the number of samples, <italic>σ</italic><sub>⟨<italic>X</italic>⟩</sub> = (<italic>N</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>)<sup>−1<italic>/</italic>2</sup><italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>X</italic></sub>. Moreover, based on the van-Kampen system size expansion, we expect the standard deviation of <italic>X</italic> to be proportional to <italic>V</italic> <sup>−1<italic>/</italic>2</sup>. Thus, <italic>σ</italic><sub>⟨<italic>X</italic>⟩</sub> ∝ (<italic>N</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub><italic>V</italic>)<sup>−1<italic>/</italic>2</sup>.</p>
<p>Using Eq. (S1) (as well as an analogous expression for the number of nucleotides that are incorporated in VCG oligomers), the yield can be expressed as

Therefore, the variance of the computed observable can be reduced by either increasing the system volume or increasing the number of samples used for averaging. Both approaches incur the same computational cost: (i) Increasing the number of samples, <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>, requires running the simulation for a longer duration, with the additional runtime scaling linearly with the number of samples. (ii) Similarly, the additional runtime needed due to increased system volume, <italic>V</italic>, also scales linearly with <italic>V</italic> (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). One update step in the simulation always takes roughly the same amount of runtime, but the change in simulation time per update step depends on the total rate of all reactions in the system. The total rate is dominated by the association reactions, and their rate is proportional to the volume. Therefore, the change in simulation time per update step is proportional to <italic>V</italic> <sup>−1</sup>. The runtime, which is necessary to reach the same simulation time in a system with volume <italic>V</italic> as in a system with volume 1, is a factor of <italic>V</italic> longer in the larger system. With this in mind, it makes no difference whether the variance is reduced by increasing the volume or the number of samples.

    <title>Coarse-grained representation of complexes in the adiabatic approach</title>
<p>It is computationally expensive to evaluate the replication observables via the full kinetic simulation. For this reason, we develop an adiabatic approach, which allows us to compute the replication observables, provided that templated ligation is far slower than (de)hybridization. The adiabatic approach relies on a coarse-grained representation of the oligomers in the pool, which is introduced in this section.</p>
<sec id="s5c1">
<title>Single Strands</title>
<p>In the coarse-grained description, oligomers of identical length are assumed to have equal concentration, irrespective of their sequence. This assumption is justified for two reasons: (i) We initialize the VCG pool without sequence bias, i.e., all oligomers compatible with the genome sequence are included at equal concentration. (ii) Hybridization energy in our simplified energy model (and therefore also the stability of complexes) only depends on the length of the hybridization site, not on its sequence, provided there is no mismatch. Each coarse-grained oligomer is uniquely identified by its length <italic>L</italic>, and it represents a group of oligomers with ℭ (<italic>L</italic>) distinct sequences. We refer to the number ℭ (<italic>L</italic>) as the combinatorial multiplicity of the coarse-grained oligomer. The value of ℭ (<italic>L</italic>) depends on the choice of the encoded genome. By construction (see main text), we assume that all possible oligomer sequences of length <italic>L &lt; L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub> are included in the genome. For <italic>L</italic> ≥ <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub>, only a subset of all possible 4<sup><italic>L</italic></sup> sequences is included, but no sequence is repeated multiple times across the genome.

<p>Two strands can form a duplex by hybridizing to each other. We refer to the bottom oligomer as ‘Crick” strand <monospace>C</monospace> and to the top oligomer as “Watson” strand <monospace>W</monospace>. A duplex is uniquely characterized by the lengths of the oligomers, <italic>L</italic><sub>C</sub> and <italic>L</italic><sub>W</sub>, as well as their relative alignment (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A</xref>). The alignment index <italic>i</italic> denotes the position of the Watson strand with respect to the Crick strand. As there needs to be at least one nucleotide of overlap between the strands for a duplex to exist, the alignment index needs lie in the interval <italic>i</italic> ∈ [− (<italic>L</italic><sub>W</sub> − 1), <italic>L</italic><sub>C</sub> − 1]. Using the alignment index, we can also determine if the duplex has a left (or right) dangling end.

To compute the combinatorial multiplicity for a duplex with fixed <italic>L</italic><sub>C</sub>, <italic>L</italic><sub>W</sub> and alignment index <italic>i</italic>, we need to multiply the combinatorial multiplicity of the Crick strand by the number of possible hybridization partners. We assume that a hybridization partner is possible if its sequence is perfectly complementary to the lower strand within the hybridization region, whereas hybridization partners with mismatches are not accounted for. This is sensible as long as the energetic penalty for mismatches in the full kinetic simulation is sufficiently large to suppress mismatches. The number of possible hybridization partners is determined by the length of the overlap region <italic>L</italic><sub>o</sub>: If <italic>L</italic><sub>o</sub> ≥ <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub>, the pool contains only one oligomer sequence that can act as hybridization partner by construction of the genome.

Analogously, <italic>j</italic> denotes the relative position of <monospace>W2</monospace> relative to oligomer <monospace>C</monospace>. Two strands that are hybridized to each other need to have a hybridization region of at least one nucleotide. Moreover, the strands <monospace>W1</monospace> and <monospace>W2</monospace> must not occupy the same position on the template strand <monospace>C</monospace>. Taking both requirements together, the alignment indices fall within the intervals,

A triplex may have a dangling end not only on its left or right end, but also in the gap between strands <monospace>W1</monospace> and <monospace>W2</monospace>. Three boolean variables are necessary to denote the presence/absence of the respective dangling ends,

The hybridization energy depends on the length of the overlap regions as well as on the existence of dangling ends: As in the duplex, each overlap region of length <italic>L</italic><sub>o,1</sub> (or <italic>L</italic><sub>o,2</sub>) comprises <italic>L</italic><sub>o,1</sub> − 1 (or <italic>L</italic><sub>o,2</sub> − 1) nearest neighbor blocks, each of which contributes <italic>γ</italic> to the total energy. Moreover, every dangling end contributes <italic>γ/</italic>2. Note that the presence of a gap between strands <monospace>W1</monospace> and <monospace>W2</monospace>, i.e., <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> = 1, implies that there are two dangling ends, one for <monospace>W1</monospace> and another for <monospace>W2</monospace>. Gaps in between two complexes contribute <italic>γ/</italic>2 per each dangling end, adding up to <italic>γ</italic>. If there is no gap between the strands, i.e., <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> = 0, there are no dangling end contributions, but a new full nearest neighbor block emerges, which contributes <italic>γ</italic> to the energy. Therefore, the total energy reads,

<graphic xlink:href="603910v3_ueqn33.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
The combinatorial multiplicity of a triplex is computed in the same way as for the duplex: The combinatorial multiplicity of the strand <monospace>C</monospace> is multiplied by the number of possible hybridization partners <monospace>W1</monospace> and <monospace>W2</monospace>. Again, the number of possible partners is set by the length of the hybridization regions,

Recall that we assumed that all sequences of a given length that are compatible with the circular genome are equally likely in the pool (Section S3). Thus, the concentration of the coarse-grained oligomer and the concentration of an oligomer with specified sequence are related by the combinatorial multiplicity,

In order to compute the concentration of a complex based on the concentration of single strands, we make use of the law of mass action. The concentration of a specific sequence realization of a complex is computed as the product of concentrations of the strands forming the complex divided by the dissociation constant <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub>,

where <italic>c</italic><sup>°</sup> = 1 M is the standard concentration. Just as in the case of single strands, the concentration of the sequence-independent coarse-grained complex is related to the concentration of a complex with specific sequence realization via the combinatorial prefactor,
<disp-formula id="ueqn56">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v3_ueqn56.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>

It can be useful to combine the combinatorial multiplicity and the dissociation constant into a single effective association constant,

<p>In the adiabatic approach, we study the behavior of the system on timescales that are long enough for the system to reach the (de)hybridization equilibrium, but too short for templated ligation events to take place. Therefore, the length of the oligomers are expected not to change throughout the equilibration process, and we need to introduce a separate mass conservation law for each coarse-grained oligomer, i.e., each oligomer length, that is included in the pool. For each length, the concentration of single-stranded coarse-grained oligomers of length <italic>L</italic> and the concentration of coarse-grained oligomers of length <italic>L</italic> bound in a complex need to add up to their total concentration <italic>c</italic><sup>tot</sup>(<italic>L</italic>) set by the initial condition,

<p>Combining the mass conservation requirement with the mass action law gives a set of coupled polynomial equations. The number of equations equals the number of distinct oligomer lengths included in the pool. The polynomial equations are of degree 4, as quaternary complexes are the largest complexes to be accounted for and their concentrations equals the product of the four strands comprising the complex. We determine the equilibrium concentrations by finding the root of this set of fourth-degree polynomial equations using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.</p>

<p>As we are not modeling templated ligation events explicitely in the adiabatic approach, we compute replication observables based on the equilibrium concentration of complexes that are in a configuration which allows for a templated ligation reaction to happen.

Recall that the absence of a gap between two oligomers in the complex implies that the dangling end indicator variable <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> = 0 (Section S3).

    <title>Scaling law of the equilibrium concentration ratio that maximizes replication efficiency</title>
<p>We consider a pool containing monomers and VCG oligomers of a single length. As the feedstock only contains monomers, the total monomer concentration and the total feedstock concentration are identical, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline103.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>.

In such a system, the replication efficiency can be expressed as
<disp-formula id="ueqn66">

</disp-formula>
where the concentrations denote the equilibrium concentration of all complexes facilitating the indicated type of templated ligation. Note that we do not include dimerizations, i.e., F+F ligations, in the numerator as they do not contribute to the yield. Moreover, the V+V ligations are multiplied by the length of the oligomers <italic>L</italic><sub>V</sub>, as each V+V extends an existing oligomer by <italic>L</italic><sub>V</sub> nucleotides.</p>
<p>Assuming that complexes comprised of three strands are the dominant type of complexes, we can express the equilibrium concentrations as product of the equilibrium concentrations of the free strands and the effective association constants,

    <title>Dependence of replication efficiency on subsequence lengthscales of the circular genome</title>
<p>The coarse-grained representation (Section S3) used in the adiabatic approach applies only to a specific class of genomes – those in which the exhaustive coverage length <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> is maximal and the unique motif length <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub> is minimal. This corresponds to genomes that satisfy <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline144.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline145.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> (see Section S1 for details).</p>
<p>To analyze replication behavior beyond this limited case, we developed a fully sequence-resolved extension of the adiabatic approach. Rather than using a coarse-grained view of oligomers, this method considers each distinct strand sequence as a separate chemical species. For example, a genome of length <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub> = 64 nt that is encoded in a pool containing monomers and octamers, a total of 132 individual oligomers must be tracked: 4 monomers and 128 distinct octamers. This contrasts sharply with the coarse-grained scenario, which involves only two variables (total monomer and total octamer concentrations). Starting from the single-stranded oligomers, all possible complexes involving up to three strands are enumerated, and their hybridization free energies are calculated using the same energetic model applied in the coarse-grained framework. In the aforementioned example, this results in 351 200 distinct sequence-resolved complexes, compared to just 135 complexes in the coarse-grained model, highlighting the increased computational demands in terms of memory and runtime. The hybridization equilibrium is computed by solving the algebraic system defined by the law of mass action and mass conservation. The procedure mirrors that of the coarse-grained approach (Section S4), with the key difference that combinatorial prefactors are no longer required: these are inherently encoded in the full enumeration of unique sequences and their binding configurations.</p>
<p>For our further analysis, we fix the genome length at <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub> = 64 nt and systematically vary the motif length scales <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> and <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub>. Genomes with desired values of <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> and <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub> are constructed as described in Section S1: Starting from a genome with maximal motif entropy <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline146.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, we reduce the motif entropy on intermediate length scales <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> <italic>&lt; L &lt; L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub> to achieve the target characteristics. <xref rid="tblS2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref> provides an overview of all sampled genome sequences. We consider two limiting cases for motif distributions between <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> and <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub>. In the weakly biased case, the motif distribution (for motifs of length <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> <italic>&lt; L &lt; L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub>) is nearly uniform: most motifs of length <italic>L</italic> appear exactly once, except for a few motifs that occur twice. This leads to genomes where <italic>L</italic> ≠ <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub>, but the deviation from maximal entropy is minimal. In the strongly biased case, many motifs appear multiple times, yielding a much less uniform distribution.</p>

<p>Each genome is mapped to a Virtual Circular Genome (VCG) pool containing monomers and oligomers of variable length <italic>L</italic><sub>V</sub>. Assuming all oligomers are chemically activated, we compute the replication efficiency of each pool as a function of the relative oligomer concentration, for different values of <italic>L</italic><sub>V</sub> and across genome types (<xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9</xref>). As expected, replication efficiency exhibits a maximum at intermediate oligomer concentrations. The maximum efficiency achieved depends on both the VCG oligomer length and the genome’s motif properties. In general, longer oligomers enable more efficient replication. However, at a fixed oligomer length, genomes with higher unique motif lengths <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub> (or lower <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub>) replicate with lower efficiency, implying that these genomes require longer oligomers for successful replication. For example, a VCG pool with oligomers of length <italic>L</italic><sub>V</sub> = 9 nt can replicate a genome with <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> = 3 nt and <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub> = 4 nt at 97% efficiency (see solid green curve in <xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9B</xref>). In contrast, replicating a genome with <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> = 3 nt and <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub> = 10 nt requires oligomers of at least <italic>L</italic><sub>V</sub> = 11 nt to reach comparable efficiency (see dotted green curve in <xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9C</xref>).</p>
<p>Across all tested genomes, the oligomer length required to achieve <italic>&gt;</italic> 95% efficiency (denoted<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline147.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>) consistently exceeds the unique motif length <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub> (<xref rid="figS10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10</xref>). However, the difference <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline148.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> depends on the structure of the motif distribution in the intermediate length range <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> <italic>&lt; L &lt; L</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub>.

    <title>Enhanced replication efficiency in multi-length VCG pools</title>
    <p>We investigate if a pool containing a range of VCG oligomer lengths exhibits higher replication efficiency than single-length pools.

We distinguish complexes producing correct (labeled “c”) and false products (labeled “f”). For each relevant type of complex, we highlight the region in the concentration plane where it contributes most significantly, i.e., at least 20% of the total ligation flux. The plateau of high efficiency is dominated by the ligation of monomers to octamers, whereas the ridge of increased efficiency is due to the correct ligation of two tetramers templated by an octamer.figure.caption.10), with extensions of octamers by monomers (1+8) being the most dominant type of templated ligation reactions. For strong binding affinity, <italic>γ</italic> = −5.0 <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub><italic>T</italic>, templated ligations of tetramers on octamer templates eventually achieve the same replication efficiency as (1+8) ligations (<xref rid="figS11" ref-type="fig">Fig. S11</xref>). The mechanism relies on a significant difference in the length of the template (octamers) and educt strands (tetramers).

    <title>Analytical solution for equilibrium concentrations in multi-length VCG pools</title>
<p>We consider pools comprised of monomers, dimers and VCG oligomers of multiple lengths. For simplicity, we restrict ourselves to profiles with a uniform distribution of VCG oligomers, such that all VCG oligomers have the same concentration. Assuming that almost all oligomer mass is contained in single strands and duplexes, the mass conservation equations read
<disp-formula id="ueqn94">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v3_ueqn94.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Note that there is a mass conservation equation for each oligomer length individually, i.e., we are dealing with a set of multiple coupled quadratic equations. We can make the system of equations dimensionless by introducing a dimensionless concentration <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline179.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>,
<disp-formula id="eqnS9">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v3_eqnS9.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
This rescaling is chosen as it is the solution to the (approximative) mass conservation equation in the high concentration limit,
<disp-formula id="ueqn95">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v3_ueqn95.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
under the assumption that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline180.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. The latter assumption is reasonable given the concentration profile is uniform. We expect <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline181.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> to be of order 1 in the high concentration limit.</p>
<p>Writing the full mass conservation equation in terms of the dimensionless concentration yields,
<disp-formula id="ueqn96">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v3_ueqn96.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
We drop all ratios of total concentrations, as we assume that the total concentration is the same for each oligomer length of VCG oligomer (uniform concentration profile),
<disp-formula id="ueqn97">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v3_ueqn97.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
By introducing the dimensionless prefactors,
<disp-formula id="ueqn98">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v3_ueqn98.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
we can rewrite the mass conservation equation,
<disp-formula id="ueqn99">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v3_ueqn99.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
To solve for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline182.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, we make the assumption that the dimensionless equilibrium concentration is close to 1 for any length <italic>L</italic>. For this reason, we may assume that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline183.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. This assumption is crucial, as it allows us to de-couple the quadratic equations. Therefore, the mass conservation reads,
<disp-formula id="ueqn100">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v3_ueqn100.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
We can use this representation to compute the equilibrium concentrations recursively: We start the recursion with the assumption <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline184.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, and compute <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline185.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> with this assumption,
<disp-formula id="eqnS10">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v3_eqnS10.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
In the first recursion step, we compute <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline186.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, and solve the mass conservation equation for the equilibrium concentration,
<disp-formula id="eqnS11">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v3_eqnS11.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
This scheme can be applied until the approximated values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline187.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> match the true values (obtained via numerical root finding) sufficiently well,
<disp-formula id="ueqn101">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v3_ueqn101.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Note that the equilibrium concentration obtained after the (<italic>i</italic> + 1)-th iteration step <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline188.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> depends on the total concentration <italic>c</italic><sup>tot</sup>(<italic>L</italic>) via the rescaling prefactor as well as via <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub>. It turns out that the approximation converges after about five iteration steps; the relative error between the true (numerically computed) equilibrium concentration and the approximation is already below 1% in the first iteration step.</p>

    <title>Threshold concentration for the inversion of productivity</title>
<p>In VCG pools that contain VCG oligomers of multiple lengths as well as activated monomers, we observe “inversion of productivity”: The fraction of short VCG oligomers in a monomer extension-capable complex configuration exceeds that of long oligomers. However, this is only the case for sufficiently high concentration of VCG oligomers. The threshold concentration that is necessary for oligomers of length <italic>M</italic> to exceed the monomer-extension fraction of oligomers of length <italic>L</italic> (assuming <italic>M &lt; L</italic>) is set by the condition <italic>r</italic><sub>1+V</sub>(<italic>L</italic>) = <italic>r</italic><sub>1+V</sub>(<italic>M</italic>). To compute <italic>r</italic><sub>1+V</sub>(<italic>L</italic>), we need to account for all possible complexes, in which an oligomer <italic>L</italic> can be extended by a monomers,
<disp-formula id="ueqn102">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v3_ueqn102.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
As we are considering a uniform concentration profile, all VCG oligomers have the same total concentration, i.e., <italic>c</italic><sup>tot</sup>(<italic>L</italic>) = <italic>c</italic><sup>tot</sup>(<italic>M</italic>). Thus, we can express the condition for the threshold concentration as
<disp-formula id="ueqn103">
<graphic xlink:href="603910v3_ueqn103.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
We combine this condition with the analytical approximation of the equilibrium concentration up to the first iteration step derived in Section S12, <italic>cf</italic>. Eqs. S9-S11. As the equilibrium concentrations <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline189.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> depend on the total concentration of VCG oligomers <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline190.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, this yields an semi-analytical criterion for the threshold concentration<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline191.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, at which the fraction of monomer-extended <italic>M</italic>-mers exceeds the fraction of monomer-extended <italic>L</italic>-mers.</p>

    <title>Inversion of productivity using parameters of system studied by Ding <italic>et al</italic></title>
<p>In their experimental study, Ding <italic>et al</italic>. focus on a genome of length <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub> = 12 nt. In the VCG pool encoding the genome, Ding <italic>et al</italic>. include (<xref rid="tblS1" ref-type="table">Tab. S1</xref> in [9])</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>dimers with 11 different sequences,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>trimers with 20 different sequences, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>tetramers up to 12-mers with 24 different sequences each.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Every oligomer sequence is included with a concentration of 1 µM (so-called 1x profile), adding up to a total concentration of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline192.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. The feedstock for the replication is comprised of activated imidazolium-bridged homo-dinucleotides with a total concentration of 20 mM. Over a timescale of around 4 h, these homo-dinucleotides react with each other to form 6 additional imidazolium-bridged hetero-dinucleotides as well as activated mono-nucleotides (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref> in [9]).</p>
<p>We construct a genome that mimics the properties of the genome used by Ding <italic>et al</italic>., but obeys our genome construction principles outlined in the method section of the main text. To this end, we consider a genome of length <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub> = 12 nt and a minimal unique subsequence length of <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub> = 3 nt. This implies that our VCG pool contains</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>dimers with 16 different sequences, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>trimers up to 12-mers with 24 different sequences.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Our model does not include imidazolium-bridged dinucleotides explicitely. Instead, we assume that the concentration of activated mononucleotides in our model equals the total concentration of activated homo-dinucleotides (20 mM) used in the experimental study. The total concentration of non-activated oligomers is treated as a free parameters.</p>
<p>We find that the system exhibits inversion of productivity: For the entire considered range of concentration of non-activated oligomers, 10-mers are more likely to be extended by a monomer than 12-mers (<xref rid="figS17" ref-type="fig">Fig. S17</xref>). Moreover, 8-mers are more productive than 12-mers (provided the concentration of non-activated oligomers exceeds roughly 0.3 µM), and more productive than 10-mers (provided <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline193.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>). Thus, for the experimentally used concentration of non-activated oligomers (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603910v3_inline194.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, see vertical dashed line in <xref rid="figS17" ref-type="fig">Fig. S17</xref>), 8-mers are more productive than 10-mers, which are in turn more productive than 12-mers. Unlike in the experimental system, 6-mers are less likely than 8-mers and 10-mers to be extended by a monomer. We suppose that this difference can be attributed to the differences between the experimental setup and our theoretical model: (i) We choose a (slightly) different genome than Ding <italic>et al</italic>.. (ii) We model imidazolium-bridged dinucleotides as mononucleotides, as imidazolium-bridged dinucleotides only incorporate one mononucleotide at a time, just like activated mononucleotides. However, dinucleotides bind more stably to an existing complex than mononucleotides, which will affect the fraction of monomer-extended oligomers predicted.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This important theoretical and computational study by Burger and Gerland attempts to set environmental, compositional, kinetic, and thermodynamic constraints on the proposed virtual circular genome (VCG) model for the early non-enzymatic replication of RNA. The authors create a solid kinetic model using published kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for non-enzymatic RNA ligation and (de)hybridization, which allows them to test a variety of hypotheses about the VCG. Prominently, the authors find that the length (longer is better) and concentration (intermediate is better) of the VCG oligos have an outsized impact on the fidelity and yield of VCG production with important implications for future VCG design. They also identify that activation of only RNA monomers, which can be achieved using environmental separation of the activation and replication, can relax the constraints on the concentration of long VCG component oligos by avoiding the error-prone oligo-oligo ligation. Finally, in a complex scenario with multiple VCG oligo lengths, the authors demonstrate a clear bias for the extension of shorter oligos compared to the longer ones. This effect has been observed experimentally (Ding et al., JACS 2023) but was unexplained rigorously until now. Overall, this manuscript will be of interest to scientists studying the origin of life and the behavior of complex nucleic acid systems.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- The kinetic model is carefully and realistically created, enabling the authors to probe the VCG thoroughly.</p>
<p>
- Fig. 6 outlines important constraints for scientists studying the origin of life. It supports the claim that the separation of activation and replication chemistry is required for efficient non-enzymatic replication. One could easily imagine a scenario where activation of molecules occurs, followed by their diffusion into another environment containing protocells that encapsulate a VCG. The selective diffusion of activated monomers across protocell membranes would then result in only activated monomers being available to the VCG, which is the constraint outlined in this work. The proposed exclusive replication by monomers also mirrors the modern biological systems, which nearly exclusively replicate by monomer extension.</p>
<p>
- Another strength of the work is that it explains why shorter oligos extend better compared to the long ones in complex VCG mixtures. This point is independent of the activation chemistry used (it simply depends on the kinetics and thermodynamics of RNA base-pairing) so it should be very generalizable.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is an interesting theoretical study examining the viability of Virtual Circular Genome (VCG) model, a recently proposed scenario of prebiotic replication in which a relatively long sequence is stored as a collection of its shorter subsequences (and their compliments). It was previously pointed out that VCG model is prone to socalled sequence scrambling which limits the overall length of such a genome. In the present paper, additional limitations are identified. Specifically, it is shown that VCG is well replicated when the oligomers are elongated by sufficiently short chains from ”feedstock” pool. However, ligation of oligomers from VCG itself results in a high error rate. I believe the research is of high quality and well written. However, the presentation could be improved and the key messages could be clarified.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>High-quality theoretical modeling of an important problem is implemented.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The conclusions are somewhat convoluted and could be presented better.</p>
<p>(1) It is not clear from the paper whether the observed error has the same nature as sequence scrambling.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for pointing out that this important point was not clearly explained. The sequence errors observed in our model are indeed of the same nature as sequence scrambling previously identified by Chamanian and Higgs (Chamanian and Higgs, PLoS Comp Biol 2022). The core issue is the ligation of two oligomers representing non-adjacent segments of the genome sequence, leading to the formation of ”chimeric” products that are not part of the desired genome.</p>
<p>Our analysis identifies the ligation of VCG oligomers (V+V reactions) as the primary mechanism driving sequence scrambling. This allowed us to propose two strategies to mitigate sequence scrambling: (i) tuning the length and concentration of the VCG oligomers, and (ii) considering scenarios where only feedstock monomers contribute to elongation (non-reactive VCG oligomers). We modified the Introduction and Results section of our manuscript to convey this connection more clearly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors introduce two important lengths LS1 and LS2 only in the conclusions and do not explain enough which each of them is important. It would make sense to discuss this early in the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the Reviewer and have followed the suggestion to introduce the two important length scales earlier in the manuscript (in the Model section of the main text). In the updated version, we refer to these length scales as the <italic>exhaustive coverage length</italic> <italic>L<sub>E</sub></italic> (formerly LS1) and the <italic>unique subsequence length</italic> <italic>L<sub>U</sub></italic> (formerly LS2). The exhaustive coverage length <italic>L<sub>E</sub></italic> is defined as the maximum motif length for which all possible sequences of that length appear somewhere in the genome. In contrast, the unique subsequence length <italic>L<sub>U</sub></italic> is the minimum motif length such that each subsequence of that length occurs only once in the genome, thus giving each motif a unique ”address”.</p>
<p>Generally, a genome of length <italic>L<sub>G</sub></italic> contains at most 2<italic>L<sub>G</sub></italic> distinct subsequences, implying that <italic>L<sub>E</sub></italic> can be at most <inline-formula id="sa3equ1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-104043-sa3-equ1.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula>, and <italic>L<sub>U</sub></italic> must be at least <inline-formula id="sa3equ2"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-104043-sa3-equ2.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula>, where ⌊<italic>...</italic>⌋ and ⌈<italic>...</italic>⌉ denote the next lower and higher integer, respectively. While the previous version of the manuscript focused exclusively on the limiting case <italic>L<sub>E</sub></italic> = <italic>L</italic><sup>max</sup><italic><sub>E</sub></italic> and <italic>L<sub>U</sub></italic> = <italic>L</italic><sup>min</sup><italic><sub>U</sub></italic> , we have extended our analysis to genomes with a broader range of <italic>L<sub>E</sub></italic> and <italic>L<sub>U</sub></italic> values the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>This extended analysis reveals that, for accurate and efficient replication, the VCG oligomer length must always exceed <italic>L<sub>U</sub></italic>, regardless of the choice of <italic>L<sub>E</sub></italic>. The required margin beyond <italic>L<sub>U</sub></italic> depends on the distribution of intermediate-length motifs (i.e., with <italic>L<sub>E</sub></italic> &lt; <italic>L</italic> &lt; <italic>L<sub>U</sub></italic>), but is typically only a few nucleotides.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) It is not entirely clear why specific length distribution for VCG oligomers has to be assumed rather than emerged from simulations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have integrated these new findings into the Results section of the main text and expanded the discussion of their implications for the prebiotic relevance of the VCG scenario in the Discussion section. Full methodological details are provided in the Supplementary Material (Sections S1 and S8).</p>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for this insightful question. Our choice to assume specific length distributions for VCG oligomers is motivated by both conceptual and practical considerations. We explain our reasoning more clearly in the revised manuscript, in the beginning of the Model section of the main text.</p>
<p>Conceptually, our study focuses on the <italic>propagation</italic> of sequence information by an already-formed VCG, rather than its <italic>emergence</italic> from a random pool. As discussed by Chamanian and Higgs, the spontaneous formation of a VCG from randomly interacting oligomers is a rare event. Our aim is to understand whether, once formed, such a structure can robustly replicate under prebiotic conditions. This question is best addressed when the genome and the oligomer pool (including their lengths and concentrations) can be systematically controlled.</p>
<p>From a practical standpoint, working with a controllable pool of oligomers facilitates direct comparison to recent experimental studies that use predefined and well-characterized oligomer pools (Ding et al. JACS 2023). With our current methods and realistic rate constants, simulating the emergence of such pools from simple building blocks (e.g., monomers and dimers) would be computationally prohibitive, due to the low ligation rate. For example, in a system containing monomers (concentration 0.1mM) and octamers (concentration 1µM) in a volume of <italic>V</italic> = 3.3µm<sup>3</sup>, simulating the time between two ligation events takes over 300 hours of compute time (see SI Fig. S2). This renders dynamic pool generation unfeasible for the scope of our study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Furthermore, the problem has another important length, L0 that is never introduced or discussed: a minimal hybridization length with a lifetime longer than the ligation time. From the parameters given, it appears that L0 is sufficiently long (∼ 10 bases). In other words, it appears that the study is done is a somewhat suboptimal regime: most hybridization events do not lead to a ligation. Am I right in this assessment? If that is the case, the authors might want to explore another regime, _L_0 _&lt; LS_1, by considering a higher ligation rate.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, we assume that the ligation rate is smaller than both the hybridization and dehybridization rates for any oligomer typically included in the pool (up to length 10). In terms of effective length scales, this corresponds to <italic>L</italic><sub>0</sub> ≈ 10nt, with <italic>L</italic><sub>0</sub> defined as stated by the Reviewer, i.e., the hybridization length corresponding to a lifetime comparable to the ligation time. Most of our analysis actually exploits the small ligation rate, by employing an adiabatic approximation in which ligation is assumed to be slower than any hybridization or dehybridization process in the pool irrespective of oligomer length. As the Reviewer states, in this regime most hybridization events are transient, and will not result in ligation, since the complexes typically dissociate before ligation can occur.</p>
<p>While we agree that this assumption limits the overall yield of replication, it has a beneficial effect on replication fidelity. Oligomers that hybridize with mismatches tend to unbind more quickly due to the destabilizing effect of mismatches. In the slow-ligation regime, such complexes are likely to dissociate before a ligation can occur, preventing the formation of incorrect products. In contrast, if the ligation rate was comparable to the unbinding rate of mismatched hybrids, these incorrect associations could undergo ligation, thereby lowering the fidelity of replication. We thus view the regime <italic>L</italic><sub>0</sub> &gt; <italic>L<sub>V</sub></italic> as more favorable for studying the error-suppressing potential of the VCG mechanism, though we acknowledge that exploring the effects of faster ligation rates is an interesting question for future work.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>• Most of the experimental work on the VCG has been performed with the bridged 2aminoimidazolium dinucleotides, which are not featured in the kinetic model of this work. Oher studies by Szostak and colleagues have demonstrated that non-enzymatic RNA extension with bridged dinucleotides have superior kinetics (Walton et al. JACS 2016, Li et al. JACS 2017), fidelity (Duzdevich et al. NAR 2021), and regioselectivity (Giurgiu et al. JACS 2017) compared to activated monomers, establishing the bridged dinucleotides as important for non-enzymatic RNA replication. Therefore, the omission of these species in the kinetic model presented here can be perceived as problematic. The major claim that avoidance of oligo ligations is beneficial for VCGs may be irrelevant if bridged dinucleotides are used as the extending species, because oligo ligations (V + V in this work) are kinetically orders of magnitude slower than monomer extensions (F + V in this work) (Ding et al. NAR 2022). Formally adding the bridged dinucleotides to the kinetic model is likely outside of the scope of this work, but perhaps the authors could test if this should be done in the future by simply increasing the rate of monomer extension (F + V) to match the bridged dinucleotide rate without changing rate of V + V ligation?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for this insightful comment. Indeed, we did not design our model to specifically describe the use of bridged 2-aminoimidazolium dinucleotides as feedstock for the VCG scenario. Adding the bridged dinucleotides to our model would require allowing for feedstock that effectively changes its length during the ligation reaction. As anticipated already by the Reviewer, this is outside the scope of our current modeling framework, which was chosen to explore the generic issue of sequence scrambling in the VCG scenario without distinguishing between different types of activation chemistries.</p>
<p>Along the lines of the Reviewer’s suggestion, we clarified in the revised manuscript that we consider two limiting cases out of a family of models with two different ligation rate constants, <italic>k</italic><sub>lig,1</sub> for ligations involving a monomer and <italic>k</italic><sub>lig,&gt;1</sub> for ligations involving no monomer, allowing for kinetic discrimination between these processes. We consider the two limiting cases where either <italic>k</italic><sub>lig,1</sub> = <italic>k</italic><sub>lig,&gt;1</sub> or <italic>k</italic><sub>lig,1</sub><italic>/</italic><italic>k</italic><sub>lig,1</sub> → 0. The latter case, captures the behavior expected from an activation chemistry that enables fast primer extension but slow ligation, thereby suppressing sequence scrambling via V+V ligation events. The corresponding results, presented in Figure 6 and 7, indeed show that the VCG replication efficiency approaches 100% for pools that are rich in VCG oligomers.</p>
<p>Our coarse-grained model, which does not explicitly describe the activation chemistry, was sufficient to capture important kinetic and thermodynamic constraints of the VCG scenario, and to qualitatively explain the experimental observation of a preferential extension of short over long VCG oligomers (Fig. 7B). For future work, we plan to extend our model to account for the activation chemistry in detail, to allow for a more quantitative comparison between theory and experiment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• The kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for oligo binding appear to be missing two potentially important components. First, base-paired RNA strands that contain gaps where an activated monomer or oligo can bind have been shown to display significantly different kinetics of ligation and binding/unbinding than complexes that do not contain such gaps (see Prywes et al. eLife 2016, Banerjee et al. Nature Nanotechnology 2023, and Todisco et al. JACS 2024). Would inclusion of such parameters alter the overall kinetic model?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for highlighting these recent studies. Todisco et al. (JACS 2024) report that complexes with gaps are well described by standard nearest-neighbor models, while stacking interactions at nick sites confer additional stability beyond these predictions. Our model is therefore expected to capture the thermodynamics of complexes with gaps accurately, but likely underestimates the stability of complexes containing nicks. In the VCG pool, all productive ligation complexes (F+F, F+V, V+V) inherently contain a nick and thus benefit from this stabilization, whereas unproductive complexes typically do not. The added stability is expected to increase the residence time of oligomers in productive complexes, thereby enhancing overall extension rates. However, since this stabilization applies uniformly across all productive complexes, it does not shift the relative contributions of different ligation pathways (in particular, correct vs. incorrect).</p>
<p>This reasoning assumes that hybridization and dehybridization occur on timescales faster than ligation or primer extension. It is conceivable that this separation of timescales does not hold, particularly for oligomers binding to templates with gaps, where association is slower due to steric hindrance, while dissociation is further slowed by stabilizing nicks. As a result, the residence time of such complexes can become comparable to (or longer than) the ligation timescale. We now discuss this aspect more thoroughly in the revised Results and Discussion sections. Capturing the resulting effects in our analytical framework would require relaxing the adiabatic assumption, which is beyond the scope of this work. We recognize the relevance of the non-adiabatic regime of the dynamics, and hope to explore this regime in follow-up work.</p>

<p>• Second, it has been shown that long base-paired RNA can tolerate mismatches to an extent that can result in monomer ligation to such mismatched duplexes (see Todisco et al. NAR 2024). Would inclusion of the parameters published in Todisco et al. NAR 2024 alter the kinetic model significantly?</p>

<p>In contrast to complexes with nicks and gaps, mismatched complexes (Todisco et al. NAR 2024) will decrease replication fidelity relative to the results presented in our manuscript. Our current model assumes perfect base pairing, such that replication errors arise only from binding events involving regions too short to reliably identify the correct genomic position (sequence scrambling). Allowing mismatches will indeed introduce an additional error mechanism via imperfect yet sufficiently stable duplexes, thereby increasing the rate of incorrect extensions. However, we expect this effect to be limited. Due to the thermodynamic cost of internal loops, mismatched duplexes most often have their mismatches near the ends of the hybridized region, where their destabilizing effect is weakest (Todisco et al. NAR 2024). Terminal mismatches at the 3’end of the primer have been shown to reduce the primer-extension rate significantly via a stalling effect (Rajamani et al. JACS 2010, Leu et al. JACS 2013). Hence, we would expect errors due to mismatched duplexes to primarily occur for mismatches at the 5′ end. Such errors could be mitigated by a VCG pool consisting only of oligomers that are sufficiently long relative to the unique motif length of the virtual genome.</p>
<p>We have extended the Discussion section to address this interesting issue.</p>

<p>We thank the Reviewer for spotting this mistake, which we have now corrected.</p>

<p>• In the Introduction, the section that discusses the fidelity of enzyme-free copying should include a reference to Duzdevich et al. NAR 2021, as that work measured the fidelity experimentally.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have included this reference together with other references on the kinetics of hybridization/dehybridization to nicks and gaps in the main text.</p>

<p>• The term feedstock oligomers may be problematic, because these also include monomers. In the ”Templated ligation” section of the Model, the statement ”We consider pools in which all oligomers are activated, as well as pools in which only monomers are activated” is imprecise. ”All oligomers, including monomers,...” would be better so as to avoid confusion in readers accustomed to standard RNA language.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for this helpful suggestion. In the revised manuscript, we now use the term feedstock (rather than feedstock oligomers) to avoid confusion. We have also revised the sentence in the ”Templated ligation” section to read ”all oligomers, including monomers, ...” as recommended.</p>

<p>• The ”Experimentally determined association rate constants” reference 24-26, which measured the rate constants for DNA. Considering that the authors are modeling RNA, I wonder if Ashwood et al. Biophysical Journal 2023 contains any relevant RNA data that could help refine the model?</p>

<p>We thank the Reviewer for pointing us to the study by Ashwood et al. We have added this reference to the corresponding paragraph in the revised manuscript. Their RNA association rate constant (∼ 5 × 10<sup>7</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) is larger than the one we used (∼ 1×10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), however a larger association rate is in fact beneficial for the validity of our adiabatic approximation, and thus would not affect our results, as long as the thermodynamic stability remains the same. This is because faster association then also implies faster dissociation, and the ratio of the ligation timescale to the timescales of (de)hybridization then becomes even smaller, which is the regime where the adiabatic approximation made in our analysis is justified.</p>

<p>• In ”Triplexe softype 1—8 and 1—9...”,the word triplexes will confuse readers with RNA expertise as triplexe simply a triple-strandedRNA.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for pointing out the potentially ambiguous nomenclature. To avoid confusion with triplestranded RNA structures, we now refer to binary (ternary, ...) complexes instead of duplexes (triplexes, ...) throughout the revised manuscript.</p>
