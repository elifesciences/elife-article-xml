<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The General Stress Response promotes survival of bacteria in adverse conditions, but how sensor proteins transduce species-specific signals to initiate the response is not known. The serine/threonine phosphatase RsbU initiates the General Stress Response in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> upon binding a partner protein (RsbT) that is released from sequestration by environmental stresses. We report that RsbT activates RsbU by inducing otherwise flexible linkers of RsbU to form a short coiled-coil that dimerizes and activates the phosphatase domains. Importantly, we present evidence that related coiled-coil linkers and phosphatase dimers transduce signals from diverse sensor domains to control the General Stress Response and other signaling across bacterial phyla. These results additionally resolve the mystery of how shared sensory domains control serine/threonine phosphatases, diguanylate cyclases and histidine kinases, revealing a common coiled-coil linker transduction mechanism. We propose that this provides bacteria with a modularly exchangeable toolkit for the evolution of diverse signaling pathways.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The General Stress Response (GSR) allows bacteria to survive in hostile and changing environments<sup>1-5</sup>. A defining feature of the GSR is that it controls transcription of a large and diverse set of genes, dramatically reshaping the physiology of the organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gottesman 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Guerreiro et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Boekhoud et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Boylan et al. 1993</xref>). Another defining feature is that the GSR is induced by a variety of stress conditions that are frequently associated with each other, including stationary phase, nutrient depletion, cellular damage, and (for pathogens) host defense mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gottesman 2019</xref>). This multiplicity of initiating conditions allows cells to anticipate and prepare for accumulating adversity, suggesting why the GSR is present in every bacterial species that has so far been analyzed. The GSR additionally contributes to pathogenesis through expression of genes controlling virulence, biofilm formation, and quorum sensing (Kint et al. 2017; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Battesti et al. 2011</xref>; Bartolini et al. 2019). Inactivation of the GSR, in turn, promotes the transition to long-term slow growth and antibiotic resistance, which are particularly important for persistent infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Tuchscherr &amp; Löffler 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Herbert et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bergkessel et al. 2016</xref>). Thus, deciphering the mechanisms that govern GSR activity is critical to understanding how bacteria interact with and adapt to their environments.</p>
<p>A major barrier to understanding initiation of the GSR is that we lack a unique, generalizable mechanistic model for how the activating signaling proteins have evolved to respond to species-specific signals. In a widespread mechanism for initiating the GSR, a member of the PPM family of serine/threonine phosphatases dephosphorylates a phosphorylated substrate protein to activate an alternative σ-factor through a “partner-switching” mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hecker et al. 2007</xref>), but how the phosphatase receives and is activated by an upstream signal has not been determined.</p>
<p>In this study, we address how the GSR phosphatase RsbU from <italic>B. subtilis</italic> is regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Yang et al. 1996</xref>) and present evidence that this mechanism is widely conserved. RsbU dephosphorylates a single phospho-serine on its substrate protein (RsbV) to release the GSR transcription factor (σ<sup>B</sup>) from inhibition by an anti-sigma factor (RsbW) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). RsbU has an N-terminal four-helix bundle dimerization domain that is also the binding site for RsbT, which activates RsbU as a phosphatase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C,D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Delumeau et al. 2004</xref>). RsbT is sequestered in a megadalton stress sensing complex called the stressosome, and is released to bind RsbU in response to specific stress signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Marles-Wright et al. 2008</xref>). We and others have reconstituted RsbU activation by RsbT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Delumeau et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ho &amp; Bradshaw 2021</xref>), but how RsbT activates RsbU was not known.</p>

<p>This “partner-switching” mechanism is broadly conserved, and the activating phosphatases are observed to have diverse N-terminal sensory domains including PAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Vijay et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Greenstein et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fernández Martínez et al. 2009</xref>), response-receiver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">de Been et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rodríguez-Martínez et al. 2023</xref>), GAF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kint et al. 2019</xref>), and HAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Mittenhuber 2002</xref>). These signaling domains are frequently found as N-terminal regulators of histidine kinases and GGDEF diguanylate cyclases in bacteria, but whether or not there are shared mechanistic features between the regulatory principles of PPM phosphatases and these other signaling effector families is not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Möglich et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Galperin 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>We previously described a mechanism for allosteric control of the related <italic>B. subtilis</italic> phosphatase SpoIIE, which regulates endospore formation through a partner-switching mechanism analogous to RsbU control of the GSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ho &amp; Bradshaw 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bradshaw et al. 2017</xref>). Two helices of the PPM domain (α1 and α2), which we refer to as the switch element, change conformation to recruit metal cofactor and activate SpoIIE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bradshaw et al. 2017</xref>). Based on analysis of structural and genetic data, we conjectured that this conformational change exemplifies a common mechanism among diverse phosphatases. However, we could not propose a specific model for how unrelated regulatory domains modularly control the switch conformation. For RsbU, we found that RsbT enhances phosphatase activity by increasing the efficacy of metal cofactor binding and that substitution of an amino acid in α1 (RsbU<sup>M166V/L</sup>) activates RsbU in the absence of RsbT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ho &amp; Bradshaw 2021</xref>) These results supported our proposal that the switch element controls RsbU activation, but they did not reveal how RsbT binding to the N-terminus of RsbU is transduced to the switch.</p>
<p>One broadly conserved feature of GSR phosphatases (absent in SpoIIE) is an α-helical linker of variable length, which is N-terminal to the PPM phosphatase domain. Genetic data suggest that this linker regulates a paralogous <italic>B. subtilis</italic> GSR phosphatase (RsbP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brody et al. 2009</xref>). Here we report that binding of RsbT to the N-terminus of RsbU rigidifies an otherwise flexible linker to dimerize the C-terminal phosphatase domains through an interface mediated by the switch element. Importantly, and as we now report, this mechanism is generalizable to other PPM phosphatases and reveals a widespread feature of bacterial signaling.</p>

<title><bold>The linker controls RsbU activation through a predicted phosphatase dimer</bold></title>
<p>We previously conducted a genetic screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ho &amp; Bradshaw 2021</xref>) to identify variants of RsbU that are active in the absence of RsbT. Focusing on the phosphatase domain in our initial study, we reported identification of an amino acid substitution in α1 (RsbU<sup>M166V/L</sup>) that links the switch element to RsbU activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ho &amp; Bradshaw 2021</xref>). From this screen, we isolated a second variant, RsbU<sup>Q94L</sup>, located in the linker of RsbU between the N-terminal dimerization domain and the C-terminal phosphatase domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-D</xref>). <italic>rsbU<sup>Q94L</sup></italic> strains activated σ<sup>B</sup> in the absence of <italic>rsbT</italic>. This activation is comparable to when <italic>rsbT</italic> is overexpressed to exceed the capacity of the stressosome and is stronger than what we observe in strains expressing <italic>rsbU<sup>M166V/L</sup></italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>To visualize how the Q94L and M166V/L substitutions could impact RsbU structure and activity, we generated an AlphaFold2 model of an RsbU dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Jumper et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Mirdita et al. 2022</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). The prediction of the complex was of high confidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Fig. S8</xref>) and had a dimer of the N-terminal region consistent with a previous experimental structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Delumeau et al. 2004</xref>). In our model, the linkers form extended alpha-helices (82-112) that cross to connect dimers of the RsbU N-terminal domains and C-terminal phosphatase domains, with Q94 buried in the linker interface and M166 buried in the core of the phosphatase domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>The crossing linker helices have similar conformation to homologous linkers observed in crystal structures of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> RssB, a phosphatase/adapter protein that also controls the GSR (PDB 3F7A and 3EQ2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2C</xref>). RssB has an N-terminal response-receiver domain in place of the RsbU four helix bundle dimerization domain, suggesting that linker conformation is a conserved feature of PPM phosphatase dimers with divergent N-terminal regulatory domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2C</xref>).</p>
<p>The linker helices in the RsbU prediction and the RssB structure splay apart as they enter the PPM domain with similar angle (pitch angles (α) based on Crick parameters for coiled-coils – 17.6° and –18.4° respectively) and pack against α-1 of the PPM fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Grigoryan &amp; DeGrado 2011</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that other bacterial signaling proteins that are regulated by coiled-coil linkers had similar pitch angle for the helices connecting to the catalytic domains (for example the dimeric histidine kinase CheA, 1B3Q, α –16.8°, and the dimeric GGDEF diguanylate cyclase PadC, 5LLW, α –14.3°) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bilwes et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gourinchas et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Grigoryan &amp; DeGrado 2011</xref>) (Fig S2C). Thus, the linker of RsbU could be a conserved regulatory feature, analogous to linkers of histidine kinases and GGDEF diguanylate cyclases.</p>
<p>Analysis of the RsbU dimer model using Socket2 identifies amino acids 83-97 as a two-turn coiled coil, with Q94 unfavorably packing against leucine 90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kumar &amp; Woolfson 2021</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2A</xref>). To test whether hydrophobicity at position 94 promotes an active state, we tested the activity of RsbU alleles with different amino acid substitutions at position 94 for σ<sup>B</sup> in wildtype and <italic>rsbT</italic> deleted strains. We found that substitutions of Q94 with amino acids that could pack at the intersection of the crossing linker helices (hydrophobic residues isoleucine, valine, and methionine, as well as tyrosine) resulted in mild, RsbT-independent activation of σ<sup>B</sup> that was further heightened by RsbT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2B</xref>). Aromatic hydrophobic residues (phenylalanine and tryptophan) drove constitutive activation of RsbU but did not bypass the requirement for <italic>rsbT</italic> on the chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2B</xref>). Substitutions of small or charged residues (alanine, glycine, glutamate, and asparagine) did not lead to activity in either strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2B</xref>). These results are consistent with a model in which burial of the amino acid at position 94, such as in the crossed helices of our prediction for RsbU dimer structure, drives RsbU activation.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>RsbT binding to RsbU is influenced by the linker</title>
<p>One prediction of our hypothesis that RsbT stabilizes the crossed alpha helices of the RsbU dimer, is that RsbT should bind more tightly to RsbU<sup>Q94L</sup> than to RsbU. To test this, we measured the binding affinity of RsbT for RsbU using fluorescence anisotropy. From these data we obtained a K<sub>D</sub> of 4.5 ± 1 µM, which decreased approximately 10-fold for RsbU<sup>Q94L</sup> (0.56 ± 0.2 µM) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Thus, RsbU<sup>Q94L</sup> stimulates RsbU phosphatase activity by an on-pathway mechanism, supporting the idea that RsbT binding stabilizes the linker in a dimerized conformation to activate RsbU.</p>

<title>RsbU phosphatase activation is controlled by the linker</title>
<p>We previously found that RsbT activates RsbU by simultaneously decreasing the K<sub>M</sub> for manganese cofactor and increasing the k<sub>cat</sub> for dephosphorylation of RsbV-P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ho &amp; Bradshaw 2021</xref>). To test whether RsbU Q94L substitution works by the same kinetic mechanism, we measured dephosphorylation of <sup>32</sup>P-phosphorylated RsbV by RsbU<sup>Q94L</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). The k<sub>cat</sub> of RsbU<sup>Q94L</sup> was nearly the same as for the basal activity of RsbU (2.4 ± 0.1 min<sup>-1</sup> compared to 1.4 ± 0.1 min<sup>-1</sup>, and stimulated more than ten-fold by RsbT, 15 ± 0.4 min<sup>-1</sup>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ho &amp; Bradshaw 2021</xref>). However, RsbU<sup>Q94L</sup> had a K<sub>M</sub> for MnCl<sub>2</sub> (1.4 ± 0.2 mM) that is more than fifty-fold reduced compared to RsbU alone (77 ± 9 mM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ho &amp; Bradshaw 2021</xref>), and similar to the K <sup>MnCl2</sup> of RsbU in the presence of RsbT (0.98 ± 0.07 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ho &amp; Bradshaw 2021</xref>)) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Addition of RsbT did not change the K<sub>M</sub> of RsbU<sup>Q94L</sup> for MnCl<sub>2</sub> (1.9 ± 0.6 mM), but the maximum catalytic rate of dephosphorylation increased nearly four-fold to 9.0 ± 0.64 min<sup>-1</sup>, approaching the rate of RsbU stimulated by RsbT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Thus, RsbU<sup>Q94L</sup> substantially recapitulates RsbT activation by decreasing the K<sub>M</sub> for Mn<sup>2+</sup>, demonstrating that the linker transduces RsbT binding to control the active site of RsbU. This is consistent with previous findings that the allosteric switch controlling phosphatase activity of SpoIIE couples dimerization to cofactor interaction.</p>

<title>RsbT binds to the linker and N-terminal domain</title>
<p>To visualize how RsbT could control the linker to activate RsbU, we generated an AlphaFold2 prediction of a heterotetrameric complex between RsbT and RsbU (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). In this model, RsbU adopts a conformation very similar to our prediction of the RsbU dimer (RMSD 1.36 Å), suggesting that our AlphaFold2 RsbU dimer model represents the active state of RsbU even when RsbT was not included in the prediction (a known feature of AlphaFold2 models (Chakravarty 2022)). The predicted structure places RsbT in a hybrid interface that spans the N-terminal dimerization domain of both RsbU monomers and the linker of one monomer (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Supporting the validity of the AlphaFold2 2RsbT/2RsbU model, residues previously implicated in RsbT/U binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hardwick et al. 2007</xref>) (Y28 and E24 from one RsbU monomer, I74, and I78 from the other RsbU monomer, and RsbT R19, R23, and N24) are all buried in the predicted interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3</xref>).</p>

<p>To gain further insight into how RsbT binding is transduced to RsbU linker conformation and phosphatase activity, we performed a genetic screen to isolate suppressors of RsbU<sup>Y28I</sup>, which was previously observed to abolish binding to RsbT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hardwick et al. 2007</xref>). After screening a library of PCR mutagenized <italic>rsbU<sup>Y28I</sup></italic>and <italic>rsbT</italic>, we identified eleven variants that introduced substitutions to RsbU that suppress <italic>rsbU<sup>Y28I</sup></italic>: S49G, K53E, T89A, G92E, G92R, Q94L, T110S, V142A, K143E, C165Y, and M173I (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-B</xref>). We additionally isolated revertants that restored Y28 suggesting that the screen was near saturation, but did not isolate any suppressors in <italic>rsbT</italic>, which was also mutagenized.</p>
<p>Mapping the RsbU<sup>Y28I</sup> suppressor mutations onto our 2RsbU/2RsbT model suggests that they fall into three classes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A and B</xref>): <italic>(1)</italic> Substitutions in the RsbU N-terminal dimerization domain that map near the predicted RsbT binding site (S49G and K53E), supporting the predicted interface. <italic>(2)</italic> Substitutions that map near predicted contacts between RsbT and the RsbU linker (T89A, G92E/R, and Q94L), providing evidence that contacts between RsbT and the linker promote RsbU activation. <italic>(3)</italic> Substitutions that cluster around the regulatory switch element of the RsbU phosphatase domain (helices α1 and α2 of the PPM fold, T110S, V142A, K143E, C165Y, and M173I). We hypothesize that these substitutions rescue RsbU<sup>Y28I</sup> inactivation by reducing the energetic cost (normally provided by RsbT binding) to transition the RsbU phosphatase domain to the active conformation. Together these genetic data provide independent support for the AlphaFold2 model of the 2RsbT/2RsbU complex, and suggest that RsbT activates RsbU by transmitting signals to the switch element in the RsbU phosphatase domain through a coiled-coil linker.</p>

<title>Contacts between RsbT and the RsbU linker drive phosphatase activation</title>
<p>To test the model that RsbT activates RsbU by directly interacting with the linker to dimerize the RsbU phosphatase domains, we introduced a substitution that would block this interaction (a charge swap at position R91, RsbU<sup>R91E</sup>) and assayed RsbU activation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). RsbU<sup>R91E</sup> abolished σ<sup>B</sup> activity for cells overexpressing <italic>rsbT</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>), and in biochemical assays RsbT stimulation of RsbU<sup>R91E</sup> phosphatase activity was abolished (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>).

<title>The RsbU linker is flexible in the absence of RsbT</title>
<p>We considered two models for why RsbU is inactive in the absence of RsbT. One possibility is that inactive RsbU resembles the dimeric structure predicted by AlphaFold2 and that RsbT induces a subtle conformational change, for example changing the registry or pitch of the crossing linker helices. A second possibility is that the linkers of inactive RsbU are flexible and that the phosphatase domains only interact with each other when RsbT orders the linkers into a crossing conformation. To distinguish between these two models, we performed small angle X-ray scattering coupled to size exclusion chromatography with multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS-SAXS) to assess the shape and flexibility of RsbU dimers in solution (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4A</xref>). RsbU eluted as a single peak from the size exclusion column with an average molecular weight of 77 kDa (calculated dimeric molecular weight 77.3 kDa) determined by multi-angle light scattering (MALS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1A</xref>). However, our sample had a minor contaminant of heterodimeric complexes of RsbU in which one monomer is C-terminally truncated that could influence the SAXS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1B</xref>). We therefore deconvoluted the SAXS profiles using evolving factor analysis (EFA) in RAW to isolate scattering profiles from the individual components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hopkins et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Meisburger et al. 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4A-C</xref>).The EFA deconvolution identified a major component (MW 75.6 kDa calculated from V<sub>c</sub> method), which eluted earlier than a smaller component (MW 48.8 kDa calculated from V<sub>c</sub> method) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> Guinier fits, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4A-C</xref>). We conclude that the larger component is a RsbU dimer, while the smaller fragment is likely a heterodimeric complex of RsbU and the C-terminal truncation product of RsbU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1B</xref>).</p>

<p>We assessed the SAXS data for the RsbU dimer for features that report on flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kikhney &amp; Svergun 2015</xref>). First, we compared the scattering intensity profile (I(q) vs. q) to a profile calculated from the AlphaFold2 model of an RsbU dimer using FoXS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Schneidman-Duhovny et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Schneidman-Duhovny et al. 2013</xref>) The model was a poor fit to the data (χ<sup>2</sup> 12.53), and the data lacked distinct features caused by the multi-domain structure of RsbU from the AlphaFold2 model (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4A</xref>). This can be visualized more readily from a dimensionless Kratky plot, which is bell-shaped and peaks above 1.3, indicating that the RsbU dimer is non-globular (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Additionally, the data do not show the two peaks from the FoXS computed model of the AlphaFold2 dimer that reflect the extended two domain structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kikhney &amp; Svergun 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Receveur-Bréchot &amp; Durand 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4F</xref>).

Prompted by this evidence of flexibility, we performed multi-state modelling using MultiFoXS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Schneidman-Duhovny et al. 2016</xref>), which incorporates flexibility and heterogeneity.

We allowed flexibility for the linker residues 82-96 while keeping the N-terminal domain dimerized because a stable dimer of the N-terminal domain is observed in solution, was present in a previous X-ray crystal structure of C-terminally truncated RsbU (Delumeau 2004), and C-terminally truncated RsbU coelutes as a heterodimer with the full-length protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1B</xref>).</p>

<p>Importantly, the precise region of allowed linker flexibility does not have a substantial impact on the MultiFoXS fit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig. S6A-C</xref>), but constraining the C-terminal phosphatase domain dimer does not yield a good fit to the data (χ<sup>2</sup> of 5.4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig. S6D</xref>). The structural models predicted by MultiFoXS depict a dimerized N-terminal domain with flexible linkers and PPM domains that do not make contact. Notably, this approach also would include models in which both domains remain dimerized, suggesting that such models are not the best fit of the data. The two conformations that were selected as the best fit to the scattering data by MultiFoXS also have very different R<sub>g</sub> values, (34.91 Å (71%) and 45.69 Å (29%)), indicating RsbU samples a range of conformational space that includes a more compact state(s) consistent with the AlphaFold2 model and a significantly extended state(s), emphasizing that the linker is highly flexible.

<title>RsbT rigidifies and compacts the RsbU dimer</title>
<p>To test the hypothesis that RsbT rigidifies the linker to produce an active RsbU dimer, we attempted SEC-MALS-SAXS analysis of the RsbT/U complex. RsbT/U eluted with molecular weight (determined by MALS) of 88 kDa compared to 105 kDa for a 2RsbT/2RsbU heterotetramer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1E</xref>), suggesting that the RsbT/U complex had largely disassembled on the column. We therefore performed SEC-MALS-SAXS on the RsbT/RsbU<sup>Q94L</sup> complex, which has a higher affinity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The RsbT/U<sup>Q94L</sup> complex eluted as a major peak with a higher molecular weight shoulder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1C</xref>) (also visible when we ran RsbU<sup>Q94L</sup> alone. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1F</xref>), with the average molecular weight of the main peak (determined by MALS) of 125 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1C</xref>). This is larger than the predicted molecular weight of a heterotetrameric 2RsbT/2RsbU<sup>Q94L</sup> complex (105 kDa), suggesting that some higher order complexes form. EFA deconvolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Meisburger et al. 2016</xref>) identifies two components. The first deconvolved component had a SAXS determined molecular weight of 164 kDa, while the second had a SAXS molecular weight of 103 kDa, consistent with a 2RsbT/2RsbU complex (105 kDa). Together with the fact that RsbT co-elutes with RsbU<sup>Q94L</sup> throughout the entire peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1D</xref>) and the MALS molecular weight, we assess that this second component is an 2RsbT/2RsbU hetero-tetramer. The identity of the higher molecular weight component of the scattering data is ambiguous, but could represent a larger assembly of RsbT/RsbU<sup>Q94L</sup> or multimers of RsbU<sup>Q94L</sup> that were observed when RsbU<sup>Q94L</sup> was analyzed alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1F</xref>). Several lines of evidence demonstrate that the 2RsbT/2RsbU<sup>Q94L</sup> complex lacks the flexibility of the 2RsbU complex. First, the R<sub>g</sub> from the Guiner fit (35.06 ± 0.43 Å) matches well with the model computed from the AlphaFold2 prediction of the heterotetrameric complex of 2RsbT/2RsbU using FoXS (33.68 Å) and is smaller than the R<sub>g</sub> we observed for the RsbU dimer (39.05 ± 0.16 Å). Second, the features of the scattering data that suggested flexibility for RsbU dimers all suggest that the RsbT/RsbU complex is more rigid (the quality of the FoXS fit, a lower peak of the dimensionless Kratky plot, and a shorter tail of the P(r) plot) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cordeiro et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kikhney &amp; Svergun 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Receveur-Bréchot &amp; Durand 2012</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>,<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4E-4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">S5G</xref>). Third, fitting the scattering profile (I(q) vs. q) to the AlphaFold2 model yielded a χ<sup>2</sup> of 1.83 without requirement for flexibility (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). As expected, based on the lack of evidence of flexibility in the scattering profile and P(r) function, the model is not improved by the use of multi-state modeling by MultiFoXS, which was run as a control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Schneidman-Duhovny et al. 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Fig. S5F</xref>). Together, these data support the validity of the AlphaFold2 model of the heterotetrameric 2RsbT/2RsbU complex, and additionally suggest that RsbT rigidifies the otherwise flexible linker of RsbU to dimerize the phosphatase domains (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). Together with our biochemical data linking RsbU linker conformation to RsbT binding, metal cofactor interaction, and phosphatase activity, this provides a comprehensive model for how RsbU is activated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>).</p>

An AlphaFold2 prediction of the heterotetrameric 2RsbP/2RsbQ complex places the two molecules of RsbQ in a hybrid interface between the PAS domains and linkers, similar to how RsbT contacts RsbU, suggesting that key features of the activation mechanism are conserved (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>).</p>

<p>To further probe the generality of the linker-mediated phosphatase dimer we observe for RsbU, we generated AlphaFold2 predictions for dimers of other documented GSR initiating phosphatases (<italic>C. difficile</italic> RsbZ (N-terminal tandem GAF domains) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>), <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> OsaC (N-terminal GAF and PAS domains), and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> Rv1364c (N-terminal PAS domain, C-terminally fused to an anti-σ factor domain and an anti-anti-σ factor domain)), as well as from examples of common domain architectures of PPM phosphatases selected from InterPro (response receiver (<italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic>, MY40396.1), GAF (<italic>Rhodococcus aetherivorans</italic>, WP_029544106.1), and HAMP (<italic>Synechocystis sp.</italic>, WP_010874143.1) domains) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Fig. S7</xref>). In each case AlphaFold2 produced high-confidence predictions of phosphatase domains dimerized through a shared α0, α1, α2 interface, connected to dimeric N-terminal domains by crossing α-helical linkers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Fig. S7</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">8</xref>). From this analysis, we conclude that linker-mediated phosphatase domain dimerization is likely an evolutionarily conserved, adaptable mechanism to control PPM phosphatase activity.

<title>RsbT activates RsbU through a conserved phosphatase dimer</title>
<p>Using unbiased genetic screens, biochemical reconstitution, biophysical approaches, and structural prediction, we have discovered that RsbT activates RsbU by rigidifying an otherwise flexible linker region to allosterically activate RsbU as a phosphatase. Our structural prediction, supported by our genetic and structural data suggest that RsbU linkers assume a crossed α-helical conformation that dimerizes the phosphatase domains (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). This dimerization activates RsbU through a conserved switch element at the dimer interface, decreasing the K<sub>M</sub> for metal cofactor and increasing the catalytic rate. Our structural predictions suggest that this is a widespread mechanism to regulate the activity of bacterial protein serine/threonine phosphatases.</p>

<title>A general mechanism for general stress response activation</title>
<p><italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> are the most extensively studied models for GSR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Battesti et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hecker et al. 2007</xref>). However, key mechanistic features of the activation mechanisms differ between the two systems. The <italic>E. coli</italic> GSR is initiated by stabilizing the alternative sigma factor σ<sup>S</sup> (RpoS) against degradation by ClpXP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Under non-stressed conditions, degradation of σ<sup>S</sup> is mediated by the adapter protein, RssB, which is inhibited by anti-adaptors (IraD, IraM, and IraP) and stimulated by phosphorylation on its N-terminal response-receiver domain during stress. Historically, the differences between these systems were interpreted to mean that they operate by distinct mechanistic principles. However, RssB contains a C-terminally truncated (and therefore inactive) PPM phosphatase domain, suggesting some aspects of its regulatory mechanism could be shared with RsbU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Battesti et al. 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Our findings reveal that <italic>E. coli</italic> RssB and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> RsbU use three shared regulatory features to control GSR activation through their distinct downstream mechanisms. First, the positioning of analogous flexible linkers controls GSR activation by RssB and RsbU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brugger, Schwartz, et al. 2023</xref>; Brugger, Srirangam, et al. 2023; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dorich et al. 2019</xref>). The C-terminal pseudo-phosphatase domain of RssB is joined to its N-terminal σ<sup>S</sup> binding response-receiver domain by a predominantly α-helical linker (termed the segmented helical linker, or SHL) of similar length to the linker of RsbU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dorich et al. 2019</xref>). The SHL folds to occlude the σ<sup>S</sup> interacting face of the response-receiver domain when bound to anti-adapters, and is remodeled to promote σ<sup>S</sup> interaction when the response-receiver domain is phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brugger, Schwartz, et al. 2023</xref>; Brugger, Srirangam, et al. 2023; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dorich et al. 2019</xref>). Supporting the hypothesis that the SHL is mechanistically related to the RsbU linker, substitution of W143, the homologous residue to Q94 of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> RsbU, blocks regulation by IraD and IraP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Battesti et al. 2013</xref>). Second, the interface between the linker and α1 of the phosphatase domain is critical for regulation of both RssB and RsbU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brugger, Schwartz, et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dorich et al. 2019</xref>). W143 packs in a hydrophobic pocket formed with the α1 helix of the pseudo-phosphatase domain of phosphorylated RssB and IraD bound RssB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brugger, Schwartz, et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dorich et al. 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Substitution of residues in α1, including A216 (corresponding to M166 of RsbU), block regulation of RssB by anti-adapters, underscoring the mechanistic similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Battesti et al. 2013</xref>). Third, conformational change of the switch helices (α1 and α2) of the phosphatase domain is of shared regulatory importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Battesti et al. 2013</xref>). HDX experiments demonstrate that there is decreased exchange of the α1 helix of the pseudo-phosphatase domain of RssB when σ<sup>S</sup> is bound, suggesting that the conformational dynamics of this region are reduced by substrate recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brugger, Schwartz, et al. 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>These striking mechanistic similarities between RssB from <italic>E. coli</italic> and RsbU from <italic>B. subtilis</italic> suggest that key regulatory features were conserved when an ancestral phosphatase lost enzymatic activity and became a dedicated adapter protein in <italic>E. coli</italic> and related γ-proteobacteria. Interestingly, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> has a homologue of RssB/RsbU that functions as an adapter for σ<sup>S</sup> degradation, yet has a catalytically active, full length phosphatase domain and resides in an operon with an <italic>rsbV</italic> homologue (<italic>rssC)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rodríguez-Martínez et al. 2023</xref>). Crystal structures of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> RssB revealed that it forms a dimer with crossing linkers and dimerized phosphatase domains with striking similarity to the dimer predicted for RsbU (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>, S2C). Intriguingly, adapter protein function of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> RssB requires RssC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rodríguez-Martínez et al. 2023</xref>), and <italic>E. coli</italic> RssB has been observed to weakly dimerize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dorich et al. 2019</xref>), further supporting a direct mechanistic link between phosphatase regulation and adapter protein function. While not all GSR regulatory mechanisms involve a phosphatase or adapter protein related to RsbU/RssB, these findings suggest that linker-mediated control of a PPM phosphatase is a broadly conserved mechanism for GSR initiation across bacterial phyla.</p>

<title>An exchangeable toolkit for signal transduction</title>
<p>Histidine kinases and GGDEF diguanylate cyclases are the two most prevalent families of bacterial signal transduction proteins. A striking feature of their regulatory mechanisms is that they are often active in dimeric complexes that are allosterically controlled by N-terminal regulatory domains that propagate signals through crossing α-helical linkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Zschiedrich et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Randall et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gourinchas et al. 2017</xref>). Our findings that the crossing α-helical linkers are structurally similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2C</xref>), and that shared regulatory domains (response receiver, HAMP, and PAS domains) connect phosphatase dimers by a coiled-coil linker (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A-C</xref>, S7) suggests that this shared allosteric regulatory architecture allows modular exchange of N-terminal domains between PPM phosphatases, histidine kinases, and GGDEF diguanylate cyclases (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). In support of this, the RsbU N-terminal domain and RsbT were previously shown to control GGDEF diguanylate cyclase activity in <italic>Moorella thermoacetica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Quin et al. 2012</xref>), histidine kinases with RsbU N-terminal domains are found in operons with <italic>rsbT</italic> and stressosome genes in some <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Heinz et al. 2022</xref>), and AlphaFold2 prediction of these dimeric complexes reveals coiled-coil linkers to the effector domains (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E-F</xref>). Similarly, the PAS/α/β hydrolase module that controls RsbP phosphatase activity in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> is found coupled to histidine kinases and GGDEF diguanylate cyclases across bacterial phyla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Nadezhdin et al. 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>While the specific mechanism discovered here for linker control of RsbU activity (flexibility controlled by a binding partner) is distinct from the models for linker control of histidine kinases and GGDEF diguanylate cyclases (piston shift, scissoring, and helical rotation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Zschiedrich et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Randall et al. 2022</xref>), the shared dimeric architecture suggests that N-terminal regulatory domains could be modularly exchanged across effector domain families (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>). Allosteric control of PPM switch element conformation could theoretically be achieved by piston shift, scissoring, or helical rotation. Future characterization of PPM phosphatases will be required to determine how widespread linker flexibility is as a regulatory mechanism and how modularly sensory domains can be exchanged across signaling effector families.</p>

<p>Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) was performed at BioCAT (beamline 18ID at the Advanced Photon Source, Chicago) with in-line size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to separate sample from aggregates and other contaminants and ensure optimal sample quality. In-line multiangle light scattering (MALS), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and differential refractive index (dRI) measurements were recorded for additional biophysical characterization (SEC-MALS-SAXS). The samples were loaded on a Superdex 200 10/300 Increase GL Column (Cytiva) run by a 1260 Infinity II HPLC (Agilent Technologies) at 0.6 ml/min. The flow passed in order through an Agilent UV detector, a MALS detector and a DLS detector (DAWN Helios II, Wyatt Technologies), and an RI detector (Optilab T-rEX, Wyatt) before the SAXS flow cell. The flow cell consists of a 1.0 mm ID quartz capillary with ∼20 µm walls. A coflowing buffer sheath is used to separate sample from the capillary walls, helping prevent radiation damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kirby et al. 2016</xref>). Scattering intensity was recorded using a Pilatus3 X 1M (Dectris) detector that was placed 3.682 m from the sample giving us access to a q-range of 0.0027 Å<sup>-1</sup> to 0.33 Å<sup>-1</sup>. 0.5s exposures were acquired every 1 s during elution and data was reduced using BioXTAS RAW 2.1.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hopkins et al. 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hopkins 2024</xref>).

We added increasing concentrations of RsbU and RsbU<sup>Q94L</sup> to 200nM RsbT<sup>TMR</sup> and measured the change in anisotropy (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). All measurements were done at 25°C in 50 mM K•HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, and 10% glycerol. All measurements of spectra were conducted with a slit width of # nm, and anisotropy measurements were conducted with a slit width of # nm. The excitation wavelength was 551 nm and the emission wavelength was 577 nm. Anisotropy measurements were taken 30 seconds apart for 6 measurements, and then were averaged and plot against its corresponding concentration of RsbU. Anisotropy data was then fit to a quadratic binding curve using KaleidaGraph, reported errors are the error of the fit.</p>

<title>Phosphatase assays</title>
<p>Phosphatase assays were performed with RsbV-P that was labeled with <sup>32</sup>P by incubating RsbV (40 µM), 6His-RsbW (45 µM), and 100 µCi of γ-<sup>32</sup>P ATP overnight at room temperature in 50 mM K•HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 2 mM DTT. Unincorporated nucleotide was removed by buffer exchange using a Zeba spin column equilibrated in 50 mM K•HEPES pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl. 6H-RsbW was then removed by Ni-NTA resin equilibrated in 50 mM K•HEPES pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole. The flow-through fraction from the Ni-NTA resin containing RsbV-<sup>32</sup>P was then exchanged into 50 mM K•HEPES pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl buffer using 3 subsequent Zeba spin columns to remove all unincorporated nucleotide and free phosphate. Labeled RsbV-<sup>32</sup>P was aliquoted and frozen at −80°C for future use.</p>
<p>All phosphatase assays were performed at room temperature in 50 mM K•HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl. The concentrations of enzyme, substrate, MnCl<sub>2</sub>, and MgCl<sub>2</sub> were varied as indicated. 10 µM RsbT was additionally added to reactions as indicated. Reactions were stopped with 0.5 M EDTA, pH 8.0 and run on PEI-Cellulose TLC plates developed in 1 M LiCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.8 M acetic acid and imaged on a Typhoon scanner. Phosphatase assays were performed more than three independent times as separate experiments. Data shown in figures is from a single representative experiment, and reported errors are the error from the fit.</p>

<title><italic>B. subtilis</italic> strain construction</title>
<p><italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells were grown in Lennox lysogeny broth (LB, Sigma Aldrich) as liquid medium or as plates supplemented with 15% Bacto Agar (Difco). Antibiotics were used as appropriate for maintenance of plasmids or for selection of transformants: MLS (50 µg/ml erythromycin, 250 µg/ml lincomycin), kanamycin (10 µg/ml). For plates used to visualize σ<sup>B</sup> reporter activity, 80 µg/ml of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal) and 1 mM IPTG were added. All <italic>B. subtilis</italic> strains were derived from the PY79 strain background and are listed in the table of strains. Plasmids based on pHB201(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bron et al. 1998</xref>) were introduced to <italic>B. subtilis</italic> strains using natural competence(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Harwood &amp; Cutting 1990</xref>).</p>

<title>Genetic screens</title>
<p>Genetic screens were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ho &amp; Bradshaw 2021</xref>). Plasmids containing <italic>rsbU</italic> or <italic>rsbT/rsbU<sup>Y28I</sup></italic> were subjected to PCR mutagenesis using GoTaq DNA polymerase mix (Promega) supplemented with 2mM additional MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Pools of mutagenized inserts were assembled into digested plasmid using isothermal (Gibson) assembly and transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5α cells. Mutation rate of approximately one single-nucleotide polymorphism per kilobase of DNA was confirmed by sequencing individual clones. Plasmids were then introduced to <italic>B. subtilis</italic> using natural competence and cells were plated on selective medium containing IPTG and X-gal for two days at 37°C. Blue colonies were selected, restruck on plates with and without IPTG, and plasmids recovered from single colonies that retested as σ<sup>B</sup> positive were sequenced using Sanger sequencing. For the RsbU<sup>Y28I</sup> suppressor screen, two independent pools of PCR mutagenized plasmid were screened. In addition to the reported variants that were selected, we identified simple revertants that restored Y28 in both pools, and mutations in the promoter and RBS that we predict enhanced protein production. These variants were not studied further. Individual amino acid changing mutations were rebuilt in the parental plasmid using PCR (QuickChange) mutagenesis and the phenotypes were validated by replating on indicator plates. All strains shown in the figures are from these rebuilt plasmids.</p>

<title>AlphaFold2 structure predictions</title>
<p>AlphaFold2 predictions were performed using ColabFold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Mirdita et al. 2022</xref>). Alphafold2_multimer_v2 was used in unpaired_paired mode with no templates with 3 recycles, 200 iterations, and greedy pairing strategy. The predicted aligned error plots for all AlphaFold2 structures are shown in Figure S8.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study combines genetic analysis, biochemistry, and structural modeling to reveal new insights into how changes in protein-protein structure activate signal transduction as part of the bacterial general stress response. The data, collected using validated and standard methods, and the interpretations are <bold>solid</bold>, although additional experimental structural evidence would strengthen the proposed model and its potential application to other systems. This manuscript, which provides multiple avenues for follow-up studies, will be of broad interest to microbiologists, structural biologists, and cell biologists.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This very interesting manuscript proposes a general mechanism for how activating signaling proteins respond to species-specific signals arising from a variety of stresses. In brief, the authors propose that the activating signal alters the structure by a universal allosteric mechanism.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The unitary mechanism proposed is appealing and testable. They propose that the allosteric module consists of crossed alpha-helical linkers with similar architecture and that their attached regulatory domains connect to phosphatases or other molecules through coiled-coli domains, such that the signal is transduced via rigidifying the alpha helices, permitting downstream enzymatic activity. The authors present genetic and structural prediction data in favor of the model for the system they are studying, and stronger structural data in other systems.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The evidence is indirect - targeted mutations, structural predictions, and biochemical data. Therefore, these important generalizable conclusions are not buttressed by impeccable data, which would require doing actual structures in B. subtilis, confirming experiments in other organisms, and possibly co-evolutionary coupling. In the absence of such data, it is not possible to rule out variant models.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>While bacteria have the ability to induce genes in response to specific stresses, they also use the General Stress Response (GSR) to deal with growth conditions that presumably include a larger range of stresses (for instance, stationary phase growth). The activation of GSR-specific sigma factors is frequently at the heart of the induction of a GSR. Given the range of stresses that can lead to GSR induction, the regulatory inputs are frequently complex. In B. subtilis, the stressosome, a multi-protein complex, contains a set of proteins that, upon appropriate stresses, initiate partner switching cascades that free the sigma B sigma factor from an anti-sigma. The focus here is on the mode of activation of RsbU, a serine/threonine phosphatase of the PPM family, leading to sigB activation. RbsT, a component of the degradosome interacts with RsbU upon stress, activating the phosphatase activity. Once active, RsbU dephosphorylates its target (RsbV, an anti-antisigma), which in turn binds the anti-sigma. The conclusion is that flexible linker domains upstream of the phosphatase domain are the target for activation, via binding of proteins to the N-terminal domain, resulting in a crossed-linker dimeric structure. The authors then use the information on RsbU to suggest that parallel approaches are used to activate PPM phosphatases for the GSR response in other bacteria. (Biology vs. Mechanism, evolution?)</p>
<p>Strengths and Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Many of these have to do with clarifying what was done and why. This includes the presentation and content of the figures.</p>
<p>One issue relates to the background and context. A bit more information on the stresses that release RsbT would be useful here. The authors might also consider a figure showing the major conclusions and parallels for SpoIIE activation and possibly other partner switches that are discussed, introducing the switch change more clearly to set the stage for the work here (and the generalization). There are a lot of players to keep track of.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors present a study building on their previous work on activation of the general stress response phosphatase, RsbU, from Bacillus subtilis. Using computed structural models of the RsbU dimer the authors map previously identified activating mutations onto the structure and suggest further protein variants to test the role of the predicted linker helix and the interaction with RsbT on the activation of the phosphatase activity.</p>
<p>Using in vivo and in vitro activity assays, the authors demonstrate that linker variants can constitutively activate RsbU and increase the affinity of the protein for RsbT, thus showing a link between the structure of the linker region and RsbT binding.</p>
<p>Small angle X-ray scattering experiments on RsbU variants alone, and in complex with RsbT show structural changes consistent with a decreased flexibility of the RsbU protein, which is hypothesised to indicate a disorder-order transition in the linker when RsbT binds. This interpretation of the data is consistent with the biochemical data presented by the authors.</p>
<p>Further computed structure models are presented for other protein phosphates from different bacterial species and the authors propose a model for phosphatase activation by partner binding. They compare this to the activation mechanisms proposed for histidine kinase two-component systems and GGDEF proteins and suggest the individual domains could be swapped to give a toolkit of modular parts for bacterial signalling.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The key mutagenesis data is presented with two lines of evidence to demonstrate RsbU activation - in vivo sigma-b activation assays utilising a beta-galactosidase reporter and in vitro activity assays against the RsbV protein, which is the downstream target of RsbU. These data support the hypothesis for RsbT binding to the RsbU linker region as well as the dimerisation domain to activate the RsbU activity.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Small angle scattering curves are difficult to unambiguously interpret, but the authors present reasonable interpretations that fit with the biochemical data presented. These interpretations should be considered as good models for future testing with other methods - hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, would be a good additional method to use, as exchange rates in the linker region would be affected significantly by the disorder/order transition on RsbT binding.</p>
<p>The interpretation of the computed structure models should be toned down with the addition of a few caveats related to the bias in the models returned by AlphaFold2. For the full-length models of RsbU and other phosphatase proteins, the relationship of the domains to each other is likely to be the least reliable part of the models - this is apparent from the PAE plots shown in Supplementary Figure 8. Furthermore, the authors should show models coloured by pLDDT scores in an additional supplementary figure to help the reader interpret the confidence level of the predicted structures.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for their feedback. A challenge of studying flexible proteins is that it is often not possible to directly obtain high resolution structural data. For the case of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> RsbU, the independent experimental approaches we applied (including two unbiased genetic screens, targeted mutagenesis, SAXS, enzymology, and structure prediction, which includes evolutionary coupling) converged upon a model for activation, which we feel is well supported. Frustratingly, our attempts at determining high resolution experimental structures have been unsuccessful, which we think is due to the flexibility of the proteins revealed by our SAXS experiments. For example, we collected X-ray diffraction data from crystals of a fragment of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> RsbU containing the N-terminal domain and linker in which the linker was almost entirely disordered in the maps. We agree that doing experiments in other organisms would be valuable next steps to test the hypothesis that this coiled-coil based transduction mechanism is conserved across species, and will modify the text to differentiate this more speculative section of the manuscript. Based on this critique (and the critiques of the other reviewers), we plan to do energetic analysis of the predicted coiled coils from the enzymes we analyzed from other species and to incorporate this into the manuscript. Finally, in the manuscript, we have highlighted that this mechanism is not the only mechanism for activation of other proteins with effector domains connected to linkers, but rather one of many mechanisms (Fig 5G). The reviewer additionally made helpful suggestions about the text in detailed comments that we will incorporate as appropriate.</p>

<p>We plan to carefully review the manuscript to improve the clarity of presentation and background. In particular, we thank the reviewer for pointing out the missing information about the release of RsbT from the stressosome. We will incorporate this information into the introduction and provide an additional figure.

<p>We agree with the reviewer that the SAXS data has inherent ambiguity due to the nature of the measurement. However, SAXS is one of the best techniques to directly assess conformational flexibility. Our scattering data for RsbU have multiple signatures of flexibility supporting a high confidence conclusion. While the scattering data support a reduction in flexibility for the RsbT/RsbU complex, we agree that a high resolution structure would be valuable. However the combination of the scattering data with our biochemical and genetic data supports the validity of the AlphaFold predicted model. We thank the reviewer for the suggestion of future hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments that would be complementary, but which we feel are beyond the scope of this work.</p>
