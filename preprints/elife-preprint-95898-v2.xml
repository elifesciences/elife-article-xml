<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>ASARs are a family of very-long noncoding RNAs that control replication timing on individual human autosomes, and are essential for chromosome stability. The eight known ASAR lncRNAs remain closely associated with their parent chromosomes. Analysis of RNA-protein interaction data (from ENCODE) revealed numerous RBPs with significant interactions with multiple ASAR lncRNAs, with several hnRNPs as abundant interactors. An ∼7kb domain within the ASAR6-141 lncRNA shows a striking density of RBP interaction sites. Genetic deletion and ectopic integration assays indicate that this ∼7kb RNA binding protein domain contains functional sequences for controlling replication timing of entire chromosomes in <italic>cis</italic>. shRNA-mediated depletion of 10 different RNA binding proteins, including HNRNPA1, HNRNPC, HNRNPL, HNRNPM, HNRNPU, or HNRNPUL1, results in dissociation of ASAR lncRNAs from their chromosome territories, and disrupts the synchronous replication that occurs on all autosome pairs, recapitulating the effect of individual ASAR knockouts on a genome-wide scale. Our results further demonstrate the role that ASARs play during the temporal order of genome-wide replication, and we propose that ASARs function as essential RNA scaffolds for the assembly of hnRNP complexes that help maintain the structural integrity of each mammalian chromosome.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The vast majority of mammalian DNA replicates in homologous regions of chromosome pairs in a highly synchronous manner <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. However, genetic disruption of non-protein coding ASAR (“<underline>AS</underline>ynchronous replication and <underline>A</underline>utosomal <underline>R</underline>NA”) loci causes a delay in replication timing on individual human chromosomes in <italic>cis</italic>, resulting in highly asynchronous replication between pairs of autosomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. There are eight genetically validated ASARs that are located on human chromosomes 1, 6, 8, 9 and 15 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. All of the known ASAR lncRNAs share several distinctive characteristics, including: 1) contiguously transcribed regions of &gt;180 kb, 2) epigenetically regulated <underline>A</underline>llelic <underline>E</underline>xpression Imbalance (AEI; including mono-allelic expression); 3) <underline>V</underline>ariable <underline>E</underline>pigenetic <underline>R</underline>eplication <underline>T</underline>iming (VERT; including asynchronous replication timing); 4) high density of LINE1 (L1) sequences (&gt;30%); and 5) retention of the RNA within their parent chromosome territory. Recently, we used these notable characteristics to identify 68 ASAR candidates on every human autosome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In addition to genetic disruption assays, ectopic integration of ASAR transgenes into mouse chromosomes has been used as a second functional assay to help define the critical sequences within ASAR lncRNAs that control chromosome-wide replication timing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. For example, ASAR6 lncRNA expressed from transgenes, ranging in size from an ∼180 kb BAC transgene to PCR products (as small as ∼3 kb) containing the critical sequences, remain associated with the chromosome territories where they are transcribed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. These same transgenes cause <underline>d</underline>elayed replication timing (DRT) and <underline>d</underline>elayed <underline>m</underline>itotic <underline>c</underline>ondensation (DMC) of entire chromosomes in <italic>cis</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Furthermore, ASAR6 lncRNA was found to control chromosome-wide replication timing using oligonucleotide mediated RNA degradation of ASAR6 lncRNA that was expressed from a BAC transgene integrated into mouse chromosome 3 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. These findings suggest that ASARs represent ubiquitous, essential, <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements that control mammalian chromosome replication timing via expression of chromosome associated RNAs. In this report, we identify <underline>R</underline>NA <underline>b</underline>inding <underline>p</underline>roteins (RBPs) that are critical for ASAR lncRNA localization and function.</p>
<p>Chromosome-associated long non-coding RNAs are known to be important for numerous aspects of chromosome dynamics in diverse eukaryotes from yeast to mammals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. The mammalian nucleus is rich in heterogenous nuclear RNA (hnRNA), which represents &gt;95% of the total RNA Polymerase II output <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. The vast majority of hnRNA is poorly defined, has been referred to as the “Dark Matter” of the genome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, and includes spliced and unspliced intronic sequences, circular RNAs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, <underline>v</underline>ery long intergenic <underline>n</underline>on-<underline>c</underline>oding RNAs (vlincRNAs; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>), as well as poorly defined RNAs that include <underline>c</underline>hromatin <underline>a</underline>ssociated RNAs (caRNAs; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>) and <underline>rep</underline>eat rich RNAs (repRNAs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>) that can be detected by C0T-1 DNA (which is comprised primarily of LINE and SINE repetitive sequences; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>). Some of these nuclear RNAs comprise abundant species, yet lack clearly defined functions, while others are thought to be the by-products of other nuclear processes and have been collectively called “RNA debris” <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. The relationship between ASAR lncRNAs and these other chromosome-associated RNAs remains poorly defined.</p>
<p>Previous studies have suggested that long nascent transcripts that are detected by C0T-1 DNA play a dynamic structural role that promotes the open architecture of active chromosome territories <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. The RNA species detected by C0T-1 DNA are predominantly L1 sequences, and these L1 RNAs remain associated with the chromosome territories where they are transcribed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. A link between C0T-1 RNA and ASAR lncRNAs is suggested by the observation that ASAR lncRNAs contain a high L1 content and remain associated with their parent chromosome territories <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. In addition, deletion and ectopic integration assays demonstrated that the critical sequences for controlling chromosome-wide replication timing within ASAR6 and ASAR15 map to the antisense strand of L1 sequences located within the ASAR6 and ASAR15 lncRNAs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. In this report we found that human C0T-1 DNA can detect the chromosome territory localization of ASAR6 lncRNA that is expressed from a BAC transgene integrated into a mouse chromosome, indicating that at least some of the RNA species detected by C0T-1 DNA represents ASAR lncRNA.</p>
<p>Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) represent a large family of abundant RBPs that contribute to multiple aspects of nucleic acid metabolism. Many of the proteins that are in hnRNP complexes share general features, but differ in domain composition and functional properties (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>). The functions of hnRNPs vary according to their subcellular localization. Most of the hnRNPs possess conventional nuclear localization signals and are predominantly present in the nucleus during steady state, where they function in various RNA metabolic processes including transcription, splicing, nuclear export, and 3’ end processing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, and more recently have been implicated in DNA replication <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. A direct connection between chromosome territory associated C0T-1 RNA and hnRNPs was established by the observation that siRNA mediated depletion, or forced expression of dominant interfering mutants, of HNRNPU results in dissociation of C0T-1 RNA from chromosome territories <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. In addition, recent studies have proposed that abundant nuclear proteins such as HNRNPU nonspecifically interact with “RNA debris” that creates a dynamic nuclear mesh that regulates interphase chromatin structure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Here, we used publicly available <underline>e</underline>nhanced <underline>C</underline>ross <underline>L</underline>ink Immuno-<underline>P</underline>recipitation (eCLIP) data from ENCODE <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> to identify RBPs, including HNRNPA1, HNRNPC, HNRNPL, HNRNPM, HNRNPU, and HNRNPUL1, that interact with the known ASAR lncRNAs. We also found that an ∼7 kb region within the ∼185 kb ASAR6-141 lncRNA has a surprisingly high density of interacting RBPs, and that genetic deletion of this ∼7kb “RBP domain” from the endogenous ASAR6-141 locus results in a delayed replication timing phenotype that is comparable to deletion of the entire ∼185 kb ASAR6-141 transcribed region located on human chromosome 6. In addition, ectopic integration of transgenes, expressing the ∼7 kb RBP domain, into autosomes or into the inactive X chromosome results in retention of the RNA within the chromosome territory of the integrated chromosomes, and results in DRT/DMC, and chromosome structure instability in <italic>cis</italic>. Taken together, these results indicate that the ∼7 kb RBP domain represents a critical region within ASAR6-141 that controls replication timing of human chromosome 6.</p>
<p>Because ASARs were identified as <italic>cis-</italic>acting elements that control chromosome-wide replication timing, we tested if ASAR associated RBPs also control replication timing. We found that shRNA mediated depletion of 9 different ASAR-associated RBPs (HNRNPA1, HNRNPC, HNRNPL, HNRNPM, HNRNPU, HNRNPUL1, HLTF, KHSRP or UCHL5) dramatically altered the normally synchronous replication timing program of all autosome pairs, recapitulating the effect of individual ASAR knockouts on a genome-wide scale. These results demonstrate the role that ASARs play during the temporal order of genome-wide replication, and suggests that ASAR lncRNAs serve as essential RNA scaffolds for the assembly of multiple hnRNP/RBP complexes that function to maintain the structural integrity of each mammalian chromosome.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>All of the eight genetically validated ASARs are subject to AEI and express lncRNAs that remain associated with the chromosome territories where they are transcribed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Examples of mono-allelic expression and chromosome territory localization of ASAR6-141 lncRNA are shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>, where ASAR6-141 lncRNA is localized within one of the chromosome 6 territories in two different cell types, male HTD114 cells and female GM12878 cells, respectively. We note that the size of the RNA hybridization signals detected by all ASAR probes are variable, ranging in size from large clouds that occupy entire chromosome territories, with similarity in appearance to XIST RNA “clouds” (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), to relatively small sites of hybridization that remain tightly associated with the expressed alleles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>We first sought to identify RBPs that interact with the known ASAR lncRNAs. Using publicly available eCLIP data for 150 RBPs in K562 and HepG2 cells (ENCODE; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>), we identified RBP interactions within 4 ASARs (ASAR1-187, ASAR6-141, ASAR8-2.7, and ASAR9-23). Utilizing the eCLIP peaks previously identified by ENCODE <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> we found significant RBP binding peaks for 99 different RBPs that map within the four ASAR lncRNAs (Figure 1-source data 1). We also utilized a “region-based” method <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> to identify significant enrichments of eCLiP reads against matched controls in 10 kb windows across the four ASAR loci (Figure 1-source data 2). An example of this analysis is shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, where ASAR6-141 displays significant RBP interactions for 35 different RBPs across the transcribed region. Given the contiguous expression (RNAseq from total RNA) across the ∼185 kb ASAR6-141 locus in both K562 and HepG2 cell lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>) and the abundant eCLIP reads from 35 different RBPs in 10 kb windows across the ASAR6-141 lncRNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>; see Figure 1-source data 2), we were surprised to detect an ∼7 kb region that contained virtually all of the significant eCLIP peaks in both cell lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1G</xref>; and Figure 1-source data 1). The zoomed in view in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref> shows alignment of 58 independent eCLIP peaks of RBP interactions within the ∼7kb <underline>R</underline>NA <underline>B</underline>inding <underline>P</underline>rotein <underline>D</underline>omain (RBPD). <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> shows the 23 RBPs with the most abundant peaks of eCLIP reads within the ∼7kb RBPD. The eCLIP peaks associated with the RBPs chosen for shRNA knockdown experiments (see below) are highlighted in the zoomed in view in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>.</p>

<title>Disruption of the ∼7kb RBPD within ASAR6-141 results in delayed replication</title>
<p>To determine if the ∼7kb RBPD within the ASAR6-141 lncRNA contains replication timing activity, we used CRISPR/Cas9 mediated engineering to delete the ∼7 kb sequence from the endogenous locus on human chromosome 6. For this analysis we designed single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to unique sequences on either side of the ∼7kb RBPD (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>; and Figure 1-figure supplement 1). We expressed these sgRNAs in combination with Cas9 in human HTD114 cells and screened clones for deletion of the ∼7kb RBPD (see Figure 1-figure supplement 1). We chose HTD114 cells for this analysis because they maintain mono-allelic expression and asynchronous replication of both imprinted and random monoallelic genes, they have a stable karyotype that does not change significantly following transfection, drug selection and sub-cloning, and knockouts of the eight known ASARs, including ASAR6-141, result in DRT/DMC and chromosome structure instability in <italic>cis</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>.

<p>To assay replication timing of homologous chromosome pairs we quantified DNA synthesis in mitotic cells using a BrdU terminal label assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>; and <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>). In addition, the HTD114 cells contain a centromeric polymorphism on chromosome 6, which allows for an unambiguous distinction between the two chromosome 6 homologs (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>; also see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). For simplicity, we refer to the chromosome 6 with the larger centromere as CHR6A and to the chromosome 6 with the smaller centromere as CHR6B. From our previous studies we knew that the chromosome 6 with the smaller centromere is linked to the expressed allele of ASAR6-141 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref> shows the replication timing analysis on a mitotic cell where the ∼7kb RBPD was deleted from the expressed allele (CHR6B). Note that CHR6B contains more BrdU incorporation than CHR6A, indicating later replication of CHR6B (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Quantification of the BrdU incorporation in CHR6B and CHR6A in multiple cells indicated that deletion of the ∼7kb RBPD from the expressed allele resulted in a significant delay in replication timing (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). This is in contrast to cells prior to deletion, or in cells containing a deletion of the ∼7kb RBPD from the silent allele (CHR6A), where the BrdU incorporation is comparable between CHR6A and CHR6B (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). In addition, an asynchronous replication pattern was also present in cells with homozygous deletions of the 7kb RBPD, with CHR6B representing the later replicating allele (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Furthermore, we found that the delayed replication associated with deletion of the ∼7kb RBPD on CHR6B is comparable to the delayed replication associated with deletion of the entire ASAR6-141 locus from the same chromosome (i.e. CHR6B; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>; also see <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>). These results indicate that the ∼7kb RBPD contains functional sequences for controlling replication timing, and further supports the conclusion that the expressed allele but not the silent allele controls replication timing of human chromosome 6 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Ectopic integration of transgenes expressing the ∼7kb RBPD into autosomes</title>
<p>To determine if the ∼7 kb RBPD is sufficient to induce delayed replication in an ectopic integration assay, we generated two transgenes containing the ∼7kb RBPD, one in the sense orientation and one in the antisense orientation with respect to the promoter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). These transgenes were introduced into mouse cells and individual clones isolated. We initially screened individual clones for expression of the transgenes using RNA FISH with the ∼7kb RBPD as probe. Because the mouse cells that we used are female, we included an RNA FISH probe for Xist to serve as positive control for the RNA FISH assays. This two-color RNA FISH assay allowed us to identify clones with single sites of transgene expression, and allowed us to directly compare the RNA FISH signals from the transgenes to that of the endogenous Xist RNA expressed from the inactive X chromosome. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> shows examples of the RNA FISH signals in cells expressing either the sense (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>) or antisense (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>) transgenes. Large clouds of RNA FISH hybridization signals that are comparable to Xist RNA hybridization signals were detected in 4 out of 12 clones expressing the sense transgene (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). In contrast, 0 out of 12 clones containing the antisense transgene expressed RNA FISH hybridization signals comparable to Xist RNA signals, but instead only small pinpoint sites of RNA FISH hybridization were detected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>). Quantitation of the nuclear area occupied by the sense and antisense ∼7 kb RNAs is shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>. Note that the mouse cells are tetraploid for the X chromosome and contain two Xist RNA hybridization signals, representing two inactive X chromosomes.</p>
<p>To identify the mouse chromosomes that contain the transgenes, we used DNA FISH using the ∼7kb RBPD DNA as probe in combination with the inverted DAPI banding pattern to identify the mouse chromosomes in metaphase spreads. We then confirmed the identity of the mouse chromosomes using DNA FISH on metaphase spreads using the ∼7kb RBPD in combination with BAC probes from the chromosomes of interest. For example, clone ∼7kb(+)A5, which contains the sense-strand transgene integrated in mouse chromosome 5 is shown in Figure 2-figure supplement 1A. Next, to determine if the RNA expressed from the ∼7kb RBPD sense strand transgene is retained within the chromosome territory that expresses the transgene, we used RNA-DNA FISH with the ∼7kb RBPD as RNA probe plus a chromosome paint to detect mouse chromosome 5 DNA in clone ∼7kb(+)A5. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref> shows that the ∼7kb RBPD RNA is localized within one of the chromosome 5 DNA hybridization signals, indicating that the ∼7kb RBPD RNA is retained within the chromosome 5 territory.</p>
<p>Next to determine if the ∼7kb RBPD transgene alters replication timing of mouse chromosome 5, we visualized DNA synthesis in mitotic cells using the BrdU terminal label assay (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>; and <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>).

Note that the chromosome containing the ∼7kb RBPD transgene is delayed in mitotic condensation and contains more BrdU incorporation than any other chromosome within the same cell.

<p>Next, to determine if the nuclear localization of ASAR6-141 lncRNA was affected by RBP depletions we used RNA FISH assays in K562 cells expressing shRNAs against the 14 RBPs. For this analysis we used RNA FISH to detected ASAR6-141 lncRNA, and because K562 cells are female we also included a probe for XIST RNA as positive control for the RNA FISH. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3L</xref> shows the expected RNA FISH patterns for both ASAR6-141 and XIST lncRNAs in cells expressing empty vector. In contrast, cells expressing shRNAs directed at HNRNPU, HNRNPUL1, HNRNPC, HNRNPM, HLTF, HNRNPA1, HNRNPL, KHSRP, or UCHL5 showed a nearly complete absence of the highly localized nuclear RNA hybridization signals for ASAR6-141 lncRNA, and the appearance of large punctate cytoplasmic hybridization signals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3M-U</xref>). We also noticed an overall increase in a diffuse ASAR6-141 lncRNA nuclear and cytoplasmic hybridization signals.

<title>Ectopic integration of the ∼7kb RBPD transgene into the inactive X chromosome</title>
<p>The results described above indicate that shRNA depletion of 9 different RBPs resulted in dissociation of ASAR6-141 lncRNA from its parent chromosome, and resulted in a decreased nuclear XIST RNA hybridization signal with concomitant colocalization of both RNAs in cytoplasmic foci (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), suggesting that ASAR6-141 and XIST lncRNAs are retained on their respective chromosome territories via similar mechanisms, which is supported by the large overlap in RBPs associated with both RNAs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>; and Figure 1-source data 1).

The ectopic integration assays described above involved random integration of transgenes followed by an RNA FISH screen for clones expressing the ∼7kb RBPD, which included an RNA FISH probe for Xist RNA as positive control. Therefore, to identify transgene integrations into the inactive X chromosome, we simply screened an additional 50 clones for colocalization of RNA FISH hybridization signals for both Xist and the ∼7kb RBPD transgene. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> shows this RNA FISH assay on cells where the Xist and ∼7kb RBPD hybridization signals are colocalized. We note that the intensity of the Xist RNA FISH signal was enhanced in the region where the ∼7kb RBPD hybridization signal was detected (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>), suggesting that the presence of the ∼7kb RBPD RNA promoted preferential localization of Xist RNA in the same region of the X chromosome territory that contains the ∼7kb RBPD RNA.</p>

An example of this analysis is shown in Figure 2-figure supplement 1B-C, and indicates that the ∼7kb RBPD transgene is integrated into an X chromosome.

<title>Depletion of RBPs causes asynchronous replication on all autosome pairs</title>

Using the BrdU terminal label assay <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> in cells expressing the empty vector, we found that each autosome pair displays a stereotypical and synchronous BrdU incorporation pattern (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>).

Quantification of the BrdU incorporation in chromosomes 1 and 6 (see Figure 6-figure supplement 1) in multiple cells depleted for HNRNPU, HNRNPUL1, HLTF, KHSRP, UCHL5, or HNRNPA1 indicated that both pairs of chromosomes display significant asynchrony (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We recently identified 68 ASAR candidates, and genetically validated five out of five as controlling replication timing of individual human autosomes, bringing the total of genetically validated ASARs to eight <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. These eight ASARs (ASAR1-187, ASAR6, ASAR6-141, ASAR8-2.7, ASAR9-23, ASAR9-24, ASAR9-30 and ASAR15) display striking epigenetically controlled differential allelic expression and replication timing, and their RNAs remain localized to their parent chromosome territories <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. In this report, we used publicly available RNA-protein interaction data from ENCODE to identify RBPs that interact with multiple ASAR lncRNAs. One unanticipated observation that came from this analysis was that an ∼7 kb domain within the ∼185 kb ASAR6-141 lncRNA contained virtually all of the significant peaks of RBP interactions in two different cell lines. Using genetic deletion and ectopic integration assays we found that this ∼7kb RBPD contains functional sequences for controlling replication timing of entire chromosomes in <italic>cis</italic>. We also found that shRNA-mediated depletion of 9 different ASAR-associated RBPs results in loss of the chromosome territory association of multiple ASAR RNAs. In addition, we found that depletion of HNRNPA1, HNRNPC, HNRNPL, HNRNPM, HNRNPU, HNRNPUL1, HLTF, KHSRP, or UCHL5 alters the normally synchronous replication timing that occurs between pairs of homologous chromosomes resulting in the DRT/DMC phenotype, recapitulating the effect of individual ASAR knockouts on a genome-wide scale.</p>
<p>Previous studies have suggested that C0T-1 RNA plays a dynamic structural role that promotes the open architecture of active chromosome territories <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. C0T-1 RNA is predominantly L1 sequences, and these L1 RNAs remain associated with the chromosome territories where they are transcribed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Additional studies have proposed that repRNA is an important regulator of the dynamic organization of genomic loci into membrane-less subcompartments with distinct nuclear functions (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>). Other studies have proposed that HNRNPU nonspecifically interacts with “RNA debris” to create a dynamic nuclear mesh that regulates interphase chromatin structure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. One important distinction that can be made between ASAR RNAs and these other hnRNAs (i.e. C0T-1 RNA, repRNA, caRNA, and “RNA debris” <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>) is that ASARs have been defined genetically, and these other RNAs have not. Thus, we have used both loss of function and gain of function assays to define the roles that ASARs play in chromosome dynamics, which includes control of chromosome-wide replication timing and mitotic chromosome condensation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. We also found that C0T-1 DNA, when used as an RNA FISH probe, can detect ASAR6 RNA that is expressed and localized to an individual chromosome territory, indicating that at least some of the RNA FISH signal detected by C0T-1 DNA represents ASAR RNA. Given our recent discovery of ASAR RNAs expressed from every autosome, and encoded by ∼3% of the human genome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, we propose that ASAR RNAs represent functional “chromosome associated RNA” species that control chromosome dynamics within mammalian nuclei. Whether or not there are nuclear functions of other chromosome associated hnRNAs that are independent of ASARs will require genetic and/or functional validation.</p>
<p>Here we identified several hnRNPs (HNRNPA1, HNRNPC, HNRNPL, HNRNPM, HNRNPU, and HNRNPUL1) as important interaction partners for the chromosome territory localization of multiple ASAR RNAs. In addition, we found that the SWI/SNF related transcription factor HLTF, which was recently shown to regulate replication fork reversal, prevent alternative mechanisms of stress-resistant DNA replication, and mediates cellular resistance to replication stress <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, is required for the chromosome territory localization of multiple ASAR RNAs and for the synchronous replication of every autosome pair. Furthermore, we found that the KH domain (HNRNP<underline>K</underline> <underline>H</underline>omology domain) containing protein KHSRP, and the ubiquitin hydrolase UCHL5 also contribute to the chromosome territory localization of ASAR RNAs. We found that depletion of HNRNPA1, HNRNPC, HNRNPL, HNRNPM, HNRNPU, HNRNPUL1, HLTF, KHSRP, or UCHL5 proteins resulted in a dramatic genome-wide disruption of the normally synchronous replication timing program on all autosome pairs. Taken together our results indicate that the association of ASAR RNAs with multiple hnRNPs in combination with other nuclear RBPs is an essential step in the regulation of the synchronous replication timing program on mammalian chromosomes.</p>
<p>While these studies have demonstrated a role for multiple RBPs in genome-wide chromosome replication timing, one limitation of these studies is that we only tested 14 out of the ∼100 RBPs shown by eCLIP to associate with multiple ASAR RNAs. It is likely that additional insights into the network of RBP/ASAR interactions could be gained by extending our replication timing analyses to knockdowns of additional RBPs. Another limitation of these studies is that all of the RBPs implicated in control of replication timing are known to play various roles in other essential nucleic acid metabolic pathways, including transcription, splicing, mRNA export, and RNA degradation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. It is possible that knocking down these RBPs has an indirect effect on replication related to these other functions of the RBPs, rather than a direct effect on ASAR function. However, the RBP knockdowns that disrupt genome-wide synchronous replication also disrupt chromosome association of multiple ASAR RNAs. Our previous work demonstrated that the ability of an ectopically integrated ASAR6 transgene to cause delayed replication timing of a mouse chromosome required the ASAR6 RNA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Hence, we expect that displacement of ASAR RNA from chromosome territories upon RBP knockdown is a primary cause of the genome-wide replication timing asynchrony, regardless of whether the displacement of ASAR RNA from the chromosome is a direct or indirect effect of RBP knockdown. A final limitation of these studies is that the precise mechanism by which ASARs and RBPs interact to control replication timing remains unknown. One intriguing possibility that is consistent with our data is that the ASAR RNAs serve as scaffolds for the assembly of extensive RNA-protein and protein-protein complexes that form a chromosome-tethered liquid-liquid phase that facilitates the recruitment of the requisite chromatin modifiers and DNA replication machinery. In support of this notion, HNRNPA1 and HNRNPC are components of the 40S hnRNP particle, which forms a nuclear biomolecular condensate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. In addition, HNRNPU and HNRNPUL1 interact with each of the 40S hnRNP particle subunits <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, suggesting the possibility of extensive protein-protein interactions. ASAR RNAs normally remain associated exclusively with the chromosome territory from which they are transcribed, and ASAR RNAs on different chromosomes remain separate. RBP knockdowns that disrupt synchronous replication timing also release ASAR RNAs from their chromosome territories, allowing colocalization of ASAR RNAs from different chromosomes (i.e. ASAR6 and ASAR1-187, see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5O-Q</xref>), often in nuclear and/or cytoplasmic foci reminiscent of the mixing of liquid-liquid phases. Additional support for this model is the observation that Xist RNA participates in the assembly of a nuclear heteromeric condensate essential for gene silencing on the inactive X chromosome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. It is worth noting that ectopic integration of Xist transgenes has been a useful assay for characterization of Xist functions, including the ability to delay replication timing and induce gene silencing on autosomes (reviewed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>). Thus, our observation that the ∼7kb RBPD RNA induces DRT/DMC on the inactive X chromosome, and associates with the Xist RNA cloud (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>), suggests that the ∼7kb RBPD RNA interferes with Xist RNA function within the heteromeric condensate. One intriguing observation, which is largely ignored by the X inactivation field, is that deletion of the Xist gene on either the active or inactive X chromosomes results in delayed replication timing of the X chromosome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Thus, loss of function mutations of either ASARs or Xist result in a similar chromosome-wide delayed replication timing phenotype. These parallels between ASAR and Xist mutation phenotypes suggest a shared mechanism for controlling replication timing in cis.</p>
<p>The formation of liquid-liquid phases via ASAR RNA-RBP interactions is speculative at this point and remains to be tested directly. A full understanding of the mechanisms by which ASARs control chromosome replication timing will require an extensive biochemical and biophysical characterization of the ASAR RNA-protein and protein-protein complexes and how they interact with the DNA replication machinery.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study expands generally upon our understanding of the role of hnRNP proteins in lncRNA function through analysis of ASAR genes that are present on all chromosomes and of profound significance. The findings provide <bold>convincing</bold> evidence linking ASARs with the phenomenon of RNA retention on chromosomes, including X inactivation, thereby providing an expanded context for studies in these areas. This manuscript will be of interest to researchers studying gene regulation and the interactions and functional roles of hnRNP and lncRNAs.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Thayer et al build upon their prior findings that ASAR long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are chromatin-associated and are implicated in control of replication timing. To explore the mechanism of function of ASAR transcripts, they leveraged the ENCODE RNA binding protein eCLIP datasets to show that a 7kb region of ASAR6-141 is bound by multiple hnRNP proteins. Deletion of this 7kb region resulted in delayed chromosome 6 replication. Furthermore, ectopic integration of the ASAR6-141 7kb region into autosomes or the inactive X-chromosome also resulted in delayed chromosome replication. They then use RNA FISH experiments to show that knockdown of these hnRNP proteins disrupts ASAR6-141 localization to chromatin and in turn replication timing.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Given prior publications showing HNRNPU to be important for chromatin retention of XIST and Firre, this work expands upon our understanding on the role of hnRNP proteins in lncRNA function.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The work presented is mechanistically interesting, however, one must be careful with the over interpretation that hnRNP proteins can regular chromosome replication directly.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper reports a role for a substantial number of RNA binding proteins (RBPs), in particular hnRNPs, in the function of ASAR &quot;genes&quot;. ASARs are (very) long, non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that control allelic expression imbalance (e.g.: mono-allelic expression) and replication timing of their resident chromosomes. These relatively novel &quot;genes&quot; have recently been identified on all human autosomes and are of broad significance given their critical importance for basic chromosomal functions and stability. However, the mechanism(s) of ASAR function remain unclear. ASARs exhibit some functional relatedness to Xist RNA, including persistent association of the expressed RNA with its resident chromosome, and similarities in the composition of RNA sequences associated with ASARs, in particular Line1 RNAs. Recent findings that certain hnRNPs control the chromosome territory retention of Cot1-bearing RNAs (which includes Line1) led the authors to test hypothesis that hnRNPs might regulate ASARs.</p>
<p>Specific new findings in this paper:</p>
<p>-Analysis of eCLIP (RNA-protein interaction) ENCODE data shows numerous interactions of the ASAR6-141 RNA with RBPs, including hnRNPs (e.g.: HNRNPU) that have been implicated in the retention of RNAs within local chromosome territories.</p>
<p>
-most of these interactions can be mapped to a 7kb region of the 185kb ASAR6-141 RNA</p>
<p>
-deletion of this 7kb region is sufficient to induce the DMC/DRT phenotype associated with deletion of the entire ASAR region</p>
<p>
-ectopic integration into mouse autosomes of the 7kb region is sufficient to cause DMC/DRT of the targeted autosome, and a similar effect upon ectopic integration into inactive X. This raises the question about integration into the active X, which was not mentioned. Is integration into the active X observed? Is it possible that integration might alter Xist expression confounding this interpretation?</p>
<p>
-Knockdown of RBPs that bind the 7kb region causes dissociation of ASAR6-141 RNA from its chromosome territory, and, remarkably, dissociation of Xist RNA from inactive X, and mis-colocalization of the ASAR6-141 and Xist RNAs. Depletion of these RBPs causes DMC/DRT on all autosomes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>These are compelling results suggesting shared mechanism(s) in the regulation of ASARs and Xist RNAs by RBPs that bind Cot1 sequences in these lncRNAs. The identification of these RBPs as shared effectors of ASARs and Xist that are required for RNA territory localization mechanistically links previously independent phenomena.</p>
<p>The data are convincing and support the conclusions. The replication timing method is low resolution and is only a relative measure but seems adequate for the task at hand. The FISH experiments are convincing. The quality of the images is impressive.</p>
<p>Links to other subfields like X-inactivation and RNA association with chromosome territories provide novel context and protein players, new phenotypes to examine</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The exact effects of knockdown experiments are unclear and may be indirect, which is acknowledged.</p>
<p>The mechanism is not much clearer than before.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Major recommendations</p>
<p>(1) In lines 42-44 (abstract), the authors state that &quot;ASARs function as essential RNA scaffolds for the assembly of hnRNP complexes that help maintain the structural integrity of each mammalian chromosome&quot;. Similar conclusions are restated in lines 138-140. Based on the data presented, it is evident that ASARs localization on chromatin is dependent on hnRNPs. However, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that ASARs cause the assembly of hnRNP complexes or that these hnRNP complexes are directly responsible for the regulation of chromosome replication. Please revise your claims.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have modified the text as follows: “Our results further demonstrate the role that ASARs play during the temporal order of genome-wide replication, and we propose that ASARs function as essential RNA scaffolds for the assembly of hnRNP complexes that help maintain the structural integrity of each mammalian chromosome.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In the analysis in Figure 1C- F, it is unclear why XIST is used as a comparison to ASAR6-141. A more meaningful control would be to show that hnRNPs preferentially bind ASAR6-141 relative to all expressed transcripts. Also, some panels are missing the y-axis label.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have genetically validated 8 different ASAR genes for their role in controlling chromosome-wide replication timing. The only other gene known to control chromosome-wide replication timing is XIST, which also encodes a chromosome-associated lncRNA. Our analysis of publicly available eCLIP data (and previous literature on XIST-binding proteins) showed substantial overlap between RBPs that associate with ASARs and XIST. Hence, we anticipated that at least some RBP knockdowns would affect both lncRNAs, despite their contrasting functions. In addition, we routinely use XIST RNA as a positive control in RNA FISH assays, as the XIST RNA FISH protocol represents a robust and well validated chromosomal RNA FISH procedure.</p>
<p>y-axis labels have been added to Figure 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In Figure 2K&amp;L, it would be beneficial to quantify and normalize the BrdU incorporation, as ectopic integration of the sense 7kb region appears to result in overall higher BrdU incorporation in all chromosomes, not just chromosome 5.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There are two main aspects of the BrdU incorporation assay that we use: 1) The BrdU incorporation banding pattern on each chromosome is unique to that chromosome, and the banding pattern is also representative of the time during S phase when the BrdU incorporation occurred, i.e. we detect a different banding pattern if BrdU is incorporated in early S phase versus late S phase. 2) The amount of BrdU incorporation can be used to measure the synchrony between chromosome homologs, but only within the same cell. Thus, we generate a ratio of BrdU incorporation in chromosome homologs in individual cells, then compare the ratio of incorporation into each chromosome pair in multiple cells (see Figure 2B-E). The overall BrdU incorporation into the chromosomes of different cells is quite variable; however, the banding pattern and ratio of BrdU incorporation in chromosome homologs in individual cells is comparable, unless we have disrupted or ectopically integrated an ASAR. Given the variability in overall BrdU incorporation detected between different cells in the population this is not a useful readout for measuring synchronous versus asynchronous replication between chromosome homologs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) hnRNP protein can regulate multiple aspects of RNA processing other than chromatin retention. Hence, it would be beneficial to rule out an alternative hypothesis as to what the hnRNP knockdowns do to ASAR6-131? For example, assessing changes in RNA levels or splicing upon knockdown of hnRNPs using qPCR?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that direct roles for any of the hnRNP/RBPs that are critical for ASAR RNA localization and replication timing have not been established. However, our findings combined with the observation that cells depleted of HNRNPU show reduced origin licensing in G1, and show reduced origin activation frequency during S phase (PMID: 34888666), supports a role for HNRNPU, either directly or indirectly, in DNA replication. Furthermore, we also found that depletion of the DNA replication fork remodeler HLTF or the deubiquitinase UCHL5 also results in mis-localization of ASAR RNAs, and results in asynchronous replication of every autosome pair, indicating that ASAR RNA mis-localization and asynchronous replication are not simply a phenotype associated with hnRNP depletions. A full mechanistic understanding of the role that ASAR RNAs play in combination with this relatively large and diverse set of hnRNP/RBPs will require a better understanding of the direct roles that each protein, and any higher order complexes that contain these proteins, play in regulating DNA synthesis, splicing, transcription, chromatin structure and/or ASAR RNA localization.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Both the disruption and ectopic expression of the 7kb region result in delayed chromosome replication. Would one not expect there to be opposing effects on replication timing? Please discuss.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>One puzzling set of observations is that loss of function mutations and gain of function mutations of ASAR genes result in a similar delayed replication timing and delayed mitotic condensation phenotype. We have detected delayed replication timing in human cells following genetic knockouts (loss of function) of eight different ASAR genes located on 5 different autosomes. We have also detected delayed replication timing on mouse chromosomes expressing transgenes (gain of function) from three different ASAR genes (ASAR6, ASAR6-141, and ASAR15). The ASAR transgenes ranged in size from an ~180kb BAC, to an ~3kb PCR product. One possible explanation for these observations is that ectopic integration of ASAR transgenes function in a dominant negative manner by interfering with the endogenous “ASARs” on the integrated chromosomes. Consistent with this possibility is that we recently identified ASAR candidate genes on every human autosome (PMC9588035). Our favored model is that expression of ASAR transgenes integrated into mouse chromosomes disrupts the function of endogenous ASARs by &quot;out-competing&quot; them for shared RBPs. We also point out that a similar ectopic integration assay, using <italic>Xist</italic> transgenes, has been an informative assay for characterization of <italic>Xist</italic> functions, including the ability to delay replication timing and induce gene silencing on autosomes (reviewed in PMID:19898525). One intriguing observation (yet largely ignored by the X inactivation field) is that deletion of the Xist gene on either the active or inactive X chromosomes in somatic cells results in delayed replication timing of the X chromosomes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc1667074/">PMC1667074</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc1456779/">PMC1456779</ext-link>). Thus, both loss of function and gain of function mutations of Xist result in a similar delayed replication timing phenotype. Given these parallels between Xist and ASAR gene mutation phenotypes we were curious to test the consequences of ASAR gain of function on the inactive X chromosome. In this manuscript, we integrated the ~7kb ASAR6-141 transgene into the inactive X chromosome, and detected a delayed replication timing phenotype on the integrated X chromosome. We also detected an association between Xist and ASAR RNAs using RNA FISH in interphase cells (Figure 4A and 4B), which supports the observations that ASAR RNAs and XIST RNA are bound by a partially overlapping set of hnRNP/RBPs (Figure 1D-F), and is consistent with the model that ASAR transgenes disrupt function by competition for shared RBPs. Dissecting the roles that the hnRNP/RBPs that interact with both ASAR and XIST RNAs will undoubtably give important insights into both XIST and ASAR function, and how these poorly understood chromosomal phenotypes are generated.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor recommendations</p>
<p>(1) In Figure 1G, it would be informative to show where the LINE-1 element within ASAR6-141 is located to get a sense of what hnRNP proteins bind to it.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There are numerous LINE-1 elements within the ASAR6-141 gene. The ~7kb RBPD does not contain LINE-1 sequences. Therefore, we did not detect significant hnRNP/RBP eCLIP peaks within LINE-1 sequences.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The rationale for ectopic integration of the 7kb region into the inactive X-chromosome is unclear. Is there something unique about the replication of the inactive X or were you interested in seeing whether the 7kb region could escape X-inactivation?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Given the parallels between Xist and ASAR gene mutation phenotypes, i.e. loss of function and gain of function result in delayed replication timing (see above), we were curious to test the consequences of ASAR gene gain of function on the inactive X chromosome. One possibility was reversal of X inactivation and a shift to earlier replication timing. However, we detected delayed replication timing on the inactive X, and an enhanced XIST RNA FISH signal that overlapped with the ASAR RNA. This speaks to the comment of Reviewer 2 questioning: &quot;Is it possible that integration might alter Xist expression confounding this interpretation? &quot;. The enhanced XIST RNA FISH signal suggests that the delayed replication of the inactive X is not due to reduced expression of XIST RNA.</p>
