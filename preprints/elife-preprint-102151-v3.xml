<title>Abstract</title><p>The purpose of these studies is to investigate how Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling regulates glial phenotype, dedifferentiation of Müller glia (MG), reprogramming into proliferating MG-derived progenitor cells (MGPCs), and neuronal differentiation of the progeny of MGPCs in the chick retina. We found that S1P-related genes are highly expressed by retinal neurons and glia, and levels of expression were dynamically regulated following retinal damage. Drug treatments that activate S1P receptor 1 (S1PR1) or increase levels of S1P suppressed the formation of MGPCs. Conversely, treatments that inhibit S1PR1 or decrease levels of S1P stimulated the formation of MGPCs. Inhibition of S1P receptors or S1P synthesis significantly enhanced the neuronal differentiation of the progeny of MGPCs. We report that S1P-related gene expression in MG is modulated by microglia and inhibition of S1P receptors or S1P synthesis partially rescues the loss of MGPC formation in damaged retinas missing microglia. Finally, we show that TGFβ/Smad3 signaling in the resting retina maintains S1PR1 expression in MG. We conclude that the S1P signaling is dynamically regulated in MG and MGPCs in the chick retina, and activation of S1P signaling depends, in part, on signals produced by reactive microglia.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Different cell signaling pathways are known to regulate the reprogramming of Müller glia (MG) into MG-derived progenitor cells (MGPCs) in damaged retinas. There are crucial roles of growth factors, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and transcription factors in the regulation of MG reprogramming into MGPCs in different vertebrate species (Taylor et al., 2024b). Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NFκB) is one the key cell signaling “hubs” that regulates the reactivity of MG, acts restore glial quiescence and suppress the neurogenic of MG-derived progenitors in the mouse retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hoang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Palazzo et al., 2022</xref>). We found that NFκB-signaling in damaged retinas is manifested in MG by pro-inflammatory signals produced by activated microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Palazzo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Palazzo et al., 2023</xref>). Further, we show that inhibition of NFκB-signaling results in diminished recruitment of immune cells in damaged retinas, increased neuronal survival, and increased formation of neuron-like cells from Ascl1-overexpressing MG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Palazzo et al., 2022</xref>). In the chick retina, by comparison, rapid activation of NFκB via signals produced by reactive microglia starts the process of MG activation and reprogramming, but sustained NFκB signaling suppresses the proliferating of MGPCs and neuronal differentiation of progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Palazzo et al., 2020</xref>). NFκB signaling is known to be coordinated with Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) -signaling to regulate different cellular processes, including inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Blom et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pérez-Jeldres et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>S1P signaling is a promising candidate to regulate the ability of MG to reprogram into proliferating, neurogenic progenitor cells. S1P is produced by sphingosine kinases (SPHK1 and SPHK2) and is degraded by a lyase (SGPL1). Notably, SPHK2 does not directly contribute to levels of secreted S1P (Thuy et al., 2022), nor is it annotated in the chick genome. S1P can be exported from cells by a transporter (MFSD2A and SPNS2) or converted to sphingosine by a phosphatase (SGPP1). Levels of sphingosine are increased by ASAH1 by conversion of ceramide or decreased by CERS2/5/6 by conversion to ceramide. S1P is known to activate G-protein coupled receptors, S1PR1 through S1PR5. S1PRs are known to activate different cell signaling pathways including MAPK and PI3K/mTor, and crosstalk with pro-inflammatory pathways such as NFκB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hu et al., 2020</xref>). Alternatively, activation of S1PRs can activate Jak/Stat-signaling, which upregulates Egr1 to upregulate pro-inflammatory cytokines that secondarily activate NFκB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gurgui et al., 2010</xref>). S1P signaling is an important pathway that has been widely implicated as mediating inflammatory responses, cellular proliferation, promote survival and regulate angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Obinata and Hla, 2019</xref>). S1P signaling is required for vascular maturation, progenitor cell cycle exit, and axon guidance in the developing retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Simón et al., 2019</xref>). However, S1P can have detrimental effects including migration of MG, angiogenesis, and inflammation associated with proliferative retinopathies and aging. Most of these studies in retinal cells were conducted <italic>in vitro</italic>, and these studies need to be followed-up by <italic>in vivo</italic> analyses to assess the coordinated impact of S1P signaling on the many different cell types in the retina. The functions of S1P signaling in normal and damaged retinas are poorly understood, and nothing is known about how S1P signaling impacts MG-mediated retinal regeneration.</p>
<p>Pro-inflammatory signaling represses reprogramming of mouse MG by promoting reactivity networks and anti-neurogenic factors, while increasing cell death in damage retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Palazzo et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, it is important to understand how different cell signaling pathways impact inflammation to develop techniques to enhance neuronal survival and retinal regeneration. In this study we target S1P synthesis, S1P degradation and S1P receptors to investigate the roles of S1P-signaling during damage-dependent MG reprogramming and neurogenesis in the chick model system.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>The animal use approved in these experiments was in accordance with the guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health and IACUC at The Ohio State University. Newly hatched P0 wildtype leghorn chicks (<italic>Gallus gallus domesticus</italic>) were obtained from Meyer Hatchery (Polk, Ohio). Post-hatch chicks were maintained in a regular diurnal cycle of 12 hours light, 12 hours dark (8:00 AM-8:00 PM). Chicks were housed in stainless-steel brooders at 25°C and received water and Purina<sup>tm</sup> chick starter <italic>ad libitum</italic>.</p>

<title>Intraocular Injections</title>
<p>Chicks were anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane mixed with oxygen from a non-rebreathing vaporizer. The technical procedures for intraocular injections were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fischer et al., 1998</xref>). With all injection paradigms, both pharmacological and vehicle treatments were administered to the right and left eye respectively. Compounds were injected in 20 μl sterile saline. Hydrophobic compounds were injected with 20% DMSO in saline, according to solubility data provided by the vendors. Sphingosine and sphingosine-1 phosphate were injected with 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin added as a carrier. 5-Ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) was injected into the vitreous chamber to label proliferating cells. Compounds included in this study are described in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. For chicks between P7 and P14, we estimated volumes of 100 µl of liquid vitreous and 800 µl gel vitreous, and an average eye weight of 0.9 grams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Oishi and Murakami, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Prashar et al., 2009</xref>). <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> includes the ranges of reported <italic>in vivo</italic> ED50’s (50% effective dose; mg/kg) and the calculated initial maximum dose (mg/kg equivalent per eye). Doses were chosen based on estimates of the initial maximum ocular dose that were within the range of reported ED50’s. The S1P-targetting drugs are classified as BDDCS Class II, indicating low solubility but high cell permeability. Thus, it is highly probable that they diffuse across the inner limiting membrane to act within the retina, but it is also likely that their bioavailability is limited, requiring a higher dose, repeated doses and delivery in 20% DMSO. Injection paradigms are included in each figure.</p>

<title>Preparation of clodronate liposomes</title>
<p>Clodronate liposomes were prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fischer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Van Rooijen, 1989</xref>). In short, 50 ng cholesterol (Sigma C3045) and 8 mg L-α-phosphatidyl-DL-glycerol sodium salt (Sigma P8318) were dissolved in chloroform and evaporated into a thin film in a round-bottom flask. Then, the liposome film was dissolved in sterile PBS containing 158 mg dichloro-methylene diphosphonate (Sigma D4434). The clodronate was encapsulated by the liposomes via sonication at 42,000 Hz. The clodronate liposomes in PBS were centrifuged at 10,000 RCF, gently resuspended in 150 ml sterile PBS, and injected 20 ul/eye immediately. Our previous studies have shown that this method ablates &gt;99% of microglia/macrophages 2 days after intraocular injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">El-Hodiri et al., 2023</xref>).</p>

<title>Fixation, sectioning, and immunocytochemistry</title>
<p>Retinas were fixed, sectioned, and immunolabeled as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fischer et al., 1998</xref>). To identify MG, we labeled sections for Sox2 or Sox9. Antibodies to Sox2 and Sox9 are known to label the nuclei or MG in the INL and the nuclei of astrocytes at the vitread surface of the retina (Fischer et al., 2010). None of the observed labeling was due to non-specific labeling of secondary antibodies or auto-fluorescence because sections labeled with secondary antibodies alone were devoid of fluorescence. Primary antibodies used in this study are described in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Secondary antibodies included donkey-anti-goat-Alexa488/594/647 (Life Technologies A11055; A11058; A21447), donkey-anti-rabbit-Alexa488/594 (Life Technologies A21206; A21207); and goat-anti-mouse-Alexa488/568 (Life Technologies A11001; A-11004) diluted to 1:1000 in PBS plus 0.2% Triton X-100. Nuclear staining was accomplished using DRAQ5 (Thermo 62251).</p>

<p>For the detection of nuclei that incorporated EdU, immunolabeled sections were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in 0.1M PBS pH 7.4 for 5 minutes at room temperature.</p>
<p>Samples were washed for 5 minutes with PBS, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 minute at room temperature and washed twice for 5 minutes in PBS. Sections were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature in a buffer consisting of 100 mM Tris, 8 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub>, and 100 mM ascorbic acid in dH<sub>2</sub>O. The Alexa Fluor 647 Azide (Thermo Fisher Scientific A10277) was added to the buffer at a 1:500 dilution.</p>

<title>Fluorescent in situ hybridization</title>
<p>Standard procedures were used for fluorescent <italic>in-situ</italic> hybridization (FISH), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Campbell et al., 2021a</xref>). In short, retinas from P9 eyes were fixed for 4 hours RT in 4% paraformaldehyde buffered in 0.1M dibasic sodium phosphate, washed in PTW (PBS + 0.2% Tween), and incubated in 30% sucrose at 4°C overnight.</p>
<p>The retinas were embedded in OCT-compound and cryosectioned at 12 microns. Tissue sections were processed for in situ hybridization with a split-initiator probe pair (Molecular Instruments) according to the manufacturer protocol for fresh/fixed frozen tissues. For slides in which immunocytochemistry was conducted with FISH, primary antibodies incubated overnight with the hairpin amplification buffer solution, and secondary antibodies incubated for one hour the next day. Slides were mounted with glycerol and glass coverslips.</p>

<title>Measurement of S1P with LC-MS/MS</title>
<sec id="s2h1">
<title>Sample preparation</title>
<p>After intraocular injections of saline, NMDA, saline + PF-543, NMDA + PF543, or NMDA + SGPL-in-31, whole retinal tissue samples were collected into a 10-fold volume of methanol acidified with 0.1% formic acid.</p>
<p>Sphingosine-1-shosphate(d18:1) (S1P) and Sphingosine(d17:1) (Avanti Polar Lipids) were used as internal standards. Retinal samples were extracted with 80% methanol at a ratio of 1:20 (w/v) in a 2 mL Eppendorf tube. The samples were vortexed for 30 seconds, sonicated in water bath for 10 minutes, and followed by centrifugation at 10,000 rcf for 5 minutes at room temperature. One hundred microliter of supernatant was transferred out to a 2 mL HPLC vial and spiked with Sphingosine to a final concentration of 100 ppb. All the samples were analyzed in triplicates.</p>
<p>The matrix blank sample was prepared exactly as samples. Standard addition calibration levels were subsequently prepared by spiking 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, and 500 ppb of S1P into the matrix blank supernatant with final volume of 100 µL. The internal standard of Sphingosine was spiked in each calibration levels at 100 ppb. Finally, five microliters of the standard addition levels were injected and analyzed by LC-MS/MS.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2h2">
<title>Quantification</title>
<p>Quantification was carried out on a Vanquish UHPLC coupled to an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher, MA, USA). The analytes were separated on a Accucore C18 2.6 μm 2.1 × 100 mm column using the binary solvents of 0.1% formic acid in water (v/v) (solvent A), and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (v/v) (solvent B). The gradient was as follows: 0–0.5 min, holding at 10% B; 0.5–6 min, 10% to 95% B; 6-8 min, holding at 95% B; 8-8.01 min, 95% to 10% B; 8.01-10 min, holding at 10% B. The flow rate was 0.4 mL/min.</p>
<p>The following mass spectrometer instrument settings were used: ion source = H-ESI; positive ion = 3500 V; sheath gas = 35; aux gas = 7; ion transfer tube temperature = 320°C; vaporizer temperature = 275°C; HCD collision energy = 50%; RF lens = 40%. The S1P and Sphingosine were quantified using the transition from 380.2560 m/z to 264.27 m/z, and transition from 286.2741 m/z to 268.26 m/z, respectively.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The standard addition curves demonstrated great linearity with R<sup>2</sup> above 0.99. Significance of difference was determined using a one-way ANOVA with Šidák correction for multiple comparisons.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Photography, immunofluorescence measurements, and statistics</title>
<p>Wide-field photomicroscopy was performed using a Leica DM5000B microscope equipped with epifluorescence and Leica DC500 digital camera. Confocal images were obtained using a Leica SP8 imaging system at the Department of Neuroscience Imaging Facility at the Ohio State University. Images were optimized for color, brightness and contrast, multiple channels over laid and figures constructed using Adobe Photoshop. Cell counts were performed on representative images. To avoid the possibility of region-specific differences within the retina, cell counts were consistently made from the same region of retina for each data set. Peripheral regions of the retina were designated as 1 to 3 mm from the circumferential marginal zone, and central regions of the retina were designated as within 3 mm of the posterior pole of the eye in the nasotemporal plane.</p>
<p>Where significance of difference was determined between two treatment groups accounting for inter-individual variability (means of treated-control values) we performed a two-tailed, paired t-test. Where significance of difference was determined between two treatment groups, we performed a two-tailed, unpaired t-test. Significance of difference between multiple groups was determined using ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test. GraphPad Prism 6 was used for statistical analyses and generation of histograms and bar graphs.</p>

<title>S1P-signaling regulates the formation of MGPCs in damaged retinas</title>
<p>We first probed for patterns of expression of S1P-related genes in a large aggregate scRNA-seq library of &gt;180,000 cells isolated from retinas treated with saline, NMDA, or 2 or 3 doses insulin+FGF2 and the combination of NMDA and insulin+FGF2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Campbell et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Campbell et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">El-Hodiri et al., 2022</xref>).

<p>We bioinformatically isolated the MG (&gt;70,000 cells) and re-embedded these cells into a UMAP plot (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref>). The UMAP ordering of MG revealed clusters that were comprised of cells from distinct treatments and different times after treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h,i</xref>). We find that S1P-related genes are dramatically up- or downregulated in MG in damaged retinas and during the formation of MGPCs. Dynamic changes of mRNA levels are strongly correlated with changes in protein levels and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). We found that levels of <italic>S1PR1</italic> and <italic>CERS6</italic> were very high in resting MG and significantly downregulated in MG and MGPCs from treated retinas (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1j</xref>; supplemental Fig. 1; supplemental table 1). <italic>S1PR3</italic> was significantly higher in MGPCs, namely the MGPC2 cluster, compared to MG in all other UMAP clusters (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1j</xref>; supplemental Fig. 1; supplemental table 1). Levels of <italic>SPHK1</italic> were relatively high in resting MG and significantly downregulated in MG and MGPCs from retinas treated with NMDA and/or insulin+FGF2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1j</xref>; supplemental Fig. 1; supplemental table 1). <italic>CERS5</italic> was significantly upregulated in MG at 24hrs after NMDA and MGPCs compared to resting MG and MG treated with insulin and FGF2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1j</xref>; supplemental Fig. 1; supplemental table 1).</p>
<p>We next analyzed the expression of S1P-related genes in a scRNA-seq database that we generated for early time-points, 3 and 12 hours, after NMDA- treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Campbell et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Campbell et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">El-Hodiri et al., 2023</xref>). These scRNA-seq libraries did not integrate well with older libraries likely because these libraries were generated with different reagents with different sensitivities. UMAP ordering of cells revealed distinct clusters of neurons and glia, with MG forming distinct clusters based on time after NMDA-treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1k,l</xref>). Resting MG were identified based on high levels of expression of genes such as <italic>GLUL</italic> and <italic>RLBP1</italic>, activated MG were identified based of high levels of expression of genes such as <italic>TGFB2</italic> and <italic>PMP2,</italic> and proliferating MGPCs were identified based on high levels of expression of <italic>CDK1</italic> and <italic>TOP2A</italic> (supplemental Fig. 1). Consistent with previous observations, <italic>S1PR1</italic> was highly and exclusively expressed by resting MG and is rapidly (&lt;3hrs) downregulated following NMDA-induced damage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1m</xref>; supplemental Fig. 1). Levels of <italic>SPHK1</italic> were very low in this aggregate scRNA-seq library possibly because the transcripts are very low-copy or the mRNA is labile (not shown). <italic>SGPL1</italic> and <italic>ASAH1</italic> are rapidly downregulated, and <italic>CERS6</italic> is upregulated at different times after NMDA-treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e,f</xref>,m,n), suggesting a downregulation of S1P levels following damage in the chick retina.</p>
<p>In microglia, levels of <italic>ASAH1</italic> and <italic>SGPL1</italic> were significantly increased at 48hrs after NMDA-treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1n</xref>; supplemental table 1). In cone photoreceptors, only ASAH1 was significantly decreased following NMDA-treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1n</xref>; supplemental table 1). In bipolar cells, there were significant decreases in levels of <italic>S1PR1</italic> and <italic>CERS6</italic> following NMDA-treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1n</xref>; supplemental table 1). In amacrine cells, there were significant decreases in levels of <italic>S1PR1, ASAH1</italic> and <italic>CERS6</italic> following NMDA-treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1n</xref>; supplemental table 1). In RGCs, there were significant decreases in expression levels of CERS6 and SGPL1 at different times after NMDA- treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1n</xref>; supplemental table 1). There were no significant changes in S1P- related genes in rod photoreceptors or horizontal cells in damaged retinas (not shown). Collectively, these findings indicate that there is dynamic expression of genes related to S1P synthesis and degradation in retinal neurons, and this may impact signaling through <italic>S1PR1</italic> in MG.</p>

<title>Validation of patterns of expression of <italic>S1PR1</italic>, <italic>S1PR3,</italic> and <italic>SPHK1</italic></title>
<p>To validate some of the findings from scRNA-seq libraries, we performed fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) on normal and NMDA-damaged retinas. We applied antibodies to S1pr1 and Sphk1(Santa Cruz, sc-48356; Novus, NB120-11424; Bioss, bs-2652R), but these antibodies did not reveal plausible patterns of labeling (not shown). By comparison, FISH for <italic>S1PR1</italic> revealed distinct puncta that were concentrated around the Sox2-positive nuclei of resting MG in undamaged retinas, consistent with scRNA-seq data (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). 100% of the Sox2-positive MG nuclei in the INL were associated with <italic>S1PR1</italic> FISH puncta (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). In damaged retinas at 3 HPI (hour post injury), <italic>S1PR1</italic> was significantly reduced in the INL and very few puncta were observed in close proximity to MG nuclei (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>).

In undamaged retinas, we found very few <italic>S1PR3</italic> FISH puncta associated with MG nuclei and across the retina (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c,d</xref>). In contrast, we identified <italic>S1PR3</italic> puncta associated with some MG nuclei at 48 HPI; these results are consistent with scRNA-data (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). In undamaged retinas, we found <italic>SPHK1</italic> FISH puncta associated with MG nuclei, consistent with scRNA-seq data (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e,f</xref>).

<title>Activation of cell signaling pathways by S1P</title>
<p>S1P signaling is known to activate different cell signaling pathways including MAPK and PI3K/mTor, and crosstalk with pro-inflammatory pathways such as NFκB (reviewed by Cui et al, 2021). Alternatively, activation of S1PRs can activate Jak/Stat- signaling, which upregulates the immediate early gene Egr1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gurgui et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Liang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Sato et al., 2000</xref>). To probe for the activation of different cell signaling pathways in the retina, we delivered S1P to undamaged eyes and collected retinas 24hrs later. In retinas treated with exogenous S1P, levels of pS6 and pSTAT3 levels were significantly increased in MG (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). By comparison, levels of pERK1/2 and cFos were unaffected by S1P-treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). We did not observe significant changes in the total number of microglia in the retina, indicating that S1P delivery did not initiate any recruitment of macrophages into the retina (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3c,d</xref>). However, we found that S1P-treatment significantly increased the accumulation of microglia to the inner limiting membrane (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3c,d</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that the signaling pathways activated by S1P include Jak/Stat and mTOR, but not MAPK. These pathways are predominantly activated in MG, and high levels of S1P may elicit a migratory response in resident retinal microglia. S1P receptor transcripts are not highly expressed in microglia (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>); it is most probable that this response is elicited indirectly through S1PRs expressed by MG and secondary production of chemotactic signaling. There are no reliable cell-level readouts of NFκB -signaling in the chick retina (Palazzo, 2020). Thus, we did not probe for activation of NFκB in retinas treated with S1P.</p>

<title>S1P signaling and the formation of proliferating MGPCs</title>
<p>We next investigated how activation or inhibition of S1P-signaling influences the formation of proliferating MGPCs in damaged retinas.

<p>We also applied FTY720 (Fingolimod), which has been used in clinical applications. FTY720 is known to act as an agonist at S1P receptors and then induce internalization <italic>and</italic> deactivation after continuous exposure, whereas other agonists are believed to induce persistent changes in signaling through S1P receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Jo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Sykes et al., 2014</xref>). FTY720 treatment significantly reduced numbers of proliferating MGPCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a,h</xref>). Finally, we targeted the metabolism of S1P with inhibitors to SPHK1 or SGPL1, enzymes that synthesize and degrade S1P, respectively. Inhibition of SPHK1 (PF543 or SKI-II), which is expected to decrease levels of S1P, significantly increased numbers of proliferating MGPCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a,h</xref>,i) By comparison, inhibition of SGPL1 with S1PL-in-31, which is expected to increase levels of S1P, significantly decreased in numbers of proliferating MGPCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a,b</xref>,j).</p>
<p>To corroborate findings from EdU incorporation studies, we probed for numbers of MGPCs that were labeled for neurofilament, Sox9 and phospho-histone H3 (pHisH3). MGPCs are known to upregulate neurofilament and pHisH3 during late G2 and M phase of the cell cycle at 3 days after NMDA-treatment (Fischer and Re, 2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zelinka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Palazzo et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with findings from EdU-incorporation, we found significant increases in numbers of MGPCs labeled for Sox9, neurofilament and pHisH3 in damaged retinas treated with S1PR1 antagonist (MT1303) or SPHK1 antagonist (PF543) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4k,m</xref>,o). Further, we found significant decreases in numbers of MGPCs labeled for Sox9, neurofilament and pHisH3 in damaged retinas treated with S1PR1 modulator (FTY720) or SGPL1 antagonist (S1PL-in-31; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4n,p</xref>).</p>
<p>None of the agonists or antagonists had a significant effect on the proliferation of microglia/macrophage in NMDA-damaged retinas (supplemental Fig. 2a-g). Similarly, except for the S1PR1 antagonist MT1301, none of the agonists or antagonists significantly affected numbers of dying cells (supplemental Fig. 3a-f). In damaged retinas treated with MT1303 we found a significant decrease in numbers of TUNEL- positive cells in the inner INL (supplemental Fig. 3a,c). In summary, treatments that increase levels of S1P or activate signaling through S1P-receptors result in decreased proliferation of MGPCs, whereas treatments that decrease levels of S1P or inhibit signaling through S1P-receptors result in increased proliferation of MGPCs, without significant effects upon cell death or the proliferation/accumulation of microglia.</p>
<p>Ceramide synthesis and ceramidase genes have variable patterns of expression in the resting and damaged chick retina (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). S1P and ceramides have been described as a rheostat that regulates cell survival; S1P is protective, and ceramides trigger apoptotic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Simón et al., 2019</xref>). ASAH1 (acid ceramidase) acts to restrict ceramide accumulation and is dynamically regulated in the chick retina (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). To investigate whether ceramide accumulation regulates cell survival and MGPC proliferation, we applied an acid ceramidase inhibitor (Ceranib-2) before and following NMDA treatment (supplemental Fig. 4). We observed no significant differences in cell death, microglia reactivity, MGPC proliferation between Ceranib-2 treated retinas and control damaged retinas (supplemental Fig. 4). Thus, ceramide accumulation may not impact cell survival or the responses of MG to retinal damage.</p>
<p>MG reprogramming remains robust in mature chick retinas from P7 and up to P30, but the zones of proliferation become increasingly confined to the peripheral regions of retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fischer and Reh, 2003b</xref>). In post-hatch chick retina, it is likely that MG “maturation” occurs in a central-to-peripheral gradient, much like the process neuronal differentiation in the embryonic retina. Accordingly, a zone of regeneration-competent MG persists in the retinal periphery in maturing chicks. We have previously shown that the expression of Notch-related genes differs by retinal region and chick age, and Notch inhibition suppresses numbers of MGPCs in central but not peripheral regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Ghai et al., 2010</xref>). By comparison, we observed that <italic>SPHK1</italic> expression was low in the central retina at 48 HPI, whereas <italic>SPHK1</italic> expression was high in peripheral retina (supplemental Fig. 6a). Patterns of <italic>S1PR1</italic> expression in MG were similar in central and peripheral retinal regions (data not shown). Consistent with these patterns of expression, we observed increased numbers of MGPCs in central retinas treated with S1PR1 inhibitor, whereas SPHK1 inhibitor had no effect on numbers of proliferating MGPCs in the central retina (Supplemental Fig. 6b). We conclude that as MG mature the ability to upregulate <italic>SPHK1</italic> in response to damage is lost in central regions of the retina.</p>

<title>Cell signaling downstream of SPHK1 inhibition in damaged retinas</title>
<p>There are several known downstream targets of S1PR1 signaling which may be active in MG after retinal damage. To identify second messenger pathways that were affected by diminished levels of S1P in damaged retinas, we applied SPHK1 inhibitor before, with and after NMDA-treatment and collected retinas 24 HPI. We found a significant decrease in levels of ATF3, pS6, and pSmad1/5/9 in MG in damaged retinas treated with SPHK1 inhibitor (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a-e</xref>). By comparison, phosphorylated ERK1/2 and cFos were not significantly different in MG in damaged retinas treated with SPHK1 inhibitor (supplemental Fig. 5). These findings were relatively consistent with our previous findings, where mTOR activation was observed with exogenous S1P treatment, but there was no change to pERK1/2 or immediate early gene cFOS (supplemental Fig. 5).</p>

<p>Next, we sought to validate S1P levels using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS). We collected whole retinas 48 hours after saline treatment, Sphk1-inhibitor (PF543) treatment, NMDA treatment, NMA + PF543 treatment, or NMDA + S1P lyase inhibitor (S1PLin31) treatment. As predicted, Sphk1 inhibitor treatment decreased levels of S1P in undamaged retinas (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5e</xref>). We found that S1P levels increased in NMDA-treated retinas, which correlated well with increased Sphk1 transcript levels after damage. Surprisingly, SPHK1 inhibitor treatment was not sufficient to ameliorate high levels of S1P induced by NMDA. It is possible that the effects of PF- 543 (k<sub>off</sub> t1/2=8.5 min) subsided in the 24 hours prior to tissue collection. Alternatively, this observation may reflect the rapid and transient nature of SPHK1 activity after damage, which is consistent with prior experimental observations; we found that S1P/S1PR1-targeting drugs had to be applied prior to NMDA damage to produce robust effects on MGPC proliferation (data not shown). S1P lyase inhibitor treatment robustly boosted levels of S1P in damaged retinas (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5f</xref>). In summary, differences in levels of S1P between undamaged retinas and NMDA treatment are consistent with observed Sphk1 RNA levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e,f</xref>). Further, we validated the targeting activity of two drugs, PF543 and S1PLin31.</p>

<title>Inhibition of S1P signaling and neurogenesis</title>
<p>We next investigated whether S1P signaling affects the neural differentiation of MGCPs after NMDA-treatment. We find that levels of S1PR1 were rapidly downregulated in activated MG but later rose in MG returning to resting, and S1PR3 was highly expressed in a percent of MGPCs (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1</xref>). We hypothesized that S1P receptor activity during this period of cell-fate specification of MGPC progeny may restrict neural differentiation. We applied S1P pathway inhibitors starting 2 days after NMDA, after MG have committed to cell cycle re-entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fischer and Reh, 2003a</xref>). We found that SPHK1, S1PR1, and S1PR1/3 inhibitors applied after NMDA had no significant effect on the proliferation of MGPCs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a,b</xref>). We found a significant increase in EdU<sup>+</sup> amacrine-like cells that express HuC/D (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6c,d</xref>). There was no significant difference in new Calretinin+ (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6e,f</xref>) or Ap2a<sup>+</sup> neurons (not shown) across treatment groups. Further, we found that while many EdU<sup>+</sup> progeny migrated distally into the ONL, these cells did not co-label for the photoreceptor marker visinin (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6g</xref>). These findings suggest that inhibiting S1P synthesis or receptor activity enhances the neural differentiation of MGPC progeny to differentiate into HuC/D<sup>+</sup> amacrine-like neurons after retinal damage. However, the increase in differentiation of amacrine-like cells did not include differentiation of subsets of amacrine cells that express Ap2a or calretinin.</p>

<title>Inhibition of S1P signaling rescues MGPC proliferation in damaged retinas missing microglia</title>
<p>In chicks and zebrafish, depletion of microglia prior to damage stunts the formation of MGPCs and neural regeneration in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fischer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). We have previously identified several factors that can “rescue” reprogramming in the absence of microglia, including NFκB activators, FGF2, and HBEGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">El-Hodiri et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Palazzo et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, we have found increased numbers of dying cells in NMDA-damaged retinas missing microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Todd et al., 2019</xref>). Given that S1P signaling is known to be involved in regulating inflammatory responses involving immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Obinata and Hla, 2019</xref>), we sought to determine whether the ablation of microglia/macrophages from the retina influenced the expression of S1P-related genes. Accordingly, we probed scRNA-seq libraries of normal and damaged retinas with and without microglia (saline and clodronate saline, respectively); the generation of these libraries has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">El-Hodiri et al., 2023</xref>), In short, eyes were treated with saline or clodronate liposomes at P6, treated with saline or NMDA at P10, and retinas were harvested at P11. Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fischer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Zelinka et al., 2012</xref>), a single intravitreal injection of clodronate-liposomes effectively eliminated &gt;99% of microglia from the retina (not shown). Analyses of scRNA-seq libraries of MG from undamaged and NMDA-damaged retinas with and without microglia showed that many components of S1P signaling were upregulated in resting MG in undamaged retinas (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7a-i</xref>). These genes included <italic>S1PR1, S1PR3, SPHK1, SGPL1</italic> and <italic>ASAH1</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7d-i</xref>). Notably, <italic>S1PR1</italic> expression was significantly diminished in undamaged retinas treated with clodronate (microglia-ablated) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7d,j</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>CERS6</italic> was significantly upregulated in MG and other retinal cells in undamaged saline clodronate retinas (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7j-m</xref>). In MG other S1P-related factors that were up- or downregulated with NMDA-treatment were not significantly affected by the ablation of microglia. However, in neuronal cells many factors (including <italic>SPGL1</italic>) normally upregulated with NMDA showed diminished levels of expression when microglia were absent, indicating that microglial reactivity is a driver of S1P metabolism in retinal neurons (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7k-m</xref>).</p>

<p>We next tested whether intravitreal injections of inhibitors to SPHK1 and S1PR1 rescued the deficit in MGPC proliferation and increased cell death in damaged retinas missing microglia. As described previously, delivery of clodronate liposomes prior to damage dramatically reduced numbers of EdU<sup>+</sup> MGPCs (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8a-d</xref>). However, injections of S1PR1 or SPHK1 inhibitors with and following NMDA significantly increased numbers of proliferating MGPCs in retinas missing microglia (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8a,b</xref>,c,d). However, the number of proliferating MGPCs in S1P inhibitor-treated retinas was significantly lower than in NMDA-treated retinas with activated microglia (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8b,c</xref>,d), indicating a partial rescue of MGPC proliferation. Reactive microglia appear to support neuroprotection in the mouse retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Todd et al., 2019</xref>), but exacerbate NMDA-induced cell death in the chick retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fischer et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, we found that there were differences in cell death between different S1PR1 inhibitors. Similar to retinas where microglia were present (supplemental Fig. 3a,c), there were significantly fewer TUNEL<sup>+</sup> nuclei in retinas treated with MT1303 compared to numbers seen in control clodronate/NMDA retinas (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8e</xref>).</p>

<p>However, NIBR0213-treated retinas without microglia contained higher numbers of TUNEL<sup>+</sup> nuclei (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8f</xref>), suggesting that the two S1PR1 inhibitors may have different specificities or toxicities. We found that SPHK1 inhibitor-treated retinas had less cell death compared to clodronate/NMDA retinas (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8g</xref>). In summary, these findings indicate that S1P-signaling is regulated by signals produced by microglia in the retina, and inhibition of S1P-signaling is partially rescues the proliferation of MGPCs and reduces cell death in microglia-depleted retinas.</p>
<p>In retinas where microglia have been ablated, levels of <italic>S1PR1</italic> may be transcriptionally maintained by microglia:MG communication in resting conditions. One of the top inferred ligand:receptor interactions identified between resting microglia and MG is TGFB1:CD109 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">El-Hodiri et al., 2023</xref>). Additionally, we have previously shown that TGFβ2 suppresses MGPC proliferation via pSmad3; inhibition of Smad3 by the small molecule inhibitor SIS3 stimulates MGPC proliferation in damaged retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Todd et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, we tested whether TGFβ/Smad3-signaling regulates levels of <italic>S1PR1</italic> in resting MG. We intravitreally delivered SIS3 to retinas at P7 and P8, then harvested retinas at P9. Consistent with earlier findings (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), numerous <italic>S1PR1</italic> FISH puncta were associated with Sox2<sup>+</sup> MG nuclei in the middle of the INL in undamaged retinas (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9a</xref>). SIS3 treatment significantly reduced numbers of <italic>S1PR1</italic> puncta in the INL of undamaged retinas (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9a,b</xref>). These findings suggest that TGFβ/Smad3-signaling between microglia and MG maintains high levels of <italic>S1PR1,</italic> and the proliferation-inducing effects of Smad3-inhibition may, in part, be mediated by downregulation of S1P-signaling in MG.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Pro-inflammatory signaling acts differentially across species to influence the regenerative capacity of MG after damage. It is important to understand how pro- inflammatory signaling fits into the complex network of pathways that control MG reprogramming. We provide evidence that S1P signaling is among the network of pro- inflammatory pathways the regulate the responses of MG to retinal damage. Here, we report patterns of expression of S1P signaling components and the effects of activating or inhibiting S1P signaling on regeneration in the chick retina. This study highlights the significant role of S1PR1, which is highly expressed in resting MG and non-neurogenic MGPCs, in suppressing damage-dependent MGPC proliferation and neuronal differentiation. Inhibition of S1PR1 promoted MGPC cell cycle re-entry and enhanced the number of regenerated amacrine-like cells after retinal damage. Inhibition of S1P synthesis produced similar effects to inhibiting S1PR1 to promote MGPC formation, and inhibiting S1P degradation produced similar effects to activating S1PR1 to inhibit MGPC formation.</p>
<sec id="s5a">
<title>Specificity of drugs</title>
<p>We report cell-specific effects of different agonists and antagonists that increase or decrease S1P-signaling that is centered on the MG. Since we compare cell-level effects within contralateral eyes wherein one retina is exposed to vehicle and the other is exposed to vehicle plus drug, it seems highly likely that the drugs are responsible for eliciting effects upon the MG. It seems unlikely that the cellular responses that we describe resulted from drugs acting at extra-retinal tissues which secondarily release factors that selectively impact the MG and elicit cellular responses that are inferred by the different agonists/antagonists and consistent with patterns of expression for S1P- related genes. For example, using scRNA seq and FISH, we find that <italic>S1PR1</italic> and <italic>S1PR3</italic> expression is predominant in MG. Thus, we expect that S1PR1/3 inhibitors directly act on MG and this is consistent with read-outs of cell signaling with injections of S1P in undamaged retinas. We show that <italic>SPHK1</italic> and <italic>SGPL1</italic>, which encode the enzymes that synthesize or degrade S1P, are expressed by different retinal cell types, including the MG. The efficacy of the drugs that target SPHK1 and SGPL1 was supported by findings that inhibition of S1P synthesis significantly decreased levels of S1P in normal retinas, whereas inhibition of S1P degradation increased levels of S1P in damaged retinas. Further, inhibition of SPHK1 (to decrease levels S1P) results in decreased levels of ATF3, pS6 (mTor) and pSMAD1/5/9 in MG, consistent with the notion that reduced levels of S1P in the retina impacts signaling at S1PR1/3 that are expressed by MG. Finally, we find similar cellular responses to chemically different agonists or antagonists that target the same protein, and we find opposite cellular responses to agonists and antagonists that target the same protein, which is expected to be complimentary if the drugs are acting specifically at the intended targets.</p>

<title>Regulation of S1PR1 Expression</title>
<p>The identity of factors that downregulate S1PR1 in MG in damaged retinas remains uncertain. Similarly, the identity of the factors that maintain S1PR1 expression in MG in undamaged resting retinas remains uncertain. Previous studies have found S1P production and S1P receptor activation are regulated by several growth factor receptors, including EGFR and VEGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Igarashi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Paugh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sukocheva et al., 2006</xref>). In the current study, FGF and insulin treatment were sufficient to downregulate <italic>S1PR1</italic> without retinal damage. Further, we found that TGFβ- dependent Smad3 activity stimulates <italic>S1PR1</italic> expression in resting retinas. These findings support prior <italic>in vitro</italic> studies which report that TGFβ treatment robustly drives upregulation of S1PR1-3 mRNA and protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). We have previously reported that TGFβ1 is expressed by microglia and TGFβ3 is expressed by neurons in resting retinas, and TGFβ-treatment in damaged retinas suppresses MGPC formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">El-Hodiri et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Todd et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, homeostatic TGFβ/Smad2/3 signaling between microglia and Muller glia may maintain <italic>S1PR1</italic> expression to promote quiescence in MG.</p>
<p>Several TFs have been found to influence <italic>S1PR1</italic> expression. KLF2, FOXF1, STAT1, and YAP have been found to directly bind to the S1PR1 promoter to positively regulate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Carlson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tao et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Xin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zheng et al., 2023</xref>). Notably, due to the sequestering of NFκB co-activators by KLF2, S1PR1 transcription is linked to the silencing of NFκB-related pro-inflammatory genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jha and Das, 2017</xref>). Conversely, S1PR1 activity has been shown to promote downstream NFκB-mediated gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Rostami et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, signaling through S1PR1 is part of an intricate bidirectional regulatory network that imparts influence through the NFκB pathway. Taken together with present findings, this is consistent with the reported roles of NFκB signaling in rapid microglia-mediated activation of MG and thereafter suppression of MGPC formation in damaged retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Palazzo et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>S1P synthesis in MG in damaged retinas may be a symptom of glial maturation and loss of the ability to reprogram into progenitor-like cells. Unlike MG in peripheral regions of retina, <italic>SPHK1</italic> is not increased in MG and inhibition of SPHK1 does not stimulate the formation of MGPCs in central regions of retina (supplemental Fig. 6).</p>
<p>Similarly, we have previously reported that Notch-related genes show different patterns of expression in the central and peripheral regions of the retina, and expression levels differentially change at P0, P7, and P21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Ghai et al., 2010</xref>). We reported that Notch inhibition reduced cell death and numbers of MGPCs in central regions but not peripheral regions. Because retinal differentiation occurs in a central-to-peripheral gradient and zones of MGPC proliferation become increasingly confined to the periphery in post-hatch birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fischer, 2005</xref>), we hypothesize that maturing MG undergo a shift in maturity or reprogramming competence in a central-to-peripheral gradient. Notch- and S1P-signaling may be components of this maturation process, but spatial transcriptomic analyses are needed to reveal key differences in signaling- pathway gene expression which confer a persistent competence for MG-mediate regeneration in the periphery of chick retinas.</p>

<title>S1PR1 activation and downstream inflammatory signaling</title>
<p>We and others have reported that inflammatory cytokine signaling is necessary for the initiation of Muller glia cell-cycle re-entry in chicks and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fischer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Silva et al., 2020</xref>), but persistent microglial reactivity and NFκB signaling suppress MG reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Palazzo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">White et al., 2017</xref>). In the current study, we report that S1PR1 activity suppresses MGPC proliferation and neurogenesis without impacting microglia. We report differential activation of Jak/Stat, mTOR, and Smad pathways in MG treated with exogenous S1P or SPHK1 inhibitor. These pathways are activated following NMDA-treatment and are necessary for MGPC formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Todd et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Todd et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zelinka et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>S1PR1 inhibitors and NFκB inhibitors produce similar effects on MGPC proliferation in damaged retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Palazzo et al., 2020</xref>). In the absence of microglia, S1PR1 inhibition promoted damage-dependent MGPC formation but application of an NFκB <italic>activator</italic> was found to increase MGPCs. A comparison of these findings may support the notion that NFκB signaling must be transiently activated to initiate dedifferentiation but must be later suppressed to release the glial phenotype and permit cell-cycle reentry. It is probable that S1PR1 activation potentiates downstream NFκB signaling to suppress regeneration, but we could not confirm this in the current study; we have not identified antibodies to NFκB pathway components that produce plausible patterns of expression in chick retinas.</p>
<p>Although S1P signaling has been shown to activate the NFκB pathway, we find distinct differences between the impacts of S1P- and NFκB -signaling on cell signaling in MG, neuronal differentiation of the progeny of MGPCs and neuronal survival in damaged retinas. In the current study we demonstrate that intravitreal injections of S1P activate mTor (pS6) and Jak/Stat3 (pStat3) signaling in MG. Further, inhibition of S1P synthesis decreased ATF3, mTor (pS6) and pSmad1/5/9 levels in activated MG in damaged retinas. By contrast, inhibition of NFκB -signaling in damaged chick retinas did not impact the above-mentioned cell signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Palazzo et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>However, we cannot exclude the possibility of cross-talk between NFκB and different cell signaling pathways. Further, inhibition of NFκB -signaling potently decreases numbers of dying cells and increases numbers of surviving ganglion cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Palazzo et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with these findings, a TNF orthologue, which activates NFκB- signaling, exacerbates cell death in damage chick retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Palazzo et al., 2020</xref>). By contrast, 5 different drugs targeting S1P-signaling had no effect on numbers of dying cells and only one S1PR1 inhibitor modestly decreased numbers of dying cells (current study). Although different inhibitors of NFkB-signaling suppressed the proliferation of microglia in damaged retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Palazzo et al., 2020</xref>), all of the S1P-targeting drugs had no effect upon the proliferation of microglia (current study). In addition, inhibition of NFκB does not influence the neurogenic potential of MGPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Palazzo et al., 2020</xref>), whereas inhibition of S1P receptors or inhibition of S1P synthesis increased the differentiation of amacrine-like neurons in damaged retinas (current study). Collectively, our findings indicate that S1P-signaling through S1PR1 and S1PR3 in MG has distinct effects upon cell signaling pathways, neuronal regeneration and cell survival compared to the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines and NFκB-signaling in the retina.</p>

<title>S1P and neuronal differentiation</title>
<p>We found that inhibitors to SPHK1, S1PR1 or S1PR1/3 increased numbers of cells that differentiated as amacrine-like cells that expressed HuC/D. However, none the progeny of MGPCs differentiated into cells that expressed calretinin (a subset of amacrine cells) or visinin (photoreceptors). There is currently no evidence that MGPCs in the chick retina can produce progeny that differentiate into photoreceptors. By contrast, we recently reported that inhibition of ID factors enhances neuronal differentiation of calretinin-expressing MGPC-derived cells (Taylor et al., 2024a).</p>
<p>Calretinin may be expressed by a subset of amacrine cells not specified by inhibition of S1P receptors. Alternatively, the progeny of MGPC do not fully differentiate to the point where calretinin is expressed when S1P signaling is diminished. Control over the differentiation of MGPC progeny is regulated by different cell signaling pathways. For example, activation of retinoic acid receptors stimulates neuronal differentiation (Todd et al., 2018), whereas signaling through Notch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Ghai et al., 2010</xref>; Hayes et al., 2007), glucocorticoid receptors (Gallina et al, 2014), and Jak/Stat3 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Todd et al., 2016</xref>) suppress neuronal differentiation. It is possible that activation of S1P receptors acts through Jak/Stat3 or possibly NFκB to suppress the neuronal differentiation of MGPC progeny. Our data indicate that <italic>S1PR1</italic> is downregulated by activated MG and proliferating MGPCs. However, <italic>S1PR3</italic> is upregulated in MGPCs and, thus, it is likely that signaling through S1PR3 mediates the cell fate specification of MGPC progeny.</p>

<title>S1P signaling &amp; neuroprotection</title>
<p>The current study provides evidence that inhibition of the S1P pathway supports neuron survival in the damaged chick retinas. In retinas where microglia were absent, we found that SPHK1 inhibitor PF543 and S1PR1 inhibitor MT1303 alleviated retinal cell death. In retinas where microglia were present, only MT1303 significantly reduced numbers of dying cells. As mentioned previously, NFκB-related genes are regulated in a similar pattern to S1P-related genes; inhibiting NFκB signaling supports inner retinal cell and retinal ganglion cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Palazzo et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, we recently reported that Inhibitor of DNA-binding 4 (ID4) factor is transiently upregulated in MG after NMDA and may support the survival of inner retinal neurons (Taylor et al., 2024a). Other factors such as fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) and Midkine are also rapidly upregulated in activated MG and these factors are neuroprotective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Campbell et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Campbell et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, one of the S1PR1 inhibitors, NIBR0213, <italic>increased</italic> cell death in damaged retinas where microglia were absent. This disparity might be explained by differences in inhibitor specificity. MT1303 is a potent functional antagonist which induces receptor internalization and degradation, whereas NIB0213 is slightly less potent and does not drive internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Quancard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Shimano et al., 2019</xref>). Further, MT1303 is a prodrug (requiring phosphorylation) and has an elimination half-life of several days, whereas direct-acting NIBR0213 has a half-life of a few hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Quancard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Shimano et al., 2019</xref>). Studies in mice suggest that sphingosine kinase and receptor inhibition ameliorate the death of retinal ganglion cells following NMDA-treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Basavarajappa et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Nakamura et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, studies have described the neuroprotective effects of fingolimod (S1PR1 modulator) in models of glaucoma in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shiwani et al., 2021</xref>). However, we did not find any effect of fingolimod on cell death.</p>

<title>S1P activity in retinal neurons and microglia</title>
<p>Although <italic>S1PR1</italic> expression was predominantly observed in MG, S1P signaling components were not restricted to these glial cells. We found that SPHK1, which catalyzes the synthesis of S1P from sphingosine, was expressed by cells scattered across different types of retinal cells. Further, SGPL1, which catalyzes the degradation of S1P, had dynamic patterns of expression following NMDA-treatment in different types of retinal cells, including amacrine cells and microglia. These finding suggest that S1P is secreted by these cells to bind to S1P receptors on MG. S1P:S1PR paracrine signaling has been observed between neural cells and astrocytes and is hypothesized to be necessary for proper astrocyte morphogenesis during synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alam et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Singh et al., 2022</xref>). Another possibility is that S1P produced by SPHK2. However, SPHK2 is not annotated in the <italic>Gallus gallus</italic> genome, and we could not identify any genes that aligned significantly with <italic>SPHK2</italic> from other bird species. Further, this gene was not expressed at significant levels in scRNA libraries created from mouse, zebrafish, or pig retinas. A final possibility is that changes in S1P metabolism in retinal neurons are a byproduct of the recycling of other sphingolipid molecules in response to NMDA damage.</p>

<title>The sphingolipid “rheostat” in the retina</title>
<p>S1P synthesis is dependent on the availability of ceramides and ceramide- related enzymes like acid ceramidase (ASAH1). Whereas S1P signaling triggers cell cycle re-entry, ceramide accumulation drives cellular senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Simón et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, the protective effects of S1P are countered by ceramides, which activate intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Simón et al., 2019</xref>).. There is significant evidence that ceramide production must be tightly restricted by acid ceramidase, which converts ceramide into sphingosine, for retinal neurons to survive excitotoxic and hypoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lewandowski et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Nakamura et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Sugano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Yu et al., 2019</xref>). Multiple groups have found that Cer 16:0 and CERS5 are markers for astrocytic inflammation and that astrocytic ceramide production is stimulated by TNF-α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">de Wit et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kimura et al., 2000</xref>). In the current study, we observed dynamic regulation of <italic>ASAH1</italic> expression after damage in the chick retina.</p>
<p>However, application of a small molecule inhibitor to acid ceramidase had no significant effect on numbers of MGPCs or dying cells (supplemental Fig. 4). Many studies have described the effects of ceramides on neuron survival, but additional research is needed to investigate the functional role of ceramides as part of the inflammatory and apoptotic signaling cascades in glial cells.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In summary, our findings indicate that S1P:S1PR1 signaling plays significant roles in the initiation of MG dedifferentiation, formation of proliferating of MGPCs and specification of progeny toward a neurogenic identity. Our findings suggest that S1PR1 activity maintains quiescence in MG and acts to drive activate toward a resting phenotype. The expression of S1PR1 is regulated by microglia, neuronal damage and TGFβ/Smad3 signaling. Inhibitors to S1P synthesis or S1PR1 signaling promoted MGPC cell cycle re-entry and enhanced neural differentiation. Interestingly, patterns of expression of S1P-related genes are highly conserved across vertebrates, namely high levels of expression of S1PR1 in the MG in chick, fish and human retinas. Activation of S1PR1 in MG is one of the key pro-inflammatory signaling pathways that control glial responses to neuronal damage, microglial activation, and the ability of MG to reprogram into neurogenic progenitor-like cells.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study investigates the signaling pathways regulating retinal regeneration. <bold>Convincing</bold> evidence shows that the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling pathway is inhibited following retinal injury. Small-molecule activators and inhibitors support a model in which S1P signaling must be inhibited to generate Müller glial progenitor cells-a key step in retinal regeneration. The presented results support the major conclusions. However, whether the drug treatments directly or indirectly affect the Müller cells remains unclear.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study shows that the pro-inflammatory S1P signaling regulates the responses of muller glial cells to damage. The authors describe the expression of S1P signaling components. Using agonist and antagonist of the pathways they also investigate their effect on the de-differentiation and proliferation of Muller glial cells in damaged retina of postnatal chicks. They show that S1PR1 is highly expressed in resting MG and non-neurogenic MGPCs. This receptor suppresses the proliferation and neuronal activity promotes MGPC cell cycle re-entry and enhanced the number of regenerated amacrine-like cells after retinal damage. The formation of MGPCs in damaged retinas is impaired in the absence of microglial cells. This study further shows that ablation of microglial cells from the retina increases the expression of S1P-related genes in MG, whereas inhibition of S1PR1 and SPHK1 partially rescues the formation of MGPCs in damaged retinas depleted of microglia. The studies also show that expression of S1P-related genes is conserved in fish and human retinas.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is well-conducted study, with convincing images and statistically relevant data</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In a previous study, the authors have shown that S1P is upstream of NF-κB signaling (Palazzo et al. 2020; 2022, 2023). Although S1P and NF-κB signaling have overlapping effects, the authors here provide evidence for S1P specific effects, adding some new information to the field.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) metabolic and signaling genes are expressed highly in retinal Müller glia (MG) cells. This study tested how S1P signaling regulates glial phenotype, dedifferentiation of, reprogramming into proliferating MG-derived progenitor cells (MGPCs), and neuronal differentiation of the progeny of MGPCs using in vivo chick retina. Major techniques used are Sc-RNASeq and immunohistochemistry to determine the gene expression and proliferation of MG cells that co-label with signaling antibodies or mRNA FISH following treating the in vivo eyes with various S1P signaling antagonists, agonists, and signal modulators. The major conclusions drawn are supported by the results presented. However, the methodology they have used to modulate the S1P pathway using various chemical drugs raises questions about the outcomes and whether those are the real effects of S1P receptor modulation or S1P synthesis inhibition.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- Use of elaborated single-cell RNAseq expression data.</p>
<p>
- Use of FISH for S1P receptors and kinase as a good quality antibody is not available.</p>
<p>
- Use of EdU assay in combination with IHC</p>
<p>
- Comparison with human and Zebrafish Sc-RNA data</p>

<p>&quot;Notably, SPHK2 does not directly contribute to levels of secreted S1P (Thuy et al., 2022), nor is it annotated in the chick genome. S1P can be exported from cells by a transporter (MFSD2A and SPNS2) or converted to sphingosine by a phosphatase (SGPP1) (Fig. 2a). Levels of sphingosine are increased by ASAH1 by conversion of ceramide or decreased by CERS2/5/6 by conversion to ceramide (Fig. 2a). S1P is known to activate G-protein coupled receptors, S1PR1 through S1PR5 (Fig. 2a). S1PRs are known to activate different cell signaling pathways including MAPK and PI3K/mTor, and crosstalk with pro-inflammatory pathways such as NFκB (Fig. 2a) (Hu et al., 2020).&quot;</p>

<p>Please correct the typo in the following sentence (Fid.)</p>
<p>&quot;S1PR1 was most prominently expressed by resting MG and MG returning to a resting state, whereas S1PR3 was detected in relatively few scattered cells in clusters of MG, ganglion cells, horizontal cells, bipolar cells, amacrine cells, photoreceptors, oligodendrocytes, microglia and NIRG cells (Fid. 1d).</p>
