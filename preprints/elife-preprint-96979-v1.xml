<title>Abstract</title><p>Activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) is one of three endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane stress sensors that mediate the unfolded protein response (UPR). Despite its crucial role in long-term ER stress adaptation, regulation of ATF6 alpha (⍺) signalling remains poorly understood, possibly because its activation involves ER-to-Golgi and nuclear trafficking. Here, we generated an ATF6⍺/IRE1 dual UPR reporter CHO-K1 cell line and performed an unbiased genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis screen to systematically profile genetic factors that specifically contribute to ATF6⍺ signalling in the presence and absence of ER stress. The screen identified both anticipated and new candidate genes that regulate ATF6⍺ activation. Among these, calreticulin (CRT), a key ER luminal chaperone, selectively repressed ATF6⍺ signalling: Cells lacking CRT constitutively activated a BiP::sfGFP ATF6⍺-dependent reporter, had higher BiP levels and an increased rate of trafficking and processing of ATF6⍺. Purified CRT interacted with the luminal domain of ATF6⍺ <italic>in vitro</italic> and the two proteins co-immunoprecipitated from cell lysates. CRT depletion exposed a negative feedback loop implicating ATF6⍺ in repressing IRE1 activity basally and overexpression of CRT reversed this repression. Our findings indicate that CRT, beyond its known role as a chaperone, also serves as an ER repressor of ATF6⍺ to selectively regulate one arm of the UPR.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and its associated chaperones, constitutes the major cellular compartment for the synthesis, folding, and quality control of secretory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sun and Brodsky, 2019</xref>). An imbalance between synthesis and folding can lead to ER stress, potentially resulting in ER dysfunction and pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wang and Kaufman, 2016</xref>). To restore cellular homeostasis, adaptive pathways, collectively known as the unfolded protein response (UPR), are activated. The UPR is coordinated by three known ER stress transducers: IRE1, PERK and ATF6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). Of the three arms of the UPR, the mechanisms that govern ER stress-dependent ATF6 activation remain the least well understood, even though ATF6 mediates much of the ER-stress-induced changes in gene expression observed in vertebrates. Thus, ATF6 is specialised in the regulation of quality control proteins in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adachi et al., 2008</xref>) and loss of ATF6 impairs survival upon ER stress in cellular and animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wu et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>ATF6 is a type II transmembrane ER glycoprotein containing an N-terminal portion comprising its basic leucine zipper (b-ZIP), DNA-binding and transactivation domains and a C-terminal ER luminal domain (LD) that senses stress and regulates ATF6⍺ activity. Vertebrates have two isoforms: ATF6α and ATF6β. The ATF6α isoform dominates the regulation of UPR target genes in mammalian cells and is the focus of this study. Unlike IRE1 and PERK, which remain in the ER after UPR activation, ATF6 translocates from the ER to the Golgi, where it is sequentially cleaved by two serine protease, site-1 (S1P) and site-2 (S2P) proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Haze et al., 1999</xref>) to release its soluble active N-cytosolic domain (N-ATF6⍺) that is further translocated into the nucleus. There, N-ATF6α acts as a potent but short-live transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">George et al., 2020</xref>) that binds ER stress response elements (ERSE-I and -II) in the promoter regions of UPR target genes in complex with the general transcription factor NF-Y and YY1 to upregulate the expression of a large number of ER chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Li et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Yoshida et al., 2000</xref>). Among those, the gene encoding the ER Hsp70 chaperone BiP (<italic>GRP78</italic>) has been well documented as an important ATF6α target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adachi et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>At ER level, it has been proposed that ATF6⍺ is retained by its association with BiP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Shen et al., 2002</xref>), yet the existence of additional factors influencing its ER localisation remains uncertain. Redox regulation has also been proposed to keep ATF6⍺ in the ER as a mixture of monomeric and multimeric disulphide-linked forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Nadanaka et al., 2007</xref>) that upon ER stress are reduced by protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) family members (such as ERp18 or PDIA5), promoting the transit of a reduced monomeric ATF6⍺ population (Higa et al., 2014; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Oka et al., 2019</xref>). COPII-coated vesicles have been implicated in the trafficking of ATF6⍺ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Schindler and Schekman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lynch et al., 2012</xref>) and the ATF6⍺_LD’s N-glycosylation state has also been proposed to influence its ER trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hong et al., 2004</xref>), yet the details of these processed remain incompletely understood. Furthermore, it is widely recognised that a key step of ATF6⍺ activation occurs in the Golgi, the site of proteolytic processing. This is reflected in the inability of cells lacking S2P to trigger BiP transcription in response to ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Ye et al., 2000</xref>). Hence, although there is a relatively clear understanding of the events triggering ATF6⍺ cleavage and activation upon reaching the Golgi, much remains unknown about the factors influencing ATF6⍺ regulation in the ER.</p>
<p>ATF6⍺ signalling also involves crosstalk with the IRE1 pathway. This is partly mediated by direct heterodimerisation of N-ATF6⍺ with XBP1s the active, spliced form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Yamamoto et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">2004</xref>). However, the relationship between the ATF6⍺ and IRE1 pathway is complex: (i) XBP1 and IRE1 genes are transcriptional targets of activated ATF6⍺ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yoshida et al., 2001</xref>), (ii) XBP1s and IRE1 have some different target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Shoulders et al., 2013</xref>), (iii) and ATF6⍺ activity can also repress IRE1 signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Walter et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we established an ATF6⍺/IRE1 dual UPR reporter cellular model to conduct an unbiased genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen focussed on ATF6⍺. Complemented by bioinformatic analysis, post-screen hit validation using targeted gene editing and <italic>in vitro</italic> biophysical assays we report on a comprehended analysis of a complex signalling pathway.</p>

<title>A dual UPR reporter cell line to monitor ATF6⍺ and IRE1 activity</title>
<p>In vertebrates, the transcriptional activation of BiP is predominantly governed by ATF6⍺ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adachi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Adamson et al., 2016</xref>). To dynamically monitor ATF6⍺ activity in live cells, a “landing pad” cassette, containing recombination sites and expressing the <italic>Cricetulus griseus</italic> (<italic>cg</italic>) BiP promoter region fused with a super folder green fluorescent protein (BiP::sfGFP), was targeted to the <italic>ROSA26</italic> safe-harbour locus of Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1) using CRISPR/Cas9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gaidukov et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental S1A</xref>). These cells also carried an integrated XBP1s::mCherry reporter transgene monitoring the IRE1 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Harding et al., 2019</xref>). Flow cytometry analysis of these ATF6⍺/IRE1 dual UPR reporter cells (referred as <italic>XC45-6S</italic>) treated with ER stress-inducing agents such as tunicamycin (which inhibits N-glycosylation), 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (which inhibits glycolysis), or thapsigargin (which depletes ER calcium), revealed time-dependent activation of both UPR arms with a broad dynamic range (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>, top panel, and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental S1B</xref>).</p>

<p>Disruption of endogenous <italic>cgATF6⍺</italic> in <italic>XC45-6S</italic> cells by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing abolished the responsiveness of the BiP::sfGFP reporter to ER stress and derepressed IRE1 signalling, both basally and in response to ER stress. These observations are consistent with ATF6⍺’s obligatory role in BiP expression and with findings that IRE1 signalling is repressed by ATF6⍺ activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Walter et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>To further validate these UPR reporters, cells were subjected to tunicamycin treatment in the presence of Ceapin-A7 (a small molecule that blocks ATF6⍺ activation by tethering it to the lysosome) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gallagher et al., 2016</xref>) or an S1P inhibitor (PF429242) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hawkins et al., 2008</xref>). Ceapin-A7 effectively blocked the activation of the ATF6⍺ fluorescent reporter, whereas the S1P inhibitor partially attenuated the BiP::sfGFP signal in stressed cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental S1C</xref>). The selective IRE1 inhibitor 4μ8C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cross et al., 2012</xref>), did not affect the ATF6⍺-dependent BiP::sfGFP reporter under ER stress conditions, but blocked the IRE1-dependent XBP1s::mCherry reporter (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental S1D</xref>). Collectively, these observations confirm that the dual UPR reporter <italic>XC45-6S</italic> cell line enables independent monitoring of ATF6⍺ and IRE1 activities, making it well-suited for identifying additional modulators of ATF6⍺ signalling by high-throughput techniques.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out screens to profile ATF6⍺ signalling</title>
<p>To identify regulators of ATF6⍺, a library of pooled lentiviral single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting 20,680 predicted protein-coding genes in CHO cells, with ∼ 6 sgRNAs per gene, was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ordonez et al., 2020</xref>). Transduction of the <italic>XC45-6S</italic> ATF6⍺/IRE1 dual UPR reporter cells was performed at a coverage of ∼ 640X, with a multiplicity of infection of 0.3, intentionally set low to disfavour acquisition of more than one sgRNA by any one cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Shalem et al., 2014</xref>). Non-transduced cells were purged by puromycin selection, and the pool of transduced cells was expanded for 10 days to favour gene editing and the establishment of loss-of-function phenotypes.</p>
<p>To systematically identify genes regulating the ATF6⍺ transcriptional programme, two positive selection screens were conducted in parallel: a “loss-of-ATF6⍺ function screen” under ER stress conditions to identify activators/enhancers of ATF6⍺, and a “gain-of-ATF6⍺ function screen” under basal conditions to identify ATF6⍺ repressors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). In the ATF6⍺ <italic>activator screen</italic>, cells were stressed by exposure to 2-Deoxy-D-glucose for 18 h before fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS). Cells at the lowest 2% of BiP::sfGFP signal, with preserved IRE1 signalling (BiP::sfGFP<sup>low</sup>; XBP1s::mCherry<sup>high</sup>), were selected for further analysis. The search for genes whose inactivation de-represses ATF6⍺ (ATF6⍺ <italic>repressor screen</italic>) was conducted in the absence of ER stress. Here, cells exhibiting a constitutively active ATF6⍺ reporter but only basal levels of the IRE1 reporter (BiP::sfGFP<sup>high</sup>; XBP1s::mCherry<sup>low</sup>) were selected for further analysis. Sorted cells from both screens underwent two rounds of progressive enrichment through cell culture expansion and phenotypic selection by sorting. As a result, a progressive increase in the proportion of BiP:sfGFP<sup>low</sup> or BiP:sfGFP<sup>high</sup> cells occurred in the respective screen (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental S2A</xref> and S2B).</p>
<p>The integrated sgRNAs were amplified from genomic DNA, and their abundance in the enriched populations after one or two rounds of sorting was estimated by deep sequencing and compared to a reference sample of transduced and unsorted population. MAGeCK bioinformatics analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2014</xref>) was used to determine sgRNA sequence enrichment, establishing the corresponding ranking of targeted genes (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>; see GEO accession number: GSE254745) and quality controls (QC) measures (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental S2C</xref> and S2D). Both screens were conducted at least in duplicate for all conditions.</p>

<title>Expected and new candidate genes that contribute to ATF6⍺ activation</title>
<p>MAGeCK-based analysis of sgRNAs enriched in cells with attenuated ATF6⍺ signalling and intact activity of the IRE1 reporter, revealed that those targeting S1P and S2P proteases (encoding by the <italic>MBTPS1</italic> and <italic>MBTPS2</italic> genes) were the two most enriched genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>), validating the experimental methodology. Gene Ontology (GO) cluster analysis of the 100 most significantly enriched targeted genes revealed up to 19 enriched pathways (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplemental S3A</xref>), with the top two pathways highlighted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> being closely related to ATF6⍺ signalling.</p>
<p>We focused our attention on targeted genes that could act upstream to find early regulatory events of ATF6⍺. Therefore, targeted genes that were likely to act downstream and impact on the cleaved ATF6⍺ form (N-ATF6⍺) were dismissed, including the <italic>SP2</italic> transcription factor, which shares the binding site with NF-Y (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Völkel et al., 2015</xref>), and also genes involved in nuclear import, such as <italic>NUP50</italic> and <italic>SEH1L</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplemental S3A</xref>). Similar consideration was applied to <italic>PRMT8</italic>, as the family member <italic>PRMT1</italic> has been shown to enhance ATF6⍺ transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baumeister et al., 2005</xref>). Additionally, guides targeting <italic>IGFR1</italic> and <italic>CXXC1</italic> were also dismissed as likely affecting ER proteostasis indirectly <italic>via</italic> cellular growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pfaffenbach et al., 2012</xref>). Guides targeting the genes encoding the ER resident proteins <italic>SEC61A1</italic>, <italic>SEC61B</italic> (both components of the translocon machinery) and the <italic>DNAJB9</italic>/ERDj4 co-chaperone were highly enriched. However, given their roles in selectively regulating IRE1 signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Adamson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Shoulders et al., 2013</xref>), we deemed their identification to reflect a bias towards IRE1 activators arising from the selection scheme for ATF6⍺<sup>low</sup> and IRE1<sup>high</sup> cells.</p>
<p>One of the genes that could plausibly play a proximal role and act upstream on ATF6⍺ activation was the ubiquitous Golgi-localised protease FURIN (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Like S1P, FURIN belongs to the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Nakayama, 1997</xref>)and is thus poised to act at the level of ATF6⍺ proteolytic processing. All six sgRNAs targeting <italic>FURIN</italic> were enriched in the BiP:sfGFP<sup>low</sup> cells, a level of enrichment similar to that observed to the established ATF6⍺ regulators <italic>MBTPS1</italic> (S1P) and <italic>MBTPS2</italic> (S2P) (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplemental S3B</xref>). The genotype-phenotype relationship suggested by the screen was also observed upon targeting <italic>FURIN</italic> in ATF6⍺/IRE1 dual reporter cells, as both pools of targeted cells and an individual clone had diminished responsiveness of BiP:sfGFP to ER stress (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplemental S4A</xref> left and middle panels). Furthermore, the S1P inhibitor more effectively attenuated the BiP::sfGFP reporter in <italic>FURIN</italic>Δ cells compared to wild-type cells (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplemental S4A</xref> right panel, S4B and S4C).</p>
<p>These observations raised the possibility of redundant roles of FURIN and S1P in activating ATF6⍺ by cleaving its luminal domain. However, ATF6⍺_LD expressed and purified from mammalian cells, failed to serve as a substrate for FURIN in vitro (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplemental S4D</xref>), suggesting instead that FURIN’s role in regulating ATF6⍺ signalling is indirect.</p>

<title>Calreticulin and an interconnected gene network repress ATF6⍺</title>
<p>To identify genes that basally repress ATF6⍺, a similar MAGeCK-based data analysis was applied to the targeted genes enriched in cells that selectively activated the ATF6⍺ reporter under basal conditions. GO analysis of the 100 most significantly enriched genes established an interconnected network highlighting signalling processes including the calreticulin (CRT)/calnexin (CNX) cycle, N-glycan biosynthesis, ERAD and COPI-dependent Golgi-to-ER retrograde traffic (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplemental S3C</xref>). Among these, the top 10 genes included CRT, components of the dolichol-phosphate mannose (DPM) synthase complex, such as <italic>DPM3</italic>, <italic>DPM2</italic> and <italic>DPM1</italic> involved in the N-glycosylation process, and ERAD components, such as <italic>UBE2G2, SEL1L</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>Because these four pathways potentially activate all three branches of the UPR, genes previously identified in genome-wide screens to modulate IRE1 or PERK functionality were excluded from further analysis (e.g. <italic>TMED10, SEL1L, FAB2, SYVN1, PDI6</italic>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1H</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Adamson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Panganiban et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). Of the remaining genes, we focused on those encoding proteins localised in the ER lumen or Golgi, which could act as specific proximal regulators of ATF6⍺. Among these, CRT, an abundant luminal ER lectin chaperone, caught our attention (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1H</xref>). Notably, although CRT promotes the folding of ER-synthesised glycoproteins <italic>via</italic> the CRT/CNX cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lamriben et al., 2016</xref>), its ER transmembrane homolog CNX was not identified in the screen.

<title>Constitutive activation of ATF6⍺ in cells lacking calreticulin</title>
<p>To explore <italic>CRT</italic>’s role in ATF6⍺ regulation, <italic>CRT</italic> was targeted by CRISPR/Cas9 in wild-type <italic>XC45-6S</italic> dual UPR reporter cells. <italic>CRT</italic>-targeted cells exhibited large populations of BiP::sfGFP<sup>high</sup>; XBP1s::mCherry<sup>low</sup> cells, mirroring the results of the initial screen.

<title>Calreticulin represses Golgi-trafficking and processing of ATF6⍺</title>
<p>Considering the crucial role of trafficking in ATF6⍺ activation, we next investigated whether depletion of CRT affected the stress-induced localisation of ATF6⍺ by comparing the subcellular localisation of ATF6⍺ in parental and <italic>CRT</italic>Δ cells. As trafficking is closely linked to proteolytic processing, wild-type ATF6⍺ does not accumulate in the Golgi of stressed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Shen et al., 2002</xref>). To stabilise ATF6⍺ molecules reaching the Golgi, a CHO-K1 cell line stably expressing a GFP-tagged version of <italic>cg</italic>ATF6⍺_LD lacking S1P and S2P cleavage sites (GFP-ATF6⍺_LD<sup>S1P,S2Pmut</sup>) was engineered (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). In non-stressed cells, GFP-ATF6⍺_LD<sup>S1P,S2Pmut</sup> was distributed in a prominent reticular ER pattern with only a minor fraction co-localising with the Scarlet-tagged Giantin Golgi localisation marker. Exposure to the rapidly acting ER stress-inducing agent Dithiothreitol (DTT), increased the Golgi pool at the expense of the ER pool (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>); an expected outcome validating GFP-ATF6⍺_LD<sup>S1P,S2Pmut</sup> as a sentinel for the ATF6⍺ protein. Compared to parental cells, GFP-ATF6⍺_LD<sup>S1P,S2Pmut</sup> showed significantly more Golgi co-localisation in <italic>CRTΔ</italic> cells under basal conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). These results were in line with our previous flow cytometry observations and suggested that CRT contributes to ER retention of ATF6⍺, either directly or indirectly.</p>

The functionality of this probe was confirmed by treatment with DTT that resulted in the appearance of a prominent faster-migration band in SDS-PAGE, compatible with the processed S2P-cleaved ATF6⍺ (N-ATF6⍺) form, and depletion of the precursor form (ATF6⍺-P) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>.1, lane 8).

<title>Calreticulin depletion exposes a negative feedback loop by which ATF6⍺ represses IRE1</title>
<p>Given the well-established interplay between the ATF6⍺ and IRE1 branches of the UPR, we sought to assess whether the constitutive activation of ATF6⍺ observed in <italic>CRTΔ</italic> clones could be a contributing factor to the conspicuous downregulation of IRE1 activity. Through RT-PCR and gel electrophoresis, IRE1-mediated XBP1 mRNA splicing in parental cells and <italic>CRTΔ</italic> clones was compared. Under basal conditions, unspliced mRNA levels (XBP1u) were significantly higher in <italic>CRTΔ</italic> clones (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref> left bar graph), consistent with the role of N-ATF6⍺ in the transcriptional activation of XBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yoshida et al., 2001</xref>). In addition, compared to parental cells, <italic>CRTΔ</italic> cells exhibited a smaller fraction of spliced XBP1 mRNA (XBP1s) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref> right bar graph), consistent with the lower IRE1 activity measured by a XBP1s::mCherry reporter.</p>

<p>IRE1 activity is closely tied to its phosphorylation state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Shamu and Walter, 1996</xref>), therefore IRE1⍺-phosphorylation (IRE1⍺-P) levels were compared in parental and <italic>CRT</italic>Δ clones. Accordingly, <italic>CRT</italic>Δ cells exhibited lower levels of stress-induced phosphorylation of their endogenous IRE1 protein and slightly reduced total IRE1 levels (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>). These results supported earlier findings that IRE1 signalling is repressed by ATF6⍺ activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Walter et al., 2018</xref>). However, the defect in IRE1 activity wrought by CRT depletion was partial, as in the presence of ER stress, all genotypes exhibited a comparable increase in XBP1s (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study reports on a comprehensive and unbiased genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-based knockout screen dedicated to discovering regulators of ATF6⍺. Whereas previous high-throughput studies have broadly studied modulators of the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Adamson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Jonikas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Panganiban et al., 2019</xref>) we designed an ATF6⍺/IRE1 dual UPR reporter cell line to selectively detect regulators of ATF6⍺. Although a connection between CRT and ATF6⍺ was proposed previously based on an interaction between overexpressed proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hong et al., 2004</xref>), our study utilises unbiased genetic tools and manipulation of endogenous proteins to establish CRT’s role as a selective repressor of endogenous ATF6⍺ signalling, mapping its function in retaining ATF6⍺ in the ER.</p>
<p>It is notable that, though the screen identified well-known regulators of ATF6⍺ processing (including S1P, S2P and NF-Y, and thus validating the experimental approach), only a limited number of new genes that contribute to ATF6⍺ signalling emerged from the screen. Despite the biochemical evidence for the role of COPII-coated vesicles and the oligomeric state of ATF6⍺ in its activation, no cluster of genes involved in COPII vesicular transport or PDIs were found among the most enriched pathways. Nor were any counterparts to SCAP or INSIG, regulators of ER-to-Golgi trafficking of the related SREBP proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Yang et al., 2002</xref>), identified. This might reflect essentiality of the genes involved or redundancy amongst them. Cell type specificity may also be implicated in failure to identify components that are unimportant to ATF6⍺ activation in CHO-K1 cells.</p>
<p>The screen implicated two components of the nuclear pore complex (<italic>NUP50</italic> and <italic>SEH1L</italic>) in ATF6⍺ pathway activity. While it might be tempting to consider a role for these components in the nuclear translocation of the processed soluble ATF6⍺ N-terminal domain, there is no reason to think it would be regulatory, as it operates downstream of ER stress-regulated trafficking and processing events.</p>
<p>In addition to the identified S1P and S2P proteases, the <italic>screen for ATF6⍺ activators</italic> identified FURIN, a Golgi-localised protease belonging to the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase family (like S1P protease) responsible for proteolytic activation of a wide array of precursor proteins within the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Braun and Sauter, 2019</xref>). FURIN deletion synergised with S1P inhibitors in attenuating ATF6⍺ signalling. Additionally, ATF6⍺_LD has a conserved region (<underline>R</underline>T<underline>K</underline>S<underline>RR</underline>) related to the FURIN cleavage motif (generally described as R-X-R-X-[K/R]-R↓ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Nakayama, 1997</xref>) (Supplemental Fig S4E). It has been suggested that S1P’s role in activation is to reduce the size of ATF6⍺’s_LD, thereby promoting S2P cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Shen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Ye et al., 2000</xref>). FURIN cleavage could contribute to such a process and account for partial redundancy between S1P inhibition and FURIN depletion observed here. Nonetheless, <italic>in vitro</italic> FURIN failed to cleave the ATF6⍺_LD. These findings collectively suggest that FURIN may function as an indirect enhancer of ATF6⍺ signalling, perhaps by setting up conditions in a post-ER compartment that favours ATF6⍺ cleavage and activation.</p>
<p>The <italic>screen for ATF6⍺ repressors</italic> revealed a substantial enrichment of genes involved in glycoprotein metabolism. Among that cluster, the most notable hit, not previously identified in other high-throughput UPR screens, was CRT, a well-characterised soluble ER chaperone with a key role in protein quality control. Intriguingly, its ER-membrane counterpart, CNX, did not emerge in our screen, despite the inclusion of six sgRNA targeting CNX in the CRISPR library. This suggests a special role of CRT in the regulation of ATF6⍺, at least in CHO-K1 cells. CRT may not be the only repressor of ATF6⍺; this role may be shared by BiP, which has been widely suggested to suppress all the three branches of the UPR under basal conditions. Nevertheless, because of BiP’s pervasive effects on ER proteostasis and its role in direct repression of the IRE1 branch, its role in regulating ATF6 might have been missed by this screen.</p>
<p>Disruption of CRT in the <italic>XC45-6S</italic> dual ATF6⍺/IRE1 UPR reporter cell line selectively activated the ATF6⍺ pathway reporter under basal conditions. This activation was accompanied by an increased baseline trafficking of ATF6⍺ from the ER to the Golgi, enhanced processing of ATF6⍺ to its active form and increased endogenous BiP protein levels. Loss of CRT also resulted in a conspicuous basal downregulation of the XBP1s::mCherry reporter that was associated with a reduced activity of IRE1 in <italic>CRTΔ</italic> cells. These findings align with previous evidence that N-ATF6⍺ suppresses IRE1 signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Walter et al., 2018</xref>), and highlights the importance of ATF6⍺/IRE1 crosstalk.</p>
<p>CRT engages monoglycosylated glycoproteins in the ER <italic>via</italic> its glycan-binding lectin domain, retaining them in the CRT/CNX cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hebert et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Ou et al., 1993</xref>). A role for CRT’s interaction with ATF6⍺_LD glycans in repressing ATF6⍺ is suggested by the markedly diminished ability of a lectin mutant CRT<sup>Y92A</sup> to repress the ATF6⍺ pathway compared to the wild-type. However, it is worth noting that CRT has been observed to bind proteins also in a glycan-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wijeyesakere et al., 2013</xref>). Both BLI data and immunoprecipitation from cell extracts revealed that CRT can associate with both wild-type and unglycosylated ATF6⍺ (ΔGly). In the former, direct interaction is characterised by slow kinetics, consistent with previous measurements of glycosylation-independent binding of CRT to its clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wijeyesakere et al., 2013</xref>, Table 1). These biophysical features, coupled with the residual ability of the lectin mutant CRT<sup>Y92A</sup> to repress endogenous ATF6⍺, lead us to suggest that CRT repression of ATF6⍺ may involve both glycosylation-dependent and independent interactions.</p>
<p>Currently, the structural basis for ATF6⍺_LD interactions with CRT remains unknown, and its role in the direct or indirect retention of ATF6⍺ in the ER is a subject for speculation. Nonetheless, the observations presented here support previous studies indicating that the stable interaction of CRT with cellular substrates combines both lectin-dependent and lectin-independent interactions into a hybrid mode. Moreover, our observations raise the possibility that the lectin activity of CRT is dispensable for its interaction with ATF6⍺_LD but implicated in recruitment of a third component required for repression. Either way titration of CRT by competing ligands is a plausible regulatory mechanism coupling ATF6⍺ activity to the burden of unfolded (glycol)proteins in the ER (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>).</p>

<title>Generation of the <italic>XC45-6S</italic> double UPR reporter cell by genome editing in <italic>ROSA26</italic> locus of CHO-K1 cells</title>
<p>The putative <italic>ROSA26</italic> locus in CHO cells has been recently identified and described as a “safe-harbour” site for heterologous gene expression and stable long-term expression of a transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gaidukov et al., 2018</xref>). We used the previously described <italic>XC45</italic> CHO-K1 cell line bearing a XBP1s::mCherry reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Harding et al., 2019</xref>), for targeting the <italic>ROSA26</italic> locus for knock-in with a landing pad cassette, comprised the <italic>cg</italic>BiP promoter region containing ERSE-I elements, fused to the superfolded (sf) GFP into the CHO genome by CRISPR/Cas9 integration to make this reporter cell line also sensitive to ATF6⍺ activity. The landing pad donor vector was constructed by appending homology arm sequences of <italic>ROSA26</italic> locus (440 bp predefined sequence from Gaidukov’s paper) to the 5’ promoter region of <italic>cg</italic>BiP (1,000 bp), along with the first 8 amino acids of the BiP CDS fused to the sfGFP. Homology arms were PCR amplified from CHO genomic DNA using predefined primers from Gaidukov’s paper. Subsequently, the <italic>cg</italic>BiP promoter, a geneblock containing sfGFP, and the flanking homology arms were fused by Gibson assembly cloning method, which allows multiple DNA fragments joining in a single, isothermal reaction (1 h at 50°C). Targeted integration was performed by co-transfection with the circular landing pad donor vector (UK2846) and a single sgRNA/Cas9 targeting <italic>cgROSA26</italic> locus (UK2847). Transfected cells were selected with puromycin (8 μg/ml) for 3 days and then treated with 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (4 mM) for 20 h to induce ER stress prior FACS. Cells were phenotypically sorted into 96-well plates by their activation of both UPR reporters (mCherry<sup>high</sup>; GFP <sup>high</sup>). Phenotypically selected clones were subsequently confirmed by correct genetic integration. For stability integration, clones were maintained and expanded every 2-3 days for 1 month and weekly analysed with flow cytometry for mCherry and GFP expression under treatment with different ER stressors agents. For the wide-genome CRISPR/Cas9 screen, Cas9 was ultimately introduced by transduction with lentiviral particles prepared from packaging Lenti-Cas9 plasmid (UK1674).

Two days after infection, transduced cells were selected with 8 µg/ml puromycin for 14 days. Afterwards, transduced cells were split into two subpopulations: one was treated with 2-Deoxy-D-glucose to induce ER stress, while the other one remained untreated.

Rounds of enrichment were carried out through cellular recovery, expansion, and sorting. Equal number of transduced cells, both untreated or 2-Deoxy-D-glucose treated, were passed without sorting as a control group in each round of sorting.

Shen and Ye’s research provided the basis for the design of S2P and S1P mutations (N391F &amp; P394L for S2P mutant, and LL408/9VV for S1P mutant) (Shen and Prywes, 2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Ye et al., 2000</xref>). A DNA-plasmid encoding eGFP_cgATF6⍺_TEV_LD410-659_S1-2PMUT_AviTag_pCEFL_pu (UK3122) was introduced into CHO-K1 plain cells <italic>via</italic> Lipofectamine LTX. Transfected cells were selected for resistance to puromycin (8 µg/ml), and the isogenic clones were selected for confocal microscopy assays and <italic>in vitro</italic> BLI interaction assays.</p>

<p>Two sgRNA sequences targeting exon 9 and 10 of cg<italic>ATF6</italic>⍺ were incorporated into pSpCas9(BB)-2A-mTurquoise plasmid (UK2915) to generate two sgRNA/Cas9 expression plasmids (UK3021 and UK3024) according to the published procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Ran et al., 2013</xref>). These plasmids were then transfected into CHO-K1 <italic>XC45-6S</italic> double UPR reporter cells. After 72 h, mTurquoise<sup>high</sup> cells were sorted as single cells into 96-well plates. Genomic DNA from clones showing no response to ATF6⍺ activation (BiP::sfGFP<sup>low</sup>) upon tunicamycin treatment (0.5 µM, 20h) was extracted for Sanger sequencing. Clones with frame shifts causing deletions in both alleles of the DNA region flanking by both sgRNAs were selected for further functional assays.</p>

<title>cgATF6⍺_LD “minigenes” knock-in</title>
<p>A unique sgRNA sequence targeting the exon 10 of ⍺<italic>ATF6</italic>⍺<bold>Δ</bold> cells was inserted into the pSpCas9(BB)-2A-mTurquoise plasmid to create the sgRNA/Cas9 plasmid UK3025. Three repair “minigenes” templates were constructed: A wild-type, glycan free (ΔGly) or a cysteine free (ΔC) LD to be reconstituted in ATF6⍺Δ cells by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair (HDR).</p>
<p>For the construction of the wild-type LD repair template (WT; UK3054), a minigene block that contains exons 10 -17 of <italic>cgATF6⍺</italic> (785bp; GenScript) was digested with <italic>Age</italic>I and <italic>Afl</italic>II and ligated into <italic>Age</italic>I/ <italic>Afl</italic>II-digested pUC57 plasmid. To create a Glycan free LD (ΔGly; UK3086) template, a minigene block containing exon 10 -17 (GenScrip) with the three N-glycosylation sites were mutated by replacing Thr 464, 575 and 634 with Ala, was cloned into pUC57 plasmid as previously described. Similarly, to generate a Cysteine-free LD (ΔC; UK3147) template, a minigene block containing exon 10 -17 (GenScrip) with Cys457 and Cys607 replaced with Ser, was cloned into pUC57 plasmid as previously performed.

<title>Bio-layer Interferometry (BLI), protein expression and <italic>in vivo</italic> biotinylation</title>
<p>BLI studies were undertaken using on the Octet RED96 System (Pall FortéBio) using ATF6⍺_LD variants as biotinylated ligands that were immobilised on streptavidin (SA)-coated biosensors (Pall FortéBio) and rat calreticulin (<italic>r</italic>CRT) as the analyte. Prior to use, SA-coated biosensors were hydrated in a BLI buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, 1mM CaCl2) for 10 min. BLI reactions were prepared in 200 μl volumes in 96-well microplates (greiner bio-one), at 30°C. Ligand loading was performed for 600 sec until a binding signal of 1 nm displacement was reached. Following ligand immobilisation, the sensor was baselined in the reaction buffer for at least 200 seconds, after which it was immersed in wells containing the analyte for association for 1200 seconds. After each association, the sensor was dipped into a buffer-containing well to allow dissociation for 2400 sec.</p>
<p>Biotinylated ATF6⍺LD constructs [ATF6⍺LD<sup>WT</sup> (UK3122); ATF6⍺LD<sup>ΔGly</sup> (UK3141) and ATF6LD<sup>ΔC</sup> (UK3157)] were expressed in HEK293T cells, each one encoding a N-terminal GFP tag followed by a TEV protease cleavage site just after the TM and an Avi-tag at C-terminal. S1P and S2P cleavage sites were also mutated to increase expression yield. Biotinylation was conducted <italic>in vivo</italic>, where cells were co-transfected with a BirA-encoding plasmid (biotin ligase, UK2969) in a 1:0.06 ratio.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Tung and colleagues identify Calreticulin as a repressor of ATF6 signaling using a CRISPR screen and characterize the functional interaction between ATF6 and CALR.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is well written and interesting with an innovative experimental design that provides some new mechanistic insight into ATF6 regulation as well as crosstalk with the IRE1 pathway. The methods used were fit for purpose and reasonable conclusions were drawn from the data presented. Findings are novel and bring together glycoprotein quality control and activation of one sensor of the UPR. This is a novel perspective on how the integration of ER homeostasis signals could be sensed in the ER.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Several points remain to be documented to support the authors' model.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors set out to use an unbiased CRISPR/Cas9 screen in CHO cells to identify genes encoding proteins that either increase or repress ATF6 signaling in CHO cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strengths of the paper include the thoroughness of the screens, the use of a novel, double ATF6/IRE1 UPR reporter cell line, and follow-up detailed experiments on two of the findings in the screens, i.e. FURIN and CRT, to test the validity of involvement of each as direct regulators of ATF6 signaling. Additional strengths are the control experiments that validate the ATF6 specificity of the screens, as well as, for CRT, the finding of focus, determining roles for the glycosylation and cysteines in ATF6 as mechanistically involved in how CRT represses ATF6, at least in CHO cells.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The weaknesses of the paper are that the authors did not describe why they focused only on the top 100 proteins in each list of ATF6 activators and repressors. Additionally, there were a few methodology items missing, such as the nature of where the insertion site in the CHO cell genome of the XBP1::mCherry reporter. Since the authors go to great lengths to insert the other reporter for ATF6 activation in a &quot;safe harbor&quot; location, it leads to questions about whether the XBP1::mCherry reporter insertion is truly innocuous. An additional weakness is that the evidence for the physical interaction between ATF6LD and CRT is not strong, being dependent mainly on a single IP/IB experiment in Figure 4C that comprises only 1 lane on the gel for each of the test cases. Moreover, while that figure suggests that the interaction between CRT and ATF6 is decreased by mutating out the glycosylation sites in the ATF6LD, the BLI experiment in the same figure, 4B, suggests that there are no differences in the affinities of CRT for ATF6LD WT, deltaGly and deltaCys. An additional detail is that I found Figure 6A to be difficult to interpret, and that 6B was required in order for me to best evaluate the points being made by the authors in this figure.</p>
<p>Overall, I believe that this work will positively impact the field as it provides a list of potential regulators of ATF6 activation and repression that others will be able to use as a launch point for discovering such interactions in cells and tissues or interest beyond CHO cells. However, I agree with the authors that these findings were in CHO cell lines and that it is possible, if not likely, that some of the interactions they found will be cell type/line specific.</p>
