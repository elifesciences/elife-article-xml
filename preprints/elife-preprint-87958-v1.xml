<title>Abstract</title><p>Catalytic signaling outputs of protein kinases are dynamically regulated by an array of structural mechanisms, including allosteric interactions mediated by intrinsically disordered segments flanking the conserved catalytic domain. The Doublecortin Like Kinases (DCLKs) are a family of microtubule-associated proteins characterized by a flexible C-terminal autoregulatory ‘tail’ segment that varies in length across the various human DCLK isoforms. However, the mechanism whereby these isoform-specific variations contribute to unique modes of autoregulation is not well understood. Here, we employ a combination of statistical sequence analysis, molecular dynamics simulations and <italic>in vitro</italic> mutational analysis to define hallmarks of DCLK family evolutionary divergence, including analysis of splice variants within the DCLK1 sub-family, which arise through alternative codon usage and serve to ‘supercharge’ the inhibitory potential of the DCLK1 C-tail. We identify co-conserved motifs that readily distinguish DCLKs from all other Calcium Calmodulin Kinases (CAMKs), and a ‘Swiss-army’ assembly of distinct motifs that tether the C-terminal tail to conserved ATP and substrate-binding regions of the catalytic domain to generate a scaffold for auto-regulation through C-tail dynamics. Consistently, deletions and mutations that alter C-terminal tail length or interfere with co-conserved interactions within the catalytic domain alter intrinsic protein stability, nucleotide/inhibitor-binding, and catalytic activity, suggesting isoform-specific regulation of activity through alternative splicing. Our studies provide a detailed framework for investigating kinome–wide regulation of catalytic output through cis-regulatory events mediated by intrinsically disordered segments, opening new avenues for the design of mechanistically-divergent DCLK1 modulators, stabilizers or degraders.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Protein kinases are one of the largest druggable protein families comprising 1.7% of the human genome and play essential roles in regulating diverse eukaryotic cell signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). The Doublecortin-like kinases (DCLKs) are understudied members of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CAMK) clade of serine-threonine kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). There are three distinct paralogs of DCLK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>), the last of which is annotated as a “dark” kinase due to the lack of information pertaining to its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Human DCLK1 (also known as DCAMKL1) was initially identified in 1999 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>), followed by the cloning of human DCLK2 and 3 paralogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Full-length DCLK proteins contain N-terminal Doublecortin-like (DCX) domains, microtubule-binding elements that play a role in microtubule dynamics, neurogenesis, and neuronal migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). DCLKs have garnered much interest as disease biomarkers, since they are upregulated in a variety of cancer pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), as well as neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington’s Disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). However, the mechanisms by which DCLK activity is auto-regulated, and how and why they have diverged from other protein kinases is not well understood.</p>
<p>Like all protein kinases, the catalytic domain of DCLKs adopts a bi-lobal fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>), with an N-terminal ATP binding lobe and C-terminal substrate binding region. Canonical elements within the two lobes include the DFG motif, a Lys-Glu salt bridge that is associated with the active conformation, Gly-rich loop, and ATP-binding pocket, which are all critical elements for catalysis. Many protein kinases, including CAMKs, Tyrosine Kinases (TKs) and AGCs, elaborate on these core elements with unique N-terminal and C-terminal extensions that flank these catalytic lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), allowing them to function as allosteric regulators of catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Indeed, CAMKs are archetypal examples of kinases that can exist in an active-like structural conformation, yet still remain catalytically inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). This is in large part due to the presence of unique C-terminal tails that are capable of blocking ATP or substrate binding in well-studied kinases such as CAMK1 and CAMKII. In canonical CAMKs, autoinhibition may be released upon Ca/Calmodulin interaction with the CAMK C-tail, which makes the substrate-binding pocket and enzyme active-site accessible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). In CAMKII, the N and C-terminal segments flanking the kinase domain are variable in length across different isoforms and the level of kinase autoinhibition or autoactivation has been reported to be dependent on the linker length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). The CAMKII C-tail can be organized into an autoregulatory domain and an intrinsically disordered association domain. The autoregulatory domain also serves as a pseudosubstrate, which physically blocks the substrate binding pocket until it is competed away by Calmodulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Notably, this autoregulatory pseudosubstrate can be phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), and phosphorylation of the C-tail makes CAMKII insensitive to calmodulin binding. Across the CAMK group, several other kinases share autoinhibitory activity via interactions between Calcium/calmodulin binding domains and the C-terminal tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>), and a major feature of these kinases is variation in the tail length across the distinct genetic isoforms.</p>
<p>The human genome encodes four distinct DCLK1 isoforms, termed DCLK1.1-1.4 in UniProt (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>)), which display differential activity- and tissue-specific expression profiles. Human DCLK1.1 (also known as DCLK1 alpha) is expressed in a variety of tissues, but is enriched in cells derived from the fetal and adult brain, whereas DCLK1.2 (also known as DCLK1 beta) is expressed exclusively in the embryonic brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). DCLK1.3 and 1.4, which lack tandem microtubule-binding DCX domains (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>) but are otherwise identical to DCLK1.1 and DCLK1.2, respectively, are also highly expressed in the brain. To aid with clarity, the names of the human DCLK1 genes and their isoforms used in this paper are summarized in <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>. Recent structural and cellular analyses have begun to clarify the mechanisms by which the DCLK1.2 isoform is regulated by the C-tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Mechanistically, autophosphorylation of Thr 688, which is present only in the C-tail of DCLK1.2 (and DCLK1.4), blunts kinase activity and subsequently inhibits phosphorylation of the N-terminal DCX domain and thus drives DCLK microtubule association in cells. Consistently, deletion of the C-tail or mutation of Thr 688 restores DCLK1.2 kinase activity, subsequently leading to DCX domain phosphorylation and the abolition of microtubule binding. The length and sequence of the C-tail varies across the DCLK1 isoforms; however, how these variations contribute to isoform-specific functions and how they emerged during the course of evolution is not known.</p>

<p>In this paper, we employ an evolutionary systems approach that combines statistical sequence analysis with experimental studies to generate new models of DCLK evolutionary divergence and functional specialization. We identify the C-terminal tail as the hallmark of DCLK functional specialization across the kingdoms of life and propose a refined model in which this regulated tail functions as a highly adaptable ‘Swiss-Army knife’ that can ‘supercharge’ multiple aspects of DCLK signaling output. Notably, a conserved segment of the C-tail functions as an isoform-specific autoinhibitory motif, which mimics ATP functions through direct tail docking to the nucleotide-binding pocket, where it forms an ordered set of interactions that aligns the catalytic (C) spine of the kinase in the absence of ATP binding. Furthermore, modelling demonstrates a phosphorylated threonine in the C-tail of DCLK1.2, which is absent in DCLK1.1, that is poised to mimic the gamma phosphate of ATP. Other segments of the tail function as a pseudosubstrate by occluding the substrate-binding pocket and tethering to key functional regions of the catalytic domain. Thermostability analysis of purified DCLK1 proteins, combined with molecular dynamics simulations, confirms major differences in thermal and dynamic profiles of the DCLK1 isoforms, while catalytic activity assays reveal how specific variations in the G-loop and C-tail can rescue DCLK1.2 from the autoinhibited conformation. Together, these studies demonstrate that isoform-specific variations in the C-terminal tail co-evolved with residues in the DCLK kinase domain, contributing to regulatory diversification and functional specialization.</p>

<title>Origin and evolutionary divergence of DCLK family members</title>
<p>The human DCLKs repertoire is composed of three genes, termed DCLK1, 2 and 3 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). The experimental model employed in this study, DCLK1, is composed of multiple spliced variants in human cells. Those full-length proteins that contain N-terminal DCX domains are usually referred to as DCLK1.1 or DCLK1.2 and the variants that lack the DCX domains are termed here (for simplicity) ΔDCLK 1.1 and ΔDCLK1.2 (also referred to as DCLK1.3 and DCLK1.4). The core catalytic domain with minimal flanking regions (DCLK1<sub>cat</sub>, <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>) is identical in all DCLK1 proteins, whereas the length of the tail, or the presence of the DCX domains, generates considerable diversity from the single human DCLK1 gene (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1</xref></bold>). To infer evolutionary relationships of DCLK paralogs, and especially the evolution of the C-terminal tail regions that lie adjacent to the kinase domain (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>), we performed phylogenetic analysis of 36 DCLK sequences with an outgroup of closely related CAMK sequences (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, Figure 2-source data 1</bold>). These DCLK sequences are from a representative group of holozoans, which consist of multicellular eukaryotes (metazoans) and closely related unicellular eukaryotes (pre-metazoans). The analysis generated four distinct clades: pre-metazoan DCLK, metazoan DCLK3, vertebrate DCLK2 and vertebrate DCLK1. Interestingly, DCLK genes demonstrated significant expansion and diversification within metazoan taxa. The pre-metazoan DCLK sequences were the most ancestral and showed no DCLK diversity, suggesting the DCLK expansion and diversification correlated with the evolution of multicellular organisms. Within the metazoan expansion of DCLK, DCLK3 is the most ancestral and can be broken down into two sub-clades: protostome DCLK3 and deuterostome DCLK3. Within invertebrates, only two DCLK paralogs were present, one that was identified as a DCLK3 ortholog and another that was not clearly defined as either DCLK1 or DCLK2. This suggests that the diversification into DCLK1 and DCLK2 paralogs from an ancestral DCLK1/2-like paralog occurred after the divergence of invertebrates and vertebrates, which his further supported by the monophyletic DCLK1 and DCLK2 clades in vertebrates (bootstrap value: 99).</p>

<p>Interestingly, the expansion of DCLK in metazoans and the diversification of DCLK1 and DCLK2 within vertebrates correlates well with the length and sequence similarity of the C-terminal tail, which also varies between the different DCLK1 splice variants (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1</xref> and 2</bold>). Within both protostome and deuterostome DCLK3, the length of the C-terminal tail is ∼50 residues or less. This is in marked contrast to the tail lengths of vertebrate DCLK1 and DCLK2, which are ∼100 residues long. In addition to the C-terminal tail, an analysis of the domain organization of these DCLKs reveals that DCLK3 predominantly contains only a single N-terminal Doublecortin domain (DCX), whereas invertebrate DCLKs, and vertebrate DCLK1 and DCLK2 predominantly contain two DCX domains at the N-terminus of the long isoforms (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>). In addition, we identified a putative active site-binding motif, VSVI, and a phosphorylatable threonine conserved within vertebrate DCLK1 and DCLK2, which is absent in all other DCLK sequences, including invertebrate DCLK1/2. This raises the possibility that the DCLK1/2 tail extensions are employed for vertebrate-specific regulatory functions.</p>
<p>Next, we compared the type of DCLK1 protein sequence encoded by a range of chordate mammalian genomes. The domain organization of each DCLK1 isoform was compared based on annotated sequences from UniProt, demonstrating the presence of at least one DCLK1 protein that lacks the DCX domains in every species examined, with a mixture of ΔDCLK1.1 and ΔDCLK1.2 splice variants. Interestingly, it was only in the human DCLK1 gene that definitive evidence for ΔDCLK1.1 and ΔDCLK1.2 variants was found (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). To establish a model for DCLK1 biophysical analysis, we constructed a recombinant hybrid human DCLK1 catalytic domain with a short C-tail sequence that is equivalent to DCLK1.1 amino acids 351-689, containing the catalytic domain with a short C-tail region. As shown in <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>, incubation of size-exclusion chromatography purified GST-tagged DCLK1 with 3C protease generated the mature untagged DCLK1 protein for biophysical analysis. We demonstrated catalytic activity for DCLK1.1<sub>351-689</sub> using a validated peptide phosphorylation assay (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>), which revealed efficient phosphorylation of a DCLK1 substrate peptide. The Km [ATP] for peptide phosphorylation was close to 20 µM in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>, left panel), similar to values measured for other Ser/Thr kinases that are autophosphorylated and active after expression from bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). DCLK-dependent peptide phosphorylation was completely blocked (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>, right panel) by prior incubation of the reaction mixture (containing 1mM ATP) with the chemical inhibitor DCLK1-IN-1, as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). In addition to enzyme activity, we monitored thermal denaturation of purified, folded, DCLK1<sub>351-689</sub> protein in the presence of ATP, either alone or as a Mg:ATP complex, which is required for catalysis. As shown in <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>, DCLK1 was modestly stabilized by 2.1°C upon incubation with an excess of Mg:ATP, and this protective effect was completely blocked by mutation of Asp 533 to Ala, consistent with canonical ATP interaction in the nucleotide-binding site. Finally, we assessed the thermal effects of a panel of DCLK1 inhibitors on the model DCLK1.1<sub>351-689</sub> protein. Prior incubation with DCLK1-IN-1, LRRK2-IN-1, the benzopyrimidodiazipinones XMD8-92 and XMD8-85, all of which have been reported to potently (though not specifically) inhibit DCLK1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), led to marked protection from thermal unfolding (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1</xref></bold>). Consistently, the negative control compound DCLK1-Neg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>) was ineffective in stabilizing DCLK1.</p>

<title>Key differences between isoforms in the C-tail of DCLK1 arise from alternative-splicing and different open-reading frames</title>
<p>Higher-order vertebrates have multiple isoforms of DCLK1 and DCLK2, where sequence variations occur in either or both the N and C terminal regions attached to the kinase domain. Human DCLK1, for example, has four unique isoforms. Isoforms 1 and 2 differ in C-terminal tail length due to variations in exon splicing (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>). Further examination of the intron and exon boundaries indicates that human DCLK1.1 contains an additional exon (exon 16) that is not spliced in DCLK1.2. Exon 16 is spliced with exon 17 with a phase 2 intron, which introduces a shift in the reading frame and an earlier translated stop codon (UGA) in exon 17 (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>). In DCLK1.2, exon 15 is spliced with exon 17, with a non-disruptive phase 0 intron, resulting in the full translation of exon 17. These changes introduce multiple indels (insertions and deletions) and result in the insertion of a phosphorylatable threonine (T688) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) in DCLK1.2 that is absent in the DCLK1.1 variant (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B-C</xref></bold>), suggesting a possible exon duplication for adaptive regulation of DCLK1 function by phosphorylation. DCLK1.2 is the best-characterized isoform in terms of structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), and to compare it with DCLK1.1, we generated a series of C-terminal tail deletion mutants to evaluate how variations in the C-terminal tail contribute to isoform specific DCLK1 functions.</p>

<title>Isoform-specific variations encode changes in molecular dynamics, thermostability and catalytic activity in DCLK1</title>
<p>To study isoform specific differences in the C-tail, we employed experimental techniques to compare protein stability and catalytic activity between purified DCLK1 proteins alongside molecular dynamics simulations for DCLK1.1 and DCLK1.2 with different tail lengths. Isoforms 1.1 and 1.2 share identical sequences across the kinase domain and within the first 38 residues of the C-tail, and we used this information to design a new recombinant protein, termed DCLK1<sub>cat</sub> (residues 351-686). C-terminal to this totally conserved region, both isoforms possess extended tail segments, which includes the putative inhibitory binding segment (IBS; residues 682-688) and an additional intrinsically-disordered segment (IDS; residues 703-end). To study the role of the C-tail in modulating kinase stability and activity, we purified the DCLK1<sub>cat</sub>, and C-tail containing (long and short) variants of each isoform, each of which lack the N-terminal DCX domains (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold>). SDS-PAGE demonstrated that protein preparations were essentially homogenous after affinity and gel filtration chromatography (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1</xref></bold>). The short forms of the recombinant proteins (DCLK1.1<sub>351-703</sub> and DCLK1.2<sub>351-703</sub>) possess a partially truncated C-tail and were designed to match the amino acid sequence previously used to solve the structure of DCLK1.2 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Notably, these proteins exclude the IDS. The long forms of the DCLK1 proteins include the full-length C-tail for each isoform (DCLK1.1<sub>351-729</sub> and DCLK1.2<sub>351-740</sub>) and incorporate IDS domains. We first performed comparative thermal shift analyses to quantify variance in thermal stability between the different purified proteins. When contrasting DCLK1.1<sub>short</sub> and DCLK1.2<sub>short</sub> which do not differ in size or tail length but encode unique sets of amino acids in their partially truncated C-tail as a result of alternative splicing (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></bold>), we observed that DCLK1.2 was some 14°C more stable than DCLK1.1 (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref></bold>). When compared with DCLK1<sub>cat</sub>, both DCLK1.1 short and long exhibited only subtle changes in thermal stability (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> &amp; E</bold>), whereas both DCLK1.2 proteins (DCLK1.2<sub>short</sub> and DCLK1.2<sub>long</sub>) were significantly stabilized (relative ΔTm &gt;16°C, <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref> &amp; E</bold>).</p>

<p>We next performed MD simulations to study the dynamics within the distinct DCLK1 C-tails that might explain the observed difference in protein stability. The crystal structure of DCLK1.2 (pdb: 6KYQ) was employed for the DCLK1.2<sub>short</sub> model and AlphaFold2 was used to model the other proteins (DCLK1<sub>cat</sub> and DCLK1.1<sub>short</sub>). Comparison of the root mean square fluctuations (RMSF) of the two isoforms in three different replicates of molecular dynamics simulations indicates strikingly different thermal fluctuations in the C-terminal tails and catalytic domains (<bold>Figure 5-source data 1</bold>). In particular, the IBS segment (between 682-688) is stably docked in the ATP binding pocket in DCLK1.2 and an alpha helical conformation is maintained during the microsecond time scale across different replicates (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref></bold>, bottom). In contrast, the IBS is more unstable in DCLK1.1, as indicated by high thermal fluctuations and a lack of secondary structure propensity (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref></bold>, top). A caveat to bear in mind is that DCLK1.1 is an AlphaFold2 model, which will also account for increased RMSF. Analysis of sequence variations and structural interactions provides additional insights into the differential dynamics of the two isoforms. The helical conformation of the IDS in DCK1.2 is maintained during the simulation due, in part, to a capping interaction with Thr 687, which is absent in DCLK1.1 due to the alternative splicing event detailed above. Likewise, another key residue in DCLK1.2, Lys 692, anchors the tail to the catalytic domain through directional salt bridges with the conserved aspartates (Asp 511 and Asp 533) in the HRD and DFG motifs (<bold><xref rid="figs5a" ref-type="fig">Figure 5, figure-supplement 2A</xref></bold>). These interactions are not observed in DCLK1.1 simulations because Lys 692 is substituted to a histidine (His 689), which is unable to form a corresponding interaction with the catalytic domain (<bold><xref rid="figs5a" ref-type="fig">Figure 5, figure-supplement 2B</xref></bold>). These results indicate that the DCLK1.2 C-tail forms stable interactions with the kinase domain and kinase-specific motifs which drive the observed increase in thermal stability in our recombinant protein constructs (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref></bold>), while the more flexible DCLK1.1 C-tail forms fewer stable interactions with the kinase domain. This variable docking of the C-tail within the kinase domains of the two DCLK1 isoforms, and the extent to which this contributes to more transient or stable autoinhibited states was explored in more detail in the next section.</p>

<title>Residues contributing to the co-evolution and unique tethering of the C-terminal tail to the DCLK catalytic domain</title>
<p>To identify specific residues that contribute to the unique modes of DCLK regulation by the C-terminal tail, we performed statistical analysis of the evolutionary constraints acting on DCLK and related CAMK family sequences. We aligned the catalytic domain of DCLK and related CAMK sequences from diverse organisms and employed the Bayesian Partitioning with Pattern Selection (BPPS) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>) to identify residues that most distinguish DCLK sequences (foreground alignment in <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref></bold>) from CAMK sequences (background alignment).

BPPS analysis revealed DCLK-specific constraints in different regions of the kinase domain, most notably, the ATP binding G-loop, N terminus of the C-helix, the activation loop, and C-terminus of the F-helix (<bold><xref rid="figs6a" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 2</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>Some of the most significant DCLK specific residue constraints map to the ATP binding G-loop (GDGNFA motif) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-B</xref>). In particular, Asp 398, Asn 400 and Ala 402 are unique to DCLKs as the corresponding residues are strikingly different in other CAMKs. Asp 398 is typically a charged residue (K/R) in other CAMKs while Asn 400 and Ala 402 are typically hydrophobic and polar residues, respectively (see residues frequencies in background alignment; <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref></bold>). Notably, both Asn 400 and Asp 398 make direct interactions with residues in the C-tail either in the crystal structure or molecular dynamics simulations (see below). Likewise, DCLK conserved residues in the C-helix and activation loop tether the C-terminal tail to functional regions of the kinase core, suggesting co-option of the DCLK catalytic domain to uniquely interact with the flanking cis regulatory tail.</p>

<title>An autoinhibitory ATP-mimic completes the C-spine and mimics the gamma phosphate of ATP</title>
<p>The most stable segment of the C-tail based on the B-factor and RMSF fluctuations in MD simulations is a unique region (682-688 in DCLK1.2) that docks into the ATP binding pocket through both hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions. Remarkably, this peptide segment mimics the physiological ATP ligand, and stabilizes the catalytic domain through ‘completion’ of the hydrophobic catalytic spine (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref></bold>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>)).

Interestingly, based on our BPPS analyses, these C-tail residues are uniquely vertebrate DCLK1-specific pattern constraints. At the tail end of this α-helix are two Thr residues, Thr 687 and Thr 688.

In comparison, the same region in DCLK1.1, which lacks Thr 687, is predicted to be unstructured. Upon phosphorylation, Thr 688 in DCLK1.2 can mimic the gamma phosphate of ATP by maintaining a stable hydrogen bonding distance with the backbone of the second glycine of the G-loop (G399) (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 1C</xref></bold>). We additionally observe that the sidechain of Asn 400, a DCLK-specific G-loop constraint, further stabilizes the phosphate group in pThr 688 through hydrogen bonding. As previously mentioned, Thr 688 is unique to DCLK1.2. The lack of this functional site in DCK1.1 is correlated with increased RMSF and instability of the ATP-mimic segment in isoform 1 MDs (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C-D</xref>, <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 1B</xref></bold>).

<title>Mutational analysis support isoform-specific allosteric control of catalytic activity by the C-terminal tail</title>
<p>To evaluate how sequence differences between DCLK1.1 and DCLK1.2 affected both thermal stability and catalytic potential, we generated targeted mutations at contact residues within the Gly-rich loop and C-tail of DCK1.1 and DCLK1.2 (at the indicted residues depicted in <bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref></bold>) which we predicted would disrupt or destabilize C-tail docking within the domain. All proteins were purified to near homogeneity by IMAC and size exclusion chromatography filtration (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1</xref></bold>), and the thermal stability of a panel of DCLK1.2 mutant and WT proteins were compared side-by-side with the DCLK1<sub>cat</sub> (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref></bold>). The ΔTm values obtained (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref></bold>) demonstrate that mutation of Asp 398 or Asn 400 in the Gly-rich loop are by themselves insufficient to destabilize DCLK1.2. In marked contrast, dual mutation of the hydrophobic pair of Val 682 and Val 684 residues to Thr, or mutation of the acidic tail residue Asp691, resulted in a pronounced reduction in DCLK1.2 thermal stability. Moreover, the recorded Tm values for these latter two mutations quite closely resembled the Tm of DCLK1<sub>cat</sub> (which lacks the C-tail entirely), which is consistent with the uncoupling of the C-tail and a commensurate decrease in thermal stability associated with loss of this interaction. We next determined the catalytic activity of all our recombinant DCLK1.1 and DCLK1.2 proteins side-by-side (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>, <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8-figure supplement 1B</xref></bold>). Although partially diminished in relation to DCLK1<sub>cat</sub>, both DCLK1.1<sub>short</sub> (351-703) and DCLK1.1<sub>long</sub> (351-729) variants possess robust catalytic activity. This suggested ineffective ATP-competitive auto-inhibition mediated by the C-tail segment of DCLK1.1 and is consistent with their closely matched Tm values to DCLK1<sub>cat</sub> (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref></bold>). In marked contrast, detectable kinase activity for short (351-703) or long (351-740) DCLK1.2 proteins was significantly blunted compared to DCLK1<sub>cat</sub>, exhibiting just ∼5% of the activity of the catalytic domain alone. We also utilized autophosphorylation as a proxy for overall kinase activity. Quantitative tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis of site-specific autophosphorylation within DCLK1.1<sub>short</sub> and DCLK1.2<sub>short</sub> confirmed a marked reduction in the site-specific abundance of phosphate in DCLK1.2 when compared to DCLK1.1 at two distinct sites that could be directly and accurately quantified (Ser 438 and Ser 660, relative abundance set to 1, <bold><xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8-figure supplement 1A</xref></bold>). Unfortunately, we were unable to assign site-specific Thr 688 phosphorylation in DCLK1.2, since it resides in a large, multiply phosphorylated tryptic peptide with multiple potential sites of phosphorylation. Furthermore, quantitative abundance calculations between the two isoforms was not possible since Thr 688 is absent in DCLK1.1. Interestingly, amino acid substitutions in the G loop or the C-tail of DCLK1.2 designed to subvert C-tail and ATP site interactions also had major effects on DCLK1.2 catalytic activity. DCLK1.2 D398A was activated some 5-fold when compared to the WT form, whereas DCLK1.2 N400A was almost as active as the DCLK1<sub>cat</sub>. Consistently, DCLK1.2 V682T/V684T and D691A proteins were also much more active than the WT form of DCLK1.2 (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref></bold>, see <bold><xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8-figure supplement 1B</xref></bold> for kinetic analysis). Moreover, quantitative MS/MS analysis of purified DCLK1.2 D398A, N400A and V682T/V684T proteins demonstrated that Ser 438 and (especially) Ser 660 autophosphorylation sites increased in abundance, consistent with the enhanced activity of these proteins compared to WT DCLK1.2 (<bold><xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8-figure supplement 1C</xref></bold>). Together, these observations confirm that these targeted mutations are sufficient to relieve ATP-competitive C-tail autoinhibition by physical tail uncoupling; this model is also strongly supported by marked changes in the thermal stability of the mutant proteins, particularly for V682/684T and D691A (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>To expand on this finding, we investigated the interaction of Mg:ATP or DCLK1-IN-1 to our panel of DCLK1.1 and 1.2 proteins (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref></bold>), using changes in thermal stability as a reporter of ligand binding. DCLK1<bold><sub>cat</sub></bold> (351-686), DCLK1.1<sub>short</sub> (351-703) and DCLK1.1<sub>long</sub> (351-729) proteins all behaved similarly in the presence of either Mg:ATP or DCLK1-IN-1, inducing marked stabilization. In contrast, DCLK1.2<sub>short</sub> (351-703) or DCLK1.2<sub>long</sub> (351-740) proteins registered negligible thermal shifts in the presence of the same concentration of either ligand, which is in-line with the C-tail tightly occupying the ATP-binding site and obstructing their binding. Remarkably, D398A and N400A DCLK1.2, whose high basal Tm values (compared to DCLK1<sub>cat</sub>) are consistent with stabilization by docking of the C-tail within the kinase domain, were markedly destabilized in the presence of either ligand. This suggests that incorporation of these G-loop mutations in isolation is insufficient to dislodge the C-tail, but rather that the stability of the interaction is compromised to the extent that either ATP or DCLK-IN-1 can competitively dislodge the bound tail from the ATP active site, resulting in a net destabilization caused by lack of tail engagement. This observation is corroborated by the results of our kinase assays, where both D398A and N400A mutants were more active than WT DCLK1.2, confirming appropriate ATP binding (a pre-requisite for catalysis). Finally, DCLK1.2 V682T/V684T and D691A, which exhibit lower basal Tm values than the WT protein (indicating a loss of tail interaction), were both stabilized in a ligand-dependent manner to a similar degree to that observed for DCLK1<sub>cat</sub> and DCLK1.1 proteins (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref></bold>). Collectively, these observations clearly demonstrate that the C-tail section of DCLK1.2 can both stabilize the canonical DCLK kinase domain and inhibit kinase activity (by impeding the binding and structural coordination of Mg:ATP) much more effectively than that of DCLK1.1. Our targeted mutational analysis of key contact residues in DCLK1.2 also clearly shows that this is a consequence of specific amino acid interactions that are absent in DCLK1.1 due to alternative-splicing sequence deviations.</p>

<title>Classification of DCLK regulatory segments</title>
<p>We synthesized our experimental findings by classifying the DCLK C-tail into six functional segments, based on interactions with different regions of the catalytic domain and their conservation between the C-tail splice variants we analyzed (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref></bold>): First is an ATP-mimetic peptide segment (residues 682-688 in DCLK1.2) that readily mimics physiological ATP binding by completing the C-spine in the nucleotide-binding site. The inhibitory peptide also contains a phosphorylatable Thr residue, which sits adjacent to the highly characteristic Gly-rich loop (GDGNFA, residues 396-402). Second, we define a pseudosubstrate mimic (PSM, residues 692-701), which interacts with the acidic HRD and DFG Asp side-chains and docks in the substrate pocket occluding substrate access. Third, at the C-terminus of the tail, lies an intrinsically disordered segment (IDS, residues 702-749, <bold><xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9-figure supplement 1</xref></bold>), which packs dynamically against DCLK conserved residues in the kinase activation loop. Fourth, at the beginning of the C-tail lies a CAMK-tether (residues 654-664), a set of residues that pack against a CAMK-specific insert in the C-lobe. In many CAMK crystal structures, this insert makes multiple contacts with the F-helix and C-tail (<bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 1</xref></bold>). Fifth, this is followed by a highly dynamic pseudosubstrate region (residues 672-678) that occludes the substrate pocket and will thus interfere with substrate phosphorylation. Sixth, a transient beta-strand is formed in DCLK1.2 through amino acid specific sequences that help modulate and potentially strengthen binding of the C-tail in this isoform (<bold><xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 1A-B</xref></bold>). Collectively, these segments and their associated interaction sites demonstrate that co-evolution of the unique C-tail with the catalytic domain is the central hallmark of DCLK functional divergence, and that changes in these segments possess the ability to ‘supercharge’ catalytic output of the kinase. The combinatorial diversity of events that modulate C-tail function may allow DCLKs to maintain a nimble balance between various tasks including ATP-binding, substrate-based phosphorylation, coordination of DCX domain phosphorylation and structural disposition, kinase autoinhibition and allosteric regulation. Additionally, differences in cellular localization (e.g. cytoplasm or nucleoplasm) and tissue-specific expression may enable contextual DCLK regulation through these modular sequence segments.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The kinase domain is a conserved switch for phosphorylation-based catalytic regulation. Yet the complexity of cell signaling pathways demands other nuanced forms of regulation beyond binary “on” or “off” switch-based mechanisms. For many Ser/Thr kinases, including AGC and CAMK families, these distinct regulatory functions come from segments which flank the kinase domain, N- and C-terminal regions, which serve to modulate activity through allosteric activation, inhibition, or rheostatic behaviors that change based on environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). In this study, we expand on our knowledge of allosteric diversity in the human kinome by revealing how alternative splicing of the DCLK1 C-tail contributes to isoform-specific behaviors, coupling regulation of catalytic output, phosphorylation, protein dynamics and stability, substrate binding, and protein-protein interactions. Our “Swiss Army Knife” model for DCLK1 expands our view of allosteric regulation as not just a dynamic process facilitated by proteins, but one where adaptive genetic mechanisms, like differential splicing, dexterously tune isoform-specific functions for specific cellular signaling roles; in the case of DCLK1.1, this allows ‘supercharging’ of catalysis between splice variants due to key amino acid differences in the C-tail that are lacking in the DCLK1.2 isoform.</p>
<p>Multiple members of the human kinome have independently evolved C-tail regions that dock to the N or C-lobe of the kinase domain <italic>in cis</italic>. In the case of the AGC kinases, the C-terminal tail is a very well-studied <italic>in-cis</italic> modulatory element that serves to explain a variety of regulatory properties in this kinase sub-family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Classical deletion studies with members of the CAMK family, have also revealed a cis-acting inhibitory element lying C-terminal to the catalytic domain of both CAMK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>) and CAMK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). More recent examples of the diversity of C-tail function in CAMK family members are presented by the human pseudokinases TRIB1 and TRIB2, which employ C-tail sequences to either latch (and structurally restrict) the atypical kinase domain or to bind competitively to the Ubiquitin E3 ligase COP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Functional disengagement of the TRIB1 or TRIB2 tail through deletion, mutagenesis or small molecule binding has marked effects on pseudokinase conformation, intrinsic stability and cellular transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>).</p>

<title>A novel pseudosubstrate region encoded by DCLK1</title>
<p>In addition to the marked differences between DCLK1 splice variants relevant to nucleotide binding, small molecule interactions and catalysis, our work also reveals two unique pseudosubstrate segments present before and after the IBS. Before the IBS segment, we observe the formation of an anti-parallel transient beta sheet with the beta1 strand in the catalytic domain (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>, <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 1A-B</xref></bold>). During the formation of this transient structure, the C-tail dynamically occludes part of the substrate binding pocket. A beta-sheet is observed in all three MD replicates of DCLK1.1, but only in a single replicate of DCLK1.2 dynamic analysis. At the other end of the IBS is another pseudosubstrate segment whose structure and dynamics change as a result of alternative exon splicing. In DCLK1.2, the pseudosubstrate segment is stable, with an average RMSF of 1.8 Angstroms, facilitated by key interactions from Lys 692, which coordinates acidic residues in the HRD and DFG motifs (<bold><xref rid="figs5a" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 2A</xref></bold>). In DCLK1.1, Lys 692 is replaced by a His, which weakly coordinates with the HRD and DFG motifs, resulting increased dynamics of the segment and an RMSF of 3.1Å (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, <xref rid="figs5a" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 2B</xref></bold>). Together, residue variation between isoforms contribute to differences in stability and alteration of dynamics of the tail. HPCAL1 was recently proposed as a possible substrate that activates DCLK1 in a calcium-dependent manner, but it is unclear how it may bind DCLK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Because only exon 15 of the C-tail is conserved between the isoforms, it is possible the location of binding occurs in this dynamic pseudosubstrate segment prior to the IBS, where increased flexibility and occlusion of the substrate pocket is reflective of the absence of HPCAL1, or a similar calmodulin-like substrate.</p>

<title>Discovery of the DCLK1 ATP-Mimic region; a splice-variant specific regulatory module</title>
<p>Our structural analysis of DCLK1 reveals a remarkable structural mimic of ATP located in the C-tail, which differs markedly between DCLK1.1 and DLCK1.2 splice variants. We note for the first time that a set of three residues in the ATP-mimic, Val 682, Val 684, and Ile 685, are conserved across all isoforms of DCLK1 and DCLK2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) and serve to extend the kinase C-spine. Mutation of these residues in DCLK1.2 uncouples tail binding and activates the kinase. Proximal to these residues are two Thr residues (Thr 687 and Thr 688), which are only found in DCLK1.2. Based on proteomics data, both Thr residues can be phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) and are thus likely to be regulatory in DCLK1.2. By analyzing DCLK1 dynamics using MD simulations, we observed multiple key interactions between the G-loop and the C-tail in DCLK1, the most critical of which appear to be dipole interactions with the second glycine in the G-loop by the phosphothreonine. In addition, Thr 687 contributes to increased stabilization of DCLK1.2 tail by forming a C-cap with the helical ATP-mimic segment. We aligned the intensively-studied protein kinase (PKA, pdb: 1ATP), a DCLK1.2 structure (pdb: 6kyq), and frames of our MD trajectory, which demonstrate remarkable overlap of the ATP gamma phosphate and C-tail phosphothreonine, which seemingly acts as a mimic for the ATP co-factor. As phosphorylation is reported to lead to DCLK1 inhibition, this suggests a complex mechanism of regulation, in which the DCLK-specific constraints in the G-loop, the intrinsic flexibility of the C-tail, and threonine phosphorylation, by cis or trans-mediated modification, systematically prevent hyperphosphorylation of the doublecortin domains and cellular effects.</p>
<p>Finally, we have evaluated the terminal residues in the DCLK1 C-tail, which are predicted to be intrinsically disordered. Side-by-side analysis of DCLK1.1 and DCLK1.2 in which this region is added from a common core terminating at residue 703, shows that increasing the length of the tail in both DCLK1.1 and DCLK1.2 has little additional effect on the inhibitory or stabilizing effects driven by the highly ordered tail regions that precede it. Kinase domains are regulated by IDRs in a multitude of ways, but the CAMK family is specifically enriched for adapted C-terminal extensions that, as we show here, can block the ATP and substrate binding, and enzymatically inactivate the kinase domain by occlusion of the activation loop through a flexible helical IDS on their C-tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). We note that the DCLK1.2 kinase domain crystallizes in an ‘active’ closed conformation, despite binding of the C-tail in an autoinhibitory manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Repeated packing motions of the IDS against the activation loop in all replicates of DCLK1.1 MD simulations, suggest that tail may occlude the activation loop, similar to other CAMKs, possibly pointing to a mode of <italic>cis</italic> autoregulation. Conversely, AlphaFold2 predicts the placement of the DCX domains as adjacent to the IDS in both DCLK1.1 and DCLK1.2 (Figure S1). It is possible, like other CAMKs, the IDS helps facilitate protein binding, whether to the DCX domains, calcium-modulated proteins, or other kinases.</p>

<title>Evolutionary divergence and functional specialization of DCLKs</title>
<p>For the DCLK family as a whole, we discovered phylogenetic divergence between DCLK1 and 2 as a relatively recent event, (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) in which metazoan DCLK3 is the more ancestral DCLK gene from which DCLK1 and 2 emerged after duplication. Because of shared evolutionary constraints and the recent divergence between DCLK1 and 2, we surmise the functional specialization of the DCLK1 tail is shared between these paralogs. Moreover, for the first time, we quantify key differences between human DCLK1.1 and 1.2 isoforms in the C-tail that can be reversed by amino acid changes. The differences between isoforms 1 and 2 are generated by variations in exon splicing, which change both the C-tail protein sequence, and introduce or exclude potential phosphorylation sites. Expression of the highly autoinhibitable DCLK1.2 isoform is believed to be predominant during the brain in embryogenesis, and DCLK1.1 is also thought to be present in the adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). It is therefore possible that an altered ratio in DCLK1.1/1.2 expression, accompanied by changes in the requirement for DCLK1 auto-regulation, are relevant for early neurogenesis. The overall sequence similarity at the protein level, despite the loss of a putative phosphorylation site, suggests a possible exon duplication in the C-tail where polymorphisms allow for adaptive regulation during development and proliferation. Indeed, we speculate that the induced expression of DCLK1.2 splice variants in multiple cancer subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>) is likely to be indicative of a survival and drug-resistance role that could be targetable with new types of small molecule. Although nanomolar DCLK1 ATP-site inhibitors such as DCLK1-IN-1 have been developed that can bind tightly to the DCLK1 ATP site (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1</xref></bold>), the problematic existence of human DCLK1.1 and DCLK1.2 splice variants with their distinct auto-inhibitory properties, may present a challenge to compound engagement in the cell, where relief of auto-inhibition through C-tail undocking in DCLK1.2 is likely to require a high concentration of compound in order to compete and disengage interactions at the ATP site. Indeed, although potent chemical DCLK1 inhibitors such as DCLK1-IN-1 are known to influence DCLK1 autophosphorylation and cell motility, they have relatively modest effects in cells in terms of cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). Therefore, we propose that the dual inhibitory effects of the C-tail and the transmission of this information to adjacent DCX domains, which control adaptive cellular phenotypes such as EMT in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>), may make allosteric classes of DCLK1 inhibitor a preferred therapeutic option, especially if they can be tailored specifically towards DCLK1.1 or DCLK1.2, whose autoregulation is different in terms of the varied molecular details we uncover here.</p>

<p>In the study by Venkat et al. the authors expand the current knowledge of allosteric diversity in the human kinome by c-terminal splicing variants using as a paradigm DCLK1. In this work, the authors provide evolutionary and some mechanistic evidence about how c-terminal isoform specific variants generated by alternative splicing can regulate catalytic activity by means of coupling specific phosphorylation sites to dynamical and conformational changes controlling active site and substrate pocket occupancy, as well as interfering with protein-protein interacting interfaces that altogether provides evidence of c-terminal isoform specific regulation of the catalytic activity in protein kinases.</p>
<p>The paper is overall well written, the rationale and the fundamental questions are clear and well explained, the evolutionary and MD analyses are very detailed and well explained. The methodology applied in terms of the biochemical and biophysical tools falls a bit short in some places and some comments and suggestions are given in this respect. If the authors could monitor somehow protein auto-phosphorylation as a functional readout would be very useful by means of using phospho-specific antibodies to monitor activity. Overall I think this is a study that brings some new aspects and concepts that are important for the protein kinase field, in particular the allosteric regulation of the catalytic core by c-terminal segments, and how evolutionary cues generate more sophisticated mechanisms of allosteric control in protein kinases. However a revision would be recommended.</p>

<p>In this study, the authors explore the structure/function of the DCLK kinases, most specifically DCLK1 as it is the most studied to date. Recently, the C-terminal domain has garnered attention as it was found to regulate the kinase domain, however, the different isoforms retain additional amino acid sequences with as-yet-undefined functions. The authors provide an evolutionary and biochemical characterization of these regions and provide evidence for some functionality for these additional C-terminal sequences. While these experiments are informative they do require that the protein is soluble and not membrane-bound as has been suggested to be important for functionality in other studies. Still, this is a major contribution to understanding the structure/function of these proteins that will be important in future experimental designs.</p>
