<title>Abstract</title>
<p>In many organisms, aging is a clear risk factor for increased rates of chromosome mis-segregation, the main source of aneuploidy. Here, we report that old yeast mother cells lose chromosomes by partitioning them asymmetrically to their daughter cells together with the pre-existing (old) Sindle Pole Body (centrosome equivalent in yeast). Strikingly, remodelling of the NPC and the displacement of its nuclear basket triggered these asymmetric segregation events. Concomitantly, basket displacement also caused unspliced pre-mRNAs to leak to the cytoplasm. We show that removing the introns of three genes involved in chromosome segregation was sufficient to fully suppress chromosome loss in old cells. Furthermore, promoting pre-mRNA leakage in young cells also caused asymmetric chromosome partition and loss through the same three introns. Therefore, we propose that basket displacement from NPCs and its ensuing effects on pre-mRNA quality control are a key trigger of aging phenotypes such as aneuploidy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cellular aging results in several conserved phenotypes, including chromosome mis-segregation, fragmentation of mitochondria, accumulation of damaged or misfolded proteins, and alteration of nuclear morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Strikingly, in organisms as distinct as fungi, worms and mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> aging also correlates with remodelling of the Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC), a ∼50 MDa gateway that controls mRNA export and the nucleo/cytoplasmic distribution of proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. At least in dividing cells and upon expression of the progeriatric variant of Lamin A, progerin, the most prominent change observed on NPC is the loss of their nuclear basket<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. This structure is formed by the protein TPR on the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC and acts in processes as diverse as mRNA export, the retention of pre-mRNAs in the nucleus, protein quality control and gene regulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. The central position of the NPC in eukaryotic information flow and the broad range of function assumed by its basket suggests that altering their function could have very diverse effects on cell function. However, despite this and the fact that the reorganization of NPC architecture with age is prominent in a wide range of organisms, we know little about whether and how NPC remodelling contributes to aging.</p>
<p>The unicellular fungus <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, a budding yeast, is a remarkably useful system for studying the role of NPCs in cellular aging <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Indeed, budding yeast undergoes replicative aging, causing the mother cell to bud off a limited number of daughter cells until it starts slowing down its division rate, enter senescence and die<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Importantly, several studies have emphasized that the yeast NPC is remodelled during replicative aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, but the exact consequences of its reorganization are not fully understood.</p>
<p>A prominent driver of replicative aging in budding yeast is the accumulation of extrachromosomal DNA circles (also called eccDNAs) in the mother cell nucleus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. These DNA circles form during the cell’s lifetime through excision of genomic segments, generally by recombination between repeated sequences <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. The vast majority of these circles (&gt;99%) stems from the rDNA locus and are referred to as extrachromosomal rDNA circles (ERCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. As the cell age, these circles accumulate exponentially through their replication in S-phase and their retention in the mother cell at mitosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. By the end of their life, yeast cells contain about 1000 ERCs, which represents roughly the same amount of DNA as the rest of the genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Importantly, their retention in the mother cell relies on their anchorage to NPCs via the megadalton protein complex called the SAGA complex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. These NPC-ERC units are then confined to the mother part of the dividing nucleus by a lateral diffusion barrier forming in the nuclear envelope in the future plane of cleavage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Indeed, yeast cells undergo a closed mitosis, i.e., they do not undergo nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD). Remarkably, anchorage of ERCs to NPCs results in the dissociation of their nuclear basket due to SAGA acetylating nucleoporins such as Nup60 on the nuclear side of the NPC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Consequently, a majority of the NPCs of old yeast cells lack a basket<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. However, it is unknown whether this has consequences for the physiology and survival of the cell and contributes to the aging process.</p>
<p>One way to approach the question of whether displacement of the basket from the NPCs contributes to the aging process is to determine whether other aging phenotypes depend on basket displacement and if so, how. Here we focused on chromosome instability in old yeast cells. In many metazoans, including humans, aging results in increasing rates of chromosome mis-segregation and aneuploidy, correlating with increasing prevalence of cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of chromosome segregation errors in old cells remains rudimentary. Here, we report evidence that NPC remodelling during yeast aging leads to chromosome loss from old mother cells and investigate the underlying mechanisms.</p>

<title>Aging yeast cells lose chromosomes</title>
<p>To examine whether aging affects the karyotype of yeast cells, we visualized and followed the fate of individual chromosomes in replicatively aging mother cells, using either TetO-labelled chromosome II or chromosome IV as reporters. Chromosome IV is the second longest chromosome, while chromosome II is of average size. Both chromosomes are labelled through inserting an array of 256 TetO repeats in the vicinity of their centromere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. These chromosomes were visualized by expressing fluorescently tagged versions of the TetR protein (TetR-GFP or TetR-mCherry; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A-B</xref>). We then monitored them throughout the entire replicative lifespan of yeast mother cells trapped under the microscope using a microfluidics platform <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. The replicative age of each mother cell was measured by counting the number of daughters that it budded off over time, defining how many budding events they have already completed at a given time point (completed budding events, CBE). Bud size and the number and position of the spindle pole bodies (SPBs/Centrosome equivalent, labelled with mCherry) were used to identify the cell cycle stages at which the cells were imaged (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>Analysis of these images showed that all young mother cells (∼0-3 CBE; t=0h) and their daughters contained a fluorescent dot, documenting the presence of the labelled chromosomes in all of them. However, when reaching the age of 18 to 22 CBE (t=24h), 10-15% of these now old mother cells had lost their dot (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B-C</xref>). This was observed irrespectively of which chromosome was labelled and which fluorescent tag was used. Fluorescence of the labelled SPB was not affected, indicating that dot loss was not caused by some instability of fluorophores in old cells. To test if the loss of these fluorescent chromosomal foci was due to the loss of the TetO array specifically or of the entire chromosome, we included a second label (an array of 256 repeats of the LacO sequence) in the middle of the long arm of chromosome IV (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) and asked whether the cells that lost the TetO array lost the LacO repeats as well. Analysis of these images showed that 85% of the cells lacking the TetO array had indeed lost the LacO array (50/59). Thus, these cells had probably lost the entire chromosome. Supporting this notion, loss of the TetO array was fatal to the cells. Indeed, more than 99% (145/146 chromosome II loss events) of the dot-less cells failed to divide further, as expected for a haploid cell losing an entire chromosome. We concluded that much like many other organisms, yeast undergoes a burst of chromosome instability when reaching an old age (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A, C</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to chromosomes, extra-chromosomal DNA circles accumulate in the yeast mother cell with age rather than being lost <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Similarly, deleting the centromere from a chromosome causes the retention of both sister chromatids in the mother cell <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Remarkably, inserting a centromeric sequence (<italic>CEN</italic>) into a DNA circle, was sufficient to cause this mini-chromosome to be lost from aged mother cells at a similar rate as that observed for full-size chromosomes (∼20% of old cells; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B-C</xref>). To exclude the possibility that the TetO array used to label them is the cause of chromosome and mini-chromosome loss in aging, we also characterized the stability of a circular mini-chromosome expressing short-lived GFP as a marker instead of TetO repeats. Scoring of the GFP signal demonstrated that old mother cells lost these mini-chromosomes at essentially the same rate as they lose the TetO labelled one (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B-C</xref>). Therefore, the presence of a centromere was necessary and sufficient for chromosomes and mini chromosomes to be lost from aging mother cells. We concluded that chromosome loss in old cells is driven by their centromere.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Aged cells asymmetrically partition both sister chromatids to the bud</title>
<p>Given the prominent role of the centromere in chromosome loss, we rationalized that the loss of chromosomes in old mother cells could be due to mitotic mis-segregation events. To determine whether it was the case, we next focused our analysis on the cells that were imaged during their mitosis in our time-lapse recordings of aging cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Analysis of anaphases in old mother cells revealed a striking increase in the rate of chromosome II, IV and minichromosome missegregation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). In 600 total anaphase events captured in our movies we found that 66 (11%) of them co-segregated the labelled sister-chromatids to a single pole with, 54/66(82%) of the missegregation events resulting in asymmetric partition of the chromatids to the bud of these old mother cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). This was virtually never observed in young cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-C</xref>). Remarkably, the frequency of chromosome loss in the old mother cells and of sister-chromatids segregating asymmetrically to the bud were in the same size order, irrespective of whether chromosome II or chromosome IV was labelled. Therefore, chromosome loss from old mother cells seems fully explained by a rise in sister-chromatid non-disjunction with age and the resulting segregation of chromosomes asymmetrically to the bud. Thus, we examined the mechanism behind this peculiar mode of directed chromosome mis-segregation.</p>

</fig>
<p>In budding yeast, the pre-existing (old) SPB, i.e., the SPB that the cell inherited from the previous mitosis, segregates to the bud in ∼95% of mitoses, i.e., in a highly biased manner <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. This can be easily monitored when stable SPB components, such as the core SPB protein Spc42, are labelled with mCherry, the maturation of which is relatively slow (∼45 minutes half-time) relative to the duration of yeast mitosis (∼50 minutes from spindle assembly to completion of cytokinesis). Therefore, in cells expressing Spc42-mCherry as a reporter, the old SPB (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, red arrowhead) shines brighter than the newly synthesized one. Given the convergent bias of SPB and sister-chromatid inheritance by the bud of old cells, we asked whether in old mother cells it is the old SPB that drives the non-disjoining sister-chromatids to the bud. In other words, we wondered whether the co-segregating sister-chromatids attach to and co-segregate with the old SPB. To test this possibility, we examined the partition of the labelled chromosomes relative to the old and new SPBs in old mother cells (t=24h, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2D, E</xref>). In about 10% of old cells, SPB inheritance is inverted, i.e., the old SPB mis-segregates to the mother cell <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Analysis of these events indicated that the non-disjoining sister-chromatids followed the old SPB to the mother cell in 80% of the cases instead of going to the bud (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2D, E</xref>). We conclude that chromosome loss in aging mother cells is due to preferential attachment of sister-chromatids to the old SPB, which then partitions them asymmetrically to the bud.</p>
<p>In budding yeast, both sister chromatids initially attach in a syntelic manner to the old SPB upon replication, as this SPB is the first to be available. These initial syntelic attachments are then dissolved by the aurora B kinase to allow sister-chromatids to reorient and ultimately reach bi-orientation and partition symmetrically in mitosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. As a consequence, failure to correct initial attachments errors causes sister-chromatids to co-segregate with the old SPB to the bud <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Therefore, we hypothesized that the loss of chromosomes by mother cells to their daughters might be due to the error correction pathway being impaired in old yeast cells. To test this idea, we analysed the effects of reducing Ipl1/aurora B function during aging. Cells carrying the temperature sensitive <italic>ipl1-321</italic> mutant allele and grown at a permissive temperature (27°C) showed no detectable chromosome loss at a young age (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). However, they started losing chromosomes prematurely during replicative aging (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>), resulting in a shortened lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Sup Fig 1A</xref>). Strikingly, the chromosome loss rate of the old <italic>ipl1-321</italic> mutant cells (t=24h) was undistinguishable from that of the wild type cells, indicating that the effects of age and reducing Ipl1 activity were not additive (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). This suggests that age and the <italic>ipl1-321</italic> mutation affect the same pathway. We concluded that old cells lose chromosomes due to defects in the pathway dedicated to correcting chromosome attachment errors.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>ERC accumulation drives chromosome loss in aging</title>
<p>To identify mechanisms behind the deterioration of mitotic error correction with age, we investigated whether chromosome loss is causally linked to other aging events, particularly to the displacement of the basket from NPCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Given that basket displacement is triggered by accumulating ERCs and their SAGA-dependent anchorage to NPCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, we first investigated whether ERC accumulation promotes chromosome loss. Recruitment of the deacetylase Sir2 to rDNA repeats is one of the mechanisms by which cells keep the rate of ERC formation low. Therefore, the <italic>sir2Δ</italic> mutant cells show an increased rate of ERC formation, accumulate these circles quicker and prematurely compared to wild type cells, and show a reduced longevity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Supporting the notion that ERC accumulation might promote chromosome loss, these mutant cells also showed a strong increase in chromosome loss, prematurely in life (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and Sup 2A). To test further whether ERC accumulation could promote chromosome loss, we asked whether reducing the rate of ERC formation delays it. Recombination in the rDNA locus and the consequent excision of ERCs is stimulated by the presence of a replication fork barrier between rDNA units. While these barriers prevent the transcription machinery to collide with replication forks coming from neighbouring rDNA units, the stalling forks are fragile, causing high rates of double strand breaks. Therefore, removing these fork barriers, for example by inactivating the fork barrier protein Fob1, drastically decreases the rate at which ERCs form and accumulate, stabilizes the nuclear baskets of NPCs and prolongs the life span of the cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Thus, we asked whether inactivating Fob1 had any effect on chromosome loss in old cells. Analysis of chromosome II presence in <italic>fob1Δ</italic> mutant cells trapped in our microfluidics platform demonstrated that only very few of them had lost the TetO signal even after dividing 18 times or more (t=24h; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Sup Fig 2A</xref>). We concluded from these data that chromosome loss correlated remarkably well with ERC levels, suggesting that ERC accumulation and hence, possibly the displacement of the basket from NPCs might promote chromosome loss. Further supporting this notion, removal of the SAGA subunit Sgf73, which mediates ERC attachment to NPCs and the subsequent displacement of their nuclear basket, phenocopied the effect of the <italic>fob1Δ</italic> mutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Unlike the wild type cells, the <italic>sgf73Δ</italic> mutant cells failed to show any significant increase in chromosome loss at any age (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref> Sup <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). Thus, our data suggest that ERC formation and anchorage to NPCs triggers chromosome loss in old yeast cells.</p>

<title>Nuclear basket remodelling drives chromosome loss</title>
<p>We reported that SAGA-dependent anchorage of ERCs to NPCs leads to the displacement of the NPCs’ nuclear basket<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. To investigate whether basket displacement promotes chromosome loss in some manner, we sought next to genetically destabilize the basket and determined whether this accelerated aging and the concomitant rise of chromosome instability. To do this, we disrupted the <italic>MLP1</italic> gene, encoding the major isoform of the core basket protein TPR in yeast, and monitored the effect of that mutation on chromosome II stability in aging cells. In stark contrast to the <italic>sgf73Δ</italic> and <italic>fob1Δ</italic> single mutant and the wild type cells, the <italic>mlp1Δ</italic> single mutant cells exhibited a rapid increase in their chromosome loss as they aged, along with a shortened lifespan (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A-B</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Sup Fig 2A</xref>).

<title>Introns in genes of the aurora B pathway drive asymmetric chromosome partition in aging</title>
<p>The displacement of the nuclear basket from NPCs upon ERC anchorage weakened the molecular pathway that corrects chromosome attachment errors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). This in turn caused old mother cells to lose chromosomes to their buds. We wondered about the molecular mechanism linking asymmetric chromosome partition to basket displacement. The basket of the nuclear pore has been involved in various processes, such as mRNA export <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, protein quality control <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, docking of environmentally regulated genes to the nuclear periphery upon their induction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, as well as the retention in the nucleus of faulty mRNAs, such as unspliced pre-mRNAs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, as well as docking Mad1 and Mad2, two key components of the mitotic Spindle Assembly Checkpoint(SAC), to the NPC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The SAC components Mad1 and Mad2 bind Mlp1 and Mlp2 as well as Nup60 at the basket of the NPC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. However, basket dissociation, which delocalizes Mad1/2 from the nuclear periphery, does not appear to interfere with their function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, we investigated whether SAC dysfunction could account for aging phenotypes caused by basket dissociation and for the premature aging phenotype of the <italic>mlp1Δ</italic> mutant cells. Arguing against this hypothesis, the <italic>mad1Δ</italic> and <italic>mad2Δ</italic> single mutant cells exhibited no change in replicative longevity compared to the wild type cells and did not phenocopy <italic>mlp1Δ</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Sup Fig 3A</xref>). Therefore, we searched for other mechanisms through which basket displacement could trigger chromosome loss.</p>
<p>While perusing through the list of genes involved in chromosome segregation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>) we noticed that, surprisingly, only three of them contain an intron, namely <italic>NBL1</italic>, <italic>MCM21</italic> and <italic>GLC7</italic>. Strikingly, these three genes function with Ipl1/aurora B in preventing syntelic chromosome attachment. Nbl1/borealin is a component of the chromosome passenger complex of which aurora B/Ipl1 is the catalytic subunit. Mcm21/CENP-O is a docking receptor for Ipl1/aurora B at kinetochores. Glc7/PP1A is the protein phosphatase 1, which counteracts aurora B by dephosphorylating its targets at the outer-kinetochore <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Intrigued by this remarkable convergence, we wondered whether asymmetric chromosome partition in aging could stem from the presence of these three introns in error correction genes. Indeed, we rationalized that displacement of the basket from NPCs could potentially affect the regulation, export and hence expression of intron-containing transcripts, specifically, thereby affecting the function of the <italic>NBL1</italic>, <italic>MCM21</italic> and <italic>GLC7</italic> genes.</p>

<p>To investigate the possibility that the introns of <italic>GLC7, MCM21, NBL1</italic> contribute to the rise of chromosome loss in old cells, we removed them from each of the three genes (<italic>-Δi</italic> alleles) and imaged the mutant cells throughout their replicative lifespan. Removing their introns individually or all three simultaneously (<italic>3xΔi</italic> strain) had no detectable effects on chromosome segregation in young cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). In sharp contrast, simultaneously removing all three introns nearly completely suppressed chromosome loss in old cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B-C</xref>). Removing them individually or in pair did so as well, albeit the effects were milder. Removing the introns of the two α-tubulin genes <italic>TUB1</italic> and <italic>TUB3</italic> simultaneously had no effect, indicating that the effects observed with the introns of <italic>NBL1</italic>, <italic>MCM21</italic> and <italic>GLC7</italic> were specific (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). The effects observed were similar for chromosome II and chromosome IV, indicating that the role of these introns was not chromosome specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Sup Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, removing these three introns also suppressed the occurrence of asymmetric anaphases in old cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), supporting the view that asymmetric chromosome segregation and chromosome loss go hand-in-hand and are under the control of these three introns. Strengthening this conclusion, removal of these introns also suppressed chromosome loss in the <italic>ipl1-321</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Sup Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>Remarkably, simultaneous removal of <italic>MCM21</italic>, <italic>NBL1</italic> and <italic>GLC7</italic> introns had also a substantial effect on the longevity of the cells, extending their replicative lifespan up to ∼20% (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). A similar effect was observed in the <italic>ipl1-321</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Sup Fig 1A</xref>). This suggests that chromosome loss is the first direct cause of death for many yeast cells upon aging, although other mechanisms eventually take over when chromosome loss is abrogated.</p>

<title>Basket destabilization causes intron-dependent chromosome loss in young cells</title>
<p>Thus, our data indicate that basket dissociation from NPCs promotes chromosome loss through an intron-dependent dampening of the error correction pathway. To test this idea more in depth, we asked whether mutations affecting the nuclear basket also promote chromosome loss outside of the aging context. Thus, we characterized chromosome segregation in young <italic>mlp1Δ</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-C</xref>). Analysis of chromosome II segregation indicated that the <italic>mlp1Δ</italic> mutant cells not only exhibited a four-fold increase in their chromosome mis-segregation rate compared to the young wild type cells, but ∼80% of these mis-segregation events followed the old SPB, as in old cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Furthermore, this effect was suppressed upon removal of the introns of <italic>MCM21</italic>, <italic>NBL1</italic> and <italic>GLC7</italic>(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Therefore, although to a lower extent than in old cells, defects of the nuclear basket result in asymmetric chromosome partition also in young cells.

We concluded that intron-dependent dampening of the error correction pathway is one, even if not the only one, progeriatric effects of the <italic>mlp1Δ</italic> mutation.

<title>Old cells leak pre-mRNA to the cytoplasm</title>
<p>Furthermore, our data suggested that the role of the nuclear basket in enforcing proper chromosome segregation involved its function in mRNA processing and quality control, and particularly in some process related to splicing or to intron function. Thus, to explore this possibility, we next investigated whether old mother cells show defects in pre-mRNA quality control. Indeed, basket mutant cells fail to retain unspliced pre-mRNAs in the nucleus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. We therefore reasoned that old yeast mother cells might show similar defects.</p>
<p>As a first proof of principle, we went on to characterize the localization of intronic RNA sequences in young and old cells, using single molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smRNA FISH). For these studies, we focused on three introns, namely those of the <italic>DBP2</italic>, <italic>YRA1</italic> and <italic>GLC7</italic> genes. Indeed, most yeast introns are short (50-150 nucleotides) and well below the size detectable by smRNA FISH (&gt;500 nts, ideally &gt;1 kb). In the yeast genome, only 20 introns are longer than the required minimal size. Thus, we chose to develop probes for the long introns, namely those of <italic>DBP2</italic> (766 nts), and <italic>YRA1</italic> (1002 nts), and for obvious reasons for <italic>GLC7</italic> (525 nts). The introns of <italic>NBL1</italic> (66 nts) and <italic>MCM21</italic> (88 nts) are too short for this method. Cohorts of old cells were collected using the Mother Enrichment Program (MEP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> followed by FACS sorting to reach high homogeneity. By inducing cell death in the daughter cells specifically, the MEP ensures that aging mother cells are diluted linearly instead of exponentially in the population, greatly simplifying the isolation of very old cells. FACS sorting ensured that the cohorts were free of young cells and young cell debris. With each of these three series of smRNA FISH probes, we detected one or two nuclear foci in young cells. Only very rarely did we observe a focus in the cytoplasm (&lt;3% of the cells). No foci were detected in the corresponding <italic>Δi</italic> strains, demonstrating probe specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Sup Fig 4</xref>). In contrast, for each of the three introns tested, smRNA FISH detected intronic RNA sequences in the cytoplasm of the majority of old cells. For example, in the case of <italic>GLC7,</italic> ∼70% of smRNA FISH foci were found in the cytoplasm of old mother cells, compared to ∼3% in young cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A-B</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Sup Fig 4</xref>). Together, these data indicated that 3 of 3 tested introns showed a strong tendency to leak to the cytoplasm in old mother cells. However, this first test did not clarify whether the full pre-mRNA or only the intron escaped from the nucleus.</p>

<p>To address this question very directly, we turned to a functional assay and monitored the translation of an unspliced pre-mRNA reporter in the cytoplasm. This fluorescent reporter construct expresses GFP upon proper splicing of the nascent transcript, or mCherry, coded in the intron, when the unspliced pre-mRNA leaks out of the nucleus and hence, becomes translated (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Cells carrying this construct integrated at the <italic>TRP1</italic> locus were trapped and imaged in our microfluidics platform. The fluorescence levels of the two reporter fluorophores as well as the number of completed budding events of the recorded cells were measured as they aged. Analysis of the fluorescence signal established that the mCherry/GFP ratio increased in old compared to young cells, demonstrating elevated translation of the pre-mRNA in the cytoplasm of aged cells compared to young ones (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6D-E</xref>).</p>
<p>Consistent with leakage and translation of this reporter depending on ERC accumulation, the mCherry/GFP ratio increased prematurely and to a higher level in the <italic>sir2Δ</italic> mutant, compared to the wild type cells. In reverse, the <italic>fob1Δ</italic> mutant cells showed a lowered mCherry/GFP ratio, which did not increase much during their lifespan (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6D-E</xref>). Thus, we conclude that ERC formation and accumulation promotes pre-mRNA leakage during yeast aging, as expected from their effect on the NPCs’ nuclear basket.</p>

<title>pre-mRNA leakage induces asymmetric chromosome partition</title>
<p>Given the results above, we wondered whether chromosome loss in old cells is linked to their failure to retain pre-mRNAs in the nucleus. Thus, we asked whether inducing pre-mRNA leakage would alone be sufficient for triggering chromosome loss. The two yeast SR-protein Gbp2 and Hrb1 have been implicated in the retention of pre-mRNAs in the nucleus by binding intron-containing transcripts and delaying their export until they are properly spliced or degraded<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>.Therefore<italic>, hrb1Δ gbp2Δ</italic> double mutant cells leak pre-mRNA to the cytoplasm at a higher rate than wild type cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Thus, we asked whether these double mutant cells showed any tendency to lose the labelled chromosome II. As a control, we asked whether the <italic>snu66Δ</italic> mutation, which affects the spliceosome itself directly <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>, lead to similar phenotypes.</p>
<p>The young spliceosome-defective, <italic>snu66Δ</italic> mutant cells did exhibit a five-fold elevated level of chromosome mis-segregation compared to young wild type cells. However, this mis-segregation was not biased towards any specific SPB (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7A-B</xref>), suggesting that it involved a distinct mechanism than that observed in old cells and in young cells lacking the basket protein Mlp1. In contrast to the <italic>snu66Δ</italic> mutant, the <italic>hrb1Δ gbp2Δ</italic> double mutant cells, showed an even stronger increase in their rate of chromosome mis-segregation, which was more than ten-fold above that of young wild type cells. Furthermore, sister-chromatid mis-segregation was strongly biased towards the old SPB. Removing the introns of <italic>GLC7, MCM21</italic> and <italic>NBL1</italic> suppressed this chromosome segregation defect (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>).

<p>We conclude that the loss of the NPCs’ basket and subsequent leakage of pre-mRNAs impairs the correction of syntelic attachments by the Ipl1/aurora B pathway, resulting in asymmetric partition of sister-chromatids and chromosome loss with age.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Aging manifests itself through a broad diversity of conserved cellular phenotypes but except in few cases we know little about how these relate or are causally linked to each other<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. In this study we investigated whether NPC remodelling in old mother cells contributes to the emergence of other aging phenotypes, taking chromosome loss as a study case<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. We show that NPC remodelling is both necessary and sufficient for the raise of chromosome loss with age and provide insights into the mechanisms involved. Indeed, interventions that promote displacement of the NPCs’ basket and basket defects in general promoted non-disjunction and mis-segregation of sister-chromatids to the bud, and hence chromosome loss in the old mother cell. These interventions include mutations that stimulate ERC formation and removal of the main yeast TPR isoform, Mlp1. In reverse, interventions that prevent NPC remodelling, such as delaying ERC accumulation, their anchorage to NPCs and the recruitment of SAGA to NPCs, restored proper chromosome segregation in old cells and prevented chromosome loss. Thus, NPC remodelling appeared as the pivotal point for triggering chromosome loss in old cells.</p>
<p>Two potential caveats should be considered. First, the <italic>sir2Δ</italic> and <italic>fob1Δ</italic> mutations have each more effects than only influencing ERC formation. The <italic>sir2Δ</italic> mutant cells lose silencing of the hidden mating type loci, genetically behaving as diploids, fail to silence subtelomeric regions and act through some yet unknown mechanism on the maintenance of proper proteostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Likewise, the <italic>fob1Δ</italic> mutation renders the rDNA locus unstable, which might interfere with rRNA transcription and ribosome biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. However, their only clear common denominator is that they both affect ERC formation, and hence NPC remodelling even if in opposite manners<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Moreover, the <italic>sgf73Δ</italic> mutation phenocopies the effects of the <italic>fob1Δ</italic> mutation. Here again the only known functional overlap between Fob1 and Sgf73 resides in their requirements for the accumulation of ERCs in the mother cell, and indirectly (Fob1) or directly (Sgf73), for their anchorage to NPCs and the consequent displacement of NPCs’ basket<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. In fitting, the fact that destabilizing the basket also promotes the premature onset of chromosome loss reinforces the notion that it is indeed the displacement of the basket from NPCs that triggers chromosome loss upon ERC accumulation.</p>
<p>A second possible caveat is that chromosome loss could be linked to aging in some other manner. The effects of the diverse perturbations listed above would promote chromosome loss indirectly, via the effects that they have on cellular aging. To address this possibility, we investigated the molecular mechanisms that link basket displacement and chromosome loss. Our data reveal that chromosome loss is due to the non-correction of syntelic chromosome attachments in old cells. In young cells, such corrections are enforced by the kinase aurora B and its accessory factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Our data also show that the inhibition of correction in old cells requires the presence of three introns, those standing in the genes <italic>NBL1</italic>, <italic>MCM21</italic> and <italic>GLC7</italic>. These three genes are the only genes of the chromosome segregation machinery to have kept an intron. Strikingly, the proteins Nbl1, Mcm21 and Glc7 are all involved in the error correction pathway, together with aurora B/Ipl1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Removing their introns sufficed for restoring proper attachment correction and chromosome segregation in old cells and for suppressing the premature chromosome loss phenotype of the <italic>ipl1-321</italic> mutant cells grown at semi-permissive temperature. Intron removal delays cell death but does not abrogate aging. Furthermore, the suppression of chromosome mis-segregation upon removal of these introns is not only observed in old wild type cells but also in young <italic>mlp1Δ</italic> mutant cells. Thus, intron removal separates aging and chromosome loss, indicating that the action of these introns is part of the proximal cause of chromosome loss and is independent of age. Therefore, our data indicate that there is a direct, intron-dependent link between basket displacement from NPCs and chromosome loss. We suggest that this link relates to the role of the nuclear basket of the NPC in inhibiting the export of unspliced pre-mRNAs out of the nucleus, and hence, in mRNA quality control. The fact that another, independent set of mutations that also interfere with pre-mRNA retention in the nucleus, such as the <italic>gbp2Δ hrb1Δ</italic> double mutant cells, also increase the rate of chromosome loss through the same three introns strengthens this conclusion. Thus, together our data establish that displacement of the nuclear basket from NPCs in old mother cell triggers chromosome non-disjunction and loss.</p>
<p>This conclusion has several consequences and opens new questions. The key question stems from our observation that releasing pre-mRNA from the nucleus relaxes the control that cells impose on chromosome attachment. The question is, how does this work? Does it involve the translation of the pre-mRNAs in the cytoplasm? Does it come about through the correlated loss of properly mature mRNAs and hence, the reduced expression of their products? Two arguments speak against these interpretations. First, if any of these two options were to account for the effect of pre-mRNA leakage, mutations affecting splicing efficiency would lead to the same effects. However, tempering with the spliceosome does not affect the correction of chromosome attachment errors to any extent and specificity close to the effects of pre-mRNA leakage. Second, since Mcm21 and Glc7 have opposite effects on chromosome correction it is unclear how impairing the expression of both would lead to the synergistic effects that we observe between them. Finally, analysis of RNA-seq data from replicatively aged cells indicate that if aging indeed impairs the splicing of some transcripts, such as those encoding ribosomal proteins, it stimulates that of others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. This suggests that aging has a non-univocal effect on intron-containing transcripts. It will be important to determine whether basket displacement contributes to these effects, how it does so and whether this could explain the effect it has on the error correction pathway.</p>
<p>Our observations that basket displacement has such profound and highly specific impacts on processes functionally very distant from that of the NPC, such as chromosome segregation, has several consequences. First, it means that NPC remodelling could affect many more cellular functions than only chromosome segregation. Interestingly, beyond mRNA quality control the basket of the NPC is also involved in protein quality control and the activation of environmentally regulated genes, two processes that are indeed impaired in old cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Thus, basket displacement might contribute to these phenotypes in aging cells. It is also very tempting to speculate that the role of the basket in mRNA quality control could affect more than only chromosome segregation. Indeed, while budding yeasts have kept only a subset of the introns of their ancestors, these introns are not distributed randomly and seem to be enriched in very suggestive genes, such as genes coding for ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and proteasome subunits, components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and ribosomal proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Since decay of the ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, mitochondrial membrane potential and function and of ribosome assembly are classical and ubiquitous hallmarks of aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, it is possible that basket displacement in old cells contributes to the emergence of these aging phenotypes as well.</p>
<p>A second type of consequences emerging from our observations stems from the fact that displacement of the NPCs’ basket is also observed in stressed cells and not solely in the context of aging. For example, heat shock also causes basket displacement in yeast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is possible that the downstream effects we observe in old cells also take place during stress response. In this respect, it is interesting to note that heat shock has been associated with a strong raise in aneuploidy in yeast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Furthermore, aneuploidy is a frequent response to environmental stresses and a primary mechanism for the emergence of stress resistant clones in fungi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the chromosome mis-segregation resulting from basket displacement might be a selected response to stress. It might indeed be selectively advantageous for cells to have means to promote karyotype variations when their survival is in question. It is therefore worth considering that a similar process, perhaps using similar mechanisms, underlies the aneuploidy of cancer cells.</p>
<p>Third, the role of basket displacement in the emergence of aging phenotypes is likely not a peculiarity of yeast. Using proteomics, basket displacement has been inferred to take place in aging cells such as the hepatocytes of old mice and humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. Little is known about whether the nuclear basket plays any similar role in pre-mRNA retention in the nucleus of metazoans as of yeast cells, but it is still striking that intron-retention is one of the hallmarks of aging on the metazoan transcriptome, and that pre-mRNA processing genes are important in mitotic stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. Such intron-retention would be expected if some transcripts tend to escape the nucleus prematurely. More striking maybe, the perhaps most ubiquitous effect of the expression of the progeriatric variant of lamin A, progerin, across cell types is the displacement of the nuclear basket protein TPR from NPCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. We know still very little about the impact of basket displacement in the etiology of the Gilford-Hutchinson Progeria Syndrome, but our yeast studies suggest that it might be relevant. If so, investigating the potential effects of progerin on pre-mRNA leakage might become an essential step towards understanding and perhaps mitigating the effects of progerin expression.</p>
<p>In a broader sense, our findings might bring fundamental insights towards our understanding of aging. For decades, the role of ERCs in aging has been perceived as a yeast peculiarity. However, the effect it has on NPCs may close the gap. On one hand, it seems to illuminate what might be the commonality between ERC-driven aging in yeast and other aging processes in other eukaryotes. Indeed, the basket-centric view of aging that we propose here would explain how ERCs actually cause aging in yeast and indicate that while ERC accumulation might be an idiosyncrasy of yeast, the downstream events are not. On the other hand, this idea open two corollary questions. 1) What is the biological significance of eccDNAs promoting basket displacement in yeast? 2) What causes basket displacement in other aging systems. We are intrigued by the idea that ERCs and any replicating eccDNA for that matter are the closest mimics that laboratory yeast strain may encounter of pathogenic DNA of exogenous origin. In that perspective, basket displacement and the ensuing effects might have first appeared as a response to infections. In other words, yeast aging might reflect the activity of a death pathway that normally functions in pathogen control. It might represent some fungal version of what an auto-inflammatory or auto-immune response in metazoans would be. Therefore, it will be interesting to investigate whether exogenous or non-chromosomal DNA, such as possibly that of viruses, also triggers the displacement of the nuclear basket from NPCs in yeast and other systems, and whether this contributes to either or both of anti-viral defence and aging. If so, aging might have emerged as an anti-viral defence.</p>

<title>Microscopy</title>
<p>For confocal fluorescent microscopy, yeast cells were precultured in YPD, and then washed in synthetic drop-out medium. One ml of cells from exponential growing cultures with OD &lt;1 was concentrated by centrifugation at 1500 rcf, washed in SD complete, and resuspended in ∼10 µl of low fluorescent SD-medium, spotted on a round coverslip and immobilized with a SD/agar patch. The cells were imaged in &gt;15 z-stacks slices with 0.3 μm spacing, with a 100×/1.4 NA objective on a DeltaVision microscope (Applied Precision) equipped with a CCD HQ2 camera (Roper), 250 W Xenon lamps, Softworx software (Applied Precision) and a temperature chamber set to 30°C.</p>

<title>Aging microfluidic platform</title>
<p>Chromosome segregation and protein intensity during aging were assessed using the high-throughput yeast aging analysis (HYAA) microfluidics dissection platform <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. The PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) microchannel is made by soft-lithography and bonded on the 30 mm micro-well cover glass in the 55 mm glass bottom dish (Cellvis, CA, USA). For the lifespan analyses, a chip with a new cell trapping design was used <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, to ensure excellent retention of old cells.</p>
<p>To start the aging experiment, yeast cells were pre-cultured for 24 hr in SD-full media supplemented with 0.1% Albumin Bovine Serum (protease free BSA; Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium). Young cells from an exponentially growing culture were captured in the traps of the microfluidic chip; the chip was continuously flushed with fresh medium at a constant flow of 10 μl/min, using a Harvard PHD Ultra syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holiston, MA, USA) with 60 ml syringe per lane, with inner diameter 26.7 mm (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Bright field images in a single z focal plane were recorded every 15 min throughout the duration of the entire experiment to measure replicative age of cells. To record fluorescent signals, images with a florescent lamp and at least 13x z-stacks (0.5 μm step) were acquired in 12h intervals. For imaging we used an epi-fluorescent microscope (TiE, Nikon Instruments, Tokyo, Japan) controlled by Micro-Manager 1.4.23 software <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>, with a Plan Apo 60 × 1.4 NA objective. For fluorescence illumination of the GFP and mCherry labelled proteins, a Lumencor Spectra-X LED Light Engine was used. Z stacks of &gt;13 slices with 0.5 μm spacing were recorded for fluorescent imaging every 12 hours in order to cover the entire volume of the nucleus during the aging process. Transmitted light imaging was done in a single Z plane to minimize the light exposure of the cells. The age of the cell was defined by the number of daughter cells that emerged during the budding cycles (CBE).</p>

<title>Chromosome loss assessment</title>
<p>For the assessment of chromosome and mini-chromosome loss and mis-segregation in aging, trapped cells in the chip that had the labeled chromosomes at the initial time point of 0h (∼virtually all cells) were followed in transmitted light channel and fluorescent images were acquired every 12 hours. Only cells where the entire volume of the nucleus was in focus and imaged, and where SPB was clearly visible were considered in the analysis. The background fluorescence was subtracted in FIJI using a subtract background function. The aged nuclei were examined by scrolling through the z stack (&gt;13 stacks, 0,5um step) in both channels, to validate the presence of the SPBs and TetR foci in the mother or the daughter cell. “Chromosome loss” refers to two quantified events: 1) The absence of the chromosome from a mother or a daughter cell compartment during anaphase 2) A G1 mother cell that just underwent its final division and is clearly viable, with a present SPB dot, but no chromosome dot. When “Chromosome loss” is listed, it pertains to the sum of these two events. When “chromosome loss in anaphase” is listed, it only pertains to the loss frequency observed during anaphase. Cells which lost chromosomes due to abnormal mitotic events in the last replicative division, such as SPB overamplification or full nuclei migration into the bud (Combined ∼10% of all cells in the final replicative division) were discarded from the quantifications. All cells were examined in the DIC channel for signs of disrupted morphology indicating cell death and followed up in DIC to confirm cell death after chromosome loss. For the assessment of minichromosome loss in aging (TetO array or ubi-GFP minichromosome) the yeast cultures were grown in SD-LEU or SD-URA selective media enabling minichromosome maintenance in all starting young cells. When loaded onto an aging chip cell were transferred to SD complete media, allowing them to lose the minichromosome during aging without inducing cell death. As the cells were grown in selective media, the minichromosome loss rate at 0h is N/A. In general, aging chips are not suitable for measurement of chromosome loss rate in young cells, as cells within the young population that are missegregating chromosomes are usually stressed and enlarged, and thus cannot be loaded into the microfluidic traps intended for the normal young cells. For chromosome missegregation rates in young cells, we have used classical confocal imaging on a patch of SD agar, as described in the Microscopy section.</p>

<title>Measurements of chromosome loss per CBE</title>
<p>To measure chromosome loss probability per Completed Budding Event (CBE), we utilized at least 150 cells per genotype and quantified the number of cells that lost the reporter chromosome during a specific replicative division. The number of losses at a specific CBE was then divided by total number of cells which passed though mitosis at that CBE number to give the probability of chromosome loss per CBE. Categories of 5x CBE and its mean value of chromosome loss were plotted along with its SD.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors explore a novel mechanism linking aging to chromosome mis-segregation and aneuploidy in yeast cells. They reveal that, in old yeast mother cells, chromosome loss occurs through asymmetric partitioning of chromosomes to daughter cells, a process coupled with the inheritance of an old Spindle Pole Body. Remarkably, the authors identify that remodeling of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), specifically the displacement of its nuclear basket, triggers these asymmetric segregation events. This disruption also leads to the leakage of unspliced pre-mRNAs into the cytoplasm, highlighting a breakdown in RNA quality control. Through genetic manipulation, the study demonstrates that removing introns from key chromosome segregation genes is sufficient to prevent chromosome loss in aged cells. Moreover, promoting pre-mRNA leakage in young cells mimics the chromosome mis-segregation observed in old cells, providing further evidence for the critical role of nuclear envelope integrity and RNA processing in aging-related genome instability.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The findings presented are not only intriguing but also well-supported by robust experimental data, highlighting a previously unrecognized connection between nuclear envelope integrity, RNA processing, and genome stability in aging cells, deepening our understanding of the molecular basis of chromosome loss in aging.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Further analysis of yeast aging data from microfluidic experiments will provide important information about the dynamic features and prevalence of the key aging phenotypes, e.g. pre-mRNA leakage and chromosome loss, reported in this work. In addition, a discussion would be needed to clarify the relationship between &quot;chromosome loss&quot; in this study and &quot;genomic missegregation&quot; reported previously in yeast aging.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors make the interesting discovery of increased chromosome non-dysjunction in aging yeast mother cells. The phenotype is quite striking and well supported with solid experimental evidence. This is quite significant to a haploid cell (as used here) - loss of an essential chromosome leads to death soon thereafter. The authors then work to tie this phenotype to other age-associated phenotypes that have been previously characterized: accumulation of extrachromosomal rDNA circles that then correlate with compromised nuclear pore export functions, which correlates with &quot;leaky&quot; pores that permit unspliced mRNA messages to be inappropriately exported to the cytoplasm. They then infer that three intron containing mRNAs that encode portions in resolving sister chromatid separation during mitosis, are unspliced in this age-associated defect and thus lead to the non-dysjunction problem.</p>
<p>Strengths: The discovery of age-associated chromosome non-dysjunction is an interesting discovery, and it is demonstrated in a convincing fashion with &quot;classic&quot; microscopy-based single cell fluorescent chromosome assays that are appropriate and seem robust. The correlation of this phenotype with other age-associated phenotypes - specifically extrachromosomal rDNA circles and nuclear pore dysfunction - is supported by in vivo genetic manipulations that have been well-characterized in the past.</p>
<p>In addition, the application of the single cell mRNA splicing defect reporter showed very convincingly that general mRNA splicing is compromised in aged cells. Such a pleiotropic event certainly has big implications.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The biggest weakness is &quot;connecting all the dots&quot; of causality and linking the splicing defect to chromosome disjunction. I commend the authors for making a valiant effort in this regard, but there are many caveats to this interpretation. While the &quot;triple intron&quot; removal suppressed the non-dysjunction defect in aged cells, this could simply be a kinetic fix, where a slowdown in the relevant aspects of mitosis, could give the cell time to resolve the syntelic attachment of the chromatids. To this point, I note that the intronless version of GLC7, which affects the most dramatic suppression of the three genes, is reported by one of the authors to have a slow growth rate (Parenteau et al, 2008 - <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e07-12-1254">https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e07-12-1254</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Lastly, the Herculean effort to perform FISH of the introns in the cytoplasm is quite literally at the statistical limit of this assay. The data were not as robust as the other assays employed through this study. The data show either &quot;no&quot; signal for the young cells or a signal of 0, 1,or 2 FISH foci in the aged cells. In a Poisson distribution, which this follows, it is improbable to distinguish between these differences.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Mirkovic et al explore the cause underlying development of aneuploidy during aging. This paper provides a compelling insight into the basis of chromosome missegregation in aged cells, tying this phenomenon to the established Nuclear Pore Complex architecture remodeling that occurs with aging across a large span of diverse organisms. The authors first establish that aged mother cells exhibit aberrant error correction during mitosis. As extrachromosomal rDNA circles (ERCs) are known to increase with age and lead to NPC dysfunction that can result in leakage of unspliced pre-mRNAs, Mirkovic et al search for intron-containing genes in yeast that may be underlying chromosome missegregation, identifying three genes in the aurora B-dependent error correction pathway: MCM21, NBL1, and GLC7. Interestingly, intron-less mutants in these genes suppress chromosome loss in aged cells, with a significant impact observed when all three introns were deleted (3x∆i). The 3x∆i mutant also suppresses the increased chromosome loss resulting from nuclear basket destabilization in a mlp1∆ mutant. The authors then directly test if aged cells do exhibit aberrant mRNA export, using RNA FISH to identify that old cells indeed leak intron-containing pre-mRNA into the cytoplasm, as well as a reporter assay to demonstrate translation of leaked pre-mRNA, and that this is suppressed in cells producing less ERCs. Mutants causing increased pre-mRNA leakage are sufficient to induce chromosome missegregation, which is suppressed by the 3x∆i.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The finding that deleting the introns of 3 genes in the Aurora B pathway can suppress age-related chromosome missegregation is highly compelling. Additionally, the rationale behind the various experiments in this paper is well-reasoned and clearly explained.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In some cases, controls for experiments were not presented or were depicted in other figures. High variability was seen in chromosome loss data, leading to large error bars. The text could have been more polished.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors explore a novel mechanism linking aging to chromosome mis-segregation and aneuploidy in yeast cells. They reveal that, in old yeast mother cells, chromosome loss occurs through asymmetric partitioning of chromosomes to daughter cells, a process coupled with the inheritance of an old Spindle Pole Body. Remarkably, the authors identify that remodeling of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), specifically the displacement of its nuclear basket, triggers these asymmetric segregation events. This disruption also leads to the leakage of unspliced pre-mRNAs into the cytoplasm, highlighting a breakdown in RNA quality control. Through genetic manipulation, the study demonstrates that removing introns from key chromosome segregation genes is sufficient to prevent chromosome loss in aged cells. Moreover, promoting pre-mRNA leakage in young cells mimics the chromosome mis-segregation observed in old cells, providing further evidence for the critical role of nuclear envelope integrity and RNA processing in aging-related genome instability.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The findings presented are not only intriguing but also well-supported by robust experimental data, highlighting a previously unrecognized connection between nuclear envelope integrity, RNA processing, and genome stability in aging cells, deepening our understanding of the molecular basis of chromosome loss in aging.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this very positive assessment of our work</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Further analysis of yeast aging data from microfluidic experiments will provide important information about the dynamic features and prevalence of the key aging phenotypes, e.g. pre-mRNA leakage and chromosome loss, reported in this work.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this point, which we will address indeed in the revised version of the manuscript.  In short, chromosome loss is an abrupt, late event in the lifespan of the cells.  Its prevalence is more complex to assess and will require correlated loss rate of several chromosomes concomitantly. The prevalence of the pre-mRNA leakage phenotype is easier to assess and we will provide data about this in the revised manuscript as well.  Our data show that the prevalence is quite high (well above 50%), even if not every cell is affected.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In addition, a discussion would be needed to clarify the relationship between &quot;chromosome loss&quot; in this study and &quot;genomic missegregation&quot; reported previously in yeast aging.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The genomic missegregation mentioned by the reviewer is a process distinct from the chromosome loss that we report.  Genomic missegregation is characterized by the entry of both SPBs and all the chromosomes into the daughter cell compartment (PMID: 31714209).  We do observed these events in our movies as well.  In contrast, the chromosome loss phenotype is takes place under proper elongation of the spindle and proper segregation of the two SPBs between mother and bud, as shown in figure 2 of the manuscript.  In our movies, chromosome loss is at least three fold more frequent (for a single chromosome) than full genome missegregation.  Furthermore, whereas chromosome loss is alleviated by the removal of the introns of <italic>MCM21</italic>, <italic>NBL1</italic> and <italic>GLC7,</italic> genomic missegregation is not.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we thank the reviewer for bringing up the possible confusion between the two phenotypes.  We will explain and illustrate the difference between the two processes in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors make the interesting discovery of increased chromosome non-dysjunction in aging yeast mother cells. The phenotype is quite striking and well supported with solid experimental evidence. This is quite significant to a haploid cell (as used here) - loss of an essential chromosome leads to death soon thereafter. The authors then work to tie this phenotype to other age-associated phenotypes that have been previously characterized: accumulation of extrachromosomal rDNA circles that then correlate with compromised nuclear pore export functions, which correlates with &quot;leaky&quot; pores that permit unspliced mRNA messages to be inappropriately exported to the cytoplasm. They then infer that three intron containing mRNAs that encode portions in resolving sister chromatid separation during mitosis, are unspliced in this age-associated defect and thus lead to the non-dysjunction problem.</p>
<p>Strengths: The discovery of age-associated chromosome non-dysjunction is an interesting discovery, and it is demonstrated in a convincing fashion with &quot;classic&quot; microscopy-based single cell fluorescent chromosome assays that are appropriate and seem robust. The correlation of this phenotype with other age-associated phenotypes - specifically extrachromosomal rDNA circles and nuclear pore dysfunction - is supported by in vivo genetic manipulations that have been well-characterized in the past.</p>
<p>In addition, the application of the single cell mRNA splicing defect reporter showed very convincingly that general mRNA splicing is compromised in aged cells. Such a pleiotropic event certainly has big implications.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this assessment of our work.  To avoid confusion, we would like to stress out, however, that our data do not show that splicing per se is defective in old cells.  We only show that unspliced mRNAs tend to leak out of the nucleus of old cells.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The biggest weakness is &quot;connecting all the dots&quot; of causality and linking the splicing defect to chromosome disjunction. I commend the authors for making a valiant effort in this regard, but there are many caveats to this interpretation. While the &quot;triple intron&quot; removal suppressed the non-dysjunction defect in aged cells, this could simply be a kinetic fix, where a slowdown in the relevant aspects of mitosis, could give the cell time to resolve the syntelic attachment of the chromatids.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The possibility that intron-removal leads to a kinetic fix is an interesting idea that we will address in the revised manuscript.  So far we have no observed that removing these introns slows down mitosis but we will test the idea by doing precise measurements.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>To this point, I note that the intron-less version of GLC7, which affects the most dramatic suppression of the three genes, is reported by one of the authors to have a slow growth rate (Parenteau et al, 2008 - <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e07-12-1254">https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e07-12-1254</ext-link>)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is right, removing the intron of <italic>GLC7</italic> reduces the expression levels of the gene product (PMID: 16816425) to about 50% of the original value and causes a slow growth phenotype.  However, the cells revert fairly rapidly through duplication of the <italic>GLC7</italic> gene.  As a consequence, neither the <italic>GLC7-∆i</italic> nor the <italic>3x∆i</italic> mutant strains show noticeable growth phenotypes by spot assays.  We will document these findings and provide a measurement of the growth rate of the mutant strain in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In addition, the lifespan curve containing the 3∆i in Figure 5E has a very unusual shape, suggesting a growth problem/&quot;sickness&quot; in this strain.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To be accurate the strain plotted in Figure 5E is not the <italic>3x∆i</italic> triple mutant strain but the <italic>3x∆i</italic> <italic>mlp1∆</italic>  quadruple mutant strain.  The 3x∆i triple mutant strain is plotted in Figure 4D and its shape is similar to that of the wild type cells.  The strain in Figure 5E is indeed sick ,due to the removal of the nuclear basket. However, the <italic>3x∆i</italic> mutations partially rescue the replicative lifespan shortening due the <italic>mlp1∆</italic> mutation (see text).  Illustrating the fact that the <italic>3x∆i</italic> mutant strain is not particularly sick, it shows a prolonged lifespan and a fairly standard aging curve.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Lastly, the Herculean effort to perform FISH of the introns in the cytoplasm is quite literally at the statistical limit of this assay. The data were not as robust as the other assays employed through this study. The data show either &quot;no&quot; signal for the young cells or a signal of 0, 1,or 2 FISH foci in the aged cells. In a Poisson distribution, which this follows, it is improbable to distinguish between these differences.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is correct, this experiment was not the easiest of the manuscript... However, despite the limitations of the assay, the data presented in figure 6B are quite clear.  300 cells aged by MEP were analysed, divided in the cohorts of 100 each, and the distribution of foci (nuclear vs cytoplasmic) in these aged cells were compared to the distribution in three cohorts of young cells.  For all 3 aged cohorts, over 70% of the visible foci were cytoplasmic, while in the young cells, this figure was around 3%.  A t-test was conducted to compare these frequencies between young and old cells (Figure 6B).  The difference is highly significant.  The reviewer refers to the supplementary Figure 4, where we were simply asking i) is the signal lost in cells lacking the intron of GLC7 (the response is unambiguously yes) and ii) what is the general number of dots per cells between young and old wild type cells (without distinguishing between nuclear and cytoplasmic) and the information to be taken from this last quantification is indeed that there is no clearly distinguishable difference between these two population of cells.  In other word, the reason why there are more dots in the cytoplasm of the old cells in the Figure 6B is not because the old cells have much more dots in general.  We hope that these clarifications help understand the data better.  We will make sure that this is clearer in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>We are sorry about this confusion.  We will improve our presentation of the controls, make sure that they are brought back again each time they are relevant (we wanted to limit the cases of replotting the same controls several times).  We will also add those that are missing (such as those mentioned by reviewer 2, see above)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>High variability was seen in chromosome loss data, leading to large error bars.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. The variance in those two figures (3A and 5D) comes from the suboptimal plotting of this data. This will be corrected in the revised version of the manuscript.</p>

<p>Thank you for this comment.  We will go through the manuscript again in details</p>
