<title>Abstract</title><p>Behavioral responses to many odorants are not fixed but are flexible, varying based on organismal needs. How such variations arise and the role of various neuromodulators in achieving flexible neural-to-behavioral mapping is not fully understood. In this study, we examined how serotonin modulates the neural and behavioral responses to odorants in locusts (<italic>Schistocerca americana</italic>). Our results indicated that serotonin can increase or decrease appetitive behavior in an odor-specific manner. On the other hand, in the antennal lobe, serotonergic modulation enhanced odor-evoked response strength but left the temporal features or the combinatorial response profiles unperturbed. This result suggests that serotonin allows for sensitive and robust recognition of odorants. Nevertheless, the uniform neural response amplification appeared to be at odds with the observed stimulus-specific behavioral modulation. We show that a simple linear model with neural ensembles segregated based on behavioral relevance is sufficient to explain the serotonin-mediated flexible mapping between neural and behavioral responses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Often the same sensory stimulus can trigger different behavioral responses within a single organism. For example, appetitive odorants that are attractive while hungry may not drive the same behavioral response after feeding to satiety.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> How neural circuits process sensory stimuli to flexibly drive varying outcomes is not fully understood. It is hypothesized that different neuromodulators should be involved in mediating state-dependent changes in neural and behavioral responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> However, whether neuromodulation globally changes responses to sensory cues (i.e. non-specific increases or decreases), or mediates selective alterations in sensory input-driven behavior, and how this is achieved, is not clear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>In insects, serotonin (5HT) is a key neuromodulator that is linked with the regulation of many behaviors, including feeding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, socialization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, aggression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, and mating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Food intake is known to be highly dependent on the serotonin levels in the brain of an organism. Elevated levels of serotonin have been shown to decrease the time spent feeding and the amount of consumed food in blowflies and flesh flies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> In <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae and adults, inhibition of neural serotonin synthesis or global increase of serotonin levels, increases or suppresses food intake, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> In locusts, serotonin is linked to triggering phenotypical plasticity. A spike in serotonin levels in the locust brain is highly correlated with the solitary stage,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> whereas high levels of serotonin in the locust thoracic ganglion are known to trigger the transformation of solitary animals into gregarious ones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> Serotonin modulation has also been linked with increased activity and aggression in crickets and flies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> as well as a reduction of courtship behaviors, like male wing extension towards females and mating in flies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>How serotonin alters sensory processing to drive these behavioral changes is yet to be completely resolved. In olfaction, serotonin is known to modify the processing of odor-driven neural signals right from the periphery. In both vertebrates and invertebrates, the serotonergic release is known to reduce olfactory sensory neuron output to the following circuit through pre-synaptic GABAergic inhibition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> In contrast, exogenous serotonin is known to increase the odor-evoked responses of second-order neurons in the insect antennal lobe and vertebrate olfactory bulb.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> The serotonin-mediated increase in odor-evoked responses has been reported to be odor-specific and hypothesized to enhance the sensitivity to odorants in a state-dependent manner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>How are odor-evoked neural responses modulated to produce flexible, odor-specific changes in behavioral outcomes? In this study, we examined this question in the locust olfactory system. We show that serotonin can increase or decrease innate appetitive behavioral responses in an odor-specific manner. In contrast, exogenous serotonin increased the strength of odor-evoked neural responses for all odorants without altering the temporal processing features or the ensemble response fidelity. We present a simple model to map the serotonin-mediated amplification of neural responses onto odor-specific changes in behavioral outcomes. Finally, we examine the relevance of these findings for modulating hunger-state-dependent modulation of appetitive responses in locusts. In sum, our results provide a more systems-level view of how a specific neuromodulator (serotonin) alters neural circuits to produce flexible behavioral outcomes.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Serotonin modulates appetitive behavior in an odor-specific manner</title>
<p>We began by examining how serotonin modulates odor-driven innate behavioral responses in locusts (<italic>S. americana</italic>). In this assay, starved locusts opened their sensory appendages close to the mouth, called maxillary palps, when encountering certain food-related odorants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> We examined the palp-opening responses (POR) for an odor panel including four odorants: hexanol (HEX), benzaldehyde (BZA), linalool (LOOL), and ammonium (AMN). Note that hexanol (green) is a green-leaf volatile<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, and benzaldehyde (blue) is a putative locust aggregation pheromone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Whereas linalool (red) is used in many pesticides.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> Hence, this panel included odorants that have diverse behavioral preferences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> Each odorant was delivered at 1% v/v concentration and presented for ten trials or repetitions in a pseudorandomized order (see Methods).</p>
<p>We used a binary metric to categorize the presence or absence of PORs <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>)</bold>. The response matrix across locusts (rows) and trials (columns) is summarized in <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>. It is worth noting that HEX evoked supra-median(0.62) POR responses, while BZA and LOOL have a response close to the median(0.4) POR response level (mean POR = 0.43 across odorants and locusts). In contrast, AMN elicited sub-median(0.29) POR responses across locusts. We also examined the PORs before and after serotonin (5HT) injection for each locust (see Methods). Notably, we found that the probability of PORs (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>) changed after 5HT injection but only for a subset of odorants (HEX and BZA). Intriguingly, the PORs to LOOL decreased after 5HT injection. Injection of saline or merely repeating the same set of odorants after a three-hour time window (similar time frame as before and after 5HT injection) did not produce any significant change in the PORs (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figs. 1</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4</xref></bold> shows POR responses to paraffin oil before and after 5HT application). These results suggest that 5HT altered appetitive behavioral responses in an odor-specific manner.</p>

<title>Serotonin enhances olfactory arousal to odorants</title>
<p>Next, we wondered whether serotonin introduction altered the behavioral dose-response relationship. To examine this, we recorded PORs to the same four odorants at widely different concentrations <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref></bold>; spanning four log units of concentration). First, even without serotonin application, it can be noted that PORs to the odorants tended to increase as a function of odor intensity. Further, the increase was more significant for HEX and BZA, two odorants that generally elicited more PORs. However, note that there was a detectable decrease in PORs at the highest concentration of HEX and BZA.</p>

</fig>
<p>Injection of serotonin increased the probability of generating POR for all concentrations of HEX and BZA. In contrast, changes in PORs elicited by LOOL and AMN were only modestly modified after 5HT introduction. Hence, these findings imply that serotonin enhanced appetitive behavioral responses over a wide range of concentrations but only for a subset of odorants (HEX and BZA). Furthermore, the reductions in behavioral responses at the highest intensity of HEX and BZA were no longer detectable or significant after 5HT treatment. In sum, these results indicate that the overall arousal to appetitive odorants is enhanced after serotonin application, and increases in behavioral response are maintained over a wide range of concentrations.</p>

<title>Serotonin alters the spontaneous activity of projection neurons in the antennal lobe</title>
<p>Next, we investigated the neural basis of the observed serotonergic modulation of behavioral outcomes. To assess this, we intracellularly monitored the spiking activity of projection neurons <italic>(</italic>PNs<italic>)</italic> in the antennal lobe. We first compared the spontaneous spiking activities of the same neuron before and after <italic>(</italic>5HT<italic>)</italic> serotonin treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> vs. 3B</bold>). Note that the baseline spontaneous firing patterns in individual projection neurons changed after bath application of serotonin. The PNs fired spontaneous bursts of spikes after serotonin exposure (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold> (before 5HT) vs. <bold>3B</bold> (after 5HT). To quantify these differences, we computed the inter-spike interval (ISI) distributions across all PNs (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 C-E</xref></bold>; <italic>n = 82 PNs</italic>). The ISI distributions after 5HT application showed a left shift indicating that pairs of consecutive spikes occurred in quick succession (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>). Consistent with these results, the median values for the ISI distribution reduced significantly for each PN recorded (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>). Finally, we plotted the median ISI before 5HT (control; along the x-axis) against median ISI values after 5HT application (y-axis) for each PN (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref></bold>). As can be noted, each point represents a single PN. Clustering closer to the X-axis indicates that serotonin altered the excitability of PNs and induced bursts of spikes.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="552516v2_fig3.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>In addition, we found that the total spiking activity in individual PNs monotonically increased with the magnitude of the current injection (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3</xref></bold>). However, after serotonin injection we found that the spiking activity remained relatively stable and did not systematically vary with the magnitude of the current injection. While the changes in odor-evoked responses may incorporate both excitability changes in individual PNs and recurrent feedback inhibition through GABAergic LNs, these results from our current injection experiments unambiguously indicate that there are changes in excitability at the level of individual PNs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Serotonin modulates odor-evoked response intensity but not timing</title>
<p>As noted, serotonin modulated the excitability of all individual PNs we recorded. How are the odor-evoked responses modulated, and does serotonergic modulation confound the information about odor identity? To examine this, we analyzed the odor-evoked responses of eighty-two PN-odor combinations. In addition to the four odorants examined in behavioral experiments, the odor panel used included three additional odorants (4-vinyl anisole, 1-nonanol, and octanoic acid). Consistent with previous observations, projections neurons responded to odorants byincreasing their spiking activity either during odor presentation (ON response) or after stimulus termination (OFF response) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>). These odor-evoked response patterns were consistent across trials.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="552516v2_fig4.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>We examined whether the odor-evoked response timing (ON vs OFF responses) was preserved after serotonin application (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>). As can be noted, the stimulus-evoked ON and OFF responses in these four representative PNs remained intact after 5HT application. We found that for a majority of the PNs in our dataset that exhibited either an ON or OFF response, the response timing was maintained after 5HT application <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A–C</xref>).</bold> Notably, ON responses tended to be more robustly maintained after the 5HT application compared to the OFF responses (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, F</bold>). Furthermore, most of the non-responsive PNs continued to remain inactive during the odorant presentation after serotonin introduction.</p>
<p>What variations in spiking patterns were observed after the 5HT application? Our results indicate that the total number of spikes (i.e. response magnitude) evoked by an odorant increased after 5HT application during both ON and OFF time periods (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, F).</bold>However, mere introduction of saline or the solvent in which serotonin was diluted (HCl) did not alter the PN responses (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2</xref></bold>). In sum, these results indicate that serotonin modulates the excitability of individual PNs, but only those PNs that were activated by an odorant tended to increase their response magnitude. Further, the response timing (ON vs OFF periods) was robustly maintained across PNs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Robust encoding of odor identity</title>
<p>Is the identity of the odorant robustly encoded by the ensemble-level odor-evoked responses? To understand this, we first visualized the overall PN responses across all neuron-odor combinations in our dataset (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold>). Consistent with the individual PN analyses, the changes in spontaneous activities and stability of spiking responses during the odor presentation period can be readily observed. To qualitatively analyze this, we visualized the neural activity using principal component analysis dimensionality reduction. The 82-dimensional PN spike counts in 50ms time-bins were projected onto the top two eigenvectors of the response covariance matrix and connected in the order of occurrence to generate closed-loop trajectories (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref></bold>). Neural response trajectories during (ON) and after (OFF) odor presentation periods activated different subsets of PNs and therefore did not have much overlap during these time periods. We also plotted the neural response trajectories before and after 5HT application to allow comparison. Our results indicate that the ON response trajectories before and after 5HT application overlapped with each other indicating that the ensemble activity across the eighty-two PNs was similar before and after serotonin application. Similar results were also observed during the OFF-response window.</p>

<p>To further support the qualitative dimensionality reduction analysis, we performed a quantitative correlation analysis using high-dimensional PN activity vectors (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref></bold>). As can be noted, the structure of spontaneous activity before and after serotonin changed, and as a result, the correlation between them became negative. Consistent with the results from the PCA analysis, we found that the odor-evoked responses before and after 5HT application were highly correlated.</p>
<p>Taken together, these results indicate that the identity of the odorant is robustly maintained by ensemble neural activity. Both ON and OFF responses continue to preserve the information they carry about the odorant.</p>

<title>A simple linear model explains serotonergic modulation of neural-behavioral mapping</title>
<p>Our results indicate that serotonin modulated behavioral responses in an odor-specific manner. However, neural responses elicited by all odorants increased (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref></bold>). These results seem to be at odds with each other. To gain mechanistic insights regarding how 5HT uniformly amplifies neural responses while also generating odor-specific changes in behavioral outcomes, we performed a simple linear regression (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref></bold>). We used a previously published extracellular recording dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> consisting of odor-evoked responses of 89 PNs to HEX, BZA, and LOOL to build the model.

<p>We hypothesized that the antennal lobe projection neurons can be divided into two non-overlapping ensembles: Encoding Ensemble 1 is assigned mostly positive weights and Encoding Ensemble 2 are assigned negative weights (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref></bold>). Odorants that evoke supra-median PORs should activate more neurons in Encoding Ensemble 1, and those that produce sub-median-level PORs are expected to activate neurons in Encoding Ensemble 2 more. It is worth noting that this architecture is similar to having ‘neuron – anti-neuron’ pairs where one decoding neuron weighs the positive contribution to generate PORs, and the second decoding neuron collects the negative contributions and suppresses the same behavioral output. Such ‘neuron – anti-neuron’ pairs have been utilized for predicting overall motor outputs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, and are highly consistent with the emerging view from other insect models that have shown mushroom body output neurons form segregated channels to drive opposing behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Our results indicate that this simple linear regression-based model was sufficient to robustly predict the observed PORs (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref></bold>). Furthermore, as expected, HEX and LOOL activated highly distinct neural ensembles. HEX-activated projection neurons received mostly positive weights and LOOL-activated neurons received negative weights (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref></bold>). Any increase in positively weighted PN responses (HEX response after 5HT) should increase the overall POR, whereas the increase in negatively weighted PN responses (LOOL after 5HT) should similarly decrease the behavioral output. Segregating odor encoding into behavior-specific channels in the antennal lobe would allow serotonin to amplify neural responses to all odorants, while still generating odor-specific increases or decreases in behavior.</p>

<title>Hunger-state vs. serotonergic modulation of appetitive behavioral responses</title>
<p>Serotonin is regarded as one of the neuromodulators associated with feeding behaviors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> Therefore, we wondered whether serotonin modulates the behavioral appetitive responses of locusts in a hunger-state-dependent manner. To understand this, we first examined the PORs in locusts that were fed grass blades before the experiments (satiated). <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>; <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>)</bold> Compared to the hungry locusts <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>)</bold>, the fed locusts responded less to HEX and BZA. However, consistent with results from the hungry locusts, the introduction of serotonin increased the appetitive POR responses to HEX and BZA. Intriguingly, the appetitive responses of fed locusts treated with 5HT were comparable or slightly higher than the responses of hungry locusts to the same set of odorants. It is worth noting that responses to LOOL and AMN, non-food related odorants with weaker PORs, remained unchanged in fed locusts treated with 5HT. Therefore, we conclude that, like in many species, serotonin influence food-driven behaviors in locusts. However, since 5HT increased behavioral responses in both fed and hungry locusts, the precise role of 5HT modulation and whether it underlies hunger-state dependent modulation of appetitive behavior still remains to be determined.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We examined how serotonin modulates odor-evoked neural and behavioral responses in locusts to a small but diverse panel of odorants. Our behavioral results revealed that serotonin increased innate appetitive responses to a subset of odorants (HEX and BZA). In contrast, responses to aversive or neutral odorants like LOOL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> or AMN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> decreased or had no significant change in their response levels. Consistent with the behavioral result, we found that the strength of the stimulus-driven responses increased in several PNs in the antennal lobe. However, the overall combination of neurons activated, and their temporal patterns of activation (ON vs. OFF responses), remained consistent. As a direct consequence, the identity of the odorant could be robustly maintained after exogenous serotonin introduction. Finally, fed locusts injected with serotonin generated similar appetitive responses to food-related odorants as starved locusts indicating the role of serotonin in hunger state-dependent modulation of odor-evoked responses.</p>
<p>Prior results from a number of invertebrate and vertebrate models have shown similar changes in odor-evoked neural responses in the antennal lobe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> The increase in the spiking activity of second-order neurons seems inconsistent with the serotonergic gating of sensory input through pre-synaptic inhibition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> Our results indicate that serotonin also modified the overall excitability of individual PNs and made them fire action potentials in bursts. Hence, it is possible that the increased neural sensitivity could compensate for the decreased input from sensory neurons. The change in input-output mapping as a result of serotonin introduction resulted in an increase in the behavioral response to different concentrations of HEX and BZA.</p>
<p>In contrast to the changes in the response strength, our results indicate that the timing of odor-evoked spiking activity was robustly maintained. As a result, the combination of neurons activated during and immediately after the presentation of the odorant remained similar before and after the introduction of serotonin. Hence, serotonergic modulation altered sensitivity to some odorants without altering the identity of the odorant. These results are consistent with prior imaging studies in flies that reported odor-specific changes in glomerular activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> Further, this interpretation of our physiological results is consistent with the behavioral observation that serotonin altered response levels in an odor-specific manner.</p>
<p>However, behavioral responses could both increase or decrease depending on the odor identity. In contrast, our neural data indicated an enhancement for all odorants examined. This apparent mismatch between neural and behavioral responses could be resolved using a very simple linear regression model. In the model, a subset of neurons that were activated strongly by odorants with stronger PORs received positive weights. In contrast, the subset of neurons that responded to odorants that evoked fewer PORs received negative weights. Notably, the segregation of neural subsets based on the behavioral relevance and the opposing weights assigned to them was sufficient to produce odor-specific increase or decrease in behavioral PORs as observed during serotonergic modulation.</p>
<p>The model used for mapping neural responses onto behavior only required that odorants that evoke or suppress PORs activate distinct sets of neurons. It is worth noting that such segregation of neural responses could happen at any neural circuit along the olfactory pathway. Our extracellular recording data (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref></bold>) indicate that hexanol (high PORs) and linalool (low PORs) do indeed activate highly non-overlapping sets of PNs in the antennal lobe. Hence, our results suggest that the segregation of neural activity based on behavioral relevance begins very early along the olfactory pathway.</p>
<p>While serotonin is implicated in a range of behaviors, the modulation of feeding behavior is widely conserved across invertebrates and vertebrates. Hence, we finally explored whether this role is conserved in locusts as well. We found that the appetitive response evoked by a food-related odorant (HEX; green leaf volatile<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>) was reduced in animals that were fed. Notably, we found that serotonin application in locusts that were fed recovered back their appetitive response to HEX. Earlier studies have shown that serotonergic neurons could mediate a hunger-state dependent switch in behavioral response preference (attraction vs. repulsion) to the same food-related odorant in fruit fly larvae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Our studies complement these findings and show how serotonin could modulate behavioral responses to different odorants in a stimulus-specific manner.</p>

<title>Odor Stimulation</title>
<p>The odor stimulus was delivered using a standard procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> Briefly, all odorants were diluted to their 0.01-10% concentration by volume (v/v) in mineral oil. Ammonium alone was diluted in distilled water. 20 ml of diluted odor solution was kept in 60 ml sealed bottles. During stimulus presentations, a constant volume (0.1 L per minute) from the odor bottle headspace was displaced and injected into the carrier stream using a pneumatic pico pump (WPI Inc., PV-820). A vacuum funnel placed right behind the locust antenna ensured the removal of odor vapors.</p>

<title>Odor Panel</title>
<p>The odorants were selected based on chemical structure and ecological relevance. Therefore, we chose a very diverse odor panel that consisted of a food odorant – hexanol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, a sexual maturation pheromone – 4-vinyl anisole<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, and a putative aggregation pheromone – benzaldehyde<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. In addition, we included an acid – octanoic acid, a base – ammonium, and an alcohol – 1-nonanol in our experiments. These odors were specifically selected based on our previous neural and behavioral data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> For some experiments, we chose to focus on four odorants that had a diverse range of palp opening response rates: supra-median (hexanol), median (benzaldehyde), and sub-median (linalool) POR response levels.</p>

<title>Behavior experiments</title>
<p><bold>Sixth instar l</bold>ocusts of either sex were starved for 24-48 hours before the experiment or taken straight from the colony and fed blades of grass for the satiated condition. Locusts were immobilized by placing them in the plastic tube and securing their body with black electric tape (<bold><xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 7</xref></bold>). The head of the locusts along with the antenna and maxillary palps protruded out of this immobilization tube so they could be freely moved. Note that the maxillary palps are sensory organs close to the mouth parts that are used to grab food and help with the feeding process. Locusts were given 20 – 30 minutes to acclimatize after placement in the immobilization tube.</p>
<p>Each locust was presented with one concentration of four odorants (hexanol, benzaldehyde, linalool, and ammonium) in a pseudorandomized order. The odor pulse was 4 s in duration and the inter-pulse interval was set to 60 s. The experiments were recorded using a web camera (Microsoft). The camera was fully automated with the custom MATLAB script to start recording 2 seconds before the odor pulse and end recording at odor termination. An LED was used to track the stimulus onset/offset. The POR responses were scored offline. Responses to each odorant were scored a 0 or 1 depending on whether the palps remain closed or opened (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>). A positive POR was defined as a movement of the maxillary palps during the odor presentation time window as shown on the locust schematic (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Serotonin treatment</title>
<p>After the initial set of POR experiments, a 0.1 M serotonin solution was injected directly into the locust’s head. The needle of a U-100 syringe was inserted slightly under the cuticle of the locust head, ∼ 1mm above the median ocellus. 1ul of the solution was injected and the opening was sealed with a small amount of melted dental wax. The locust was left to stabilize for 3 hours after the injection and before the second set of behavioral experiments.</p>
<p>We did electrophysiology experiments 5-10 minutes after bath application of 5HT. A longer delay (3 hrs) was required for our behavioral experiments as the locusts tended to be a bit more agitated with larger spontaneous movements of palps as well as exhibited unprompted vomiting.</p>

<title>Electrophysiological Experiments Surgery</title>
<p>Sixth instar locusts of either sex were used for these experiments. The legs and wings were removed and the locust was immobilized on a platform. The head was fixed with wax and a cup was built around the head to hold saline solution. The locust antennae were held in place using clear tubing and allowed to pass through the wax cup. The cuticle between the antenna was removed and the air sacs/trachea was removed to expose the brain. Additionally, the gut was removed and a metal wire platform was placed underneath the brain to lift and stabilize it. Finally, the transparent sheath was removed by carefully using sharp forceps. Locust’s brains were super-fused with artificial saline buffer. A visual demonstration of this entire protocol is available online<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Intracellular recordings were performed using glass electrodes (resistance 8-15 MΩ) filled with intracellular saline (130mM L-aspartic acid potassium salt, 2mM MgCl2, 1mM CaCl2, 10mM HEPES, 10mM EGTA, 2mM Na2ATP, 3mM D-glucose, 0.1mM cAMP; osmolarity ∼315mmol/kg; pH 7.0). Glass electrodes were pulled using micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Spontaneous firing, as well as real-time odor-evoked responses, were recorded in the current clamp configuration. Each set of experiments consisted of 5 consecutive 40-second trials, with 20-second intervals in between for each odorant/odor concentration. Odor stimulation was performed at the 10<sup>th</sup> second of the trial for 4 seconds. Voltage signals were amplified (Axoclamp-2B, Molecular Devices) and saved using a custom MATLAB script.</p>
<p>After monitoring the responses to the odor panel, a serotonin solution was applied directly into the bath using a thin nozzle pipette. The serotonin solution (0.01M serotonin hydrochloride in locust saline buffer) was made fresh before every experiment due to its light sensitivity. The same set of recordings and odor panel was repeated 5-10 minutes following serotonin application.</p>

Same color convention as <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. Each row represents PORs recorded from a single locust (n=11 for saline injection (top panel) and n = 18 locusts when the injection was absent (bottom panel)) over 10 consecutive trials (columns). The probability of POR is shown as a bar plot on the right side. The results before and after the injection of locust saline are presented in <bold>panel A. Panel B</bold> shows the results from a second control experiment. We compared POR responses to BZA before and after 3-hour wait (without any injection). This time period is comparable to the time lag between before and after 5HT injections. Significance in POR differences tested using standard paired-sample t-test.

<p>This <bold>useful</bold> work shows that the experimental application of serotonin to locust antennal lobes induces an increased feeding-related response to some odorants (even in food-satiated animals). To explain how the odorant-specific effects are seen despite similar consequences of 5-HT modulation on all projection neuronal types, the authors propose a simple quantitative model built around projection with different downstream connections. While they are consistent with the authors' conclusions, the current panel of experiments is <bold>incomplete</bold> and additional future work will be required to fully support the conclusions the authors currently draw from their observations.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors investigate the influence of serotonin on feeding behavior and electrophysiological responses in the antennal lobe of locusts. They find that serotonin injection changes behavior in an odor-specific way. In physiology experiments, they can show that projection neurons in the antennal lobe generally increase their baseline firing and odor responses upon serotonin injection. Using a modeling approach the authors propose a framework on how a general increase in antennal lobe output can lead to odor-specific changes in behavior.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study shows that serotonin affects feeding behavior and odor processing in the antennal lobe of locusts, as serotonin injection increases activity levels of projection neurons. This study provides another piece of evidence that serotonin is a general neuromodulator within the early olfactory processing system across insects and even phyla.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I still have several concerns regarding the generalizability of the model and interpretation of results. The authors cannot provide evidence that serotonin modulation of projection neurons impacts behavior.</p>
<p>The authors show that odor identity is maintained after 5-HT injection, however, the authors do not show if PN responses to different odors were differently affected after serotonin exposure.</p>
<p>Regarding the model, the authors show that the model works for odors with non-overlapping PN activation. However, only one appetitive, one neutral, and one aversive odor has been tested and modeled here. Can the fixed-weight model also hold for other appetitive and aversive odors that might share more overlap between active PNs? How could the model generate BZA attraction in 5-HT exposed animals (as seen in behavior data in Figure 1) if the same PNs just get activated more?</p>
<p>The authors should still not exclude the possibility that serotonin injections could affect behavior via modulation of other cell types than projection neurons. This should still be discussed, serotonin might rather shut down baseline activation of local inhibitory neurons - and thus lead to the interesting bursting phenotypes, which can also be seen in the baseline response, due to local PN-to-LN feedback.</p>
<p>The authors did not fully tone down their claims regarding causality between serotonin and starved state behavioral responses.</p>
<p>
There is no proof that serotonin injection mimics starved behavioral responses.</p>

<p>For our behavioral experiments, we waited 3 hours after serotonin injection to allow serotonin to penetrate through the layers of air sacks and the sheath, and for the locusts to calm down and recover their baseline POR activity levels. For the physiology experiments, we noticed that the quality of the patch decreased over time after serotonin introduction. Hence, it was difficult to hold cells for that long. However, the point raised by the reviewer is well-taken. We have performed additional experiments to show that the changes in POR levels to different odorants are rapid and can be observed within 15 minutes of injecting serotonin (Author response image 2) and that the physiological changes in PNs (bursting spontaneous activity, maintenance of temporal firing patterns, and increase odor-evoked responses) persists when the cells are held for longer duration (i.e. 3 hours akin to our behavioral experiments). It is worth noting that 3-hour in-vivo intracellular recordings are not easily achievable and come with many experimental constraints. So far, we have managed to record from two PNs that were held for this long and add them to this rebuttal to support our conclusions. (Author response image 1).</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>This is true and likely to be true for any study linking neural responses to behavior. There are multiple circuits and pathways that would get impacted by a neuromodulator like serotonin. What we showed with our physiology is how spontaneous and odor-evoked responses in the very first neural network that receives olfactory sensory neuron input are altered by serotonin. Given the specificity of the changes in behavioral outcomes (i.e. odor-specific increase and decrease in an appetitive behavior) and non-specificity in the changes at the level of individual PNs (general increase in odor-evoked spiking activity), we presented a relatively simple computational model to address the apparent mismatch between neural and behavioral responses.

<title>Testing the generality of the proposed computational model.</title>
<p>To test the generality of the model proposed we used a published dataset [Chandak and Raman, 2023]: Neural dataset – 89 PN responses to a panel of twenty-two odorants; Behavioral dataset – probability of POR responses to the same twenty-two odorants. We built the model using just the three odorants overlapping between the two datasets: hexanol, benzaldehyde and linalool. The true probability of POR values of the twenty odorants and the POR probability predicted by the model are shown for all twenty-two odorants as a scatter plot. As can be noted, there is a high correlation (0.79) between the true and the predicted values.</p>

<p>As we agreed, there could be other cells that are impacted by serotonin release. Our goal in this study was to characterize how spontaneous and odor-evoked responses in the very first neural network that receives olfactory sensory neuron input are altered by serotonin. Within this circuit, there are local inhibitory neurons (LNs), as correctly indicated by this reviewer. Surprisingly, our preliminary data indicates that LNs are not shut down but also have an enhanced odor-evoked neural response. (Author response image 5.) Further data would be needed to verify this observation and determine the mechanism that mediate the changes in PN excitability. Irrespective, since PN activity should incorporate the effects of changes in the local neuron responses and is the sole output from the antennal lobe that drives all downstream odor-evoked activity, we focused on them in this study.</p>

<p>The authors did not fully tone down their claims regarding causality between serotonin and starved state behavioral responses. There is no proof that serotonin injection mimics starved behavioral responses.</p>
<p>Specific minor issues:</p>
<p>
It is still unclear how naturalistic the chosen odor concentrations are. This is especially important as behavioral responses to different concentrations of odors are differently modulated after serotonin injection (Figure 2: Linalool and Ammonium). The new method part does not indicate the concentrations of odors used for electrophysiology.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>All odorants were diluted to 0.01-10% concentration by volume in either mineral oil or distilled water.  This information is included in the Methods section. For most odorants used in the study, the lower concentrations only evoked a very weak neural response, and the higher concentrations evoked more robust responses. The POR responses for these odorants at various concentrations chosen are included in Figure 2. Note, that the responses to linalool and ammonium remained weak throughout the concentration changes, compared to hexanol and benzaldehyde.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Did all tested PNs respond to all odorants?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>No, only a subset of them responses to each odorant. These responses have been well characterized in earlier publications [included refs].</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors do not show if PN responses to different odors were differently affected after serotonin exposure. They describe that ON responses were robust, but OFF responses were less consistent after 5-HT injection. Was this true across all odors tested? Example traces are shown, but the odor is not indicated in Figure 4A. Figure 4D shows that many odor-PN combinations did not change their peak spiking activity - was this true across odorants? In Figure 5 - are PNs ordered by odor-type exposure?</p>
<p>Also, Figure 6A only shows example trajectories for odorants - how does the average look? Regarding the data used for the model - can the new dataset from the 82 odor-PN pairs reproduce the activation pattern of the previously collected dataset of 89 pairs?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>What is shown in Figure 6A is the trial-averaged response trajectory combining activities of all 82 odor-PN pairs. 82 odor-PN pair was collected intracellularly examining the responses to four odorants before and after 5HT application. The second dataset involving 89 PN responses to 22 odorants was collected extracellularly. They have qualitative similarities in each odorant activate a unique subset of those neurons.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors toned down their claims that serotonin injection can mimic the starved state behavioral response. However, some sentences still indicate this finding and should also be toned down:</p>
<p>last sentence of introduction - &quot;In sum, our results provide a more systems-level view of how a specific neuromodulator (serotonin) alters neural circuits to produce flexible behavioral outcomes.&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe we showed this with our computational model, how uniform changes in the neural responses could lead to variable and odor-specific changes in behavioral PORs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>discussion: &quot;Finally, fed locusts injected with serotonin generated similar appetitive responses to food-related odorants as starved locusts indicating the role of serotonin in hunger statedependent modulation of odor-evoked responses.&quot;  This claim is not supported.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figure 7 shows that the fed locusts had lower POR to hex and bza. The POR responses significantly increased after the 5HT application. However, we have rephrased this sentence to limit our claims to this result.
&quot;Finally, fed locusts injected with serotonin generated similar appetitive palp-opening responses to food-related odorants as observed in starved locusts”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>last results: &quot;However, consistent with results from the hungry locusts, the introduction of serotonin increased the appetitive POR responses to HEX and BZA. Intriguingly, the appetitive responses of fed locusts treated with 5HT were comparable or slightly higher than the responses of hungry locusts to the same set of odorants.&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Again this sentence simply describes the result shown in Figure 7.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Figure 7 - BZA response seems unchanged in hungry and fed animals and only 5-HT injection enhances the response. There is only one example where 5-HT application and starvation induce the same change in behavior - N=1 is not enough to conclude that serotonin influences food-driven behaviors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is ignoring the lack of changes to PORs to linalool and ammonium. Taken together, serotonin increased PORs to only two of the four odorants in starved locusts. The responses after 5HT modulation to these four odorants were similar in fed locusts treated with 5HT and starved locusts.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Also, this seems to be wrongly interpreted in Figure 7: &quot;It is worth noting that responses to
LOOL and AMN, non-food related odorants with weaker PORs, remained unchanged in fed locusts treated with 5HT.&quot;
The authors indicate a significant reduction in POR after 5-HT injection on LOOL response in Figure 7.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Revised.</p>
<p>
It is worth noting that responses to LOOL and AMN, non-food related odorants with weaker PORs, and reduced in fed locusts treated with 5HT.&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Also, the newly added sentence at the end of the discussion does not make sense: &quot;However, since 5HT increased behavioral responses in both fed and hungry locusts, the precise role of 5HT modulation and whether it underlies hunger-state dependent modulation of appetitive behavior still remains to be determined.&quot;</p>
<p>
The authors did not test 5-HT injection in starved animals</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The results shown in Figure 1 compare the POR responses of starved locusts before and after 5HT introduction.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript explores the impact of serotonin on olfactory coding in the antennal lobe of locusts and odor-evoked behavior. The authors use serotonin injections paired with an odor-evoked palp-opening response assay and bath application of serotonin with intracellular recordings of odor-evoked responses from projection neurons (PNs).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors make several interesting observations, including that serotonin enhances behavioral responses to appetitive odors in starved and fed animals, induces spontaneous bursting in PNs, and uniformly enhances PN responses to odors. Overall, I had no technical concerns.
Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While there are several interesting observations, the conclusions that serotonin enhanced sensitivity specifically and that serotonin had feeding-state-specific effects, were not supported by the evidence provided. Furthermore, there were other instances in which much more clarification was needed for me to follow the assumptions being made and inadequate statistical testing was reported.</p>
<p>Major concerns.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>To enhance olfactory sensitivity, the expected results would be that serotonin causes locusts to perceive each odor as being at a relatively higher concentration. The authors recapitulate a classic olfactory behavioral phenomenon where higher odor concentrations evoke weaker responses which is indicative of the odors becoming aversive. If serotonin enhanced the sensitivity to odors, then the dose-response curve should have shifted to the left, resulting in a more pronounced aversion to high odor concentrations. However, the authors show an increase in response magnitude across all odor concentrations. I don't think the authors can claim that serotonin enhances the behavioral sensitivity to odors because the locusts no longer show concentration-dependent aversion. Instead, I think the authors can claim that serotonin induces increased olfactory arousal.</p>
</list-item></list>

<p>The reviewer makes a valid point. Bath application of serotonin increased POR behavioral responses across all odor concentrations, and concentration-dependent aversion was also not observed. Furthermore, the monotonic relationship between projection neuron responses and the intensity of current injection is altered when serotonin is exogenously introduced (see Author response image 1; see below for more explanation). Hence, our data suggests that serotonin alters the dose-response relationship between neural/behavioral responses and odor intensity. As recommended, we have followed what the reviewer has suggested and revised our claim to serotonin inducing increase in olfactory arousal. The new physiology data has been added as Supplementary Figure 3 to the revised manuscript.</p>

<list-item><p>The authors report that 5-HT causes PNs to change from tonic to bursting and conclude that this stems from a change in excitability. However, excitability tests (such as I/V plots) were not included, so it's difficult to disambiguate excitability changes from changes in synaptic input from other network components.</p>

<p>To confirm that the PN excitability did indeed change after serotonin application, we performed a new set of current-clamp recordings. In these experiments, we monitored the spiking activities in individual PNs as we injected different levels of current injections (200 – 1000 pico Amperes). Note that locust LNs that provide recurrent inhibition arborize and integrate inputs from a large number of sensory neurons and projection neurons. Therefore, activating a single PN should not activate the local neurons and therefore the antennal lobe network.</p>
<p>We found that the total spiking activity monotonically increased with the magnitude of the current injection in all four PNs recorded (Author response image 1). However, after serotonin injection, we found that the spiking activity remained relatively stable and did not systematically vary with the magnitude of the current injection.  While the changes in odor-evoked responses may incorporate both excitability changes in individual PNs and recurrent feedback inhibition through GABAergic LNs, these results from our current injection experiments unambiguously indicate that there are changes in excitability at the level of individual PNs. We have added this result to the revised manuscript.</p>

<list-item><p>There is another explanation for the theoretical discrepancy between physiology and behavior, which is that odor coding is further processing in higher brain regions (ie.

<p>This is a valid argument. For our model of neural mapping onto behavior to work, we only need the odorant that evokes or suppresses PORs to activate a distinct set of neurons. Having said that, our extracellular recording results (Fig. 6E) indicate that hexanol (high POR) and linalool (low POR) do activate highly non-overlapping sets of PNs in the antennal lobe. Hence, our results suggest that the segregation of neural activity based on behavioral relevance already begins in the antennal lobe. We have added this clarification to the discussion section.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors investigate the influence of serotonin on feeding behavior and electrophysiological responses in the antennal lobe of locusts. They find that serotonin injection changes behavior in an odorspecific way. In physiology experiments, they can show that antennal lobe neurons generally increase their baseline firing and odor responses upon serotonin injection. Using a modeling approach the authors propose a framework on how a general increase in antennal lobe output can lead to odorspecific changes in behavior. The authors finally suggest that serotonin injection can mimic a change in a hunger state.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study shows that serotonin affects feeding behavior and odor processing in the antennal lobe of locusts, as serotonin injection increases activity levels of antennal lobe neurons. This study provides another piece of evidence that serotonin is a general neuromodulator within the early olfactory processing system across insects and even phyla.
Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I have several concerns regarding missing control experiments, unclear data analysis, and interpretation of results.</p>
<p>A detailed description of the behavioral experiments is lacking. Did the authors also provide a mineral oil control and did they analyze the baseline POR response? Is there an increase in baseline response after serotonin exposure already at the behavioral output level? It is generally unclear how naturalistic the chosen odor concentrations are. This is especially important as behavioral responses to different concentrations of odors are differently modulated after serotonin injection (Figure 2: Linalool and Ammonium).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>POR protocol: Sixth instar locusts (Schistocera americana) of either sex were starved for 24-48 hours before the experiment or taken straight from the colony and fed blades of grass for the satiated condition. Locusts were immobilized by placing them in the plastic tube and securing their body with black electric tape (see Author response image 2). Locusts were given 20 - 30 minutes to acclimatize after placement in the immobilization tube. As can be noted, the head of the locusts along with the antenna and maxillary palps protruded out of this immobilization tube so they can be freely moved by the locusts. Note that the maxillary palps are sensory organs close to the mouth parts that are used to grab food and help with the feeding process.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that our earlier studies had shown that the presentation of ‘appetitive odorants’ triggers the locust to open their maxillary palps even when no food is presented (Saha et al., 2017; Nizampatnam et al., 2018; Nizampatnam et al., 2022; Chandak and Raman, 2023.) Furthermore, our earlies results indicate that the probability of palp opening varies across different odorants (Chandak and Raman, 2023). We chose four odorants that had a diverse range of palp-opening: supra-median (hexanol), median (benzaldehyde), and sub-median (linaool).  Therefore, each locust in our experiments was presented with one concentration of four odorants (hexanol, benzaldehyde, linalool, and ammonium) in a pseudorandomized order. The odorants were chosen based on our physiology results such that they evoked different levels of spiking activities.</p>
<p>The odor pulse was 4 s in duration and the inter-pulse interval was set to 60 s. The experiments were recorded using a web camera (Microsoft) placed right in front of the locusts. The camera was fully automated with the custom MATLAB script to start recording 2 seconds before the odor pulse and end recording at odor termination. An LED was used to track the stimulus onset/offset. The POR responses were manually scored offline. Responses to each odorant were scored a 0 or 1 depending on if the palps remained closed or opened. A positive POR was defined as a movement of the maxillary palps during the odor presentation time window as shown on the locust schematic (Main Paper Figure 1).</p>

<p>As the reviewer inquired, we performed a new series of POR experiments, where we explored POR responses to mineral oil and hexanol, before and after serotonin injection.  For this study, we used 10 locusts that were starved 24-48 hours before the experiment. Note that hexanol was diluted at 1% (v/v) concentration in mineral oil. Our results reveal that locusts PORs to hexanol (~ 50% PORs) were significantly higher than those triggered by mineral oil (~10% PORs). Injection of serotonin increased the POR response rate to hexanol but did not alter the PORs evoked by mineral oil (Author response image 3).</p>

<p>Regarding recordings of potential PNs - the authors do not provide evidence that they did record from projection neurons and not other types of antennal lobe neurons. Thus, these claims should be phrased more carefully.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the locust antennal lobe, only the cholinergic projection neurons fire full-blown sodium spikes. The GABAergic local neurons only fire calcium ‘spikelets’ (Laurent, TINS, 1996; Stopfer et al., 2003; see Author response image 4 for an example). Hence, we are pretty confident that we are only recording from PNs. Furthermore, due to the physiological properties of the LNs, their signals being too small, they are also not detected in the extracellular recordings from the locust antennal lobe. Hence, we are confident with our claims and conclusion.</p>

<p>The presented model suggests labeled lines in the antennal lobe output of locusts. Could the presented model also explain a shift in behavior from aversion to attraction - such as seen in locusts when they switch from a solitarious to a gregarious state? The authors might want to discuss other possible scenarios, such as that odor evaluation and decision-making take place in higher brain regions, or that other neuromodulators might affect behavioral output. Serotonin injections could affect behavior via modulation of other cell types than antennal lobe neurons. This should also be discussed - the same is true for potential PNs - serotonin might not directly affect this cell type, but might rather shut down local inhibitory neurons.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There are multiple questions here. First, regarding solitary vs. gregarious states, we are currently repeating these experiments on solitary locusts. Our preliminary results (not included in the manuscript) indicate that the solitary animals have increased olfactory arousal and respond with a higher POR but are less selective and respond similarly to multiple odorants. We are examining the physiology to determine whether the model for mapping neural responses onto behavior could also explain observations in solitary animals.</p>
<p>Second, this reviewer makes the point raised by Reviewer 1. We agree that odor evaluation and decisionmaking might take place in higher brain regions. All we could conclude based on our data is that a segregation of neural activity based on behavioral relevance might provide the simplest approach to map non-specific increase in stimulus-evoked neural responses onto odor-specific changes in behavioral outcome. Furthermore, our results indicate that hexanol and linalool, two odorants that had an increase and decrease in PORs after serotonin injection, had only minimal neural response overlap in the antennal lobe. These results suggest that the formatting of neural activity to support varying behavioral outcomes might already begin in the antennal lobe. We have added this to our discussion.</p>
<p>Third, regarding serotonin impacting PNs, we performed a new set of current-clamp experiments to examine this issue (Author response image 1). Our results clearly show that projection neuron activity in response to current injections (that should not incorporate feedback inhibition through local neurons) was altered after serotonin injection. Therefore, the observed changes in the odor-evoked neural ensemble activity should incorporate modulation at both individual PN level and at the network level. We have added this to our discussion as well.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Finally, the authors claim that serotonin injection can mimic the starved state behavioral response. However, this is only shown for one of the four odors that are tested for behavior (HEX), thus the data does not support this claim.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We note that Hex is the only appetitive odorant in the panel. But, as reviewer 1 has also brought up a similar point, we have toned down our claims and will investigate this carefully in a future study.</p>

<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Was the POR of the locusts towards linalool and ammonium higher than towards a blank odor cartridge? I ask because the locusts appear to be less likely to respond to these odors and so I am concerned that this assay is not relevant to the ecological context of these odors. In other words, perhaps serotonin did not enhance the responses to these odors in this assay, because this is not a context in which locusts would normally respond to these odors.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>The POR response to linalool and ammonium is lower and comparable to that of paraffin oil. Serotonin does not increase POR responses to paraffin oil but does increase response to hexanol (an appetitive odorant). We have clarified this using new data (Author response image 5).</p>

<list-item><p>It seems to me that Figure 5C is the crux for understanding the potential impact of 5-HT on odor coding, but it is somewhat confusing and underutilized.

The authors make claims about this figure that require the reader to guess as to the aspect of the figure to which they are referring.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer makes an astute observation. Yes, the spontaneous activity in the antennal lobe network before serotonin introduction is not correlated with the ensemble spontaneous activity after serotonin bath application. Remarkably, the odor-evoked responses were highly similar, both in the reduced PCA space and when assayed using high-dimensional ensemble neural activity vectors. Whether the changes in network spontaneous activity have a function in odor detection and recognition is not fully understood and cannot be convincingly answered using our data. But this is something that we had pondered.</p>

<p>The serotonin concentration for ephys experiments was chosen based on trial-error experiments:</p>
<p>0.01mM was the highest concentration that did not cause cell death. For the behavioral experiments, we increased the concentration (0.1 M) due to the presence of anatomical structures in the locust's head such as air sacks, sheath as well as hemolymph which causes some degree of dilution that we cannot control.</p>

<p>Behavior experiments were performed 3 hours after injection - ephys experiments 5-10 minutes following bath application. Can the authors exclude that serotonin affects neural processing differently on these different timescales?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We cannot exclude this possibility. We did ePhys experiments 5-10 minutes after bath application as it would be extremely hard to hold cells for that long.</p>
<p>A longer delay was required for our behavioral experiments as the locusts tended to be a bit more agitated with larger spontaneous movements of palps as well as exhibited unprompted vomiting. A 3hour period allowed the locust to regain its baseline level movements after 5HT introduction. [This information has been added to the methods section of the revised manuscript]</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Concerning the analysis of electrophysiological data. The authors should correct for changes in the baseline before performing PCA analysis. And how much of the variance is explained by PC1 and PC2?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did not correct for baseline changes or subtract baseline as we wanted to show that the odor-evoked neural responses still robustly encoded information about the identity of the odorant.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors should perform dye injections after recordings to visualize the cell type they recorded from. Serotonin might affect also other cell types in the antennal lobe.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned above, in the locust antennal lobe only PNs fire full-blown sodium spikes, and LNs only fire calcium spikelets (Author response image 4). Since these signals are small, they will be buried under the noise floor when using extracellular recording electrodes for monitoring responses in the AL antennal lobe.</p>
