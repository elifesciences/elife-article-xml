<title>Abstract</title><p>Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) are essential for continuous spermatogenesis and male fertility. The underlying mechanisms of alternative splicing (AS) in mouse SSCs are still largely unclear. We demonstrated that SRSF1 is essential for gene expression and splicing in mouse SSCs. Crosslinking immunoprecipitation and sequencing (CLIP-seq) data revealed that spermatogonia-related genes (e.g., <italic>Plzf</italic>, <italic>Id4</italic>, <italic>Setdb1, Stra8</italic>, <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic>, <italic>Bcas2</italic>, <italic>Ddx5</italic>, <italic>Srsf10</italic>, <italic>Uhrf1</italic>, and <italic>Bud31</italic>) were bound by SRSF1 in the mouse testes. Specific deletion of <italic>Srsf1</italic> in mouse germ cells impairs homing and self-renewal of SSCs leading to male infertility. Whole-mount staining data showed the absence of germ cells in the testes of adult cKO mice, which indicates Sertoli cell-only syndrome (SCOS) in cKO mice. The expression of spermatogonia-related genes (<italic>Gfra1</italic>, <italic>Pou5f1</italic>, <italic>Plzf</italic>, <italic>Dnd1</italic>, <italic>Stra8</italic>, and <italic>Taf4b</italic>) was significantly reduced in the testes of conditional knockout (cKO) mice. Moreover, multiomics analysis suggests that SRSF1 directly binds and regulates the expression of <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic> via AS to implement SSC homing and self-renewal. In addition, immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry (IP-MS) data showed that SRSF1 interacts with RNA splicing-related proteins (e.g., SRSF10, SART1, RBM15, SRRM2, SF3B6, and SF3A2). Collectively, our data reveal the critical role of SRSF1-mediated AS in SSC homing and self-renewal, which may provide a framework to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the posttranscriptional network underlying the formation of SSC pools and the establishment of niches.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>SCOS, also known as del Castillo syndrome or germ cell aplasia, is one of the most common causes of severe non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). SCOS is the presence of only Sertoli cells in the testicular tubules of the testes, with no germ cells present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Juul et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). It is well known that abnormal self-renewal and differentiation of SSCs leads to SCOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Kanatsu-Shinohara and Shinohara, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">La and Hobbs, 2019b</xref>). Gonocyte begin homing at 0 to 3 days postpartum (dpp) and then develop into SSCs at 4 to 6 dpp for continuous self-renewal and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Lee and Shinohara, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">McLean et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Tan and Wilkinson, 2020</xref>). The mechanisms regulating spermatogonia homing are hence crucial for forming SSC pools and establishing niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Oatley and Brinster, 2012</xref>). Spermatogonia migrate to form two distinct subtypes in mice. The first subtype develops into an SSC population that provides progenitor spermatogonia for adult spermatogenesis, whereas the second subtype transitions directly to differentiated spermatogonia that contribute to the first round of spermatogenesis but do not self-renew (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Kluin and de Rooij, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Law et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, SSC homing to establish niches is essential for SSC self-renewal and differentiation.</p>
<p>Many transcription factors (e.g., FOXO1, PLZF, POU5F1, TAF4B, CHD4, BCL6B, BRACHYURY, ETV5, ID4, LHX1, POU3F1, DMRT1, NGN3, SOHLH1, SOHLH2, SOX3, and STAT3) promote SSC self-renewal and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Cafe et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Song and Wilkinson, 2014</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms of the posttranscriptional network underlying SSC homing and self-renewal are not sufficiently clear. Previous studies have identified the key RNA-binding proteins DND1 and DDX5 in SSCs with a unique and dominant role in posttranscriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Legrand et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Yamaji et al., 2017</xref>). Surprisingly, recent studies have found that the RNA-binding proteins SRSF10, UHRF1, BUD31, and BCAS2 regulate AS in mouse spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Qin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). It is well known that testes are rich in AS events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Mazin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Venables, 2002</xref>). Thus, understanding the mechanisms of AS in human reproduction can provide new insights into clinical diagnosis. However, the underlying mechanisms of how AS functions in SSC homing and self-renewal are still largely unclear.</p>
<p>Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1; previously SF2/ASF) is a widely studied and important splicing factor involved in cancer progression, heart development, and thymus development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Du et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Katsuyama et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Katsuyama and Moulton, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lv et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Qi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Xu et al., 2005</xref>). Our previous work has shown that SRSF1 deficiency impairs primordial follicle formation during meiotic prophase I and leads to primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Sun et al., 2023</xref>). However, the underlying mechanisms by which SRSF1 regulates pre-mRNA splicing in mouse SSCs remain unknown. A mouse model with <italic>Srsf1</italic> conditional deletion can effectively address this uncertainty. This study showed that specific deletion of <italic>Srsf1</italic> in mouse germ cells leads to NOA by impairing homing and self-renewal in mouse SSCs. We further verified that SRSF1 directly binds and regulates <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic> expression via AS, which is critical for homing and self-renewal in mouse SSCs.</p>

<title>SRSF1 has an essential role in mouse testes</title>
<p>To investigate the role of SRSF1 in spermatogenesis, the dynamic localization of SRSF1 in the testis was evaluated. Fascinatingly, the results of SRSF1 and γH2AX co-staining revealed that SRSF1 was expressed in spermatogenesis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">S1</xref>). RT‒qPCR and Western blotting results showed that the expression of SRSF1 fluctuated during the developmental stages of the testes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). Concurrently, the results of SRSF1 and PLZF co-staining revealed that SRSF1 was highly expressed in the nuclei of spermatogonia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). To further explore the function of SRSF1 in regulating SSC self-renewal and differentiation, CLIP-seq was performed in adult mouse testes. GO enrichment analyses of the SRSF1 peak-containing genes revealed that spermatogenesis-related genes were regulated by SRSF1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and Table S1). In combination with previous studies, we found that spermatogonia-related genes (<italic>Plzf</italic>, <italic>Id4</italic>, <italic>Setdb1, Stra8</italic>, <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic>, <italic>Bcas2</italic>, <italic>Ddx5</italic>, <italic>Srsf10</italic>, <italic>Uhrf1</italic>, and <italic>Bud31</italic>) were bound by SRSF1. To provide in-depth insight into the binding of spermatogonia-associated genes, the SRSF1-binding peaks of the gene transcripts were shown by using IGV (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). The co-staining results showed localization and expression of the spermatogonia-related protein in mouse testes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). SRSF1 has a vital role in posttranscriptional regulation in the testes, particularly during SSC self-renewal and differentiation.</p>

<title>SRSF1 deficiency leads to SCOS</title>
<p>To define the specific involvement of SRSF1 in SSC self-renewal and differentiation, we studied the physiological roles of SRSF1 in vivo using a mouse model. Considering that global SRSF1 knockout is lethal in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Xu <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), we used a conditional allele of <italic>Srsf1</italic> (<italic>Srsf1</italic><sup>Fl</sup>) in which exons 2, 3, and 4 of <italic>Srsf1</italic> are flanked by two <italic>loxP</italic> sites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). By crossing <italic>Srsf1</italic><sup>Fl</sup> and <italic>Vasa</italic>-Cre mice, we obtained <italic>Vasa</italic>-Cre <italic>Srsf1</italic><sup>Fl/Fl</sup> mice with <italic>Srsf1</italic> deletion in germ cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). We verified the absence of the SRSF1 protein in germ cells by co-immunofluorescence analyses with SRSF1 and PLZF antibodies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Subsequently, the breeding experiment indicated that cKO mice had a standard mating capacity but that the absence of <italic>Srsf1</italic> led to complete infertility in cKO males (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Histological examination of cKO epididymides revealed that sperm could not be found in the cauda epididymis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Considering the limitations of sectioning, the cauda epididymal sperm count further validated this conclusion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). It was clear that spermatogenesis in the testes was severely impaired. Therefore, we focused our attention on the testes. The adult cKO mice were normal in size (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). However, the sizes of cKO mouse testes were significantly reduced (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). Histological examination of cKO testis sections showed that no germ cells could be visualized, and only a large number of Sertoli cells were observed in the testes of cKO mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>). Together, these results demonstrated that SRSF1 is critical for spermatogenesis and that its absence leads to SCOS.</p>

<title>Loss of SRSF1 impairs SSC homing and self-renewal</title>
<p>To further confirm the absence of germ cells in the testes of cKO mice, PLZF and γH2AX co-staining was performed in adult mouse testes. These data suggested that SRSF1 deficiency impaired germ cell survival (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). The results of VASA and TRA98 co-staining further confirmed this phenotype (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Considering the limitations of sectioning, we used whole-mount immunostaining to perform a comprehensive analysis and found that germ cells were indeed absent in the testes of cKO mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). To dynamically analyse the loss of germ cells, we collected testes from 5 dpp, 7 dpp, and 14 dpp mice. Morphological results showed that the testes of 7 dpp and 14 dpp cKO mice were much smaller than those of Ctrl mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). To determine the presence of germ cells in cKO testes, VASA staining was performed in 5 dpp, 7 dpp, and 14 dpp Ctrl and cKO testes. The results showed that germ cells were still present in cKO mice but were significantly reduced in 7 dpp and 14 dpp cKO testes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). The germ cell count per tube showed a significant reduction in the number of 7 dpp and 14 dpp cKO testes, especially 14 dpp cKO testes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). In addition, TUNEL results showed that apoptosis significantly increased in cKO testes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). These data suggested that the absence of SRSF1 causes apoptosis in a large number of spermatogonia that are unable to self-renew. Interestingly, the results of VASA and SOX9 co-staining showed that partial germ cells could not complete homing in 5 dpp cKO testes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Thus, all the above data indicated that SRSF1 has an essential role in the homing and self-renewal of spermatogonia.</p>

<title>SRSF1 is essential for gene expression in SSC homing and self-renewal</title>
<p>To investigate the molecular mechanisms of SRSF1 in SSC homing and self-renewal, we isolated mRNA from 5 dpp cKO and Ctrl mouse testes and performed RNA-seq. RNA-seq and RT‒qPCR results showed a significant reduction in the expression of SRSF1 in 5 dpp cKO mouse testes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Western blotting results showed that SRSF1 expression was significantly reduced in the testes of cKO mice at 5 dpp (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Hence, for Ctrl and cKO samples, the confidence level of the RNA-seq data was high. The volcano map and cluster heatmap showed 715 downregulated and 258 upregulated genes identified by RNA-seq data in 5 dpp cKO mouse testes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref> and Table S2). These gene GO enrichment analyses indicated abnormal germ cell development and cell cycle arrest in 5 dpp cKO mouse testes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). Surprisingly, the heatmap showed that SSC homing and self-renewal-associated gene (<italic>Gfra1</italic>, <italic>Pou5f1</italic>, <italic>Plzf</italic>, <italic>Nanos3</italic>, <italic>Dnd1</italic>, <italic>Stra8</italic>, and <italic>Taf4b</italic>) expression was significantly reduced in the testes of cKO mice at 5 dpp (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). Simultaneously, visual analysis using IGV showed that the peak of SSC-related genes was significantly decreased (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). Next, we validated the abnormal expression of SSC homing and self-renewal associated genes (downregulated: <italic>Gfra1</italic>, <italic>Pou5f1</italic>, <italic>Plzf</italic>, <italic>Dnd1</italic>, <italic>Stra8</italic>, and <italic>Taf4b</italic>; stabilized: <italic>Nanos3</italic>) by RT–qPCR (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>).

<title>SRSF1 directly binds and regulates the expression and AS of <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic></title>
<p>Multiomics analyses were carried out in a subsequent study to identify the molecular mechanism of SRSF1 regulation that regulates the homing and self-renewal of SSCs. Venn diagram data revealed that 9 out of 715 down-regulated genes were bound by SRSF1 and underwent abnormal AS (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Furthermore, one out of 258 upregulated genes was bound by SRSF1 and underwent abnormal AS (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). The AS genes were subsequently investigated in 5 dpp cKO mouse testes using transcriptomic analyses. RNA-seq analyses showed that 162 AS events were significantly affected (FDR&lt;0.05) in cKO mouse testes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7C</xref> and Table S3). Most of the 133 affected AS events (162) were classified as skipped exons (SEs), with ten AS events categorized as retained introns (RIs), 13 as mutually exclusive exons (MXEs), four as alternative 5’ splice sites (A5SSs), and two as alternative 3’ splice sites (A3SSs) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). Additionally, the overall analysis of aberrant AS events showed that SRSF1 effectively promotes the occurrence of SE and MXE events and inhibits the occurrence of RI events. (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). Then, GO enrichment analyses of AS genes revealed that four genes concerning germ cell development were altered in AS forms (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). Thus, multiomics analyses suggested that <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic> were posttranscriptionally regulated by SRSF1. RT–PCR results showed that the pre-mRNA of <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic> in 5 dpp cKO mouse testes exhibited abnormal AS (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). We then visualized the different types of AS based on RNA-seq data by using IGV (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>). The results of RIP–qPCR showed that SRSF1 could bind to the pre-mRNA of <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>). Interestingly, visual analysis using IGV showed that the peak of <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic> was stabilized in 5 dpp cKO mouse testes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref>). RT‒qPCR results showed that <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic> transcript levels were not inhibited (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7I</xref>). However, Western blotting showed that TIAL1/TIAR expression levels were significantly suppressed (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7J</xref>). In summary, the data indicate that SRSF1 is required for TIAL1/TIAR expression and splicing in SSC homing and self-renewal.</p>

<title>SRSF1 recruits AS-related proteins to modulate AS in testes</title>
<p>To identify the interacting proteins for which SRSF1 exerts its AS role, we performed MS analyses of IP samples from 5 dpp mouse testis extracts. The silver-stained gel of SRSF1 and normal IgG showed several SRSF1-interacting proteins from 5 dpp mouse testis extracts (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). The IP results indicated that SRSF1 was able to effectively IP the testis extracts of 5 dpp mice (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). IP-MS data demonstrated the efficient enrichment of SRSF1 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref> and Table S4). These data showed that the two samples were highly reproducible, especially for SRSF1 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>). Then, GO enrichment analyses of the IP proteins revealed that AS-related proteins could interact with SRSF1 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref>). A circular heatmap showed that SRSF1 could interact with AS-related proteins (e.g., SRSF10, SART1, RBM15, SRRM2, SF3B6, and SF3A2) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8F</xref>). Determining the complex structures of these interactions is valuable, in which molecular docking has played an important role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Yan et al., 2017</xref>).

The HDOCK analysis results depicted SRSF1 with SRSF10, SART1, and RBM15 docking based on a hybrid strategy (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8G</xref>).

<title>Failure of spermatogonia survival led to SCOS</title>
<p>Disturbed spermatogenesis can cause SCOS and ultimately male sterility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Jiao et al., 2021</xref>). In recent years, it has been reported that many spermatogonia-related gene deletions have disrupted SSC self-renewal and differentiation in patient and mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">La and Hobbs, 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Tan and Wilkinson, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). SCOS was observed in <italic>Ddx5</italic>, <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic>, <italic>Uhrf1</italic>, <italic>Pramef12</italic>, <italic>Dot1l</italic>, and <italic>Rad51</italic> deletion mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Beck et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Legrand <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Lin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Qin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhou <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Mouse models are still of great significance and reference for human SCOS studies, and they will provide a better understanding of how SCOS occurs and develops over time. Interestingly, our mouse model had SCOS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D-I</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). The absence of germ cells represents classical SCOS in adult mouse testes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). In addition, we found abnormal expression of spermatogonia-related genes (<italic>Gfra1</italic>, <italic>Pou5f1</italic>, <italic>Plzf</italic>, <italic>Dnd1</italic>, <italic>Stra8</italic>, and <italic>Taf4b</italic>) in cKO mouse testes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 F-H</xref>). These differentially expressed genes regulate SSC self-renewal and differentiation in mouse testes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Kanatsu-Shinohara and Shinohara, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">La and Hobbs, 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Tan and Wilkinson, 2020</xref>). Thus, this provided an opportunity for us to better study the underlying molecular mechanisms. These data indicate that SRSF1 deficiency impairs spermatogonial survival, leading to SCOS in male mice.</p>

<title>The formation of SSC pools and the establishment of niches are essential for spermatogenesis</title>
<p>The earliest event in the development of the SSC population is the migration of prospermatogonia from the centre of seminiferous cords where they have resided since sex determination of the embryonic gonad to the basement membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Oatley and Brinster, 2012</xref>). In mice, this process is also known as homing, which occurs in the first 3 dpp and then develops into SSCs at 4 to 6 dpp for continuous self-renewal and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Lee and Shinohara, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">McLean <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Oatley and Brinster, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Tan and Wilkinson, 2020</xref>). Therefore, homing analysis was performed in 5 dpp cKO mouse testes. Interestingly, the VASA and SOX9 co-staining results demonstrated that partial germ cells could not complete homing in 5 dpp cKO testes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Germ cells that do not migrate to the basement membrane are unable to form SSC pools and establish niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">McLean <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). These SSCs that lose their ecological niche will cease to exist. In our data, TUNEL results showed that apoptosis significantly increased in 7 dpp cKO mouse testes. At once, the germ cell count per tube showed a significant reduction in 7 dpp and 14 dpp cKO testes, especially 14 dpp cKO testes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). In conclusion, SRSF1 is crucial for the formation of SSC pools and the establishment of niches through SSC homing.</p>

<title>Abnormal AS of <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic> impaired the survival of spermatogonia</title>
<p>AS is commonly found in mammals, especially in the brain and testes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Mazin <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Merkin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). AS plays essential roles in the posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression during many developmental processes, such as SSC self-renewal and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Song et al., 2020</xref>). Recently, BUD31-mediated AS of <italic>Cdk2</italic> was shown to be required for SSC self-renewal and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Qin <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). <italic>Srsf10</italic> depletion disturbed the AS of genes, including <italic>Nasp</italic>, <italic>Bclaf1</italic>, <italic>Rif1</italic>, <italic>Dazl</italic>, <italic>Kit</italic>, <italic>Ret</italic>, and <italic>Sycp1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). UHRF1 interacts with snRNAs and regulates AS of <italic>Tle3</italic> in mouse SSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhou <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Mettl3-mediated m6A regulates AS of <italic>Sohlh1</italic> and <italic>Dazl</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). We found that SRSF1 acts as an alternative RNA splicing regulator and directly interacts with <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic> transcripts to regulate splicing events in spermatogonia (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E-G</xref>). Additionally, TIAL1/TIAR expression levels were significantly suppressed (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7J</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic> transcript levels were not inhibited (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7I</xref>). These results suggested that SRSF1 explicitly regulates the expression of <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic> via AS. Studies have reported that TIAL1/TIAR is essential for primordial germ cell development in mouse testes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Beck <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>). <italic>Tial1/Tiar</italic> deletion impairs spermatogonia survival leading to SCOS, consistent with our phenotype (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E-I</xref> and 4A-C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Beck <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>). To summarize, SRSF1 directly binds and regulates the expression of <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic> via AS to implement SSC homing and self-renewal.</p>
<p>We found that SRSF1 could interact with AS-related proteins (e.g., SRSF10, SART1, RBM15, SRRM2, SF3B6, and SF3A2) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8F</xref>). A recent study reported that SRSF10 deficiency impaired spermatogonia differentiation but did not affect spermatogonia homing and self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). However, our data showed that SRSF1 is essential for homing and self-renewal in mouse SSCs. Therefore, this suggests that SRSF1 has a specific function in the homing and self-renewal of SSCs that are not bound by SRSF10.</p>

<title>SRSF1-mediated posttranscriptional regulation during SSC homing and self-renewal provides new insights into the treatment of human reproductive diseases</title>
<p>Aberrant SSC homing and self-renewal often lead to gametogenic failure or produce aneuploid gametes, resulting in subfertility or infertility, miscarriage, or congenital disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Jiao <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Kanatsu-Shinohara and Shinohara, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">La and Hobbs, 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Song and Wilkinson, 2014</xref>). Loss-of-function mutations in humans and corresponding knockout/mutated mice have been extensively researched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Jiao <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). However, AS-related posttranscriptional regulation during meiosis has not been well studied. In recent years, there have been reports that the RNA-binding proteins SRSF10, UHRF1, BUD31, and BCAS2 regulate AS in mouse SSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Qin <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhou <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). This study used a multiomics approach to perform in-depth analyses of SRSF1-mediated posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms to enrich the field. It also provides new ideas and insights for clinical diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>In summary, this study demonstrates that SRSF1 plays a critical role in posttranscriptional regulation by explicitly regulating the expression of <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic> via AS to implement SSC homing and self-renewal (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8H</xref>).

Testis sections were cut at a 5-μm thickness for immunostaining and histologic analyses. For histological analyses, sections were dewaxed in xylene, rehydrated in a graded ethanol solution, and stained with haematoxylin. After sealing the slides with neutral resin, a Ventana DP200 system was used for imaging. For immunofluorescence analyses, antigen retrieval was performed by microwaving the sections with sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0). After blocking with 10% normal goat serum at room temperature for 1 hour, the sections were incubated with primary antibodies (Table S6) in 5% normal goat serum overnight at 4°C. After washing with PBS, the sections were incubated with secondary antibodies (Table S6) at room temperature in the dark for 1 hour. The slides were mounted in an antifade mounting medium with DAPI (P0131, Beyotime). Photographs were taken with a Nikon A1 laser scanning confocal microscope and a Zeiss OPTOME fluorescence microscope.</p>

<title>Whole-mount immunostaining</title>
<p>The testes were collected and dispersed with 5ml syringes. Blown-out tubules were fixed in PFA at 4°C for 4 hours. The tubules were washed three times with PBS (pH 7.4) for 5 min each and stored at 4°C. The tubules were permeated with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 1 h at 4°C. Then, whole-mount staining followed the immunostaining protocol.</p>

<title>RT–PCR and RT–qPCR</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted by using RNAiso Plus (9109, Takara), and the concentration was measured with a Nano-300 ultramicro spectrophotometer (Allsheng). cDNA was obtained according to the instructions of a TIANScript II RT kit (KR107, TIANGEN). The expression of transcripts of the target gene was measured by using a LightCycle® 96 instrument (Roche) with Hieff UNICON SYBR green master mix (11198ES08, Yeasen). AS analyses were performed on a RePure-A PCR instrument (BIO-GENER). Primers were synthesized by Sangon Biotech (Table S5). The expression level of <italic>Gapdh</italic> or <italic>Actb</italic> was used as the control, and this value was set as 1. Other samples’ relative transcript expression levels were obtained by comparing them with the control results.</p>

<title>RNA-seq</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted from mouse testes according to the above protocol at 5 dpp. Briefly, mRNA was purified from total RNA using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads. After fragmentation, we established a transcriptome sequencing library and assessed library quality on an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system. The clustering of the index-coded samples was performed on a cBot Cluster Generation System using a TruSeq PE Cluster kit v3-cBot-HS (Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After cluster generation, the library preparations were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq platform, and 150 bp paired-end reads were generated. After quality control, all downstream analyses were performed on clean, high-quality data. The reference genome index was built, and paired-end clean reads were aligned to the reference genome using HISAT2 software (version 2.0.5). FeatureCounts (version 1.5.0) counted the reads mapped to each gene. Then, the fragments per kilobase million (FPKM) value of each gene was calculated based on the length of the gene and the read count mapped to this gene. Differential expression analyses of cKO/Ctrl mouse testes (three biological replicates per condition) were performed using the DESeq2 R package (version 1.20.0). Genes with a padj ≤ 0.05 identified by DESeq2 were considered differentially expressed.</p>

<sec id="s3l">
<title>AS analyses</title>
<p>rMATS software (version 3.2.5) was used to analyse the AS events in cKO mouse germ cells based on RNA-seq data. Five types of AS events (SE, RI, MXE, A5SS, and A3SS) were revealed by rMATS software. Our threshold for screening differentially significant AS events was a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.05. Splicing events with an FDR less than 0.05 and an inclusion-level difference with a significance of at least 5% (0.05) were considered statistically significant. Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV, 2.16.0) software was used to visualize and confirm AS events based on RNA-seq data.</p>

<sec id="s3m">
<title>Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses</title>
<p>The GO enrichment analyses of differentially expressed genes and AS genes were implemented with the clusterProfiler R package (version 3.4.4), in which gene length bias was corrected. GRCm38/mm10 was used as a mouse reference genome, and the Benjamini–Hochberg multiple methods was applied to adjust for multiple testing. GO enrichment analyses with corrected <italic>P</italic> values of less than 0.05 were significantly enriched for differentially expressed genes and AS genes.</p>

<title>Western blotting</title>
<p>Total protein was extracted with cell lysis buffer (P0013, Beyotime) containing PMSF (1:100, ST506, Beyotime) and a protease inhibitor cocktail (1:100, P1005, Beyotime). A BCA protein assay kit (CW0014S, CWBiotech) measured the protein concentration. The protein lysates were electrophoretically separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and electrically transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (IPVH00010, Millipore). The membranes were blocked in 5% skimmed milk for 1 hour and incubated with the primary antibodies (Table S6) for one night at 4°C. Then, the membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies (Table S6) at room temperature for 1 hour. The proteins were visualized using a Tanon 5200 chemiluminescence imaging system following incubation with BeyoECL Plus (P0018S, Beyotime).</p>

<p>Total protein was extracted with cell lysis buffer (P0013, Beyotime) containing PMSF (1:100, ST506, Beyotime) and a protease inhibitor cocktail (1:100, P1005, Beyotime). After incubation on ice for 20 min, the lysate was added to 20 μl of protein A agarose (P2051-2 ml, Beyotime) for pre-clearing at 4°C for 1 hour. Two micrograms of an SRSF1 antibody (sc-33652, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a normal mouse IgG (sc-3879, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to the lysate the mixture was incubated overnight incubation at 4°C. The next day, 60 μl of protein A agarose was added to the lysate, which was then incubated at 4°C for 4 hours. The agarose complexes containing antibodies and target proteins were washed 3 times for 5 min at 4°C. IP and Co-IP were performed according to the above Western blotting protocol. The complex was sent to the protein mass spectrometry laboratory for IP-MS analyses using a Thermo Q-Exactive high-resolution mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham). Raw data from the mass spectrometer were preprocessed with Mascot Distiller 2.4 for peak picking. The resulting peak lists were searched against the uniport mouse database using Mascot 2.5 search engine.</p>

<title>RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and RIP–qPCR</title>
<p>As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Gagliardi and Matarazzo, 2016</xref>), RIP was performed using 5 dpp mouse testes. The testes were lysed in cell lysis buffer (P0013, Beyotime) containing PMSF (1:100, ST506, Beyotime), a proteinase inhibitor cocktail (1:100, P1005, Beyotime), DTT (1:50, ST041-2 ml, Beyotime), and an RNase inhibitor (1:20, R0102-10 kU, Beyotime). After incubation on ice for 20 min, the lysate was added to 20 μl of protein A agarose (P2051-2 ml, Beyotime) for pre-clearing at 4°C for 1 hour. Two micrograms of an SRSF1 antibody (sc-33652, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a normal mouse IgG (sc-3879, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to the lysate, which was then incubated overnight at 4°C. The next day, 60 μl of protein A agarose was added to the lysate, and the mixture was incubated at 4°C for 4 hours. The agarose complexes containing antibodies, target proteins, and RNA were washed 3 times for 5 min at 4°C and repeated. Protein-bound RNA was extracted using RNAiso Plus and a Direct-zol RNA MicroPrep Kit. RIP–qPCR was performed according to the above RT–qPCR protocol.</p>

<title>CLIP-seq library construction and data analysis</title>
<p>Total cells were isolated from adult WT C57BL/6N mouse testes, and then the cells were crosslinked by ultraviolet light (254 nm) to maintain the covalent binding of RBPs to their cognate RNA. Subsequently, SRSF1 and crosslinked RNAs were immunoprecipitated with an anti-SRSF1 antibody and digested with micrococcal nuclease (EN0181, Thermo Fisher Scientific). An IR800-biotin adapter was ligated to the 3′ ends of the RNA fragments. Then, the SRSF1/RNA complexes were separated by SDS‒PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (HATF00010, Millipore). These RNA and protein complexes from approximately 47 to 62 kDa were extracted from the nitrocellulose membrane, after which proteinase K (9034, Takara) digestion was performed. RNA was isolated with saturated phenol (AM9712, Ambion), ligated with adaptors, and converted to cDNA with a SuperScript III First-Strand Kit (18080-051, Invitrogen). The cDNA was amplified by PCR to prepare the corresponding libraries and then sequenced on illumina NovaSeq 6000.</p>
<p>For the analyses of CLIP-seq data, the adaptor sequences were first removed from the reads by Trimmomatic (version 0.36). Subsequently, Bowtie 2 (version 2.1.0) was applied for mapping of clean reads to the mm10 reference genome with the parameters &quot;-p 10 -L 15 -N 1 -D 50 -R 50 --phred33 --qc- filter --very-sensitive --end-to-end.&quot; CLIP-seq peaks were identified by Piranha (version 1.2.1) with the following parameters: &quot;-s -b 20 -d Zero Truncated Negative Binomial -p 0.05.&quot;</p>

Support is <bold>inadequate</bold> because homing and self-renewal phenotypes were not explicitly tested, and functional data were not provided to support a role for alternative splicing of Tial1 in the fertility phenotype.

<p>The authors revealed that spermatogonia-related genes (e.g., Plzf, Id4, Setdb1, Stra8, Tial1/Tiar, Bcas2, Ddx5, Srsf10, Uhrf1, and Bud31) were bound by SRSF1 in the mouse testes by Crosslinking immunoprecipitation and sequencing (CLIP-seq). Using Vasa-cre mouse line, the authors successfully evidenced that SRSF1 in the testis is essential for homing and self-renewal in mouse spermatogonial stem cells. Further evidence showed that SRSF1 directly binds and regulates the expression of Tial1/Tiar via AS to implement SSC homing and self-renewal. Immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry (IP-MS) data showed that the AS of SSC is regulated by SRSF1 coordinated with other RNA splicing-related proteins (e.g., SRSF10, SART1, RBM15, SRRM2, SF3B6, and SF3A2). The authors revealed the critical role of SRSF1-mediated AS in SSC homing and self-renewal, which may provide a framework to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the posttranscriptional network underlying the formation of SSC pools and the establishment of niches. The experiments are well-designed and conducted, the overall conclusions are convincing. This work will be of interest to stem cell and reproductive biologists.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>
The authors seek to characterize the role of splicing factor SRSF1 during spermatogenesis. Using a conditional deletion of Srsf1 in germ cells, they find that SRSF1 is required for male fertility. Via immunostaining and RNA-seq analysis of the Srsf1 conditional knockout (cKO) testes, combined with SRSF1 CLIP-seq and IP-MS data from the testis, they ultimately conclude that Srsf1 is required for spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) homing and self-renewal due to alternative splicing of Tial1.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>
The overall methods and results are robust. The histological analysis of the Srsf1 cKO traces the origins of the fertility defect to the postnatal testis, and the authors have generated interesting datasets characterizing SRSF1's RNA targets and interacting proteins specifically in the testis.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the authors have shown that SRSF1's effects on alternative splicing are required to establish spermatogenesis. In the absence of Srsf1, the postnatal gonocytes/nascent spermatogonia do not properly relocate from the seminiferous tubules' lumen to basement membrane, and consequently, never initiate spermatogenesis. I believe this relocation event is what the authors are referring to as &quot;SSC homing&quot;.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>
I do not think there is enough evidence to support two major conclusions. First, the authors conclude that SRSF1 is required for &quot;SSC self-renewal.&quot; Given the defect in nascent spermatogonial development, it is not evident to me that SSCs actually form in the Srsf1 cKO. Second, the authors conclude that SRSF1 controls alternative splicing of Tial1 to &quot;implement SSC homing and self-renewal.&quot; I'm unsure as to the basis for TIAL1's role in &quot;SSC homing and self-renewal,&quot; particularly as the only reference provided about Tial1's effects on the germ line shows that germ cells are completely lost during embryonic gestation. As a result, it's ultimately unclear to me how SRSF1 mechanistically regulates the relocation of gonocytes/nascent spermatogonia to the basement membrane.</p>
<p>Alternative splicing is quite pronounced in the testis relative to other tissues. The authors have presented interesting work that shows that alternative splicing is required in the testicular germ line for the establishment of spermatogenesis.</p>

<p>In this study, Sun et al examine the role of the splicing factor SRSF1 in spermatogenesis in mice. Alternative splicing is important for spermatogenic development, but its regulation and major developmental roles during spermatogenesis are not well understood. The authors set out to better define both SRSF1 function in testes and the contribution of alternative splicing. They collect several large 'omics datasets to define SRSF1 targets in testis, including RNA interactions by CLIP-seq in whole testis, protein interactions by IP-mass spec in whole testis, and RNA sequencing to detect expression levels and splice variants. They also examine the phenotype of germline conditional knockouts (cKO) for Srsf1, using the early-acting Vasa-Cre, and find a severe depletion of germ cells starting at 7 days post partum (dpp) and culminating with a lack of germ cells (Sertoli Cell Only Syndrome) by adulthood. They detect differences in gene expression as well as differences in splicing between control and knockout, including 9 genes that are downregulated, experience alternative splicing, and whose transcripts are also bound by SRSF1, and identify the Tial1/Tiar transcript as one of these targets. They conclude that SRSF1 is required for homing and self-renewal of spermatogonial stem cells, at least in part through its regulation of Tial1/Tiar splicing.</p>
<p>Strengths of the paper include detailed phenotyping of the Srsf1 cKO, which convincingly supports the Sertoli Cell Only phenotype, establishes the timing of the first appearance of the spermatogonial defect, and provides new insight into the role of splicing factors and SRSF1 specifically in spermatogenesis. Another strength is the generation of CLIP-seq, IP-MS, and RNA-seq datasets which will be a useful resource for the field of germ cell development. Major weaknesses include a lack of robust support for two major claims: first, there is inadequate support for the claim of defects in either &quot;homing&quot; or &quot;self-renewal&quot; of spermatogonia in the cKO, and second, there is inadequate support for the claim that altered splicing of the Tial1 transcript mediates the effect of SRSF1 loss. A moderate weakness is the superficial discussion of the CLIP, RNA-seq, and IP-MS datasets, limiting their otherwise high utility for other researchers. Overall, the paper as it stands will have a moderate impact on the field of male reproductive biology. Specific points that should be addressed to improve support for the claims are below.</p>
<p>Major comments</p>
<p>1. In Fig 1D, it appears that SRSF1 is expressed most strongly in spermatogonia by immunofluorescence, but this is inconsistent with the sharp rise in expression detected by RT-qPCR at 20 days post partum (dpp) (Fig. 1B), which is when round spermatids are first added; this discrepancy should be explained or addressed.</p>
<p>2. It is important to provide a more comprehensive basic description of the CLIP-seq datasets beyond what is shown in the tracks shown in Fig. 2B. This would allow a better assessment of the data quality and would also provide information about the transcriptome-wide patterns of SRSF1 binding. No information or quality metrics are provided about the libraries, and it is not stated how replicates are handled to maximize the robustness of the analysis. The distribution of peaks across exons, introns, and other genomic elements should also be shown.</p>
<p>3. The claim that SRSF1 is required for &quot;homing and self-renewal&quot; of SSCs is made in multiple places in the manuscript. However, neither homing nor self-renewal is ever directly tested. A single image is shown in Fig. 5E of a spermatogonium at 5dpp that does not appropriately sit on the basal membrane, potentially indicating a homing defect, but this is not quantified or followed up. There is good evidence for depletion of spermatogonia starting at 7 dpp, but no further explanation of how homing and/or self-renewal fit into the phenotype.</p>
<p>4. In Fig. 6A (lines 258-260) very few genes downregulated in the cKO are bound by SRSF1 and undergo abnormal splicing. The small handful that falls into this overlap could simply be noise. A much larger fraction of differentially spliced genes are CLIP-seq targets (~33%), which is potentially interesting, but this set of genes is not explored.</p>
<p>5. The background gene set for Gene Ontology analyses is not specified. If these were done with the whole transcriptome as background, one would expect enrichment of spermatogenesis genes simply because they are expressed in testes. The more appropriate set of genes to use as background in these analyses is the total set of genes that are expressed in testis.</p>
<p>6. In general, the model is over-claimed: aside from interactions by IP-MS, little is demonstrated in this study about how SRSF1 affects alternative splicing in spermatogenesis, or how alternative splicing of TIAL1 specifically would result in the phenotype shown. It is not clear why Tial1/Tiar is selected as a candidate mediator of SRSF1 function from among the nine genes that are downregulated in the cKO, are bound by SRSF1, and undergo abnormal splicing. Although TIAL1 levels are reduced in cKO testes by Western blot (Fig. 7J), this could be due just be due to a depletion of germ cells from whole testis. The reported splicing difference for Tial1 seems very subtle and the ratio of isoforms does not look different in the Western blot image.</p>
