<title>Abstract</title><p>Natural killer (NK) cells can control metastasis through cytotoxicity and IFN-γ production independently of T cells in experimental metastasis mouse models. The inverse correlation between NK activity and metastasis incidence supports a critical role for NK cells in human metastatic surveillance. However, autologous NK cell therapy has shown limited benefit in treating patients with metastatic solid tumors. Using a spontaneous metastasis mouse model of MHC-I<sup>+</sup> breast cancer, we found that transfer of IL-15/IL-12-conditioned syngeneic NK cells after primary tumor resection promoted long-term survival of mice with low metastatic burden and induced a tumor-specific protective T cell response that is essential for the therapeutic effect. Furthermore, NK cell transfer augments activation of conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), Foxp3<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and stem cell-like CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in metastatic lungs, which requires IFN-γ of the transferred NK cells. These results imply direct interactions between transferred NK cells and endogenous cDCs to enhance T cell activation. We conducted an investigator-initiated clinical trial of autologous NK cell therapy in six patients with advanced cancer and observed that the NK cell therapy was safe and showed signs of effectiveness. These findings indicate that autologous NK cell therapy is effective in treating established low burden metastases of MHC-I<sup>+</sup> tumor cells by activating the cDC-T cell axis at metastatic sites.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Metastasis is the most common cause of cancer death, and effective therapies for established metastases are currently lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ganesh &amp; Massague, 2021</xref>). Natural killer <bold>(</bold>NK) cells play a critical role in metastasis control, as the abundance of functional circulating or tumor-infiltrating NK cells is inversely correlated with metastasis incidence while being positively correlated with favorable prognoses for patients with or at risk of metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lopez-Soto, Gonzalez, Smyth, &amp; Galluzzi, 2017</xref>). NK cells are capable of recognizing tumor cells via various activating and inhibitory NK receptors (NKRs). Tumor cells often down-regulate the expression of ligands for inhibitory NKRs, yet express stress-induced ligands for activating NKRs. Upon encountering tumor cells, the reduced inhibitory NKR engagement and enhanced activating NKR engagement facilitate NK cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Jamieson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Karre, Ljunggren, Piontek, &amp; Kiessling, 2005</xref>). NK cells also express receptors for activating cytokines, such as IL-15, IL-12, IL-18 and IL-21, as well as receptors for suppressive factors such as TGF-β and prostaglandin E2 present in the tumor microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Huntington, Cursons, &amp; Rautela, 2020</xref>). The sum of signals transduced through the activating and inhibitory receptors determines NK cell activation. Activated NK cells kill engaged tumor cells via perforin, granzymes, and the death receptor ligands TNF-α, TRAIL and FasL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Smyth et al., 2005</xref>). Activated NK cells also produce IFN-γ, which directly inhibits tumor cell growth and induces type 1 T helper cell (T<sub>H</sub>1) and cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses that are critical for effective anti-tumor immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alspach, Lussier, &amp; Schreiber, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Martin-Fontecha et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, intratumoral NK cells produce XCL1 and CCL5 to recruit type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1) that cross-present cell-associated tumor antigen to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bottcher et al., 2018</xref>), and also produce Flt3L to increase the abundance of cDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barry et al., 2018</xref>). However, the immunosuppressive microenvironment induced by tumor cells elicits NK cell and T cell dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Melaiu, Lucarini, Cifaldi, &amp; Fruci, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Thommen &amp; Schumacher, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Two anti-metastatic mechanisms of NK cells have been revealed to date, i.e., cytotoxicity and IFN-γ production. In the metastatic cascade, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition increases the susceptibility of tumor cells to NK cell cytotoxicity by modulating the expression of ligands for the activating NKRs NKG2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lopez-Soto et al., 2013</xref>), E-cadherin and cell adhesion molecule 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chockley et al., 2018</xref>), as well as MHC class I (MHC-I) molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). The IFN-γ produced by NK cells was shown to be essential for natural resistance to lung metastasis in a B16 melanoma model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Takeda et al., 2011</xref>) and for the IL-12-mediated suppression of liver metastasis in a CT-26 model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Uemura et al., 2010</xref>) using <italic>Rag</italic> knockout mice that lacked T cells. Another study indicated that the anti-metastasis effect of IL-12 produced by Baft3-dependent DCs is mediated through IFN-γ production by NK cells without the involvement of T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mittal et al., 2017</xref>). NK cells also sustain the dormancy of metastatic tumor cells seeded in distal organs through cytotoxicity and IFN-γ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Correia et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Malladi et al., 2016</xref>). The anti-metastatic mechanisms described above do not involve T cells. Thus, whether T cell immunity plays a role in the anti-metastatic function of NK cells remains to be elucidated.</p>
<p>Despite the clear anti-tumor function of endogenous NK cells, adoptive transfer of ex vivo-expanded autologous NK cells has shown limited clinical benefit in treating patients with metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors, including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and digestive cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Parkhurst, Riley, Dudley, &amp; Rosenberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sakamoto et al., 2015</xref>). Both the immunosuppressive microenvironment induced by tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Melaiu et al., 2019</xref>) and heterogeneity of NK cell subpopulations and their respective functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Freud, Mundy-Bosse, Yu, &amp; Caligiuri, 2017</xref>) likely contribute to this therapeutic limitation. Given the vast array of approaches used for ex vivo expansion of NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fang, Xiao, &amp; Tian, 2017</xref>), different methods may result in NK cells exerting different functions. We hypothesize that autologous NK cells with anti-tumor activities are effective in treating low burden metastases. In this study, we used syngeneic IL-15/IL-12-conditioned NK cells to treat established lung metastases after resection of the primary MHC-I<sup>+</sup> EO771 mammary tumor. We found that the NK cell therapy promoted long-term survival of mice with low metastatic burden in a CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-dependent manner, and induced tumor-specific protective immune memory. Furthermore, NK cell transfer augmented the activation of cDC1, cDC2 and T cells in metastatic lungs, which requires IFN-γ of the transferred NK cells. We also conducted an investigator-driven clinical trial of autologous NK cell therapy on six patients hosting four cancer types and found that the therapy is safe and shows signs of efficacy.</p>

<title>Characterization of ex vivo-expanded murine NK cells</title>
<p>To generate NK cells with anti-tumor activity ex vivo, we cultured murine BM cells with IL-15 and IL-12, since IL-15 is an NK cell growth and survival factor and both cytokines enhance IFN-γ production and the cytotoxicity of NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kennedy et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lodolce et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Marcenaro et al., 2005</xref>). On average, 86% of the resulting cells were identified as TCRαβ<sup>-</sup> TCRγδ<sup>-</sup>CD19<sup>-</sup>NK1.1<sup>+</sup> that express NKG2D, EOMES and T-bet (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), representing characteristics of NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gordon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Raulet, 2003</xref>). Approximately 90% of the expanded NK cells were CD27<sup>+</sup> with no-to-low levels of CD11b expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The proportion of NK cells expressing MHC-I-interacting NKRs, including activating Ly49D/H and inhibitory Ly49A/G2/I and NKG2A, was stable among independent cultures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). In terms of activation status, on average, 87% of the expanded NK cells expressed either intermediate or high levels of the activating receptor DNAM-1 and 82% of them displayed an activated B220<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> phenotype (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Consistently, they expressed the anti-tumor effectors IFN-γ, granzyme B, and TRAIL (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Co-culturing the NK cells with either EO771 breast adenocarcinoma cells that express MHC-I molecules and Rae-1 or B16F10 melanoma cells that express none of those molecules in vitro (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-figure supplement 1) resulted in dose-dependent tumor cell death (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>) and up-regulation of IFN-γ production by the NK cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Thus, the NK cells conditioned by means of IL-15 and IL-12 possess anti-tumor activities in vitro.</p>

<title>EO771 tumor-resected mice represent a model for established metastases to test NK cell therapy</title>
<p>Cancer recurrence occurs in a significant proportion of patients after primary tumor resection due to dissemination of tumor cells before and/or during surgery. To mimic that scenario, we established a syngeneic orthotopic breast cancer model using the MHC-I<sup>+</sup> EO771 cell line that harbors numerous mutations (Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). At 21 days post-inoculation and consistent with the spontaneous lung metastatic property of the EO771 line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ewens, Mihich, &amp; Ehrke, 2005</xref>), we observed that ∼85% of mice with a primary tumor weighing ≥ 95 mg had metastatic foci on the lung surface. The number and area of metastatic foci was positively correlated with tumor weight on day 21 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Resection of the primary tumor and its sentinel lymph node (LN) on day 21 resulted in a long-term survival rate of 18%, with mortality of all remaining mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). All dead mice exhibited metastases in the lung, of which 71% displayed tumor reappearance at the surgical site (data not shown). Therefore, this tumor resection model represents a model of established metastases caused by tumor cell dissemination before and arising from surgery. To apply adoptive NK cell therapy to this model, we examined if the transferred NK cells reach the lungs of tumor-resected mice. The expanded NK cells express the chemokine receptors CXCR3, CCR5 and CXCR6 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), and the lung of tumor-resected mice express mRNA of the corresponding ligands CXCL9/10/11, CCL3/4/5 and CXCL16 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Using eGFP<sup>+</sup> NK cells, we observed that numbers of transferred cells in the lung peaked at 4 h and then continuously declined, remaining detectable for at least 2 days (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). A similar pattern of transferred NK cells was observed in the spleen, albeit with lower cell counts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>).</p>

<title>Syngeneic NK cell therapy is effective in treating mice with low metastatic burden in a CD8<sup>+</sup>-T-cell-dependent manner</title>
<p>We evaluated the effect of syngeneic NK cell therapy on tumor-resected mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> Schema), and found a negative correlation between survival time and day 21 tumor weight in the NK cell-treated group but not in the control group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Consequently, we divided the mice into two groups according to their day 21 tumor weight. NK cell-treated mice displayed significantly enhanced overall survival (OS) and an improved long-term survival rate from 33% to 68% compared to control mice in the 95-400 mg tumor group, whereas the same therapy did not improve OS of the &gt; 400 mg tumor group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). These results, together with the result presented in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, indicate that the NK cell therapy promotes long-term survival of tumor-resected mice carrying low metastatic burden. We further examined if the surviving mice after NK cell treatment had acquired tumor-specific protection by re-challenging them with either EO771 or B16F10 tumor cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> Schema). We found that 83% of these mice were protected from EO771 re-challenge and survived beyond 180 days, whereas all mice re-challenged with B16F10 died (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Age-matched naïve mice inoculated for the first time with either EO771 or B16F10 as a control all died (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Thus, surviving mice of post-resection NK cell therapy displayed tumor-specific protective immunity.</p>

After tumor and sentinel LN resection on day 21, mice received either sorted NK cells (NK cell) or PBS (Control) at the indicated time-points. The correlation between day 21 tumor weight and survival time of mice was evaluated by Pearson correlation. Each dot represents a mouse. The results have been compiled from 5-8 independent experiments. The Control group is the same dataset as presented for the Resection group in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>. (B) NK cell therapy promotes long-term survival of mice who had light tumors on day 21. The mice described in (A) were separated into 95-400 mg and &gt;400 mg day 21 tumor weight groups for survival analysis by means of the Kaplan-Meier estimator and a Log-Rank test: *P&lt;0.05. (C) NK cell therapy induces tumor-specific protection. Surviving mice after NK cell therapy were rechallenged with EO771 (●, compiled from four independent experiments) or B16F10 cells (▴, compiled from two independent experiments) at 11-13 weeks post therapy, and then monitored for survival. Age-matched naïve mice were inoculated with EO771 (○, compiled from four independent experiments) or B16F10 cells (△, compiled from three independent experiments) as controls. Mouse survival, using 2000 mm<sup>3</sup> tumor volume as a cut-off, was analyzed by means of the Kaplan-Meier estimator and a Log-Rank test: ****P&lt;0.001. (D) Depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> cells abolished the efficacy of NK cell therapy. Mice were treated with indicated antibodies at day 19 post tumor inoculation, and then received resection followed by NK cell therapy. Mouse survival was analyzed by means of the Kaplan-Meier estimator and a Log-Rank test: ns, not significant; *P&lt;0.05; ***P&lt;0.001; ****P&lt;0.0001. The data are compiled from 2-3 experiments. (E) T cells isolated from surviving mice post NK cell therapy and tumor re-challenge confer anti-tumor activity. Post NK cell therapy and re-challenge survivors were collected from three independent experiments. T cells and non-T cells isolated from each survivor were transferred separately into naïve recipient mice in a 1-donor-to-1-recipient manner, whereas other naïve mice that received no cells served as a control (compiled from two independent experiments). T cells and non-T cells were also isolated from age-matched naïve donors and transferred separately into naïve recipient mice, whereas other naïve mice that received no cells served as a control (compiled from two independent experiments). The recipient mice were then inoculated with EO771 cells one day after cell transfer. Mouse survival, using 2000 mm<sup>3</sup> tumor volume as a cut-off, was analyzed by means of the Kaplan-Meier estimator and a Log-rank test: ns, not significant; **P&lt;0.01; ***P&lt;0.001.</p>

<p>Since the tumor re-challenge experiment was performed at 11-13 weeks following NK cell treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), the observed long-lasting protection is likely mediated by memory T cells. Accordingly, we examined the role of T cells in NK cell therapy by depleting T cell subsets two days before resecting the primary tumor (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref> Schema and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-figure supplement 1). Treatment with anti-CD8 antibody alone or with anti-CD4 plus anti-CD8 antibodies, but not with anti-CD4 antibody alone, abolished the therapeutic effect of NK cell therapy (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>), indicating the essential role of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Moreover, mice depleted of CD8<sup>+</sup> cells alone survived better than mice depleted of both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells in response to NK cell therapy (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>), suggesting a CD8<sup>+</sup>-T-cell-independent anti-tumor effect of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Next, we examined whether the T cells in surviving mice after NK cell therapy and tumor re-challenge possess anti-tumor activity. T cells and non-T cells were isolated from individual NK cell-treated and EO771-rechallenged survivors or from age-matched donors, and then transferred into naïve recipients in a 1-donor-to-1-recipient manner. The recipient mice were inoculated with EO771 cells to evaluate the anti-tumor effects of the donor cells, whereas naïve mice received no donor cells and served as a control for tumor growth (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref> Schema). For the mice receiving cells isolated from the survivors, 5 of 6 T-cell recipients and 1 of 6 non-T-cell recipients survived beyond 120 days post tumor inoculation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). In contrast, mice receiving either T or non-T cells isolated from age-matched naïve donors all died. Mice that received no donor cells in both experiments also all died (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Together, these results indicate that the post-resection NK cell therapy induces a tumor-specific T cell response with memory that is essential for its treatment efficacy.</p>
<p><bold>Syngeneic NK cell transfer promotes cDC and T cell activation in metastatic lungs</bold> Conventional DCs directly trigger an antigen-specific T cell response by providing ligands to antigen, costimulatory and cytokine receptors expressed on T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cabeza-Cabrerizo, Cardoso, Minutti, Pereira da Costa, &amp; Reis e Sousa, 2021</xref>). A previous in vivo study reported that A20 lymphoma expressing abnormally low levels of MHC I molecules (MHC-I) induces IL-12 production by splenic DCs (CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD19<sup>-</sup>F4/80<sup>-</sup>) and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mocikat et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that our NK cell therapy would modulate cDCs in metastatic lungs in favor of a T cell response. As our IL-15/IL-12-conditioned NK cells express high levels of mRNA encoding IFN-γ and IL-10 (data not shown), cytokines known to modulate cDC function, we examined whether one transfer of wild type (WT), <italic>Il10</italic><sup>-/-</sup> or <italic>Ifng</italic><sup>-/-</sup> NK cells affected cDCs and T cells in the metastatic lungs. Immune cells were analyzed ∼18 hours after NK-cell transfer, by which time the level of transferred NK cells in the lung declined by &gt; 60% relative to that determined at 4-hours (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>).</p>
<p>We found that lung cDC1s and cDC2s consist of cells expressing either high or low level of MHC-II (MHC-II<sup>hi</sup> or MHC-II<sup>lo</sup>), and the MHC-II<sup>hi</sup> cDCs are composed of CCR7<sup>+</sup>Lamp3<sup>+</sup> and CCR7<sup>-</sup>Lamp3<sup>-</sup> subsets (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). The CCR7<sup>+</sup>Lamp3<sup>+</sup>MHC-II<sup>hi</sup> subset expresses the highest level of APC function molecules, including MHC-I, MHC-II, CCR7, CD86, CD40 and PD-L1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), resembling the recently identified mregDC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cheng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">de Saint-Vis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Maier et al., 2020</xref>). The CCR7<sup>-</sup>Lamp3<sup>-</sup>MHC-II<sup>hi</sup> subset expresses an intermediate level of MHC-II, CD86 and CD40 among the three subsets, and similar levels of MHC-I, CCR7 and PD-L1 to that of the MHC-II<sup>lo</sup> subset (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). NK-cell transfer did not alter the proportion of total cDC1s or cDC2s in CD45<sup>+</sup> cells in the lung tissue (data not show). However, among cDC1s, transfer of WT NK cells significantly increased the proportion of the MHC-II<sup>hi</sup> subsets, the levels of CD86 and CD40 expressed by all three subsets, and the levels of PD-L1, MHC-I and MHC-II expressed by the CCR7<sup>-</sup>Lamp3<sup>-</sup>MHC-II<sup>hi</sup> and MHC-II<sup>lo</sup> subsets (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). These effects require IFN-γ, but not IL-10, of the transferred NK cells, except for the PD-L1 level in the MHC-II<sup>lo</sup> subset (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Transfer of WT NK cells exerted many effects on cDC2s similar to those described above for cDC1s, albeit with several differences (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). The differences include augmenting the MHC-II level in the CCR7<sup>+</sup>Lamp3<sup>+</sup>MHC-II<sup>hi</sup> subset, reducing the MHC-II level in the MHC<sup>lo</sup> subset, and having no effect on the level of CD40 in the CCR7<sup>+</sup>Lamp3<sup>+</sup>MHC-II<sup>hi</sup> subset (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). IFN-γ of transferred NK cells is essential for all effects on cDC2s except for the increase of the CCR7<sup>+</sup>Lamp3<sup>+</sup>MHC-II<sup>hi</sup> subset, the increased levels of CD40 and MHC-II in the CCR7<sup>-</sup>Lamp3<sup>-</sup>MHC-II<sup>hi</sup> subset, and the increased levels of CD86 and MHC-II in the MHC-II<sup>lo</sup> subset (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we examined T cells in the lung tissue. Transfer of WT NK cells increased the proportion of Foxp3<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells without altering that of Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>-figure supplement 1A). The proportion of activated Foxp3<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, including effector (CD62L<sup>-</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup>), PD-1<sup>+</sup> and Ki67<sup>+</sup> subsets, also increased (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>-figure supplement 1A). These effects were not observed for mice that received <italic>Ifng</italic><sup>-/-</sup> NK cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in a tumor microenvironment (TME) are known to display a complex composition comprising subsets of different activation/differentiation statuses. First, we categorized lung tissue CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells according to PD-1 and Lag3 expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>-figure supplement 1A), because PD-1 expression is induced by TCR stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sharpe &amp; Pauken, 2018</xref>) and Lag3 is only expressed by exhausted or progenitor-exhausted (PEX) CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Calagua et al., 2021</xref>; Z. Z. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). We reasoned that PD-1<sup>-</sup>Lag3<sup>-</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>-figure supplement 1A) are either naïve or at a very early stage of activation, and found that transfer of <italic>Il10</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, but not WT, NK cells increased the proportion of CD62L<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup> and CD62L<sup>-</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup> subsets, while the proportion of CD62L<sup>-</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup> and Ki67<sup>+</sup> subsets were lower in mice that received <italic>Ifng</italic><sup>-/-</sup> NK cells compared to those proportions in mice that received WT NK cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). These results indicate that IL-10 of transferred NK cells inhibits activation of naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, whereas IFN-γ of transferred NK cells promotes their effector differentiation and proliferation. We further examined stem cell-like (SCL) CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that are Tim3<sup>-</sup> in PD-1<sup>lo</sup>Lag3<sup>-</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>-figure supplement 1A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Castiglioni et al., 2023</xref>), and detected an increase of total and Ki67<sup>+</sup> SCL CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in mice that received WT or <italic>Il10</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, but not <italic>Ifng</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, NK cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Transfer of <italic>Il10</italic><sup>-/-</sup> NK cells resulted in a higher level of SCL CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells than when WT NK cells were transferred (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). In contrast, NK cell transfer did not alter the proportion of exhausted or PEX CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>-figure supplement 1A). The expression of PD-1, Lag3, Tim3, CD44, CD62L, Ly108 and GrzB by SCL, exhausted, and PEX CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in our analysis is consistent with the known characteristics of these cell populations (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>-figure supplement 1B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Andreatta et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Castiglioni et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Martinez-Usatorre et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, overall, transfer of the IL-15/IL-12-conditioned syngeneic NK cells augmented the activation of cDC1s and cDC2s, as well as the levels and activation of Foxp3<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and SCL CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in metastatic lungs. Moreover, IFN-γ of the transferred NK cells is essential for these effects.</p>

<p>It is known that CCR7 mediates migration of cDC from tumor to its draining LN (dLN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Riol-Blanco et al., 2005</xref>), in which the migratory cDCs prime tumor-specific naive T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mempel, Henrickson, &amp; von Andrian, 2004</xref>). As transfer of WT NK cells increased the levels of CCR7<sup>+</sup>LAPM3<sup>+</sup>MHC-II<sup>hi</sup> cDC1s and cDC2 in metastatic lungs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), we hypothesized that NK cell transfer augments migration of lung cDCs to mLN and activation of T cells. We analyzed migratory and resident cDCs in mLN (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>-figure supplement 1), and found that &gt; 90% of migratory cDC1s and &gt; 65% of migratory cDC2s express CCR7 and LAMP3 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), a phenotype similar to lung CCR7<sup>+</sup>LAMP3<sup>+</sup>MHC-II<sup>hi</sup> cDC1 and cDC2. On the other hand, the great majority of resident cDC1s and cDC2s in mLN are CCR7<sup>-</sup>LAMP3<sup>-</sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Transfer of WT NK cells increased the proportion of migratory cDC1 in cDCs and the level of CD86 expression by both migratory cDC1s and cDC2s, which required IFN-γ of the transferred NK cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). We also examined T cells in mLN and found that NK cell transfer affected neither the proportion nor the activation marked by CD44<sup>+</sup> or KI67<sup>+</sup> of Foxp3<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (data not show). Collectively, NK cell transfer increased the level of migratory cDC1 and CD86 expression by migratory cDC1s and cDC2s, but did not affect T cell activation in mLN.</p>

<title>Clinical trial of autologous NK cell therapy on advanced cancer patients</title>
<p>To assess NK cell therapy in human, we expanded human NK cells from TCRβ<sup>-</sup>CD19<sup>-</sup> PBMCs. The expanded NK cells are identifiable as CD3<sup>-</sup>CD19<sup>-</sup>CD14<sup>-</sup>CD56<sup>+</sup>EOMES<sup>+</sup>, with ∼90% of the cells expressing HLA-DR (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Co-culture of the expanded HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> NK cells with K562, THP-1 or U937 tumor cells resulted in dose-dependent tumor cell death (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>) and increased IFN-γ production by the NK cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). We then conducted an investigator-initiated clinical trial of autologous NK cell therapy in six pre-treated advanced cancer patients enrolled between May 2016 and October 2019. Baseline characteristics of these patients are presented in Table. The patients had an ECOG performance status of 0 and a relatively small target lesion size (6.4-22.7 mm), suggesting relatively low tumor burden. The patients in cohort 1 and cohort 2 received six bi-weekly infusions of 20×10<sup>6</sup> or 30×10<sup>6</sup> autologous HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> NK cells, respectively. The infused cells were total cells expanded from TCRβ<sup>-</sup>CD19<sup>-</sup> PBMCs, of which median 92.4% (83.2-94.9%) were HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> NK cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>-figure supplement 1). The composition of the infused cells differed slightly among patients, but was stable for each patient over the six infusions (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). We examined the expression of NKRs, CD16 and CXCR3 on the HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> NK cells and determined that it was stable for each patient over six batches of cell preparations, apart from some variation in NKp44 for patient 5 and CXCR3 for patient 4 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>-figure supplement 2). Moreover, the HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> NK cells expressed the anti-tumor effectors perforin and IFN-γ (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>-figure supplement 3). All patients completed the course of six infusions. The therapy proved safe and was well-tolerated by all patients, as no treatment-related adverse effect was observed throughout the entire infusion period up to 24 h after the final infusion. We assessed the preliminary impact of this therapeutic approach based on clinical responses and OS, and present the results with a median follow-up of 60.0 months (2.73-60.0). The response and survival timings were counted from the first infusion of NK cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>). We adopted RECIST 1.1 to evaluate responses, except that the baseline target lesions for patients 3, 4 and 5 (Table) were 18%, 36% and 31% smaller than measurable lesions according to RECIST 1.1. All patients were in a stable disease (SD) state at month 1 (i.e., 1 week after the second infusion), and completed six infusions by month 2.3. Patients 1, 3 and 6 only received NK cell therapy, whereas patients 2, 4 and 5 received additional treatment(s) as indicated. Patient 1 exhibited progressive disease (PD) at month 2.7 and left the trial. Patient 2 displayed SD for 8.2 months, during which a partial response (PR) was detected at month 4.4. She then received maintenance metronomic Endoxan starting from month 8.4, and displayed SD or PR for a further 50 months. Patient 3 displayed SD for 52.7 months. Patient 4 exhibited an SD state for 13 months, received Tarceva during months 14.9-18.6, suffered PD at month 18.6 that prompted receipt of other treatments, and ultimately left the trial at month 31.5.</p>

<p>Patient 5 presented SD for 9.9 months, and received metronomic Endoxan during months 7.7-13.5, 28.9-33.0, and 43.6-46.1. She underwent ultrasound imaging during months 17.6-54.2 and the results support a continuing SD state. Patient 6 retained an SD state for 36.3 months, and subsequent ultrasound imaging in month 44.5 supports a continuing SD state. In summary, among the four patients with metastatic solid tumors, patients 1 and 4 exhibited PD at month 2.7 and 18.6, respectively, leaving the trial at months 2.7 and 31.5, respectively. In contrast, patients 3 and 6, who only received NK cell therapy, exhibited a SD state and both survived for 60 months. The two follicular lymphoma patients (patients 2 and 5) who started maintenance Endoxan therapy ∼6 months after undergoing the NK-cell therapy have exhibited a SD state and both survived for 60 months. These preliminary results suggest some level of effectiveness for the autologous NK cell therapy, supporting the efficacy of our pre-clinical mouse model.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The limited benefit achieved with adoptive autologous NK cell therapy for metastatic solid tumors is paradoxical given the clear anti-tumor functions of endogenous NK cells. In this study, we found that transfer of syngeneic NK cells conditioned using IL-15 and IL-12 after resecting the primary tumor resulted in long-term survival of mice with low burden lung metastases. Our results indicate a requirement for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and the contribution of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to the effectiveness of this NK cell therapy (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>), which is distinct from the T-cell-independent anti-metastasis mechanisms of NK cells demonstrated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Correia et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Malladi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mittal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Takeda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Uemura et al., 2010</xref>). The difference in T cell dependency likely arises from differences in experimental design. These previous studies examined the effect of endogenous NK cells on experimental metastasis following intravenous or intrasplenic tumor cell injection by enumerating metastases of affected organs 14 days later. Given that the effect of NK cells on experimental metastasis is mediated by clearing intraluminal tumor cells in microvessels before they extravasate into the target tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Spiegel et al., 2016</xref>), these studies assessed T cell-independent control of metastasis by NK cells. In contrast, our study examined the effect of adoptively transferred ex vivo-stimulated NK cells on spontaneous metastasis by measuring long-term survival, in which lung metastases were established before primary tumor resection and NK cell administration (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The T cell dependency of the NK cell therapy in our model indicates that innate mechanisms are not sufficient to support the long-term survival of mice with EO771 metastases, which is consistent with the finding from experimental metastasis models that NK cells alone cannot reduce metastases after tumor cells have seeded the target tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Spiegel et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, the timeframe we adopted for measuring long-term survival covers the period for the innate effect of the transferred NK cells and the effect of a full T cell response with memory. The CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell dependency implies that the transferred NK cells act as an upstream controller for an effective anti-tumor T cell response, which is in line with a previous study showing that early intratumoral accumulation of IFN-γ-producing endogenous NK cells is required for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-mediated eradication of <italic>Cox</italic>-deficient melanoma in immunocompetent wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bonavita et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>In studying the mechanism underlying T cell-dependency for the effectiveness of NK cell therapy, our results from a mouse model reveal that transfer of WT NK cells augments activation of cDC1s and cDC2s in the metastatic lung (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). cDC1s and cDC2s present cell-associated and soluble antigens, respectively, to CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hildner et al., 2008</xref>). The increase of MHC-II<sup>hi</sup> cDC subsets and elevated expression of MHC-I, MHC-II and CD86 by lung cDC1s and cDC2s presumably promotes T cell activation, which is consistent with the increase of activated lung Foxp3<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Moreover, the elevated CD40 expression by cDC1 and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation implies cDC1-relayed CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell help for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response in the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Ferris et al., 2020</xref>). We also detected an increase of SCL CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in metastatic lungs upon NK cell transfer (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Intratumoral tumor-specific SCL CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are known to mediate the responses to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and adoptive T cell immunotherapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Krishna et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Siddiqui et al., 2019</xref>) and are supplied from a reservoir of precursors in the tumor dLN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Connolly et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Schenkel et al., 2021</xref>). As cDC1s in tumor dLN maintain the SCL CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell precursor reservoir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Schenkel et al., 2021</xref>), the increase of migratory cDC1 in mLN upon NK cell transfer (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>) likely contribute to the increase of lung SCL CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Moreover, a recent study reported that the SCL CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell precursors are activated by tumor antigens in the tumor dLN and acquire a stem-like state without an effector phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Prokhnevska et al., 2023</xref>). After migrating to a tumor, they differentiate from SCL to an effector state, which requires costimulation by CD80 and CD86 of APC in the TME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Prokhnevska et al., 2023</xref>). Our findings of augmented CD86 expression by cDCs and increased proliferating SCL CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in response to NK-cell transfer in metastatic lung are in line with the two-step activation of intratumoral SCL CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Together, these results demonstrate a clear association between the activation of lung cDCs and T cells in response to NK cell transfer. Furthermore, IFN-γ of transferred NK cells is essential for the activation of both cDCs and T cells, strengthening evidence for the scenario that NK cells activate cDCs and then cDCs activate T cells. The requirement for IFN-γ of transferred NK cells also suggests a direct interaction between transferred NK cells and lung cDCs. The increase of CCR7<sup>+</sup>LAMP3<sup>+</sup> MHC-II<sup>hi</sup> cDCs supports this supposition, with a recent study reporting colocalization of LAMP3<sup>+</sup> DCs with NK cells in four types of human solid tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Tang et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, this result indicates that NK-cell-derived IFN-γ drives the generation of mregDCs.</p>
<p>In summary, our results indicate that syngeneic IL-15/IL-12-conditioned NK cell therapy promotes tumor-specific T cell responses, at least in part, through activation of cDC1s and cDC2s in metastatic lung. Our findings are consistent with the critical role of endogenous NK cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in anti-tumor immunity, and support that autologous NK cell therapy is effective in treating established low burden MHC-I<sup>+</sup> metastases by enhancing the tumor-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response.</p>

<title>EO771 resection and metastasis model and NK cell treatment</title>
<p>Each mouse was inoculated with 0.3 million EO771 cells into the right fourth mammary fat pad on day 0. Twenty-one days later, mice were anesthetized and the resulting tumor and sentinel LN (right inguinal LN) were resected. Sham control mice received the same surgical procedure without removing any tissue. Mice harboring a day-21 tumor weight of &lt;95 mg were excluded since resection alone promoted long-term survival of mice with such tumors. Mice were grouped to have a similar mean and standard deviation of day-21 tumor weight. Each mouse then received 0.3 million expanded NK cells or PBS (Control) via the tail vein three times on days 24, 28 and 31, or once on day 24 as indicated. The resulting metastatic foci on lung surfaces were visualized by staining the dissected lung with India ink under a dissecting microscope. The area of metastatic foci was determined using ImageJ (NIH). For T cell depletion, mice were administered intraperitoneally with 200 μg of anti-CD4 (GK1.5, BioXcell, Lebanon, NH, USA), anti-CD8α (2.43, BioXcell), or both antibodies 19 days after EO771 inoculation, whereas control mice each received 400 μg of isotype control antibody (Rat IgG2b, κ; BioXcell).

<title>Clinical trial design</title>
<p>We conducted an investigator-driven, open-label, 3+3 design trial to investigate the safety of the autologous NK cell therapy on metastatic/refractory stage IV cancer patients at a single center (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> Identifier: NCT02661685). All six patients were ineligible for or refused further systemic chemotherapy or immunotherapy, and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, a target lesion, and adequate organ function at the time of enrollment. The three patients in cohort 1 received six bi-weekly intravenous infusions of 20×10<sup>6</sup> expanded autologous HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> NK cells, whereas the three patients in cohort 2 were administered with 30×10<sup>6</sup> of the same cells. All patients underwent a computerized tomography (CT) scan between the second and the third NK cell infusions, and then five further CT scans at 8-week intervals starting one week after the sixth infusion. Thereafter, CT or sonography scans were performed as indicated. Safety was evaluated by assessing dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), defined as any treatment-related toxicity of grade 3 or above of general or immune disorders according to the National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) v4.03. Fever, chills, flu-like symptoms, or infusion-related reactions of grade 3 or above were considered DLT only if they remained at grade 3 or above for more than 3 days despite appropriate medication. Clinical responses to the therapy were evaluated by CT scans according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). Patient survival was followed every 8 weeks for the first year and every 12 weeks from the second to the fifth year.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study provides <bold>solid</bold> in vivo data that transfer of IL-15/IL-12-conditioned syngeneic NK cells after primary tumor resection promotes long-term survival of mice with low metastatic burden from breast cancer. Also, the authors conducted an investigator-initiated clinical trial that demonstrated that similar NK cell infusions in cancer patients after resections were safe and showed signs of efficacy. Therefore, this study is of interest and value to oncologists in the field of breast cancer research.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is a very nice paper in which the authors addressed the potential for NK cell cellular therapy to treat and potentially eliminate previously established metastases after surgical resections, which are a major cause of death in human cancer patients. To do so they developed a model using the EO771 breast cancer cell line, in which they establish and then resect tumors and the draining lymph node, after which the majority of mice eventually succumb to metastatic disease. They found that when the initiating tumors were resected when still relatively small, adoptive transfers of IL-15/12-conditioned NK cells substantially enhanced the survival of tumor-bearing animals. They then delved into the cellular mechanisms involved. Interestingly and somewhat unexpectedly, the therapeutic effect of the transferred NK cells was dependent on the host's CD8+ T cells. Accordingly, the NK cell therapy contributed to the formation of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells, which protected the recipient animals against tumor re-challenge and were effective in protecting mice from tumor formation when transferred to naive mice. Mechanistically, they used Ifng knockout NK cells to provide evidence that IFNgamma produced by the transferred NK cells was crucial for the accumulation and activation of DCs in the metastatic lung, including expression of CD86, CD40, and MHC genes. In turn, IFNgamma production by NK cells was essential for the induced accumulation of activated CD8 effector T cells and stem cell-like CD8 T cells in the metastatic lung. The authors then expanded their findings from the mouse model to a small clinical trial. They found that inoculations of IL-15/12-conditioned autologous NK cells in patients with various malignancies after resection were safe and showed signs of efficacy.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- Monitoring of long-term metastatic disease and survival after resection used in this paper is a physiological model that closely resembles clinical scenarios more than the animal models usually used, a great strength of the approach.</p>
<p>- Previous literature focused on the notion that NK cells clear metastatic lesions directly, within a short period. The authors' use of a more relevant model and time frame revealed the previously unexplored T cell-dependent mechanism of action of infused NK cells for long-term control of metastatic diseases.</p>
<p>- Also important, the paper provides solid evidence for the contribution of IFNgamma produced by NK cells for activation of dendritic cells and T cells. This is an interesting finding that provokes additional questions concerning the action of the interferon-gamma in this context.</p>
<p>- The results from the clinical trial in cancer patients based on the same type of IL-15/12-conditioned NK cell infusions, were encouraging with respect to safety and showed signals of efficacy, which support the translatability of the author's findings.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- Having demonstrated that NK cell IFNgamma is important for recruiting and activating DCs and T cells in their model, one is left to wonder whether it is important for the therapeutic effect, which was not tested.</p>
<p>- Relatedly, previous studies, cited by the authors, reported that NK cells promote T cell activation by producing the chemokines CCL5 and XCL1, and FLT3 ligand, which respectively recruit and activate dendritic cells that can subsequently mobilize a T cell response. The present study demonstrates an important role for NK cell-produced IFNgamma in these processes. One is left wondering whether the model used by the authors is also dependent on CCL5, XCL1, and FLT3 production by NK cells, and if so whether IFNgamma plays a role in that or acts in parallel. The issue could be discussed by the authors, even if they cannot easily resolve it.</p>
<p>- The authors do not address whether the IL-12 in their cocktail is essential for the effects they see. Relatedly, it was of interest that despite the effectiveness of the transferred IL-15/IL-12 cultured NK cells, the cells failed to persist very long after transfer. Published studies have reported that so-called memory-like NK cells, which are pre-activated with a cocktail of IL-12, IL-18 and IL-15, persist much longer in lympho-depleted mice and patients than IL-2 cultured NK cells. It would be illuminating to compare these two types of NK cell products in the author's model system, and with, or without, lymphodepletion, to identify the critical parameters. If greater persistence occurred with the memory-like NK cell product, it is possible that the NK cells might provide greater benefit, including by directly targeting the tumor.</p>
<p>- It was somewhat difficult to gauge the clinical trial results because the trial was early stage and therefore not controlled. Evaluation of the results therefore relies on historical comparisons. To evaluate how encouraging the results are, it would be valuable for the authors to provide some context on the prognoses and likely disease progression of these patients at the time of treatment.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors show convincing data that increasing NK cell function/frequency can reduce the development and progression of metastatic disease after primary tumor resection.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The inclusion of a first-in-human trial highlighting some partial responses of metastatic patients treated with in vitro expanded NK cells is tantalising. It is difficult to perform trials in preventing further metastasis since the timelines are very protracted. However, more data like these that highlight the role of NK cells in improving local cDC1/T cells anti-tumor immunity will encourage deeper thinking around therapeutic approaches to target endogenous NK cells to achieve the same.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>As always, more patient data would help increase confidence in the human relevance of the approach.</p>
