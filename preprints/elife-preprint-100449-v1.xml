<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Pre-mRNA splicing is catalyzed in two steps: 5’ splice site (SS) cleavage and exon ligation. A number of proteins transiently associate with spliceosomes to specifically impact these steps (1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> step factors). We recently identified Fyv6 (FAM192A in humans) as a 2<sup>nd</sup> step factor in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>; however, we did not determine how widespread Fyv6’s impact is on the transcriptome. To answer this question, we have used RNA-seq to analyze changes in splicing. These results show that loss of Fyv6 results in activation of non-consensus, branch point (BP) proximal 3’ SS transcriptome-wide. To identify the molecular basis of these observations, we determined a high-resolution cryo-EM structure of a yeast product complex spliceosome containing Fyv6 at 2.3 Å. The structure reveals that Fyv6 is the only 2<sup>nd</sup> step factor that contacts the Prp22 ATPase and that Fyv6 binding is mutually exclusive with that of the 1<sup>st</sup> step factor Yju2. We then use this structure to dissect Fyv6 functional domains and interpret results of a genetic screen for <italic>fyv61</italic> suppressor mutations. The combined transcriptomic, structural, and genetic studies allow us to propose a model in which Yju2/Fyv6 exchange facilitates exon ligation and Fyv6 promotes usage of consensus, BP distal 3’ SS.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) splicing is catalyzed by a large macromolecular complex called the spliceosome. Spliceosomes are composed of 5 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), each composed of a small nuclear RNA (snRNA; U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6) and several different protein splicing factors. The snRNPs and dozens of other proteins assemble <italic>de novo</italic> at each intron to form spliceosomes. Spliceosomes are highly dynamic and form different complexes as proteins and snRNAs join and leave. Many of these complexes have been characterized biochemically, genetically, and by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Plaschka et al., 2019</xref>). The splicing reaction itself is carried out in two sequential transesterification reactions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). First, the 5’ splice site (5’ SS) is cleaved during formation of an intron lariat (1<sup>st</sup> step). Second, the intron lariat is removed simultaneously with exon ligation at the 3’ SS (2<sup>nd</sup> step).</p>

<p>The integrity of the genetic information contained within a pre-mRNA depends on correct identification of the 5’ and 3’ SS by the splicing machinery since a single nucleotide shift in either site could destroy a protein reading frame. In yeast, several DExD/H-box ATPases function to limit usage of suboptimal SS by enhancing splicing fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chung et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Semlow and Staley, 2012</xref>). Two of these ATPases, Prp16 and Prp22, impact the fidelity of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> catalytic steps, respectively. In addition to these roles, Prp16 is also required for remodeling of the spliceosome to permit the 1<sup>st</sup>-to-2<sup>nd</sup> step transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Schwer and Guthrie, 1992</xref>), and Prp22 is essential for releasing the mRNA product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Company et al., 1991</xref>). While Prp16 does not need to be present during the 1<sup>st</sup> step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chung et al., 2023</xref>), Prp22 is required to be present for exon ligation if the branch point (BP) to 3’ SS distance is <underline>&gt;</underline> 21 nucleotides (nt) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Schwer and Gross, 1998</xref>). Despite many biochemical, single molecule, and structural studies, how spliceosomes promote usage of BP distal, Prp22-dependent 3’ SS has remained elusive.</p>
<p>Identification of the correct 3’ SS is an especially challenging problem given that the consensus sequence in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (yeast) and humans is just three nucleotides (YAG, Y=U or C). Cryo-EM structures of spliceosome product (P) complexes have revealed how these nucleotides can be recognized within the spliceosome active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Fica et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Wilkinson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). The AG 3’ SS dinucleotide is recognized by formation of non-Watson Crick base-pairing interactions with the 5’ SS +1G and BP adenosine, while the pyrimidine at the -3 position of the 3’ SS is recognized by the Prp8 protein. Given this short consensus sequence, multiple different splicing factors also help to ensure that the correct 3’ SS is utilized, including Cwc21 and the 2<sup>nd</sup> step factors Slu7, Prp18, and Prp22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Crotti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Frank and Guthrie, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gautam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kawashima et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Roy et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Semlow et al., 2016</xref>). It is believed that Slu7 and Prp18 help to stabilize 3’ SS docking to the active site and that this contributes to 2<sup>nd</sup> step efficiency. It has been proposed that Prp22 antagonizes 3’ SS docking to permit sampling of different 3’ SS to ensure that optimal sequences are used as a proofreading mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mayas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Semlow et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, identification of the correct 3’ SS depends not just on identification of the YAG sequence but also involves choosing which YAG sequence to use. Prp18 appears to aid in selection of BP distal 3’ SS and avoidance of BP proximal (and often non-consensus) 3’ SS. This observation could be due to Prp18 imposing a BP to 3’ SS distance constraint, enforcing use of canonical YAG 3’ SS sequences, or a combination of the two activities.</p>
<p>Recently, Fyv6 was identified as a novel 2<sup>nd</sup> step factor in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lipinski et al., 2023</xref>). Fyv6 is a homolog of the human protein FAM192A, which was identified in pre-C* structures of the human spliceosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Zhan et al., 2022</xref>). While the impact of FAM192A on human spliceosome activity has not yet been well-characterized, loss of Fyv6 in yeast decreases 2<sup>nd</sup> step splicing efficiency <italic>in vitro</italic> and results in use of an alternative 3’ SS in the <italic>SUS1</italic> pre-mRNA <italic>in vivo</italic>. It is likely that unassigned cryo-EM densities in yeast C* (just prior to exon ligation) and P complexes correspond to Fyv6 since these densities are in analogous locations to that for FAM192A in the human pre-C* structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Zhan et al., 2022</xref>). However, the resolutions of the yeast C* and P complex structures make unambiguous assignment of Fyv6 amino acid side chains and interactions difficult.</p>
<p>Here, we use a combination of transcriptomic, structural, biochemical, and genetic assays to elucidate how Fyv6 controls 3’ SS usage in yeast. RNA-seq analysis reveals widespread activation of alternative, BP proximal nonconsensus 3’ SS in the absence of Fyv6 consistent with biochemical assays that show Fyv6 facilitates splicing of 3’ SS located <underline>&gt;</underline> 21 nt from the BP. To further elucidate Fyv6 function, we determined a 2.3 Å cryo-EM structure of the yeast P complex spliceosome in which Fyv6 can be modeled. The structure reveals interactions between Fyv6 and Prp22 as well as a domain in Syf1 that interacts with either Fyv6 or the 1<sup>st</sup> step factor Yju2. 3D classification allowed us to identify two additional conformational states of P complex and provides insights into the coupling of 3’ SS active site docking and the presence of 2<sup>nd</sup> step factors. We then used this structural data to dissect the functional domains of Fyv6, interpret the results of a genetic screen for suppressors of <italic>fyv6Δ</italic>, and to probe Fyv6 and Prp22 interactions. Combined, we propose a model in which Fyv6 is recruited to the spliceosome via interactions with the NTC component Syf1 in order to promote usage of BP distal, and Prp22-dependent, 3’ SS.</p>

<title>Deletion of <italic>FYV6</italic> Results in Widespread Use of Alternative 3′ Splice Sites</title>
<p>Our previous work showed that loss of <italic>FYV6</italic> causes changes in 3’ SS usage in the <italic>SUS1</italic> pre-mRNA. To probe for changes transcriptome-wide, we used nonsense mediated decay (NMD)-deficient (<italic>upf11</italic>, WT) yeast cells expressing or lacking Fyv6. By suppressing NMD, we hoped to limit degradation of alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms generated in the absence of Fyv6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Sayani et al., 2008</xref>). Consistent with results from <italic>fyv61</italic> strains, the <italic>fyv61 upf11</italic> double mutant strain also showed reduced growth at 30°C and cold-sensitive (<italic>cs</italic>) and temperature-sensitive (<italic>ts</italic>) phenotypes relative to a <italic>upf11</italic> control strain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). We then used RNA-Seq to analyze the isolated RNAs from these strains. As expected, many more changes in splicing were observed in the <italic>fyv61 upf11</italic> strain relative to the <italic>fyv61</italic> strain (<bold>Supplemental Fig. S1A, B; Supplemental Tables S1, S2</bold>). This is consistent with many mRNA isoforms generated due to loss of Fyv6 being substrates for NMD. Loss of Fyv6 resulted in a number of changes in gene expression with many non-intron containing genes also being up- or down-regulated (<bold>Supplemental Fig. S1C</bold>).</p>
<p>We compared and classified changes in splicing between strains containing or lacking <italic>FYV6</italic> under permissive growth conditions (30°C) or after the yeast had been shifted to a non-permissive temperature (16 or 37°C) for 1 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). In this case, we only considered events resulting in at least a 10% change in the percent spliced in (PSI) value when <italic>FYV6</italic> is deleted. At all temperatures, we see changes in alternative 3’ SS usage in the <italic>fyv61</italic> strain relative to the <italic>FYV6</italic> background. For example, we detected use of the alternative 3’ SS in the first intron of the <italic>SUS1</italic> transcript as we previously reported (<bold>Supplemental Fig. S1D</bold>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lipinski et al., 2023</xref>). We also saw increased use of a cryptic, nonconsensus GAG 3’ SS in the first, but not second, intron of the <italic>YOS1</italic> transcript in the <italic>fyv61</italic> data sets and confirmed this result by RT-PCR (<bold>Supplemental Fig. S1E, F</bold>). We observed several cases of alternative 5’ SS. However, the majority of these alternative 5’ SS were used with equal efficiencies in the WT and <italic>fyv61</italic> strains (<bold>Supplemental Fig. S1G</bold>).</p>
<p>The strains temperature shifted to 16°C had the largest number of changes due to <italic>FYV6</italic> deletion and the strains shifted to 37°C the least. The temperature shift to 16° caused an increase in the numbers of both alternative 3’ SS and retained intron events detected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). The changes in alternative 3’ SS used at each temperature were mostly unique with few events detected under all three conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Collectively, we observed that 61 different RNAs changed splicing patterns due to loss of Fyv6. For many of these mRNAs, we detected multiple different 3’ SS being used.</p>
<p>To investigate these splicing events more closely, we analyzed changes in usage of alterative splice junctions by calculating the Fraction of Annotated Splicing (FAnS) in the presence and absence of Fyv6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Roy et al., 2023</xref>). FAnS ratios report the relative abundance of an alternative splicing event in relation to the main spliced isoform. We calculated FAnS values for all exon junction reads corresponding to usage of a canonical 5’ SS and an alternative 3’ SS for WT and <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> strains at each temperature. We then calculated the ratios of the <italic>fyv6Δ</italic>/WT FAnS values for each transcript. These results confirm changes in alternative 3’ SS usage for both ribosomal protein gene (RPG) and non-RPG transcripts at all conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). We could not detect any significant differences between RPG and non-RPG splicing with this analysis, suggesting that differences in gene expression and splicing efficiencies between these two classes are not correlated with alternative 3’ SS usage. Combined these results show that Fyv6 plays a critical role in defining mRNA isoform production in yeast, particularly under non-optimal growth conditions such as temperature stress.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Fyv6 Facilitates Usage of Branch Point Distal 3′ Splice Sites</title>
<p>We next analyzed the features of the 3’ SS impacted by Fyv6 loss. We used RNAs collected from yeast grown at 30°C and sequenced the libraries at higher depth than those used for the temperature-shift experiment described in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> (∼400 million vs. 200 million reads; <bold>Supplemental Table S2</bold>). We first identified alternative 3’ SS used in each strain, annotated each as being upstream (5’) or downstream (3’) of the canonical 3’ SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Grate and Ares, 2002</xref>), and then calculated the FAnS ratio for each site. This analysis shows that the majority of the alternative 3’ SS arising from Fyv6 deletion are upstream (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, pink points above the diagonal). When these alternative 3’ SS are mapped according to their nucleotide distance from the canonical site, most of these are found within ∼40 nt upstream (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, purple violin). Plotting these alternative 3’ SS sites relative to their distance from the annotated BP reveals that the highest density of sites is <underline>&lt;</underline> 20 nt from the BP for transcripts with the highest FAnS ratios (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, purple violin). It is important to note that we did not map BP in Fyv6 deletion strains, and it is possible that in some cases a shift in 3’ SS usage could also coincide with a shift in the BP. Indeed, a small number of alternative 3’ SS detected in the Fyv6 data sets are located upstream of the annotated BP, suggesting activation of an alternative BP and 3’ SS. However, we believe that the changes are predominantly due to usage of alternative 3’ SS located between the annotated BP and canonical 3’ SS.</p>

<p>The above results suggest that Fyv6 is important for splicing of 3’ SS located distant from the BP. To test this directly and systematically, we created a series of ACT1-CUP1 reporters with various BP to 3’ SS distances (9-50 nt, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, <bold>Supplemental Table S3</bold>) based on sequences used in previous studies of 3’ SS selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brys and Schwer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Frank and Guthrie, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Schwer and Gross, 1998</xref>). We transformed strains containing or lacking Fyv6 and without debranchase (Dbr1) to limit degradation of lariat intermediates. We then detected RNA products by primer extension and calculated the 2<sup>nd</sup> step (exon ligation) efficiency for each reporter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E, F</xref>). While loss of Fyv6 has minimal impact on exon ligation when BP to 3’ SS distances are short (9-15 nt), exon ligation efficiency decreases significantly at distances of 21 nt or greater. In addition, we do not see evidence of cryptic BP usage in these assays. This result is consistent with the RNA-seq analysis and supports a function for Fyv6 in facilitating splicing at BP distal 3’ SS.</p>
<p>Finally, we analyzed the sequence features of the alternative 3’ SS activated by loss of Fyv6 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G, H</xref>). For sites located upstream of the canonical 3’ SS, we observed much greater sequence variability relative to the canonical site. We detected increased use of highly variable 3’ SS including those with atypical HAU (H=A,C,U) and BG (B=C,U,G) motifs and confirmed generation of new RNA isoforms for several of these by RT-PCR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref><bold>, Supplemental Fig. S2</bold>). Increased use of variable 3’ SS was also observed when the 2<sup>nd</sup> step factor <italic>PRP18</italic> was deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Roy et al., 2023</xref>). However, the subset of RNAs most impacted by splicing factor deletion appear to be different. For example, we were not able to detect changes in 3’ SS usage for the <italic>UBC12</italic>, <italic>MAF1</italic>, <italic>MUD1</italic>, <italic>PHO85</italic>, <italic>SPT14</italic>, or <italic>YCL002C</italic> transcripts in the <italic>fyv6</italic>1 data sets as was reported for <italic>prp18</italic>1 (not shown). Prp18 and Fyv6 likely have transcript-specific effects on splicing outcomes. Combined our results strongly support Fyv6 as a 2<sup>nd</sup> step splicing factor that facilitates usage of consensus sites located distal to the BP <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>A High-Resolution Spliceosome Structure Reveals Fyv6 Interactions</title>
<p>Previous structures of the yeast P-complex spliceosome were solved with resolutions at the core ranging from 3.3 Å to 3.7 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Wilkinson et al., 2017</xref>), and with peripheral components such as the Prp22 helicase, U2 snRNP, and Prp19 Complex (NTC) at much lower resolutions (5-10 Å) that precluded detailed investigation. To improve the resolution, we purified P complex as previously described by stalling spliceosome disassembly with a dominant negative mutant of Prp22 (S635A) defective in mRNA release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Schwer and Meszaros, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Wilkinson et al., 2017</xref>). However, by collecting a much larger cryo-EM dataset on a more modern electron detector, we were able to resolve the structure to 2.3 Å within the catalytic core, as well as visualize peripheral components at resolutions from 3.0 Å – 3.7 Å (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A, B</xref><bold>; Supplemental Fig. S3-S6; Supplemental Table S4</bold>). This is the highest resolution spliceosome structure to date. The high-quality density at the active site shows the positions of bases unambiguously, confirming the manner of the non-Watson-Crick base pairing that mediates 3’ SS recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Wilkinson et al., 2017</xref>). Monovalent ions bound at the active site were previously shown to be important during the 1<sup>st</sup> step of splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Wilkinson et al., 2021</xref>), and our data indicate that the positions of these ions are preserved after exon ligation. Additionally, the density also shows a metal ion, likely potassium, that bridges the base pair between +1G of the 5’ SS and -1G of the 3’ SS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p>

<p>The 2<sup>nd</sup>-step splicing factor Prp22 is resolved at 3.0 Å resolution, allowing atomic interpretation for the first time (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 3B</bold></xref> and later figures). Bases 13 – 21 of the 3’ exon are visible between the two RecA domains of Prp22 consistent with biochemical footprinting data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Schwer, 2008</xref>). The S635A mutation used to stall P complex is also visible; however, the origin of defective mRNA release due to this mutation is not apparent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Schwer and Meszaros, 2000</xref>). The loop containing S635A is in a similar conformation in this structure and in the structure of WT human Prp22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Felisberto-Rodrigues et al., 2019</xref>) (<bold>Supplemental Fig. S6</bold>). Part of the extensive N-terminal domain of Prp22 is resolved and constitutes a long helix that bridges between the Prp22 RecA2 domain and the C-terminal domain of Cwc22; this helix was unassigned in previous P-complex structures (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p>

<p>To improve the resolution of the peripheral, flexible regions, we used a new data-driven regularization strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kimanius et al., 2023</xref>) that allows focused refinements of much smaller domains than previously possible (<bold>Supplemental Fig. S4, S6</bold>). Combined with AlphaFold2-assisted modelling, we were able to obtain more accurate models for the U2 snRNP, NTC, U5 Sm ring, and Cwc22 N-terminal domains. Our model for the NTC within the P complex is similar to our previous model for the NTC within C and C<sup>i</sup> complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Wilkinson et al., 2021</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Notably however, we observed a star-shaped density coordinated by several conserved lysines from Clf1 and Ntc20, which we were able to model as inositol hexakisphosphate (IP<sub>6</sub>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). The same density, at lower resolution, is visible in the C complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Wilkinson et al., 2021</xref>). A distinct, separate IP<sub>6</sub> molecule had previously been observed within all catalytic spliceosomes between the B<sup>act</sup> and P-complex stages coordinated by Prp8 and (for C* and P-complexes) Slu7 (<bold>Supplemental Fig. S6</bold>). We do not believe that the NTC-bound IP<sub>6</sub> is essential for splicing since deletion of the Clf1 tetratricopeptide repeat that coordinates IP<sub>6</sub> does not result in growth or splicing phenotypes in yeast and Ntc20 is a non-essential splicing factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chung et al., 1999</xref>). Nonetheless, it is possible that IP<sub>6</sub> may regulate splicing in some manner via interactions with both Prp8 and the NTC.</p>
<p>We were able to unambiguously assign three, connected long α-helices to Fyv6 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). These helices were visible in previous cryo-EM reconstructions of yeast C* and P complexes but were either unassigned or misassigned. In the cases of misassigned densities, Fyv6 was previously attributed to the C-terminal domain of the 1<sup>st</sup> step factor Yju2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Wilkinson et al., 2017</xref>). Yju2 also has an elongated helical architecture and adopts a similar position on C complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Wilkinson et al., 2021</xref>) and the post-P complex Intron Lariat Spliceosome (ILS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wan et al., 2017</xref>). We closely inspected the density from previously determined spliceosome structures and concluded that the Yju2 C-terminus is still a better fit than Fyv6 for densities in B* and C complexes, whereas Fyv6 is a better fit than Yju2 for densities in C* and P complexes (<bold>Supplemental Fig. S7</bold>). Therefore, this position of Fyv6 seems to be characteristic of a 2<sup>nd</sup> step conformation of the spliceosome and consistent with the position of its distant human homolog FAM192A in the human pre-C* complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Zhan et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Fyv6 makes a multitude of interactions with essential splicing factors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4E, F, G</xref>). One conserved region of Fyv6 is the N-terminus with a FVSE motif (<bold>Supplemental Fig. S8</bold>). This motif forms a ‘hook’ that interacts with a hydrophobic patch on the surface of the Prp22 RecA2 domain, where it also forms hydrogen bonds by β-sheet augmentation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). The hook is followed by three α-helices. The start of helix 2 sits on top of the intron between the BP and the active site docked 3’ SS, where it may act as a steric block to prevent 3’ SS undocking and promote exon ligation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Helix 2 also contains a patch of conserved arginines that form salt bridges with Asp317 and Glu318 of Slu7 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). The linker between helices 2 and 3 interacts with the NTC component Cef1, and helix 3 interacts with NTC component Syf1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). The binding interface with Syf1 overlaps with the Syf1/Yju2 interaction in the C complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Wilkinson et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting these interactions are mutually exclusive (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). Fyv6 thus provides a direct link between the Prp22 ATPase, NTC components, and other essential splicing factors over a distance of ∼100 Å.</p>
<p>By 3D classification, we were able to resolve a total of three states of the P-complex spliceosome (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C-E</xref>). State I, represented by 51% of particles, is the most complete and has all the above-described factors visible, including a stably-docked 3’ SS. State II, represented by 20% of particles, is similar to State I but lacks density for the N-terminal half of the 2<sup>nd</sup> step factor Slu7. The endonuclease-like domain of Prp8, to which this domain of Slu7 binds, is correspondingly shifted. Interestingly, this state retains strong density for the 3’ SS, suggesting the N-terminal regions of Slu7 are not involved in maintaining 3’ SS docking after exon ligation. Finally, State III, containing 29% of particles, entirely lacks density for the 2<sup>nd</sup> step factors Slu7, Prp18, and Fyv6. Prp17 and the RNase H domain of Prp8 are still present but are weaker than in States I and II, suggesting they are more flexible in State III. Most of Prp22 can still be observed with weaker density except for the C-terminal domain that interacts with Prp8, which lacks density entirely. Importantly, State III also lacks density for the 3’ SS but has density for the 3’ exon, suggesting it is indeed post-catalytic and represents a state after loss of 2<sup>nd</sup> step factors and undocking of the 3’ SS from the catalytic core. The coincidence of loss of Fyv6 with loss of Prp18 and Slu7 reinforces the notion that these three factors act together and are important for 3’ SS docking and stabilization of Prp17, Prp22, and the RNase H domain of Prp8.</p>

<title>The Fyv6/Syf1 Interaction is Critical for Suppressing <italic>fyv61</italic> Phenotypes</title>
<p>To determine the functionally critical regions and interactions of Fyv6, we used the cryo-EM structure to design five truncation mutants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). The first three truncations remove amino acids from the N-terminus of Fyv6: deletion of the first 16 amino acids, which are not resolved in the cryo-EM structure (Δ1-16); deletion of the first 23 amino acids, which removes the conserved hook region of Fyv6 that interacts with the Prp22 RecA2 domain (Δ1-23); and deletion of amino acids 1 to 51, which additionally removes the first α-helix and interactions with Prp22, Prp8, and Slu7 (Δ1-51). The remaining two mutants are C-terminal truncations. In the first, amino acids 134 to 173, which do not have clear density in the cryo-EM structure and are not modeled but which do contain a predicted nuclear localization signal (NLS), are deleted (Δ134-173) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Nguyen Ba et al., 2009</xref>). In the second, amino acids 103 to 173 are deleted (Δ103-173), which additionally removes the region of the protein that interacts with Syf1.</p>

<p>We tested each truncation mutant for its ability to suppress the <italic>cs</italic> and <italic>ts</italic> phenotypes of the <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> strain when expressed from a plasmid under the native promoter (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). All of the N-terminal truncation mutations could suppress the <italic>cs</italic> or <italic>ts</italic> phenotypes to some degree. Surprisingly, a strain with the complete deletion of the conserved hook domain that interacts with Prp22 (Δ1-23) grew similarly to the strain expressing WT Fyv6. We wondered if splicing changes could still be present even if the growth phenotype was suppressed; so, we assayed <italic>SUS1</italic> isoforms by RT-PCR. We previously showed that loss of Fyv6 causes use of an alternative 3’ SS in the first intron of this pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lipinski et al., 2023</xref>). In addition to suppression of the <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> growth phenotype, the N-terminal truncation mutants also showed no evidence for changes in <italic>SUS1</italic> splicing (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). The N-terminal region of Fyv6 composed of the hook domain and the first α-helix is not required for suppression of either the temperature sensitivity or splicing phenotypes observed when Fyv6 is lost despite its conservation and interactions with critical splicing factors (Prp8, Prp22, and Slu7).</p>
<p>For the C-terminal truncations, the Δ134-173 truncation was also able to suppress the <italic>cs</italic> and <italic>ts</italic> phenotypes, indicating that the predicted NLS is also not essential (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). However, this mutant grew more poorly at 16°C than did the Δ1-16 and Δ1-23 truncations and showed some evidence of alternative 3’ SS usage in <italic>SUS1</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). The largest effects were seen when the C-terminus was truncated further. The Δ103-173 truncation strain phenocopied the <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> strain and grew poorly at 37°C and was dead at 23° or 16°C (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Additionally, RT-PCR showed increased use of the alternative 3’ SS in <italic>SUS1</italic> with this truncation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). To determine if this phenotype could be due to loss of protein expression, we assayed expression of the epitope-tagged proteins by western blot (<bold>Supplemental Fig. S9A</bold>). In all cases, we could detect protein; however, the abundance of the N-terminally epitope-tagged Δ103-173 variant was much lower than the others. Therefore, we also constructed a C-terminally epitope-tagged version of Δ103-173 (<bold>Supplemental Fig. S9B</bold>). The C-terminally-tagged protein expressed at much higher levels but also failed to suppress the <italic>cs</italic> and <italic>ts</italic> phenotypes. These data suggest that the C-terminal region of Fyv6 that includes a portion of α-helix 3 and the Syf1 interaction domain is critical for function.</p>
<p>To obtain additional evidence for the importance of the Fyv6/Syf1 interaction, we created a <italic>syf1Δ</italic> shuffle strain containing WT Fyv6 and expressed C-terminal Syf1 truncations (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). We hypothesized that loss of the Fyv6-interacting domain on Syf1 would phenocopy <italic>fyv6Δ</italic>. We observed just this effect. Loss of the Fyv6-interacting region in Syf1 Δ778-859 and Δ634-859 mutants resulted in either modest (Δ778-859) or severe (Δ634-859) <italic>cs</italic> and <italic>ts</italic> phenotypes. In addition, these Syf1 truncation mutants also triggered use of the alternative 3’ SS in <italic>SUS1</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). Interestingly, if the Δ778-859 and Δ817-859 Syf1 mutants are expressed in a <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> background, it results in suppression of the <italic>fyv6Δ ts</italic> phenotype (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>; <italic>c.f.</italic> <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). However, the <italic>SUS1</italic> alternative 3’ SS is still used (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>). This indicates that <italic>ts</italic> phenotype suppression and triggering usage of the alternative 3’ SS in <italic>SUS1</italic> are separable processes.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the Syf1/Fyv6 interaction is mutually exclusive with the Syf1/Yju2 interaction that occurs during 5’ SS cleavage and is reformed in the ILS spliceosome. One possible explanation for suppression of the <italic>ts</italic> phenotype in <italic>fyv6Δ</italic>/<italic>syf1</italic>(Δ778-859 or Δ817-859) strains is that Fyv6 and Yju2 are competing with one another and binding of either protein to the wrong spliceosome complex results in growth and splicing defects. When the Yju2/Fyv6 binding site on Syf1 is removed, the observed phenotypes could be due to failure of Yju2 to be properly recruited to the P complex spliceosome for displacement of Fyv6. However, recruitment occurs correctly when Fyv6 is deleted since it no longer needs to be displaced. Similarly, phenotypes due to loss of Fyv6 could arise from retention of Yju2 during exon ligation. A prediction of this model is that failure to properly remove or recruit Yju2 and Fyv6 can result in similar phenotypes. Further work will be needed to understand the binding dynamics of these factors.</p>

<title>Mutations in Many Different Splicing Factors Can Suppress <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> Phenotypes</title>
<p>To gain additional insights into Fyv6 function, we carried out a genetic screen to detect spontaneously arising suppressors that can correct temperature-dependent growth defects (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). This method has previously been used to illuminate many aspects of spliceosome biochemistry and non-silent mutations within splicing factors are likely causative for suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Montemayor et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kuhn and Brow, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brow, 2019</xref>).</p>

<p>We plated saturated <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> yeast cultures onto 20 different YPD plates and incubated them at 37°C until colonies arose. Within several days, colonies of various sizes appeared and were isolated. A subset of picked colonies were then tested for suppression of the <italic>ts</italic> phenotype. All of these colonies were able to suppress growth defects at 37°C, and many also suppressed the <italic>cs</italic> phenotype at 23°C (<bold>Supplemental Fig. S10</bold>). We then performed whole genome sequencing on the largest of the picked colonies as these were expected to be the strongest suppressors. In 19 of 20 sequenced strains, we were able to identify at least one non-silent mutation in a splicing factor (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, <bold>Supplemental Table S5</bold>). When we carried out a similar experiment aimed at identifying <italic>cs</italic> suppressors, we were unable to identify any likely causative mutations in splicing factors. Therefore, we focused our analysis on the <italic>ts</italic> suppressor mutations.</p>
<p>Collectively, the identified mutations tended to fall into two categories: gain of positive charge or substitution with a bulkier side chain. Gain of positive charge mutations were found in Prp8 (G1868R) as well as the second step factors Slu7 (A24R, and N28K), and Prp22 (I1133R). Structurally, amino acids within Prp8 and Prp22 are proximal to RNA within the spliceosome and addition of charged amino acid side chains may stabilize interactions with the phosphodiester RNA backbone. The N-terminus of Slu7 containing A24 and N28 is not resolved in any spliceosome structure to our knowledge and normally contains many negatively charged residues. The majority of identified suppressors involve a mutation to a bulkier side chain including several in Prp8 (S1594F/Y, V1862L), Prp17 (A251V, G386W), Cef1 (A37V), and Clf1 (T33I). The increase in hydrophobic surface area provided by these mutations may help to stabilize interactions with nearby proteins, compensating for structural destabilization due to the absence of Fyv6.</p>
<p>We isolated one suppressor mutation within the U2 snRNA (A25G) near where the C-terminal domain of Prp22 inserts towards the active site and located beneath the Fyv6 binding site. It has previously been observed that mutation of this specific U2 snRNA nucleotide is not deleterious to growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">McPheeters and Abelson, 1992</xref>), and is therefore well-tolerated by yeast. The mechanism of suppression by this mutation is not clear; however, it is interesting to note that we also observed suppressor mutations in the U2 snRNP component Rse1 (<bold>Supplemental Table S5</bold>) which is released from the spliceosome prior to catalysis. The Rse1 mutations always occurred coincident with mutations in other splicing factors. It is possible that suppressors in factors present prior to or after exon ligation are able to suppress (or enhance suppression of) <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> by changing how pre-mRNAs compete for a limited set of splicing factors or by reducing blocks to pre-spliceosome assembly caused by accumulation of stalled complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Mendoza-Ochoa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Munding et al., 2013</xref>). Together these data indicate that mutations in many different splicing factors including second-step factors and the U2 snRNA can be isolated from <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> suppressor strains.</p>

<p>We decided to study several of these mutations in greater detail and to confirm that they were sufficient for <italic>fyv6Δ ts</italic> phenotype suppression. In the case of Cef1, we obtained several mutants located near the interface between Cef1 and the 2<sup>nd</sup> step factor Prp17: A37V, M175I, and Q193P (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). This interface has only been observed in structures of C* and P-complex spliceosomes, suggesting its importance for exon ligation. In addition, it has previously been reported that another mutant of Cef1 A37, A37P, is able to suppress splicing defects due to a BS adenine to guanosine substitution (BS-G) which causes stalling after 5’ SS cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Query and Konarska, 2012</xref>). Therefore, we wondered if other Cef1 mutants capable of suppressing defects due to BS-G could also suppress <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> (Cef1 A37P, V36R, and S48R). We created <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> shuffle strains for Cef1 and tested each mutant’s ability to suppress <italic>cs</italic> and <italic>ts</italic> phenotypes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). All of these Cef1 mutants, both those isolated from our suppressor screen and those identified as BS-G suppressors, could at least weakly suppress the <italic>cs</italic> phenotype at 23°C with our isolated M175I mutant being a particularly strong suppressor. In addition, all of the mutants except Cef1 A37V could suppress the <italic>ts</italic> phenotype at 37°C to varying degrees. These results confirm that single point mutants in Cef1 can suppress <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> growth phenotypes and that at least some BS-G suppressors in Cef1 also suppress <italic>fyv6Δ</italic>. A common mechanism could be that these mutations stabilize the exon ligation conformation of the spliceosome to favor the 2nd step either when a BS-G is present or Fyv6 is absent.</p>
<p>In the case of Prp8, we tested five different suppressor mutations in <italic>prp8</italic> shuffle strains (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E,F</xref>). Identification of mutants in Prp8 that suppress <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> is not surprising since many different alleles of Prp8 are known to modulate the conformational equilibrium between the 1st and 2nd steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fica and Nagai, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Liu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Query and Konarska, 2004</xref>). We previously discovered that one Prp8 2<sup>nd</sup> step allele, P986T, could suppress a <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> growth defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lipinski et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>We identified two suppressors within the Prp8 α-finger domain at position S1584 and another three within the Rnase H-like domain (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref><bold>, Supplemental Table S5</bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Galej et al. 2013</xref>). S1584 is located adjacent to a residue that crosslinks with the BP (aa 1585) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Galej et al., 2013</xref>). Proximity to the BP suggests that mutations at S1584 might destabilize RNA bound within the active site after branching, alleviating the stall caused by <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> after the 1<sup>st</sup> step or facilitating formation of the 2<sup>nd</sup> step conformation.</p>
<p>Suppressors of other splicing defects have been previously identified within the Prp8 RNase H-like domain, two of which are located at the same position as <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> suppressors. V1862A/Y/D and T1982A were identified as suppressors of, respectively, the <italic>U4-cs</italic>1 allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kuhn and Brow, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kuhn et al., 1999</xref>) or the 5’ SS U2A mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Siatecka et al., 1999</xref>). V1862 is located within the RNase H-like domain β-finger (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>), while T1982 is located at the base of the β-finger (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). We identified <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> suppressors at both V1862 (V1862L) and T1982 (T1982S) as well as a third suppressor (G1868R), also located in the β-finger. Several 2<sup>nd</sup> step Prp8 alleles are also located proximal to G1868 (N1869D and V1870N) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Query and Konarska, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Four of the identified Prp8 suppressor mutations could partially suppress either or both of the <italic>cs</italic> and <italic>ts fyv6Δ</italic> phenotypes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>). Prp8 S1574Y, V1862L, G1868R, and T1982S suppressors were able to support growth at 37°C. Prp8 V1862L and T1982S also partially suppressed the growth defects at 16 and 23°C. Even though we isolated the Prp8 S1584F mutant in our screen and this substitution is very similar to S1584Y, we were not able observe suppression due to this mutant in these strains. Mutations within the Prp8 β-finger are able to compensate for loss of Fyv6 and these mutations are located near known Prp8 2nd step alleles. As with Cef1 mutants, it is possible that <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> suppression is originating from stabilization of the 2<sup>nd</sup> step conformation.</p>
<p>Finally, given our observations with the Cef1 and Prp8 mutants, we wondered about the generality of 2<sup>nd</sup> step splicing factor suppression. Several dominant mutants in the 2<sup>nd</sup> step factor Prp18 were previously shown to suppress <italic>ts</italic> phenotypes due to various mutations in Slu7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aronova et al., 2007</xref>). We wondered if these Prp18 mutants would also suppress the <italic>ts</italic> (or <italic>cs</italic>) phenotype due to Fyv6 loss. Indeed, the Prp18 V191A suppressor of <italic>slu7</italic> alleles was able to improve growth at 37°C of <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> yeast (<bold>Supplemental Fig. S11</bold>). Together our results from the suppressor analysis support a model in which a given 2<sup>nd</sup> step suppressor mutation may be able to restore splicing activity lost by a variety of mechanisms.</p>

<title>A Prp22-Dependent Splicing Stall is Relieved by Fyv6 Deletion</title>
<p>The final <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> suppressor mutation that we studied was the Prp22 I1133R mutant. This mutation is located within the C-terminal domain of Prp22 that enters the spliceosome active site and is located proximal to U2 snRNA nucleotide A31 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). Fyv6 bridges over this Prp22-U2 snRNA interaction. The I1133R mutation might stabilize Prp22/U2 snRNA contacts that can compensate for Fyv6 loss and promote exon ligation. The Prp22 I1133R mutant is able to weakly suppress both the <italic>cs</italic> and <italic>ts</italic> phenotypes in <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> yeast (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B, C</xref>). Given its location in the C-terminal domain, we wondered if it or <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> would show synthetic genetic interactions or epistasis with mutations in the helicase domain. We tested two helicase domain mutations, R805A and G810A, both of which are known to impact Prp22-dependent proofreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mayas et al., 2006</xref>). The Prp22 R805A mutant is by itself <italic>cs</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Schwer and Meszaros, 2000</xref>) and showed a synthetic lethal interaction with <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7C</xref>). This was only slightly rescued by simultaneously introducing I1133R into Prp22. In contrast, Prp22 G810A mutant is viable in the presence and absence of Fyv6 as well as in combination with the I1133R suppressor mutation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7C</xref>). Prp22 G810A by itself does not suppress the <italic>ts fyv6Δ</italic> phenotype; however, the Prp22 G810A/I1133R double mutant is a stronger suppressor of the <italic>ts</italic> phenotype than either mutant alone. These additive genetic interactions suggest that the Prp22 <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> suppressor mutation (I1133R) and the helicase domain mutations (R805A and G810A) impact distinct Prp22 functions. These functions could correspond to Prp22’s role in promoting exon ligation during the 2<sup>nd</sup> step (the C-terminal domain mutation) and its role in promoting ATP-dependent mRNA release and proofreading (the helicase domain mutations).</p>

</fig>
<p>Recently, it was reported that the Prp22 G810A mutant could activate usage of some alternative 3’ SS that are also activated by <italic>PRP18</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Roy et al., 2023</xref>). We therefore wondered if any of the Prp22 mutants could activate alternative 3’ SS also activated by <italic>FYV6</italic> deletion. We isolated RNA from these strains and analyzed <italic>SUS1</italic> splicing by RT-PCR (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D, E</xref>). None of the Prp22 mutants activated usage of the <italic>SUS1</italic> alternative 3’ SS or enhanced usage of this site beyond what is observed upon Fyv6 deletion. However, we noticed that the Prp22 helicase mutants, R805A and G810A, both caused an accumulation of unspliced pre-mRNA. This is consistent with these mutations causing a block during pre-mRNA splicing and having a different effect on splicing than Prp22 I1133R. Surprisingly, the block due to the G810A mutation was relieved in the <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> strains and little pre-mRNA accumulation was observed in the absence of Fyv6. This result suggests that Fyv6 could act as a negative regulator of splicing of the <italic>SUS1</italic> transcript when a Prp22 helicase domain mutant is present. Removing Fyv6 restores splicing by activation of the <italic>SUS1</italic> BP proximal 3’ SS.</p>
<p>To further explore the connections between Fyv6 and Prp22 fidelity, we used the ACT1-CUP1 assay in which yeast growth in the presence of increasing concentrations of Cu<sup>2+</sup> is proportional to the extent of splicing of a reporter RNA (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F, G</xref>; <bold>Supplemental Fig. S12, S13</bold>). Since the Prp22 R805A mutant grew poorly, we only assayed the Prp22 G810A, I1133R, and G810A/I1133R (double) mutants in the presence and absence of Fyv6. Consistent with previous results, we found that <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> is deleterious for splicing of the WT ACT1-CUP1 reporter containing consensus splice sites. Copper tolerance was improved when <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> was combined with Prp22 I1133R. Unexpectedly, Prp22 I1133R was actually deleterious when Fyv6 was present for this reporter. If this Prp22 mutant and Fyv6 both promote the 2<sup>nd</sup> step, then their combination may have an additive, negative effect on splicing due to over-stabilization of this spliceosome conformation.</p>
<p>Finally, we assayed strains containing a 3’ SS UAG to gAG reporter since it was previously shown that Prp22 helicase domain mutants could increase usage of nonconsensus 3’ SS due to faulty proofreading activity (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F, G</xref>). In agreement with this, we observed a dramatic increase in copper tolerance when Prp22 contained both the C-terminal domain and helicase mutants (double). This suggests that splicing of nonconsensus 3’ SS splice sites is enhanced both by stabilization of the 2<sup>nd</sup> step conformation (I1133R) and perturbing mRNA release (G810A). This effect on Prp22 is Fyv6-dependent since loss of Fyv6 results in very poor copper tolerance of strains containing the gAG reporter, likely since this 3’ SS is located far from the BP (38 nt). These results show that <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> can be suppressed with a Prp22 C-terminal domain mutant and that mutations in the Prp22 C-terminal domain can have distinct functional consequences from those located in the helicase domain. In the case of <italic>SUS1</italic>, stalling of splicing due to the Prp22 G810A mutant can be relieved by removing Fyv6 and activation of a BP proximal 3’ SS.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we establish Fyv6 as a 2<sup>nd</sup> step splicing factor in yeast that promotes usage of BP-distal 3’ SS. Structural, genetic, and biochemical studies reveal critical contacts and interactions between Fyv6 and the splicing machinery. From these data, we propose that Yju2/Syf1 interactions need to be disrupted for proper Fyv6 recruitment and that Fyv6 can enforce the Prp22-dependence of at least some splicing events. Combined, our data allow us to propose a model for Fyv6’s role during the 2<sup>nd</sup> step (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7H</xref>). In this model, Fyv6 is recruited to the C* complex after Prp16-dependent release of Yju2, which exposes the binding site for Fyv6 on Syf1. Once bound, Fyv6 (possibly in concert with Slu7 and Prp18) facilitates docking of BP distal 3’ SS into the active site. In the absence of Fyv6, the use of BP distal 3’ SS becomes more difficult and BP proximal 3’ SS are favored. Under these conditions, the requirement for Prp22 during exon ligation is reduced and Yju2 may also potentially rebind Syf1. One or both of these factors could contribute to formation of a lower fidelity spliceosome with relaxed sequence constraints for exon ligation.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Structural Insights into the Recruitment and Release of 2<sup>nd</sup> step Factors</title>
<p>A key principle of spliceosome structural biochemistry is the presence of mutually exclusive interactions that coordinate the stepwise and directional progression of splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Townsend et al., 2020</xref>). Our cryo-EM structure of the P complex spliceosome suggests another such interaction is involved in the 1<sup>st</sup> to 2<sup>nd</sup>-step transition during which Fyv6 displaces Yju2. Yju2 and Fyv6 occupy overlapping binding sites on the splicing factor Syf1 and, in fact, unassigned density in spliceosome P complexes due to Fyv6 was previously mis-interpreted as Yju2 due to their structural similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Wilkinson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Wilkinson et al., 2021</xref>). We propose that Prp16-promoted spliceosome remodeling results in release of Yju2 from the spliceosome C complex and permits mutually exclusive binding of Fyv6. Fyv6 remains bound in the P complex but then dissociates to permit re-binding of Yju2 in the ILS complex.</p>
<p>Previously, Chiang and Cheng noted that while the N-terminal half of Yju2 was able to restore 1<sup>st</sup> step activity to Yju2-depleted extracts, it is much more stably associated if a second polypeptide containing the C-terminal, Syf1-interacting half was included (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chiang and Cheng, 2013</xref>). It is possible that competition between Yju2 and Fyv6 for Syf1 binding can explain these results. If only the N-terminal half of Yju2 is present, Fyv6 could associate prematurely with Syf1 and result in destabilization of the 1<sup>st</sup> step conformation in favor of 2<sup>nd</sup> step interactions. This may then result in weaker binding for the N-terminal half of Yju2. Failure to properly recruit and exchange the Yju2/Fyv6 interaction on Syf1 may also be the origin of some of the yeast growth and splicing phenotypes we observe (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>
<p>The need for Yju2/Fyv6 exchange hints at two distinct functions for Fyv6: a role in Yju2 displacement to prevent its re-binding during exon ligation and a role in stabilization of the 2<sup>nd</sup> step spliceosome conformation. These two functions can potentially result in the distinct <italic>cs</italic> and <italic>ts</italic> phenotypes in yeast. While more work is needed to dissect these phenotypes, it is possible that the <italic>cs</italic> phenotype results from increased stability of the Yju2/Syf1 interaction at lower temperatures and the need for Fyv6 to act as a competitor of this interaction. The <italic>ts</italic> phenotype on the other hand may result from destabilization of the 2<sup>nd</sup> step conformation of the spliceosome active site due to loss of Fyv6. It is possible that loss of Fyv6 results in destabilization due to removal of a buttress that holds the RNase H-like domain of Prp8 in place (along with Prp18), changes in how the C-terminal domain of Prp22 interacts with the spliceosome active site, removal of an impediment to reversal of the U2 snRNA/BS duplex conformational change that occurs during the C to C* complex transition, or a combination of these factors.</p>
<p>The high quality of our cryo-EM data combined with 3D classification also provide new insights into the requirements for 3’ SS docking into the active site and potentially for how the P complex spliceosome is disassembled into the ILS complex. It was previously speculated that the N-terminal domain of Slu7 may be critical for 3’ SS docking by reducing the entropic cost of this process when the BP to 3’ SS distance is long (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Wilkinson et al., 2017</xref>). In our state II P complex structure, the 3’ SS remains docked but this domain of Slu7 is not observed. This suggests that either Slu7 N-terminal domain interactions with Cwc22 and Prp8 are not essential for 3’ SS docking into the active site for exon ligation and/or that these interactions are not essential for maintaining 3’ SS docking within P complex once they form in C*.</p>
<p>In the state III P complex structure, densities for the 2<sup>nd</sup> step factors Fyv6, Prp18, and Slu7 are entirely missing and the 3’ SS is no longer docked into the active site. This result suggests that 3’ SS undocking is coupled to 2<sup>nd</sup> step factor release. Prp22 is still present in this structure, and it is possible that state III represents a conformation occurring after exon ligation but prior to Prp22-dependent mRNA release. In this case, the state III structure implies that Prp22 ATPase activity is not needed for dissociation of Fyv6, Prp18, and Slu7. It is also interesting to note that the C-terminal domain of Prp22 can no longer be resolved in the state III structure. What exactly activates the Prp22 ATPase to promote proofreading or mRNA release is not known. It is conceivable that undocking of the 3’ SS from the active site can be sensed by the Prp22 C-terminal domain and this contributes to ATPase activation. This model differs from that previously proposed for Prp22-enabled 3’ SS sampling in which that ATPase activity of Prp22 is needed to undock the 3’ SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Semlow et al., 2016</xref>). However, sampling could involve multiple steps: ATP-independent 3’ SS undocking and ATP-dependent entry into the sampling state. Whether or not the 2<sup>nd</sup> step factors must release or alter conformation to enable sampling is unknown. Regardless of the exact mechanism, it is important to recognize that the P complex structures determined here were all obtained using a Prp22 mutant defective in mRNA release. The chemical and kinetic competencies of these states will require future investigations.</p>

<title>Multiple, Non-Redundant 2<sup>nd</sup> Step Factors Promote Use of BP Distal 3’ SS</title>
<p>The challenge of 3’ SS selection involves not just selection of the correct nucleotide sequence (YAG) but also identifying which YAG sequence to use. Here, we define a function for Fyv6 in facilitating use of BP distal 3’ SS, especially those located <underline>&gt;</underline> 21 nt away from the branch. This function is similar to those of other 2<sup>nd</sup> step factors important for efficient splicing when the BP-3’ SS distance is <underline>&gt;</underline>12 nt (Slu7, Prp18) or <underline>&gt;</underline>21 nt (Prp22) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brys and Schwer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Schwer and Gross, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Zhang and Schwer, 1997</xref>). Human Slu7 has additionally been reported to be important for preventing suppression of the correct 3’ SS in favor of up- or downstream alternative 3’ SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chua and Reed, 1999</xref>). Our previous study using competing 3’ SS in the ACT1-CUP1 intron did not provide evidence for suppression of the correct 3’ SS in the absence of Fyv6, suggesting that this function is not shared between human Slu7 and yeast Fyv6. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that the splicing machinery employs multiple factors that enforce usage of BP distal 3’ SS. These functions are not redundant as changes in 3’ SS are still observed in the absence of Fyv6 but presence of Prp18 and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Roy et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Intron architecture can also contribute to 3’ SS selection since canonical “AG” 3’ SS are depleted in humans in the region between the BP and annotated 3’ SS (the AG exclusion zone, or AGEZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Corvelo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gooding et al., 2006</xref>). AG sites are also typically depleted in the corresponding region in yeast introns (data not shown). This would suggest that annotated 3’ SS are also the most optimal sites located downstream of the BP. However, an important assumption of this model is that non-AG 3’ SS can also be effectively proofread and not used. Deletion of either Prp18 or Fyv6 leads to activation of not just BP proximal 3’ SS but also those with highly divergent sequences from the YAG consensus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Roy et al., 2023</xref>). This suggests that an AGEZ alone is insufficient for correct 3’ SS usage and that mechanisms to ensure preferential use of YAG sites are critical.</p>
<p>It is likely that Fyv6 and Prp18 enforce usage of YAG sites by common as well as factor-specific mechanisms. Both proteins stabilize the conformation of the Prp8 RNase H-like domain in P complex. Numerous splice site suppressor mutations map to this domain including those that enhance splicing of non-YAG 3’ SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Galej et al., 2013</xref>). Fyv6 and Prp18 may be essential for establishing a “high fidelity” conformation of the RNase H-like domain that enforces use of canonical YAG 3’ SS and preventing activation of cryptic sites within the AGEZ. In support of this, we note that in our state III P complex structure that lacks both Fyv6 and Prp18 and a stably docked 3’ SS, the RNase H-like domain is also more flexible.</p>
<p>In addition to this possibility, Fyv6 and Prp18 may also contribute uniquely to 3’ SS fidelity and selection. The conserved loop region of Prp18 inserts into the spliceosome active site and contacts the 3’ SS. Partial deletion of this region of Prp18 phenocopies at least some of the changes in 3’ SS selection when Prp18 is deleted entirely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Crotti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Roy et al., 2023</xref>). This indicates that even when the Prp8 RNaseH-like domain is still stabilized by Prp18 (and Fyv6) disruptions to 3’ SS selection can still occur. Unlike Prp18, Fyv6 does not contact the spliceosome active site. However, it is the only 2<sup>nd</sup> step factor that contacts exon ligation fidelity factor Prp22. While these contacts are not essential for suppressing use of an alternative 3’ in <italic>SUS1</italic>, a mutation in Prp22 can nonetheless suppress a <italic>fyv61</italic> phenotype and loss of Fyv6 relieves a Prp22 helicase mutant-dependent stall in <italic>SUS1</italic> splicing. These observations suggest that Fyv6 and Prp22 are functionally connected to one another.</p>

<title>Some 2<sup>nd</sup> Step Factors May Enforce Usage of Prp22 during Exon Ligation</title>
<p>We were particularly struck by the similarities in the BP-3’ SS distances for the requirement of Prp22 during exon ligation and for promotion of BP distal 3’ SS usage by Fyv6, both <underline>&gt;</underline>21 nt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Schwer and Gross, 1998</xref>). In addition, the alternative, BP proximal 3’ SS that are activated when Fyv6 is deleted show much less sequence conservation relative to the annotated 3’ SS and include sequences (GAG, BG) known to be proofread and rejected by Prp22. Together, this suggests that one function of Fyv6 is to enforce Prp22-dependence of exon ligation by stabilizing a spliceosome conformation that more easily enables usage of BP distal 3’ SS (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7H</xref>). As these sites require Prp22 for exon ligation, it is also likely that they are subject to Prp22-dependent proofreading, and this may enforce accurate exon ligation at the YAG 3’ SS consensus. When Fyv6 is absent, many alternative, BP proximal 3’ SS are activated. These sites could have a relaxed requirement for Prp22 and proofreading. While the Fyv6-dependence of Prp22 occupancy is beyond the scope of the current manuscript, loss of Prp18 (which also activates usage of non-canonical, BP-proximal 3’ SS) does result in lower occupancy of Prp22 on the <italic>ACT1</italic> intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Strittmatter et al., 2021</xref>). This suggests that Prp22 occupancy, and possible involvement in the exon ligation step, can be influenced by 2<sup>nd</sup> step factors.</p>
<p>There is precedent for nonessential splicing factors enforcing use of a proofreading ATPase. Cus2 is not essential for pre-spliceosome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Yan et al., 1998</xref>). However, when Cus2 is present then ATPase activity of Prp5 is essential for disruption of the Hsh155/Cus2 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Perriman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Talkish et al., 2019</xref>). In this case, Cus2 is not essential for Prp5 proofreading of BP selection, and the connection between the ATP hydrolysis activity of Prp5, removal of Cus2, and proofreading is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Liang and Cheng, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Talkish et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Xu and Query, 2007</xref>). It is possible that enforcement of Prp5 ATPase activity by Cus2 is important for other aspects of pre-spliceosome formation <italic>in vivo</italic> and the impact of Prp5 and Cus2 on BP selection has not yet been studied transcriptome-wide using high-resolution, sequencing-based approaches. The C-terminal domain of the 1<sup>st</sup> step splicing factor Yju2 (the same domain that competes with Fyv6 for Syf1 binding) is also not essential for 5’ SS cleavage. In the absence of this domain, the N-terminal domain of Yju2 is sufficient for promoting the 1<sup>st</sup> step reaction, and the spliceosome can transition to the 2<sup>nd</sup> step and carry out exon ligation without Prp16, albeit inefficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chiang and Cheng, 2013</xref>). Importantly, addition of the C-terminal domain on a separate polypeptide reduces Prp16-independent activity. This suggests that the Yju2 C-terminal domain enforces the use of the Prp16 ATPase. As we propose with Fyv6 and Prp22, the C-terminal domain of Yju2 may not just help to promote the 1<sup>st</sup> to 2<sup>nd</sup> step transition by enforcing Prp16-dependence but could also facilitate Prp16-dependent proofreading during 5’ SS cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Koodathingal et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Semlow et al., 2016</xref>). General operating principles of the yeast splicing machinery may not just include proofreading but also use of splicing factors that enforce usage of the proofreading ATPases.</p>

<title>Preparation and purification of P complex for cryo-EM</title>
<p>P complex was purified as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Wilkinson et al., 2017</xref>). Brr2-TAPS yeast were grown in a 120 L fermenter and splicing extract was prepared by the liquid nitrogen method essentially as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lin et al., 1985</xref>). A pre-mRNA substrate consisting of 20 nt 5’-exon, 95 nt intron, and 32 nt 3’-exon from the UBC4 pre-mRNA followed by 3xMS2 stem loops was generated by run-off in vitro transcription from an EcoRI-linearized plasmid template. The RNA product was labelled at the 3’ end with fluorescein-5-thiosemicarbazide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Wu et al., 1996</xref>). A 180 mL in vitro splicing reaction was performed containing 60 mM potassium phosphate pH 7, 2 mM ATP, 2.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 3% w/v PEG8000, 3 nM pre-mRNA, 37.5 nM MS2-MBP protein, and 40% (v/v) splicing extract treated with dominant negative Prp22 S635A. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 23°C, then incubated for 20 min with 5 mM of a DNA oligonucleotide complementary to the 3’-exon (oligo sequence 5’-ATGAAGTAGGTGGAT-3’) to induce cleavage of the 3’-MS2 tag by the endogenous RNase H activity of the splicing extract. The reaction mixture was centrifuged through a 40% glycerol cushion in buffer A (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 75 mM KCl, 0.25 mM EDTA). The cushion was collected and applied to amylose resin in the presence of 0.025% NP-40 substitute. After overnight incubation at 4°C the resin was washed and eluted with buffer A containing 5% glycerol, 0.01% NP-40 substitute and 12 mM maltose. Fractions containing spliceosomes were concentrated to 0.1 mg/mL then dialyzed against buffer A for 3 h.</p>
<p>For cryo-EM grid preparation, a freshly glow-discharged Cu300 R2/2 holey carbon grid with a 2-nm layer of amorphous carbon (Quantifoil) was mounted in the chamber of a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) maintained at 4°C and 100% humidity. Spliceosomes (3 µL) were applied and after 60 s was manually blotted using Ø55 grade 595 filter paper (Ted Pella), followed by application of another 3 μL of spliceosomes, waiting 60 s, before blotting again and plunging into liquid ethane.</p>

<p>Cryo-EM data were collected as two datasets from two grids made from the same sample. Dataset 1 was acquired using a Thermo Scientific Titan Krios cryo-TEM (LMB Krios 1) and dataset 2 was acquired using a Thermo Scientific Titan Krios G3i cryo-TEM (LMB Krios 3). Both used a K3 direct detector (Gatan) operated in super-resolution mode with 2-fold binning, and an energy filter with slit width of 20 eV. Micrographs were collected automatically using EPU in AFIS mode, yielding a total of 51,113 movies at 81,000x or 130,000x magnification with a real nominal pixel size of 0.93 Å or 0.669 Å, with defocus ranging from -1.3 μm to -3.1 μm and a total fluence per micrograph of 40 e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>, fractionated into 40 frames.</p>

<title>Cryo-EM data processing</title>
<p>All cryo-EM data were processed using RELION-5.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kimanius et al., 2023</xref>). Both datasets were initially processed separately. Movies were corrected for motion using the RELION implementation of MotionCor2, with 4×4 patches and dose-weighting. CTF parameters were estimated using CTFFIND-4.1. Particle picking was done using Topaz with the general model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bepler et al., 2019</xref>), yielding 1,820,457 particles. 3D classification was performed on 4-fold (dataset 1) or 5-fold (dataset 2) binned particles using a P-complex reference map (EMD-10140), and 299,741 (dataset 1) or 599,123 (dataset 2) were selected and refined to 2.99 Å or 2.78 Å resolution respectively. After Bayesian Polishing and CTF refinement (per-particle defocus, anisotropic magnification, beam tilt, trefoil, and 4<sup>th</sup> order aberrations) the resolution improved to 2.67 Å or 2.32 Å respectively. To improve the general density quality, 3D classification without alignment was performed with a soft mask around the whole complex with T=15. Particles with good density, without selecting for Fyv6 occupancy, were selected (151,443 and 257,501 for datasets 1 and 2) and refined to 2.66 Å or 2.27 Å respectively. The particles were then merged, refined, and then refined for anisotropic magnification. The overall scaling factors from the “anisotropic” magnification matrix was then used to calculate the corrected pixel size for dataset 1 as 0.94057 Å, keeping dataset 2 constant at 0.669 Å per pixel. Defocus values for dataset 1 were then scaled by the square of 0.94057 / 0.93, with an empirical constant correction of -10.06 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Wilkinson et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, another round of per-particle defocus refinement and anisotropic magnification refinement was performed to reduce errors in defocus correction and dataset scaling. The combined particles refined to 2.24 Å resolution. Resolution is reported using the gold-standard Fourier Shell Correlation with 0.143 cutoff.</p>
<p>The refined particles after merging were subjected to 3D classification without alignment, with a soft mask around the entire spliceosome, with T=15. The resulting four classes were used to define States I, II and III. To improve the densities for the periphery of the spliceosome that displayed local flexibility, focused refinements were used with Blush regularization in RELION-5 to reduce overfitting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kimanius et al., 2023</xref>). The Prp22 density was improved using a soft-mask just around the Prp22 helicase domain for refinement of particles from States I and II, yielding a 2.96 Å map. Densities for the U2 snRNP, NTC, U5 Sm ring, and Cwc22 N-terminal domain were each improved first by 3D classification without alignment of particles from all three states, selecting particles with strong density (72,869 for the U2 snRNP, 260,409 for the NTC, 113,561 for the U5 Sm ring, 201,984 for Cwc22-NTD), performing signal subtraction to remove density for the rest of the spliceosome (recentering on the mask center of mass and re-boxing to 300 pixels, or 192 pixels for Cwc22-NTD), and finally 3D refinement starting with 1.8 degree local angular searches, giving 3.42 Å for the U2 snRNP, 3.72 Å for the NTC, 3.06 Å for the U5 Sm, and 3.57 Å for Cwc22-NTD. In all cases, control refinements without Blush regularization did not produce interpretable maps (<bold>Supplemental Fig. S6).</bold></p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study addresses how 3' splice site choice is modulated by the conserved spliceosome-associated protein Fyv6. The authors provide <bold>compelling</bold> evidence Fyv6 functions to enable selection of 3' splice sites distal to a branch point and in doing so antagonizes more proximal, suboptimal 3' splice sites. The study would be improved through a more nuanced discussion of alternative possibilities and models, for instance in discussing the phenotypic impact of Fyv6 deletion.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>A key challenge at the second chemical step of splicing is the identification of the 3' splice site of an intron. This requires recruitment of factors dedicated to the second chemical step of splicing and exclusion of factors dedicated to the first chemical step of splicing. Through the highest resolution cyroEM structure of the spliceosome to-date, the authors show the binding site for Fyv6, a factor dedicated to the second chemical step of splicing, is mutually exclusive with the binding site for a distinct factor dedicated to the first chemical step of splicing, highlighting that splicing factors bind to the spliceosome at a specific stage not only by recognizing features specific to that stage but also by competing with factors that bind at other stages. The authors further reveal that Fyv6 functions at the second chemical step to promote selection of 3' splice sites distal to a branch point and thereby discriminate against proximal, suboptimal 3' splice site. Lastly, the authors show by cyroEM that Fyv6 physically interacts with the RNA helicase Prp22 and by genetics Fyv6 functionally interacts with this factor, implicating Fyv6 in 3'SS proofreading and mRNA release from the spliceosome. The evidence for this study is robust, with the inclusion of genomics, reporter assays, genetics, and cyroEM. Further, the data overall justify the conclusions, which will be of broad interest.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The resolution of the cryoEM structure of Fyv6-bound spliceosomes at the second chemical step of splicing is exceptional (2.3 Angstroms at the catalytic core; 3.0-3.7 Angstroms at the periphery), providing the best view of this spliceosomal intermediate in particular and the core of the spliceosome in general.</p>
<p>
(2) The authors observe by cryoEM three distinct states of this spliceosome, each distinguished from the next by progressive loss of protein factors and/or RNA residues. The authors appropriately refrain from overinterpreting these states as reflecting distinct states in the splicing cycle, as too many cyroEM studies are prone to do, and instead interpret these observations to suggest interdependencies of binding. For example, when Fyv6, Slu7, and Prp18 are not observed, neither are the first and second residues of the intron, which otherwise interact, suggesting an interdependence between 3' splice site docking on the 5' splice site and binding of these second step factors to the spliceosome.</p>
<p>
(3) Conclusions are supported from multiple angles.</p>
<p>
(4) The interaction between Fyv6 and Syf1, revealed by the cyroEM structure, was shown to account for the temperature-sensitive phenotypes of a fyv6 deletion, through a truncation analysis.</p>
<p>
(5) Splicing changes were observed in vivo both by indirect copper reporter assays and directly by RT-PCR.</p>
<p>
(6) Changes observed by RNA-seq are validated by RT-PCR.</p>
<p>
(7) The authors go beyond simply observing a general shift to proximal 3'SS usage in the fyv6 deletion by RNA-seq by experimentally varying branch point to 3' splice site distance experimentally in a reporter and demonstrating in a controlled system that Fyv6 promotes distal 3' splice sites.</p>
<p>
(8) The importance of the Fyv6-Syf1 interaction for 3'SS recognition is demonstrated by truncations of both Fyv6 and of Syf1.</p>
<p>
(9) In general, the study was executed thoroughly and presented clearly.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Despite the authors restraint in interpreting the three states of the spliceosome observed by cyroEM as sequential intermediates along the splicing pathway, it would be helpful to the general reader to explicitly acknowledge the alternative possibility that the difference states simply reflect decomposition from one intermediate during isolation of the complex (i.e., the loss of protein is an in vitro artifact, if an informative one).</p>
<p>
(2) The authors acknowledge that for prp8 suppressors of the fyv6 deletion, suppression may be indirect, as originally proposed by the Query and Konarska labs - that is, that defects in the second step conformation of the spliceosome can be indirectly suppressed by compensating, destabilizing mutations in the first step spliceosome. Whereas some of the other suppressors of the fyv6 deletion can be interpreted as impacting directly the second step spliceosome (e.g., because the gene product is only present in the second step conformation), it seems that many more suppressors beyond prp8 mutants, especially those corresponding to bulky substitutions, which would more likely destabilize than stabilize, could similarly act indirectly by destabilization of first step conformation. The authors should acknowledge this where appropriate (e.g., for factors like Prp8 that are present in both first and second step conformations).</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Senn, Lipinski, and colleagues report on the structure and function of the conserved spliceosomal protein Fyv6. Pre-mRNA splicing is a critical gene expression step that occurs in two steps, branching and exon ligation. Fyv6 had been recently identified by the Hoskins' lab as a factor that aids exon ligation (Lipinski et al., 2023), yet the mechanistic basis for Fyv6 function was less clear. Here, the authors combine yeast genetics, transcriptomics, biochemical assays, and structural biology to reveal the function of Fyv6. Specifically, they describe that Fyv6 promotes the usage of distal 3'SSs by stabilizing a network of interactions that include the RNA helicase PRP22 and the spliceosome subunit SYF1. They discuss a generalizible mechanism for splice site proofreading by spliceosomsal RNA helicases that could be modulated by other, regulatory splicing factors.</p>
<p>This is a very high quality study, which expertly combines various approaches to provide new insights into the regulation of 3'SS choice, docking, and undocking. The cryo-EM data is also of excellent quality, which substantially extends on previous yeast P complex structures. This is also supported by the authors use of the latest data analysis tools (Relion-5, AlphaFold2 multimer predictions, Modelangelo). The authors re-evaluate published EM densities of yeast spliceosome complexes (B*, C,C*,P) for the presence or absence of Fyv6, substantiate Fyv6 as a 2nd step specific factor, confirm it as the homolog of the human protein FAM192A, and provide a model for how Fyv6 may fit into the splicing pathway. The biochemical experiments on probing the splicing effects of BP to 3'SS distances after Fyv6 KO, genetic experiments to probe Fyv6 and Syf1 domains, and the suppressor screening add substantially to the study and are well executed. The manuscript is clearly written and we particularly appreciated the nuanced discussions, for example for an alternative model by which Prp22 influences 3'SS undocking. The research findings will be of great interest to the pre-mRNA splicing community.</p>
<p>We have only few comments to improve an already strong manuscript.</p>
<p>Comments:</p>
<p>(1) Can the authors comment on how they justify K+ ion positions in their models (e.g. the K+ ion bridging G-1 and G+1 nucleotides)? How do they discriminate e.g. in the 'G-1 and G+1' case K+ from water?</p>
<p>
(2) The authors comment on Yju2 and Fyv6 assignments in all yeast structures except for the ILS. Can the authors comment on if they have also looked into the assignment of Yju2 in the yeast ILS structure in the same manner? While it is possible that Fyv6 could dissociate and Yju2 reassociate at the P to ILS transition, this would merit a closer look given that in the yeast P complex Yju2 had been misassigned previously.</p>
<p>
(3) For accessibility to a general reader, figures 1c, d, e, 2a, b, would benefit from additional headings or labels, to immediately convey what is being displayed. It is also not clear to us if Fig 1e might fit better in the supplement and be instead replaced by Supplementary Figure 1a (wt) , b (delta upf1), and a new c (delta fyv6) and new d (delta upf1, delta fyv6). This may allow the reader to better follow the rationale of the authors' use of the Fyv6/Upf1 double deletion.</p>
<p>
(4) The authors carefully interpret the various suppressor mutants, yet to a general reader the authors may wish to focus this section on only the most critical mutants for a better flow of the text.</p>

<p>In this manuscript the authors expand their initial identification of Fyv6 as a protein involved in the second step of pre-mRNA splicing to investigate the transcriptome-wide impact of Fyv6 on splicing and gain a deeper understanding of the mechanism of Fyv6 action.</p>
<p>They first use deep sequencing of transcripts in cells depleted of Fyv6 together with Upf1 (to limit loss of mis-spliced transcripts) to identify broad changes in the transcriptome due to loss of Fyv6. This includes both changes in overall gene expression, that are not deeply discussed, as well as alterations in choice of 3' splice sites - which is the focus of the rest of the manuscript</p>
<p>They next provide the highest resolution structure of the post-catalytic spliceosome to date; providing unparalleled insight into details of the active site and peripheral components that haven't been well characterized previously.</p>
<p>Using this structure they identify functionally critical interactions of Fyv6 with Syf1 but not Prp22, Prp8 and Slu7. Finally, a suppressor screen additionally provides extensive new information regarding functional interactions between these second step factors.</p>
<p>Overall this manuscript reports new and essential information regarding molecular interactions within the spliceosome that determine the use of the 3' splice site. It would be helpful, especially to the non-expert, to summarize these in a table, figure or schematic in the discussion.</p>

<p>We thank the editors and reviewers for their enthusiasm for this work and helpful suggestions. In summary, the reviewers provided suggestions for additional discussion items and clarifications for the text and figures, especially in relation to the cryo-EM structures and suppressor screen sections of the manuscript. We will consider each of these and make edits as needed. In particular, reviewers asked for further details about the structural model in addition to analysis of our new structure with respect to previously reported intron lariat spliceosome (ILS) complexes. For the latter point, we present additional evidence for the correct assignment of Yju2 in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> ILS structure and note that docking of the 3’ splice site is not observed in any ILS structure from yeast, worms, or humans. This is consistent with our proposed mechanism. We will clarify these points in the text as well highlight some caveats of prior studies of the ILS complex. We feel that these changes will add additional nuance to the manuscript as well as clarify the findings and their context and significance for the reader.</p>
