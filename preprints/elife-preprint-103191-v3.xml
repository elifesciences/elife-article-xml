<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Decision-making is a ubiquitous component of animal behavior that is often studied in the context of foraging. Foragers make a series of decisions while locating food (food search), choosing between food types (diet or patch choice), and allocating time spent within patches of food (patch-leaving). Here, we introduce a framework for investigating foraging decisions using detailed analysis of individual behavior and quantitative modeling in the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. We demonstrate that <italic>C. elegans</italic> make <italic>accept-reject</italic> patch choice decisions upon encounter with food. Specifically, we show that when foraging amongst small, dispersed, and dilute patches of bacteria, <italic>C. elegans</italic> initially <italic>reject</italic> several bacterial patches, opting to prioritize exploration of the environment, before switching to a more exploitatory foraging strategy during subsequent encounters. Observed across a range of bacterial patch densities, sizes, and distributions, we use a quantitative model to show that this decision to <italic>explore</italic> or <italic>exploit</italic> is guided by available sensory information, internal satiety signals, and learned environmental statistics related to the bacterial density of recently encountered and <italic>exploited</italic> patches. We behaviorally validated model predictions on animals that had been food-deprived, animals foraging in environments with multiple patch densities, and null mutants with defective sensory modalities. Broadly, we present a framework to study ecologically relevant foraging decisions that could guide future investigations into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying decision-making.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Decision-making is frequently defined as the selection of a course of action among several alternatives. The ubiquity and importance of decision-making has led to its use in describing a broad range of behaviors from taxes of unicellular organisms to economics and politics in human society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. In decision neuroscience, laboratory experiments have investigated the behavioral choices of animals in well-controlled environments or tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. While these experiments have led to key insights into mechanisms underlying decision-making and related cognitive processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>], a comprehensive understanding of decision-making remains elusive. Many researchers have advocated for a more neuroethological approach – suggesting that experiments designed to understand problems the brain evolved to solve offer a more rigorous framework for investigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Thus, one approach to enrich our understanding of decision-making is to look at the decisions made by animals foraging in naturalistic environments.</p>
<p>Foraging animals make a hierarchy of decisions to locate food (food search), choose between different food types (diet or patch choice), and allocate time spent within patches of food items (patch-leaving) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. These foraging decisions often require that an animal <italic>exploit</italic> an environment for known resources or <italic>explore</italic> it for potentially better opportunities elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. This exploration-exploitation trade-off requires cognitive computations such as learning the spatiotemporal distribution of food, route planning, estimation of food availability, and decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. According to optimal foraging theory, foragers may seek to maximize their rate of net energy gained over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>] by using internal and external information to guide decision-making, especially in environments where resources are sparsely distributed or fluctuating. Although many studies have provided insight into the motivations, behavioral implementations, and genes associated with foraging decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], a more rigorous framework for exploring the neuronal mechanisms underlying foraging decisions is essential to establish a comprehensive understanding of decision-making.</p>
<p>The microscopic nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> is well suited for investigating the cellular and molecular basis of foraging decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. A myriad of genetic tools, behavioral assays, and neuronal imaging techniques have been developed to take advantage of the species’ quick reproductive cycle, isogeneity, optical transparency, and ease of maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. While <italic>C. elegans</italic> typically feed upon a diversity of bacterial types in the wild [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>], they are commonly maintained in the laboratory on agar plates containing large patches of the bacteria <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> as a food source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. However, even in these simplified laboratory conditions and despite having a numerically simple nervous system of only 302 neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], <italic>C. elegans</italic> display complex and robust species-typical behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] involving learning and memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>], and decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Recent studies have demonstrated that ecologically focused environmental enrichment permits identification of novel behaviors and gene functions in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and other animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>].</p>
<p>Foraging animals often must make one of two types of decisions: <italic>stay-switch</italic> or <italic>accept-reject. Stay-switch</italic> decisions refer to scenarios where an individual experiences diminishing returns with the current action and must decide when to switch to a new action (e.g., patch-leaving and area-restricted search) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. In contrast, <italic>accept-reject</italic> decisions refer to situations where an individual must decide between engaging with an option or ignoring it in search of a better one (e.g., diet or patch choice) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. <italic>Stay-switch</italic> decisions have been well described in <italic>C. elegans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>] and enable them to successfully explore an environment and exploit the bacteria within [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, <italic>accept-reject</italic> decisions have not yet been demonstrated in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. While <italic>C. elegans</italic> have been shown to alter food preferences in a diet choice assay, this behavior has only been described by a set of <italic>stay-switch</italic> decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. The ability to make <italic>accept-reject</italic> decisions is likely advantageous for foraging in fluctuating or variable environments as rejecting an encountered food item of low quality creates the opportunity for a subsequent encounter with preferred food. Thus, while <italic>C. elegans</italic> can successfully forage in patchily distributed environments, it is not known whether <italic>C. elegans</italic> make decisions to <italic>exploit</italic> a patch of food upon encounter and how this decision-making process changes over a series of patch encounters.</p>
<p>In this study, we aimed to identify if <italic>C. elegans</italic> make <italic>accept-reject</italic> decisions upon encounter with bacterial patches. To answer this question, we performed a detailed analysis of the behavior of individual animals foraging in an ecologically inspired environment where bacterial patches were dilute and dispersed. In conditions where the bacterial density was much lower than that of previously visited patches, animals first explored the environment before <italic>accepting</italic> patches for exploitation. This explore-then-exploit strategy persists even when only one bacterial patch is present in the environment. Using a theoretical framework, we found that this initial exploration reflects a series of <italic>accept-reject</italic> decisions guided by signals related to the bacterial density of current and recently <italic>explored</italic> and <italic>exploited</italic> patches as well as the animal’s state of satiety.</p>

<title><italic>C. elegans</italic> forage in patchy environments with an explore-then-exploit strategy</title>
<p>To investigate whether <italic>C. elegans</italic> make <italic>accept-reject</italic> decisions upon encounter with bacterial patches, we observed the behavior of animals foraging on an agar surface containing an isometric grid of small, low density bacterial patches (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, Video 1-2). Animals were confined to an arena where their behavior was recorded and tracked for 60 minutes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref rid="fig1_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – supplement 1</xref>, Video 3). During this time, animals were observed to move about the arena (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-C</xref>, <xref rid="fig1_S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – supplement 2</xref>, Video 4) with each animal encountering, on average, ∼8.4 total patches and ∼5.3 unique patches during the one-hour recording (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). These patch encounters ranged in duration from seconds to tens of minutes and could be classified as either short or long (2+ minutes) using a Gaussian mixture model (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref rid="fig1_S3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – supplement 3</xref>). Notably, animals were significantly more likely to stay on patch for longer durations at later time points (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>) which corresponded to an overall increase in their probability of residing on patch (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref rid="fig1_S4" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – supplement 4</xref>). Specifically, we found that while animals initially resided on bacterial patches at levels close to those predicted by chance, an animal’s probability of residing on a bacterial patch increased significantly after ∼10 minutes. These findings, that patch duration and residence increased over time, suggest that animals are more likely to exploit an encountered patch as time goes on.</p>

<caption><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> forage in a patchy environment with an explore-then-exploit strategy.</title>
<p>(A) An example animal’s midbody location (colored to represent time in the experiment) as it forages in an environment bounded by a large (30 mm diameter) arena containing 19 small (∼1.8 mm diameter) bacterial patches (gray). Each patch was made by pipetting ∼0.5 µL of OP50 <italic>E. coli</italic> diluted to OD600 ∼10 and grown at room temperature for ∼1 hour. (B) Distance between the example animal’s midbody position and the nearest patch edge (positive indicates inside patch) is plotted (black) for every time point. Putative encounters with a bacterial patch are indicated (gray). (C) Patch encounters (colored to represent the duration of the encounter) for 50 individuals foraging in these environments are plotted. (D) The number of total and unique patch encounters for each animal are shown. (E) Duration for each patch encounter was computed and classified as either short (0-2 minutes) or long (2-60 minutes) using a Gaussian mixture model. The distributions of all observed short and long encounters are plotted with duration binned logarithmically. (F) The observed start time of each patch encounter is shown for all short and long duration encounters. Long duration encounters occur significantly later (one-tailed Mann-Whitney U-Test). (G) The probability of residing on patch was computed for all worms across time (black) and compared to the probability of residing on patch if patch locations were semi-randomly permuted (pink). Smoothed median values are plotted with bootstrap-derived 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles shown in shaded regions. Time points where observed probabilities of residing on patch significantly exceed permuted probabilities are indicated by a black line (one-tailed Fisher’s exact test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction). (H) The track of the example animal in (A) is replotted with color used to represent the animal’s instantaneous velocity at each time point. (I) Velocity of the example animal over time is plotted (black) alongside patch encounters (gray) as previously identified in (B). Example encounters – one early, short duration (green) and one late, long duration (blue) – are indicated. (J,K) A 60-second time window surrounding the start of these example encounters is enlarged. (L) Velocity trajectories were aligned to patch entry for every encounter. Mean encounter-aligned (black/gray) and randomly-aligned (pink) trajectories are plotted for each animal (light) and across all animals (dark). (M) Deceleration upon encounter with the patch edge is plotted for every encounter and grouped by duration type. Deceleration was significantly lower for encounter-aligned as compared to randomly-aligned trajectories (pink) for all duration types (one-tailed Mann-Whitney U-Tests with Bonferroni Correction). (N) Mean velocity as a function of the distance from the edge of bacterial patches (computed for 50 μm bins) is shown for every animal (gray) and across all animals (black). (O) Each animal’s mean velocity during time spent on and off (midpoint at least - 0.46 mm from patch edge) patch is shown. Velocity on patch was significantly slower than off patch (one-tailed paired-sample <italic>t</italic>-test). Sample data for one animal (worm #1) are shown in (A-C,H-K). Summary data for all animals (N = 50 worms) and encounters (N = 419 total encounters) are shown in (D-G,L-O). Violin plots in (D,F,M,O) give the KDE and quartiles for each measure. Asterisks denote statistical significance (***p&lt;0.001).

<p>Given that the bacterial density of the experimental patches was approximately 20 times more dilute than that of conditions animals experienced during development and immediately preceding the assay, it was possible that the initial delay in exploitation could be due to animals’ inability to detect the presence of bacteria in these more dilute patches. We therefore set out to determine if animals detected patches at all time points. Previous studies have shown that <italic>C. elegans</italic> display an immediate and marked slowdown upon encounter with the edge of a food patch and sustain these slower speeds on food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. Therefore, velocity can be used as a proxy for an animal’s ability to sense a bacterial patch. Following this precedent, we quantified the instantaneous velocity of individuals in our assay (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). We observed significant deceleration of an animal’s instantaneous velocity upon encounter with the patch edge (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>), with no obvious difference between short duration, early time point (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>) and long duration, late time point (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1K</xref>) encounters. Animals consistently displayed marked slowdown when approaching the patch edge (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1L</xref>), achieving an average deceleration of -19.5 μm/s<sup>2</sup> upon encounter with the bacterial patch (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1M</xref>, <xref rid="fig1_S5" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – supplement 5</xref>). This slowdown was statistically significant for both long and short duration encounters (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1M</xref>). Further, consistent with <italic>C. elegans</italic> behavior on larger and more densely seeded patches in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>], animals in our assay maintained significantly lower average velocities on patch (∼52 μm/s) compared to off patch (∼198 μm/s) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1N,O</xref>). These results suggest that, despite detecting the availability of food during early patch encounters, <italic>C. elegans</italic> opt to initially prioritize exploration of the environment before switching to a more exploitatory foraging strategy during subsequent patch encounters.</p>

<title>The timing of the switch from exploration to exploitation varies with bacterial density</title>
<p>To determine whether this explore-then-exploit foraging strategy is dependent upon food-related characteristics of the environment, we varied the density of the bacterial patches. By diluting bacterial stocks and controlling growth time, we created 12 bacterial density conditions with relative density ranging from 0 to ∼200 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref rid="fig2_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – supplement 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2_S3">3</xref>). At the low end of this range (densities less than ∼0.5), animals do not appear to detect bacterial patches as indicated by on-patch velocities matching those of animals foraging on bacteria-free (density 0) patches (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B,C</xref>). At the high end of the range (density ∼200), bacterial density is comparable to the environments animals experienced during development and immediately prior to the assay (<xref rid="fig2_S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – supplement 2</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2_S3">3</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) The relative density (as estimated by fluorescently-labeled OP50-GFP) is shown for small (∼1.8 mm diameter) bacterial patches made by pipetting ∼0.5 µL droplets of OP50 <italic>E. coli</italic> diluted in LB to a range of optical densities (OD<sub>600</sub> = {0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10} and controlling growth time at room temperature (hours = {1, 12, 48}). For (A-G,L-O), gray-scale color saturation is proportional to the relative density of each condition and corresponds to labels in (A). (B) The mean velocities of animals foraging in environments containing patches matching one of the 12 bacterial densities are plotted as a function of the distance from the edge of bacterial patches (computed for 50 μm bins). (C) Animals’ average on-patch velocity is plotted as a function of the relative density of bacteria. Compared to animals foraging amongst bacteria-free patches containing only LB (relative density 0), animals foraging on bacterial patches with relative density of 0.5 or greater display significantly slower on-patch velocities (one-tailed Mann-Whitney U-Tests with Bonferroni Correction). (D) The midbody location (colored to represent time in the experiment) of example animals foraging in environments containing patches (gray) of relative density 0, 1, 5, 10, and 200 are shown. (E) The total time each animal spent on patch is plotted as a function of the relative density of bacteria. Time on patch increased monotonically with increasing bacterial density (Kendall’s τ correlation, p&lt;0.001) following a sigmoidal trend. (F) Smoothed median values of the probability of worms residing on patch over time for each density condition are plotted. Time points where observed probabilities of residing on patch either match (pink) or significantly exceed (gray) the probability of residing on patch if patch locations were semi-randomly permuted are indicated (one-tailed Fisher’s exact test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction). (G) A KDE of the distribution of encounter durations is plotted for each density condition. (H) For each encounter, the average velocity of the animal during the encounter and the duration of that encounter are plotted on a double-logarithmic plot with color representing the probabilities of clustering classification as <italic>search</italic> (orange), <italic>sample</italic> (green), or <italic>exploit</italic> (blue). Contours showing the first, second, and third standard deviation of the GMM used to classify <italic>explore</italic> and <italic>exploit</italic> encounters are shown as shaded ellipses with saturation corresponding to standard deviation. KDEs for distributions of average on-patch velocity and encounter duration are plotted for each encounter type. (I) For each encounter, the minimum on-patch velocity and maximum change in velocity are plotted. Contours showing the separation of <italic>sensing</italic> and <italic>non-responding</italic> encounters as estimated by semi-supervised QDA are indicated. A KDE for the distribution of the maximum change in velocity is plotted for each encounter type. (J) Features used to classify encounters as <italic>search, sample</italic>, or <italic>exploit</italic> are summarized. (K) KDEs of the distributions of animals’ velocities are shown for all timepoints during search off and on patch as well as during sample and exploit encounters. (L) Ethograms of patch encounters (colored to represent the probability of classification as <italic>search, sample</italic>, and <italic>exploit</italic>) are shown for 443 individuals. (M) The average proportion of each encounter type over time is plotted. (N) Time elapsed and (O) number of encounters occurring prior to the first <italic>exploitation</italic> event are plotted for every animal (blue). In the event that no <italic>exploitation</italic> event occurred, the maximum observed time and encounters are plotted (red-orange). Both time and encounter number before <italic>exploitation</italic> decrease monotonically with increasing patch density (Kendall’s τ correlation, p&lt;0.001) following a sigmoidal trend. Summary data for all animals (N = 443 total worms; N = 20-50 worms per condition) and encounters (N = 6,560 total encounters; N = 46-876 encounters per condition) are shown in (A-C,E-I,K-O).

<p>Previous studies have shown that in diet choice assays where animals are given the option between patches of varying quality or density, animals spend more time on preferred patches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. We hypothesized that even when all patches in the environment are of equal density, an efficient forager should still modulate the amount of time spent on the bacterial patches in a density-dependent manner. To test this, behavior was recorded and tracked for one hour as animals foraged in patchy environments matching one of the bacterial density conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref rid="fig2_S4" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – supplement 4</xref>). Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that the total time animals spent on bacterial patches increased monotonically with increasing bacterial density following a sigmoidal trend (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Further, the probability of an animal residing on patch as a function of time was highly dependent on the bacterial density (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref rid="fig2_S5" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – supplement 5</xref>). At the highest densities (50 and 200), animals spent nearly 100% of time in the assay on bacterial patches, while at the lowest densities (0 to 0.3), animals spent chance levels of time on patch for the duration of the experiment. At intermediate densities (0.5 to 10) animals initially resided on patches at rates predicted by chance, later transitioning to more time spent on patch. Notably, this delayed increase in patch residence is density dependent with animals switching earlier in environments with patches of greater density.</p>
<p>Consistent with our previous observation that animals reside on patches for either short or long durations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>), we observed two distinct patch encounter types: 1) short (less than 2 minute) patch visits and 2) long (often tens of minutes) patch visits (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). We validated the existence of two patch types using Silverman’s test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>] for bi-modality (<xref rid="fig2_S6" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – supplement 6</xref>) and then, using a two-component Gaussian mixture model (GMM), classified all encounters based on the duration of these patch visits and animals’ average velocity during the encounter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>, <xref rid="fig2_S6" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – supplement 6</xref>). We identified two behaviorally distinct clusters: 1) short duration and fast velocity (<italic>explore</italic>), and 2) long duration and slow velocity (<italic>exploit</italic>) encounters. The <italic>explore</italic> encounters suggest that an animal has <italic>rejected</italic> a patch, opting to continue exploration of the environment. In contrast, the <italic>exploit</italic> encounters suggest that an animal has <italic>accepted</italic> a patch and is consuming the bacteria within.</p>
<p>While we previously found that animals consistently slowed down upon encounter with the patch edge when foraging in relative density ∼10 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J-M</xref>), we observed that a large portion of short duration, exploratory encounters were not accompanied by this slow down (<xref rid="fig2_S7" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – supplement 7A-B</xref>), especially for the lowest bacterial densities tested. Therefore, to determine which exploratory encounters displayed evidence that the patch was detected by the animal, we further classified encounters by an animal’s minimum velocity on patch, deceleration upon patch entry, and maximum change in the animal’s velocity upon encounter (i.e., the difference between the peak velocity immediately before the patch encounter and the minimum velocity achieved during the patch encounter) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>, <xref rid="fig2_S7" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – supplement 7</xref>). We again observed two behaviorally distinct clusters: 1) large slow-down and slow on-patch velocity, and 2) small slow-down and fast on-patch velocity. We validated the existence of these two clusters using Silverman’s test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>] for bi-modality (<xref rid="fig2_S7" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – supplement 7</xref>) and then classified these encounters as <italic>sensing</italic> or <italic>non-responding</italic>, respectively, using a semi-supervised quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) approach (<xref rid="fig2_S8" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – supplement 8</xref>, Video 5). The presence of a slowdown and the subsequent continuation of slower on-patch velocity suggest that an animal sensed the bacteria, while the absence of a slowdown response suggests that the animal either did not perceive the encounter or chose to ignore it. For simplicity, we define: 1) <italic>non-responding</italic> encounters as <italic>searching</italic> (i.e., on-patch behavior that matches off-patch behavior where an animal appears to be searching for food); 2) <italic>sensing</italic>, short duration encounters as <italic>sampling</italic> (i.e., evaluating a patch’s suitability as a food source, but ultimately <italic>rejecting</italic> the patch and continuing to explore the environment); and 3) <italic>sensing</italic>, long duration encounters as <italic>exploiting</italic> (i.e., <italic>accepting</italic> a patch and consuming its bacteria) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>). Consistent with our interpretation of <italic>searching</italic> encounters, the average velocities that animals achieved during <italic>search</italic> on (∼200 μm/s) and off (∼207 μm/s) patch were similar, especially when compared to markedly slower on-patch velocities during <italic>sample</italic> (∼114 μm/s) and <italic>exploit</italic> (∼57 μm/s) encounters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref>). In summary, we have identified three distinct patch encounter types: encounters lacking a slowdown that were either not detected or ignored (<italic>search</italic>) and encounters that were detected with the animal subsequently deciding to <italic>reject</italic> (<italic>sample</italic>) or <italic>accept</italic> (<italic>exploit</italic>) the patch.</p>
<p>We next characterized how the frequency of encounter types varied as a function of time and patch density. The behavior of 443 animals (20-50 worms per condition) was tracked and classified at each time point (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2L</xref>, Video 6). In low density conditions (0 to 0.3), animals spent nearly all of their time <italic>searching</italic> on or off patch. With increasing bacterial patch density, animals spent less time <italic>searching</italic> and more time <italic>sampling</italic> and <italic>exploiting</italic>. Animals foraging in medium density patches (0.5 to 10) initially spent most of their time <italic>sampling</italic> patches upon encounter. However, animals eventually switched to mostly <italic>exploiting</italic> patches. Animals foraging on high density patches (50 and 200) almost exclusively <italic>exploited</italic>. Classification of on-patch behavior across all densities tested revealed a consistent switch from <italic>exploratory</italic> behaviors (<italic>searching</italic> and <italic>sampling</italic>) to <italic>exploitation</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2M</xref>) with the timing of the switch occurring earlier for animals foraging in environments with higher bacterial patch density (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2N</xref>). The delay in exploitation corresponded to a comparatively large number of initial exploratory encounters with animals on medium density conditions (0.5 to 10) <italic>exploiting</italic> after an average of 4.8 to 18.7 exploratory encounters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2O</xref>). To summarize, for densities similar to those experienced immediately preceding the experiment (50 and 200), animals immediately <italic>exploit</italic> available bacteria. On the other hand, for bacterial densities that appear to be below an animal’s sensory threshold (0 to 0.3), animals never <italic>exploit</italic> patches and spend the entire 60-minute assay <italic>searching</italic> for food. When foraging in medium density patches (0.5 to 10), animals initially explore the environment via a combination of <italic>searching</italic> and <italic>sampling</italic> encounters and eventually switch to <italic>exploiting</italic>. Notably, the timing of this switch is density-dependent with animals switching earlier when foraging on higher density patches.</p>

<title>Animals explore before exploiting even when only one patch is available</title>
<p>Given that bacterial patches within an environment were relatively invariable and that bacterial growth during the experiment was negligible (<xref rid="fig2_S3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – supplement 3</xref>), it was surprising that animals were often willing to <italic>reject</italic> 10+ patches before <italic>exploiting</italic> a patch of the same density as those previously <italic>rejected</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2O</xref>). This <italic>sampling</italic> behavior may be beneficial when food is patchily distributed in the environment as exploiting a dilute patch may result in a lost opportunity for future encounter with a higher quality patch. Thus, we hypothesized that an animal’s willingness to <italic>accept</italic> a patch whose density matched that of a previously <italic>rejected</italic> patch could be a specific feature of a patchily distributed environment where numerous observations of individual patches could contribute to learning the features of a changing environment. To address this, we observed whether animals were willing to <italic>reject</italic> a patch numerous times before <italic>accepting</italic> it even when only one patch is available in the environment. We created environments with single large (∼8.3 mm) or small (∼1.8 mm) diameter patches with relative density ranging from 0 to ∼400 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-C</xref>). Behavior was tracked for 60 minutes as animals foraged in these environments (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D-E</xref>, <xref rid="fig3_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – supplement 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3_S1">2</xref>). We found that even in these single patch environments, animals initially <italic>explore</italic> (<italic>search</italic> and <italic>sample</italic>) before <italic>exploiting</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F-G</xref>) in a density-dependent manner. Just as when foraging in a patchily distributed environment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2N</xref>), animals <italic>explored</italic> (<italic>search</italic> and <italic>sample</italic>) the small and large single patches numerous times prior to <italic>exploiting</italic> with the timing of this switch occurring significantly earlier with increasing bacterial density (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H-I</xref>). These results suggest that the explore-then-exploit strategy employed by <italic>C. elegans</italic> is not specific to a patchily distributed environment. Rather, animals may <italic>sample</italic> the same patch numerous times before deciding to <italic>exploit</italic>, especially when foraging on dilute patches. The decision of when to stop <italic>exploring</italic> and start <italic>exploiting</italic> is highly dependent upon the density of bacteria within a patch with the switch occurring earlier when animals encounter patches of higher density.</p>

<title>External and internal sensory information guide the decision to explore or exploit</title>
<p>While our behavioral analysis demonstrated that <italic>C. elegans</italic> modulate their decision to <italic>explore</italic> or <italic>exploit</italic> in a density-dependent manner, it remains unclear whether these animals use more complex cognitive processes such as learning and memory to guide their foraging decision.

<p>We considered that the probability of exploiting a patch upon any given encounter can be described by a logistic function:
<disp-formula id="ueqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="613674v3_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>p</italic>(<italic>y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 1 | <bold><italic>β</italic></bold> · <bold><italic>x</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>) represents the conditional probability that an animal exploited during patch encounter <italic>k</italic> ; <bold><italic>x</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> ∈ <italic>R</italic><sup><italic>n</italic></sup> is a vector of covariates; and <bold><italic>β</italic></bold> ∈ <italic>R</italic><sup><italic>n</italic></sup> is a vector of weights that describes how much each covariate influences the animal’s choice. In models compared here, <bold><italic>x</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> includes a combination of a constant element and covariates that may empirically influence the decision to <italic>exploit</italic>. We considered the simplest model where every encounter is independent with fixed probability of <italic>exploiting</italic> (i.e., <italic>p</italic>(<italic>y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 1 | <bold><italic>β</italic></bold><sub>0</sub>)) where <bold><italic>β</italic></bold><sub>0</sub> represents the average animal’s propensity to <italic>exploit</italic>. We compared this null model against a set of nested models containing covariates that vary from encounter to encounter and relate to: 1) the relative density of the encountered patch <italic>k</italic>(<italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>), 2) the duration of time spent off food since departing the last <italic>exploited</italic> patch (<italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>), 3) the relative density of the patch encountered immediately before encounter <italic>k</italic>(<italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub>), and 4) the relative density of the last <italic>exploited</italic> patch (<italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>). Using this model design (i.e.,<bold><italic>β</italic></bold> · <bold><italic>x</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = <italic>β</italic><sub>0</sub> + <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> + <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub><italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> + <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub> <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub> + <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub> <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>), we assessed how each of these covariates influences the probability of <italic>exploitation</italic> at each patch encounter <italic>k</italic>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).</p>
<p>Given that our aim is to understand what factors influence an animal’s decision to <italic>explore</italic> or <italic>exploit</italic>, we rationalized that encounters where the animal did not detect the presence of bacteria were unlikely to contribute to decision-making. Therefore, we excluded <italic>searching</italic> encounters from our analysis where animals did <italic>not respond</italic> to the bacterial patch. To account for the uncertainty in our classification of <italic>sensing</italic>, we probabilistically included patch encounters with frequency equal to the probability that the bacterial patch was <italic>sensed</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>) as previously estimated by semi-supervised QDA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>, <xref rid="fig2_S8" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – supplement 8</xref>). In doing so, we simulated sets of observations of <italic>sensed</italic> (<italic>sample</italic> and <italic>exploit</italic>) encounters. Further, to account for the uncertainty in our classification of patch encounters as <italic>exploration</italic> or <italic>exploitation</italic>, we fit our GLM to the probability of <italic>exploiting p</italic>(<italic>y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 1 | <bold><italic>β</italic></bold> · <bold><italic>z</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>) as previously estimated by GMM (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>, <xref rid="fig2_S6" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – supplement 6</xref>) rather than fitting to direct observations of exploitation <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> (see Models of exploitation probability).</p>
<p>When selecting covariates for our model, we calculated the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) – a model selection test to avoid overfitting by penalizing increases in the number of parameters – and observed the best model performance when all covariates were included (<xref rid="fig4_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – supplement 1A-B</xref>). Further, we found that all covariates (i.e., <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>, <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>, <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub>, and <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>) significantly contribute to the decision to <italic>exploit p(y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 1 | <bold><italic>β</italic></bold> <italic>·</italic> <bold><italic>x</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub><italic>)</italic> as indicated by coefficient values significantly greater than or less than zero (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref rid="fig4_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – supplement 1C</xref>). Specifically, we found that</p>
<p><italic>β</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> and <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> are significantly greater than zero which suggests that animals are more likely to <italic>exploit</italic> patches with increasing patch density <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> and duration of food-deprivation <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>. On the other hand, <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub> and <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub> are significantly negative, which suggests that the greater the density of a recently encountered or <italic>exploited</italic> patch, <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub> and <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>, the less likely an animal should be willing to <italic>exploit</italic> the current patch.</p>
<p>In order to better understand how each of the covariates in our model affect the <italic>exploitation</italic> decision, we examined the probability of observing <italic>exploitation</italic> for the first time as a function of the cumulative number of patches an animal encountered. Exploitation events were simulated from a Bernoulli distribution with probability estimated by the model (i.e., <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>|<bold><italic>x</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> ∼ Bern <italic>p(y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 1 | <bold><italic>β</italic></bold> <italic>·</italic> <bold><italic>x</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub><italic>)</italic>))or observed from our classification of <italic>exploitation</italic> (i.e., <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>|,<bold><italic>z</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> ∼ Bern <italic>p(y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 1 | <bold><italic>β</italic></bold> <italic>·</italic> <bold><italic>z</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub><italic>))</italic>). Although the probability of <italic>exploiting</italic> for the first time was not expressly fit by our model, this derived metric highlights the model’s ability to predict the delay in <italic>exploitation</italic> observed for animals foraging on low to medium density bacterial patches in our experiments (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref rid="fig4_S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – supplement 2</xref>). For the simplest model where every encounter is independent with fixed probability of <italic>exploiting p(y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 1 | <italic>β</italic><sub>0</sub>), we find that the probability of <italic>exploiting</italic> for the first time is greatest for the first encounter and decreases for every subsequent encounter (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref rid="fig4_S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – supplement 2</xref>), fitting a geometric distribution.</p>
<p>We next considered whether the observed delay in <italic>exploitation</italic> could be explained by a simple density-dependent model (i.e., <italic>p(y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 1 | <italic>β</italic><sub>0</sub> <italic>+ β</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>). This model predicts that animals are more likely to <italic>exploit</italic> bacterial patches of greater density with probability proportional to the relative density of the current patch <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>. While this density-dependent model accurately predicted that the first <italic>exploitation</italic> occurs earlier on average for higher density patches, it also predicted that, regardless of patch density, the first <italic>exploitation</italic> is most frequently observed on the first encounter which did not match the observed distribution (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref rid="fig4_S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – supplement 2</xref>). We subsequently considered that the onset of food-deprivation during <italic>exploration</italic> of these low-density environments could drive the observed time-dependent delay in <italic>exploitation</italic>. We assume that animals become satiated during <italic>exploitation</italic> and use the duration of time an animal spent searching off-food since the last <italic>exploitation</italic> event (i.e., <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>) as a proxy for the animal’s likely decrease in satiety. With the addition of this satiety-related signal (i.e., <italic>p(y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 1 | <italic>β</italic><sub>0</sub> + <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> <italic>+ β</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>), we observed a slight delay in whenanimals are predicted to first <italic>exploit</italic> for the lowest density conditions tested (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref rid="fig4_S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – supplement 2</xref>). To validate our finding that animals use a satiety-related signal to inform decision making, we applied our model to observations of animals foraging in patchily distributed environments following 3 hours of food-deprivation (<xref rid="fig4_S3" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – supplement 3A-B</xref>). We found that only with the inclusion of a satiety-related covariate in our model, were we able to reliably predict the immediate <italic>exploitation</italic> that food-deprived animals exhibit (<xref rid="fig4_S3" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – supplement 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>We next considered the alternative possibility that this time-dependent signal could actually be related to the physical stress induced by the process of moving animals into the experimental arena rather than the onset of food-deprivation. While we used an agar plug method to mitigate the stress of moving (see Nematode cultures); we sought to examine the impact of satiety as compared to transfer-induced stress on the <italic>exploitation</italic> decision. We quantified both <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>, the duration of time an animal spent searching off-food since the last <italic>exploitation</italic> event, and <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>, the duration of time since transfer (i.e., the time elapsed in the experiment). However, as our initial experiments were only one hour, we typically observed only one <italic>exploitation</italic> event. Resultantly, <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> and <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> were highly correlated and their individual contributions to the model could not be easily parsed. Therefore, we ran additional experiments with animals foraging in environments with multiple patch densities over two hours (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref rid="fig4_S4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – supplement 4A-C</xref>) which led to observations containing multiple <italic>exploitation</italic> events and a resultant decorrelation of <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> and <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>. When the model was re-fit to this two-hour data set using both <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> and <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> covariates (i.e., <italic>p(y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 1 | <italic>β</italic><sub>0</sub> + <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> +<italic>β</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> +<italic>β</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>+<italic>β</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub> <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub> +<italic>β</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub> <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>), only the satiety-related covariate <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> was statistically significant (<xref rid="fig4_S4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – supplement 4D</xref>). This result suggests that the time-dependent change in <italic>exploitation</italic> is likely due to a satiety-related signal rather than a stress-related signal. Altogether, these results suggest that animals use available external and internal sensory information to guide the decision to <italic>exploit</italic>.</p>

<title>Prior experience guides the decision to explore or exploit</title>
<p>Although the current patch density and satiety covariates significantly influence the decision to <italic>exploit</italic>, this model (i.e., <italic>p(y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 1 | <italic>β</italic><sub>0</sub> + <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> +<italic>β</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>)) does not accurately predict the extent that <italic>exploitation</italic> was delayed. We hypothesized that because animals had experienced very densely seeded bacterial patches immediately prior to the assay, animals may have built an expectation that high density bacterial patches are available in the new environment. We would therefore expect an initial suppression in the probability of <italic>exploiting</italic> while animals updated their expectation using information learned from <italic>sampling</italic> patches in the current environment. To test whether the decision to <italic>exploit</italic> could be influenced by prior experience, we added a history-dependent covariate to our model (i.e., <italic>p(y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 1 | <italic>β</italic><sub>0</sub>+<italic>β</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> +<italic>β</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> +<italic>β</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub> <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub>) where <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub> is the relative density of the patch encountered immediately before encounter <italic>k</italic>). We find that inclusion of the density of the most recently encountered patch significantly improves our prediction of <italic>exploitation</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref rid="fig4_S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – supplement 2</xref>). We then considered whether the animal’s expectation of bacterial density in the environment might be a longer lasting memory. Specifically, we considered if the relative density of the most recently <italic>exploited</italic> patch <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub> could have influenced the animal’s decision to <italic>exploit</italic>. The addition of this second history-dependent term to our model (i.e., <italic>p(y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 1 | <italic>β</italic><sub>0</sub>+<italic>β</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> +<italic>β</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> +<italic>β</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub> <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub> + <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub> <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>)) further improved the fit of our model (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref rid="fig4_S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – supplement 2</xref>) suggesting that <italic>C. elegans</italic> use recent experiences of encountered and <italic>exploited</italic> patches to guide their decision to <italic>exploit</italic>. Animals may use this learned information to create and update an expectation for the relative density of bacterial patches available in their environment and compare that estimate against the density of a subsequently encountered patch. Altogether, these results suggest that animals use recent experiences to estimate available resources and modulate their decision to <italic>explore</italic> or <italic>exploit</italic>, a strategy that is highly beneficial for behavioral adaptation in a changing environment.</p>
<p>To validate the role of prior experience in guiding foraging decisions, we observed animals foraging in environments with multiple patch densities (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref rid="fig4_S4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – supplement 4A-C</xref>). Our model predicts that the lower the density of recently encountered and/or <italic>exploited</italic> patches, the more likely an animal should be to <italic>exploit</italic> a subsequent patch. Without the history-dependent terms <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub> and <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>, our model predicts that no relationship should exist between prior experience and the probability of <italic>exploiting</italic> the current patch. To test which model best fit the animals’ behavior, we calculated the conditional probabilities of <italic>exploiting p(y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 1 | <bold><italic>β</italic></bold> · <bold><italic>x</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>) for this new multi-density, multi-patch data set with more nuanced combinations of current (<italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>) and recent patch (<italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub> hand <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>) density using the coefficients <bold><italic>β</italic></bold> learned previously (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). We observed significantly better predictions of <italic>exploitation</italic> probability for the model including prior experience as compared to the model without the terms <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub> and <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref rid="fig4_S4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – supplement 4E</xref>) as confirmed by a likelihood-ratio test. We observed an augmentation in <italic>exploitation</italic> when animals move from low to high density (e.g., 1 to 4 or 1 to 7) as predicted by the model with history-dependence, but not the model without. It is important to note, that this improvement in prediction was achieved without fitting the model to this new multi-density data set. In summary, our modeling results suggest that animals evaluate bacterial density, monitor internal signals of satiety, and leverage recent experiences to drive their decision to <italic>exploit</italic> a bacterial patch upon encounter.</p>

<title>Ciliated sensory neurons are required for the evaluation of patch density</title>
<p>The quantitative modeling applied in this study provides a useful framework for testing the influence of behaviorally relevant features on decision-making. To validate this approach and further elucidate how animals evaluate current and recent patch density, we assessed the foraging behavior of mutants with sensory deficiencies (<xref rid="fig4_S5" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – supplement 5</xref>). We found that animals with reduced function of non-ciliated mechanoreceptor neurons due to a null mutation in the <italic>mec-4</italic> gene behave similarly to wild-type N2 animals, displaying increasingly delayed <italic>exploitation</italic> as patch density decreases (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref rid="fig4_S5" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – supplement 5</xref>). Contrastingly, animals with reduced function of ciliated chemoreceptor and mechanoreceptor neurons due to a null mutation in the <italic>osm-6</italic> gene displayed immediate <italic>exploitation</italic> even while foraging on low density patches (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref rid="fig4_S5" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – supplement 5</xref>). These results indicate altered decision-making in the <italic>osm-6</italic> mutants. Specifically, it appears that the influence of patch density on the <italic>exploitation</italic> decision is reduced in <italic>osm-6</italic> mutants and that these animals are more likely to <italic>accept</italic> a patch by default.</p>
<p>To further elaborate on these findings, we fit our GLM to each of the three data sets (i.e., N2, <italic>mec-4, osm-6</italic>) and assessed the difference in the estimated distributions of coefficients <bold><italic>β</italic></bold> between mutant and wild-type models (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). We hypothesized that the density-related covariates (<italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>, <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub>, and <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>) would have smaller magnitude (i.e., less influence on decision-making) for animals with reduced sensation of bacterial density. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found a significant reduction in the magnitude of the influence of current patch density (i.e., <bold><italic>β</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>) on the decision to exploit in <italic>osm-6</italic> mutants. Further, we found a significant increase in the intercept <bold><italic>β</italic></bold><sub>0</sub> in <italic>osm-6</italic> mutants which corresponds to the overall increase in <italic>exploitation</italic> observed in these animals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref rid="fig4_S5" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – supplement 5</xref>). These results suggest that the ciliated sensory neurons play an important role in evaluating the density of the current patch and that when sensation is impaired, animals modify their default behavioral strategy to prioritize <italic>exploitation</italic>. We also observed a marginal increase in our estimate of the influence of recently <italic>exploited</italic> patches (i.e., <bold><italic>β</italic></bold><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>) in <italic>osm-6</italic> mutants which suggests that reduced efficacy in the evaluation of current patch density also affects learning and memory of patch density. No significant changes were detected in the <italic>mec-4</italic> mutants. Although we cannot rule out a role for non-ciliated mechanoreceptor neurons in contributing to the assessment of patch density, this modality likely provides less salient information. Altogether, these results suggest that ciliated sensory neurons are necessary for the evaluation of patch density and that when the function of these neurons is impaired, animals prioritize <italic>exploitation</italic>. Further, these results demonstrate that this quantitative modeling approach can be used to probe mechanisms underlying decision-making.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Like all foraging animals, <italic>C. elegans</italic> must choose between <italic>exploiting</italic> an environment for known resources and <italic>exploring</italic> it for potentially better opportunities elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that <italic>C. elegans</italic> use <italic>stay-switch</italic> decisions to efficiently explore a patchily distributed environment and exploit the bacteria within [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. In this study, we show that <italic>C. elegans</italic> also make <italic>accept-reject</italic> decisions while foraging. Specifically, we observe that animals often initially <italic>reject</italic> low density bacterial patches, opting to prioritize exploration of the environment, before switching to a more exploitatory foraging strategy during subsequent encounters. This explore-then-exploit strategy was consistent across a range of bacterial patch densities, sizes, and distributions. In order to better understand this phenomenon and identify the factors that contribute to the decision to <italic>exploit</italic>, we leveraged a quantitative modeling approach to hypothesis testing. We found that animals do not employ a default explore-then-exploit strategy; rather, this behavior reflects a series of <italic>accept-reject</italic> decisions guided by multimodal information related to an animal’s environment and internal state. Specifically, we show that each decision to <italic>explore</italic> or <italic>exploit</italic> is informed by available sensory information, internal satiety signals, and learned environmental statistics related to the bacterial density of recently encountered and <italic>exploited</italic> patches.</p>

<title><italic>C. elegans</italic> make accept-reject foraging decisions</title>
<p>While <italic>C. elegans</italic> have been shown to alter food preferences in a diet choice assay, this behavior has only been described by a set of <italic>stay-switch</italic> decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. Specifically, <italic>C. elegans</italic> were found to modulate their patch-leaving frequency to <italic>stay</italic> on high quality bacterial patches and <italic>switch</italic> with declining food quality and quantity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. The overall effect of leaving low quality patches more frequently is that animals are more likely to reside on high quality patches. Thus, <italic>stay-switch</italic> decision-making enables <italic>C. elegans</italic> to allocate time spent between exploring or exploiting in a manner consistent with optimal foraging theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. However, optimal foraging theory also predicts that an animal should never exploit (i.e., always <italic>reject</italic>) a low density patch if higher density patches are sufficiently abundant as inclusion of the low density patch type in the animals’ diet decreases the overall rate of energy gained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Thus, while leaving low density patches more frequently drives an overall increase in the rate of energy gained, it can still result in sub-optimal foraging behavior.</p>
<p>Here, we demonstrate that <italic>C. elegans</italic> are capable of making <italic>accept-reject</italic> decisions upon encounter with bacterial patches. We employed quantitative methods – GMM and semi-supervised QDA – to estimate whether animals <italic>sensed</italic> a patch and, if they did, whether they <italic>accepted</italic> or <italic>rejected</italic> it. We found that when transferred from high to low density bacterial patches, animals initially <italic>rejected</italic> several patches, opting to continue exploration of the environment, and that this <italic>reject</italic> decision did not reflect an animal’s inability to detect the presence of bacteria in these dilute patches. Further, we found that the decision to <italic>explore</italic> or <italic>exploit</italic> is density-dependent and robust across a range of bacterial densities, distributions, and sizes. The initial preference for <italic>exploration</italic> during foraging on low density patches suggests that animals may be <italic>searching</italic> for denser bacterial patches such as those experienced immediately preceding the assay and throughout development. This explore-then-exploit strategy is advantageous for animals when bacterial patch density is low or variable. On the other hand, we observed immediate <italic>exploitation</italic> of high density patches. In these environments, an explore-then-exploit strategy is disadvantageous, as delaying <italic>exploitation</italic> when patch density is already high results in spending more energy on food search with no expected increase in energy gained during <italic>exploitation</italic> of a subsequently encountered patch. Thus, consistent with an energy maximizing optimal forager, <italic>C. elegans</italic> initially <italic>explores</italic> when bacterial patch density is low but immediately <italic>exploits</italic> when bacterial patch density is sufficiently high. Altogether, our results demonstrate that <italic>C. elegans</italic> make a distinct decision to either <italic>explore</italic> or <italic>exploit</italic> a patch upon encounter and that the density-dependence of this decision is consistent with predictions from optimal foraging theory.</p>
<p>The concepts of <italic>accept-reject</italic> and <italic>stay-switch</italic> decision-making are well described in foraging theory literature (see Pyke, Pulliam &amp; Charnov 1977 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] for a review on the subject) and represent the questions “Do you want to eat it?” and, if so, “How long do you want to eat it for?”. These concepts are easily distinguishable for animals that forage using the following framework: 1) search for prey, 2) encounter prey from a distance, 3) identify prey type, 4) decide to pursue (<italic>accept-reject</italic> decision), 5) pursue and capture the prey, 6) exploit prey, and 7) decide to stop exploiting and start searching again (<italic>stay-switch</italic> decision). However, in some scenarios, animals must physically encounter prey prior to identification. In these cases where pursuit and capture are not visualized, it is harder to distinguish between <italic>accept-reject</italic> and <italic>stay-switch</italic> decisions. In our experiments, <italic>C. elegans</italic> do not appear to detect the presence of bacterial patches prior to encounter as slow-down only occurs within one body-length of the patch edge (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Further, we find significant bimodality in encounter duration (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>) where short duration (<italic>exploratory</italic>) encounters appear to represent a lower bound where animals spend the minimum amount of time possible on a patch (less than 2 minutes), which we interpret as a <italic>rejection</italic> of the patch. On the other hand, <italic>exploitatory</italic> encounters span a large range of durations from 2 to 60+ minutes which we interpret as an initial <italic>acceptance</italic> of the patch followed by a series of <italic>stay-switch</italic> decisions which determine the overall duration of the encounter. While we could certainly model our data using only <italic>stay-switch</italic> decision-making, we ascertain that an encounter of minimal duration is better interpreted ethologically as a <italic>rejection</italic> rather than as an immediate <italic>switch</italic> decision. In accordance with this interpretation, we hypothesize that if <italic>C. elegans</italic> were able to detect the presence of a bacterial patch prior to encountering it, it’s possible that animals may be observed to navigate towards (<italic>accept</italic>) or away from (<italic>reject</italic>) a patch. However, it could be the case that, for <italic>C. elegans, sampling</italic> the patch is prerequisite to an <italic>accept-reject</italic> decision which would suggest that gustation, mechanosensation, and/or post-ingestive feedback may guide <italic>C. elegans</italic> foraging decisions.</p>
<p>Our finding that <italic>C. elegans</italic> are willing to <italic>reject</italic> numerous encountered patches is somewhat surprising, especially given that <italic>C. elegans</italic> likely possess limited spatial memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] and are likely unaware of how many patches are in the environment as evidenced by their willingness to <italic>reject</italic> a patch even when only one patch is available (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Taken together, this suggests that animals are “knowingly” passing up an opportunity to <italic>exploit</italic> an immediately available food source for the potential opportunity to <italic>exploit</italic> preferred food later. This type of behavior has been described in humans and other animals in the context of delayed gratification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>], intertemporal choice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>], self-control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>], and optimal stopping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]. Notably, few animals display the capacity for delayed gratification when given the option between eating an immediately available but less preferred food item and waiting for a preferred food item [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]. Even fewer animals are willing to wait if the delayed reward is not visible or increases in quantity rather than quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>]. Our observation that <italic>C. elegans</italic> can exhibit delayed gratification suggests that this and similar processes require less complex cognition than previously considered or that we may have underestimated the cognitive capacity of <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p>

<title>External and internal sensory information guide foraging decision-making</title>
<p><italic>Stay-switch</italic> decisions in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are strongly modulated by a variety of internal and external sensory cues over a range of behavioral timescales. For example, patch-leaving frequency can be modulated by an animal’s prior experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>], metabolic status, arousal state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>], as well as the presence of pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>], chemorepellents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>], predators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>], and varying levels of environmental O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we used a quantitative framework to show that recent experiences (i.e., the density of current and recently encountered and <italic>exploited</italic> bacterial patches) guide <italic>accept-reject</italic> decision-making. In our study and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>], <italic>C. elegans</italic> appear to be able to detect the presence of and assess the relative density of bacterial patches. When foraging in environments with low density bacterial patches, we initially observed many <italic>searching</italic> encounters where animals did not appear to slowdown; however, over time, the proportion of <italic>searching</italic> encounters decreased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2L,M</xref>). This increased responsiveness to dilute patches over time could have resulted from small changes in bacterial growth or a modulation of patch detection sensitivity. Contrastingly, animals with reduced function of ciliated chemoreceptor and mechanoreceptor neurons due to a null mutation in the <italic>osm-6</italic> gene almost never <italic>searched</italic>. Rather, they displayed immediate <italic>exploitation</italic> even while foraging on low density patches. This suggests that <italic>osm-6</italic> mutants display an augmented ability to detect bacterial patches but a diminished ability to assess the bacterial density of those patches. While this may seem contradictory, it suggests that bacterial detection and density assessment are mediated by distinct sensory mechanisms. Specifically, post-ingestive feedback or other non-ciliary sensory cues may drive the initial detection of bacteria, while ciliated sensory neurons appear to be crucial for the nuanced evaluation of bacterial patch density. This interplay allows for a flexible foraging strategy where initial detection by one modality can trigger exploitation, which can then be modulated or overridden by more detailed chemosensory and mechanosensory information. This framework may explain why <italic>osm-6</italic> mutants, lacking the ability to finely assess bacterial density, prioritize exploitation; if all patches appear effectively equivalent, further exploration is inefficient. Collectively, these results suggest an important role for sensory modalities in the detection and assessment of bacterial patch density and highlight a need to investigate the mechanisms behind these effects in future studies.</p>
<p>The difficulty in assessing bacterial patch density is more than just a sensory challenge. Within-patch spatial inhomogeneity resulting from areas of active proliferation of bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>] complicate an animal’s ability to accurately assess the quantity of bacteria within a patch and, consequently, our ability to accurately compute a metric related to our assumptions of what the animal is sensing. In our study, we used the relative density of the patch edge where bacterial density is highest as a proxy for an animal’s assessment of bacterial patch density (<xref rid="fig2_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – supplement 1</xref>). This decision was based on a previous finding that the time spent on the edge of a bacterial patch affected the dynamics of subsequent area-restricted search [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. While within-patch spatial inhomogeneity likely affects an animal’s ability to assess patch density, we do not believe that this qualitatively affects the results of our study. Both the patch densities tested (<xref rid="fig2_S3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – supplement 3A</xref>) as well as our observations of time-dependent changes in <italic>exploitation</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E,N-O</xref>; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H-I</xref>) maintained a monotonic relationship. Therefore, alternative methods of patch density estimation should yield similar results.</p>
<p>According to early models in optimal foraging theory, foragers behave as if they have <italic>complete information</italic> about the environment (e.g., animals are assumed to know the average density of bacterial patches) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Later theoretical and empirical work expanded models of patch choice to accommodate situations where animals have <italic>incomplete information</italic> (e.g., environments with fluctuating resources) and, therefore, must both acquire information and forage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>]. This work suggests that animals may continuously sample areas in their environment to keep track of resource availability. Here, we found that animals initially choose to <italic>sample</italic> patches and that the duration of this period of <italic>sampling</italic> is correlated with the degree of mismatch between current and recently experienced and <italic>exploited</italic> patches (i.e., animals spend more time <italic>sampling</italic> as the magnitude of difference between the patch density experienced immediately before and during the experiment increases). When there is no difference between current and prior experience (i.e., animals foraging on patches of relative density 200), animals rarely <italic>sample</italic>. These results suggest that <italic>C. elegans</italic> use <italic>sampling</italic> as a way of re-evaluating the overall quality of patches available in the environment when a change is detected. Further, the results of our model suggest that animals likely use the information learned during <italic>sampling</italic> encounters to guide their decision to <italic>explore</italic> or <italic>exploit</italic> on subsequent patch encounters. We behaviorally validated this hypothesis by applying our model predictions to animals foraging in environments with multiple patch densities. Consistent with our predictions, we observed that the lower the density of recently encountered or <italic>exploited</italic> patches and the higher the density of the current patch, the more likely an animal would be to <italic>exploit</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>C. elegans</italic> can learn and remember features of recent experiences and use that learned information to guide efficient decision-making. Incorporating prior experience into the decision to <italic>explore</italic> or <italic>exploit</italic> currently available food is highly beneficial when foraging in a fluctuating environment. <italic>C. elegans</italic> thus may have evolved this ability to maximize foraging in the wild where animals experience a boom-and-bust environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>]. Future studies investigating the effects of varying patch density during animal development could provide additional insights into the effects of more distant experiences on the <italic>explore</italic>-<italic>exploit</italic> decision. However, testing this is non-trivial as maintaining stable bacterial density conditions over long timescales requires matching the rate of bacterial growth with the rate of bacterial consumption.</p>
<p>In addition to external sensory information, internal state signals serve a critical role in modifying decision-making in <italic>C. elegans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>]. For example, food-deprived animals are more likely to cross an aversive barrier (e.g., copper, primaquine, glycerol) in search of food as compared to well-fed controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>]. Here, we find that a satiety-related signal likely drives the decision to <italic>exploit</italic>. Specifically, our model suggests that as animals’ satiety decreases, their willingness to accept a lower quality patch increases. We confirmed this prediction by analyzing the behavior of food-deprived animals, which immediately <italic>exploit</italic> even when bacterial patches are very dilute (<xref rid="fig4_S3" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – supplement 3</xref>). Further, we showed that this temporal signal was not likely to have been caused by transfer-induced stress (<xref rid="fig4_S4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – supplement 4D</xref>). Combined with the effect of prior experience, these results suggest that the decision to <italic>explore</italic> or <italic>exploit</italic> likely requires integration of food-related internal and external cues. Future studies should probe if additional factors related to the animal’s biotic and abiotic environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>] as well as alternative motivations (e.g., reproduction and predatory avoidance) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>] further modify these foraging decisions.</p>

<title>Quantitative and ethological approach to investigating decision-making</title>
<p>Naturalistic observations of <italic>C. elegans</italic> behavior are necessary to achieve a more complete cellular, molecular, and genetic understanding of how the nervous system has evolved to drive animal behavior. For example, large patches of densely seeded bacteria have primarily been used in experiments assessing <italic>C. elegans</italic> foraging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>]. However, wild nematodes experience a boom-and-bust environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>] that may be more consistent with sparse, patchily distributed bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Thus, just as quiescence is only observed on high quality bacterial patches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>], additional behavioral states may be discovered when assessing foraging in dilute patchy environments. By conducting detailed analyses of ecologically inspired foraging behaviors in individual animals, we discovered that <italic>C. elegans</italic> make <italic>accept-reject</italic> decisions upon encounter with bacterial patches. By studying foraging in these environments containing small, dilute bacterial patches, we increased the frequency of opportunities for <italic>accept-reject</italic> decision-making (i.e., patch encounters and patch-leaving events are more frequent) and decreased the condition-specific bias towards <italic>accept</italic> decisions (i.e., animals are less likely to <italic>accept</italic> patches when moved between environments of differing bacterial density). We expect that further investigation into naturalistic behaviors could reveal additional insights into more complex behaviors and decision-making in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and other animals.</p>
<p>In this study, we developed an assay that enables observation of ecologically relevant decision-making in freely moving animals. We posit that future studies can leverage this assay to investigate the neuronal mechanisms underlying decision-making. The frequency of decision-making opportunities (i.e., numerous <italic>accept-reject</italic> decisions could be observed in the span of minutes) and consistency of patch choice decisions across hundreds of animals and a range of environmental conditions tested supports this claim. Further, we anticipate that the <italic>accept-reject</italic> decision occurs during a narrow time window – possibly at the time of encounter with the patch edge or shortly thereafter. Therefore, we expect that this assay could be adapted for experiments utilizing calcium imaging in freely-moving animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>] to monitor neuronal activity as animals make these decisions. Additionally, the foraging task used here could be leveraged as an accumulation of evidence paradigm, which has been predominantly studied using mammalian animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>].</p>
<p>Finally, we used simple quantitative models to dissect and validate the components underlying decision-making. Specifically, we employed a logistic regression GLM which we adapted to accommodate our uncertainty in classification of <italic>sensing</italic> and <italic>exploitation</italic> for each encounter. While alternative models may provide more mechanistic predictions, the GLM enabled us to conduct a sequence of hypothesis tests probing the influence of food-related signals on the decision to <italic>exploit</italic>. Indeed, we conducted a great number of analyses involving model selection and optimization. Ultimately, we focused our study on asking whether a set of simple covariates could be used to predict foraging decisions. The GLM enabled us to identify the simplest model that could explain the observed delay in <italic>exploitation</italic>. While even the null model predicted that, on average, numerous <italic>exploratory</italic> encounters were likely to occur before the first <italic>exploitation</italic>, models including satiety and prior experience significantly better predicted the extent of this delay. Further, we demonstrated that we could validate these model predictions in food-deprived animals, animals exploring multiple patch densities, and animals with sensory deficiencies. We regard our study as an initial foray into demonstrating <italic>accept-reject</italic> decision-making in nematodes and, while our model is a useful tool for testing the effects of past experiences, our results do not imply that <italic>C. elegans</italic> discretize their experiences into the parameters used in our model. The exact mechanisms and, consequently, the best model design require further investigation. For example, it is possible that the density of recently <italic>exploited</italic> patches is predictive of subsequent <italic>exploitation</italic> because post-ingestive feedback is required for the memory and/or because more distant experiences are remembered (i.e., long-term memory is involved). Future studies should seek to differentiate between these possibilities and characterize the time window of the memory. Altogether, we suggest that this quantitative and ecologically inspired approach to investigating behavior and decision-making is incredibly powerful for refining hypotheses and enables subsequent investigation into the underlying cellular, molecular and circuit pathways in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, a strategy that could be adopted across species.</p>

<p>Stock liquid cultures of the OP50 strain of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> were prepared via inoculation of a single colony in sterile lysogeny broth (LB) grown overnight at room temperature. Stock liquid cultures were subsequently stored at 4°C for up to 6 weeks.</p>
<p>Solutions of OP50 for each experiment were prepared via a series of dilutions in LB (<xref rid="fig1_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – supplement 1A</xref>). 50 mL of OP50 stock solution was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes. After removal of supernatant, approximately 500 to 1000 µL of saturated liquid culture remained. The bacterial density of this saturated solution was estimated by measuring the optical density at 600 nm (OD<sub>600</sub>) of a 1:50 dilution of the homogenized solution on a spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices SpectraMax Plus 384). The saturated solution was subsequently diluted to achieve an OD<sub>600</sub> of ∼10 (μ = 10.22, σ = 0.31). Measurements of the number of colony forming units in the “10” solution estimated 13.1×10<sup>9</sup> cells per mL on average. Additional densities (OD<sub>600</sub> = {0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}) were prepared via dilution of the “10” solution with LB and kept on ice to prevent bacterial growth. A “0” density solution was prepared with just LB.</p>
<p>For all experiments, these density solutions were seeded onto cold, low-moisture nematode growth medium (NGM) plates (3% agar) to facilitate pipetting of small, circular, quick-drying patches. Unless otherwise noted, seeded plates were immediately returned to 4°C after patches dried to prevent bacterial growth. Plates were stored at 4°C for an average of 6 days before experimentation.</p>
<p>For experiments using an OP50 strain expressing green fluorescent protein (OP50-GFP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>], cultures were prepared as above, but with the addition of 100 µg/mL of carbenicillin to the liquid LB.

<title>Single-density, multi-patch assay</title>
<p>Several days before the experiment, condition and acclimation plates were prepared (<xref rid="fig1_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – supplement 1A</xref>). For the condition plates, a large circular arena (30 mm in diameter) made of clear transparency film (6 mil, PET) was cut using a computer-controlled cutting machine (Cricut Maker 3) and placed in the center of a 10 cm petri dish filled with 25 mL of NGM (3% agar). These arenas function to corral animals with a low probability of escape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>]. A pipetting template made of the same material was designed and cut with an isometric grid consisting of 19 circular holes spaced 6 mm apart from center-to-center. The pipetting template was overlaid on top of the arena and 0.5 µL of OP50 solution (OD<sub>600</sub> = {0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10}) was pipetted into each hole. After drying, the template was immediately removed, and the petri dish lid replaced to prevent contamination and dehydration. For two conditions (“1 (12H)” and “1 (48H)”), plates were seeded with OD<sub>600</sub> = 1 and then left at room temperature for 12 or 24 hours, respectively, prior to storage at 4°C. For all other conditions, plates were immediately stored at 4°C after drying. Acclimation plates were prepared by seeding NGM (3% agar) plates with one large patch of 200 µL of OD<sub>600</sub> = 1 grown for 24 hours at room temperature.</p>
<p>Approximately 24 hours before the experiment, acclimation plates and “1 (48H)” condition plates were transferred from 4°C to room temperature. After plates warmed to room temperature (∼1 hour), 30-60 L4 animals were picked onto the acclimation plates. Plates were then stored at 20°C until the experiment for a combined bacterial growth time of approximately 48 hours (24 hours from freshly seeded to 4°C; 24 hours from 4°C to experiment). The combined bacterial growth time for all condition plates was approximately 1 hour (μ= 1.16 hours, σ = 0.23) unless otherwise noted as “12” (μ= 13.63 hours, σ = 0.50) or “48” hours (μ= 49.28 hours, σ = 2.94).</p>
<p>On the day of the experiment, each set of condition plates was transferred from 4°C to room temperature. After one hour, 4 young adult animals were gently transferred to an empty NGM plate to limit the spread of bacteria from acclimation to condition plates. Animals were then quickly transferred to a condition plate. Animals were transferred using the flat surface of cylindrical plugs excised from clean 3% agar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>]. Importantly, the use of agar as a medium to transfer animals provides minimal disruption to their environment as all physical properties (e.g. temperature, humidity, surface tension) are maintained. Qualitatively, we observe no marked change in behavior from before to after transfer with the agar plug method, especially as compared to the often drastic changes observed when using a metal or eyelash pick.</p>
<p>Condition plates were subsequently placed face down on a piece of glass suspended above an edge-lit backlight (Advanced Illumination). Recordings were acquired using PixeLink cameras (PL-B741F) combined with Navitar lenses (1-60135 and 1-6044) and Streampix 8 software. Behavior was recorded for one hour at 1024×1024 pixels and 3 frames per second (fps) with spatial resolution of ∼33 pixels per mm (μ= 32.68 pixels/mm, σ = 1.70).</p>
<p>The assay was repeated over numerous days with every condition assayed on each day when possible. The order of seeding assay plates and recording behavior was randomized for each day to compensate for the potential effects of time on animal age and bacterial density. Further, the average temperature (μ= 21.99°C, σ = 0.95) and humidity (μ= 51.39%, σ = 11.67) during each experiment were recorded. As a result of randomization, animal age, bacterial growth time, temperature, and humidity did not significantly vary between density conditions. Replication of the assay was constrained by the set-up (∼4 hours per day), recording (1-2 hours per animal), and analysis (0.5-1 hours per animal) time required. A maximum of 24 animals (2 cameras run for 12 hours) could be assayed per day. Given these resource constraints, we collected replicates until saturation of qualitative observations (i.e., new animals merely replicated earlier observations without adding new information) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>] resulting in sample sizes comparable to similar studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>].</p>

Animals were transferred to this droplet using an eyelash pick immediately prior to the assay plate being placed on the imaging set-up. The recording was started once the droplet evaporated and animals were free to crawl about the arena. This process ensured that recordings began prior to an animal’s first patch encounter.</p>

<title>Bacterial patch location detection</title>
<p>Most bacterial densities tested in these experiments were too dilute to be visible under normal imaging conditions. Therefore, several strategies were employed to accurately detect the location of bacterial patches. First, a small reference dot was cut into the arena and pipetting templates enabling consistent and traceable patch placement. Further, prior to each behavior recording, a “contrast” video was acquired wherein a piece of dark cardstock was passed between the light source and the condition plate (<xref rid="fig1_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – supplement 1B-D</xref>, Video 2). This produced an effect where diffraction of light through the patches provided enough contrast to view the patches. Binary masks of the circular arena and patches were extracted from these videos in MATLAB using the Image Processing Toolbox and further refined manually in Photoshop (Adobe, 2024). Arena masks were used to calculate the scale (pixels/mm) of each image. In early experiments, the “contrast” video was acquired prior to worms being added to the condition plate, which resulted in displacement of the arena within the camera’s field-of-view. Image registration using MATLAB’s Computer Vision Toolbox was performed to accurately map the patches detected in the “contrast” video onto the behavioral recording.</p>

<title>Bacterial patch density estimation</title>
<p>As described above (see Assay preparation and recording), we varied the relative density of bacterial solutions by diluting OP50 in LB and growing patches for different lengths of time. As a result of these procedures, the relative bacterial density throughout the assay was not known and needed to be estimated. To determine the relative density of these bacterial patches, we seeded plates with fluorescently labeled OP50-GFP under identical conditions as in our assays (<xref rid="fig2_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – supplement 1A</xref>). We imaged these bacterial patches for several hours using a Zeiss Axio Zoom.V16. Images were analyzed using the Image Processing Toolbox in MATLAB. After correcting for inconsistent illumination across the field-of-view and normalizing images using matched controls (<xref rid="fig2_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – supplement 1B-C</xref>), we detected the location of each bacterial patch and extracted a fluorescence intensity profile along each patch’s radius (<xref rid="fig2_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – supplement 1D</xref>). Consistent with previous studies, we found that even in extremely dilute conditions, bacterial density was greater at the patch edge where actively proliferating bacteria are concentrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>]. Therefore, we detected the patch edge and computed the peak amplitude of each bacterial patch at all time points assayed (<xref rid="fig2_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – supplement 1E</xref>). We then performed linear regression on the values for each condition to create models of peak amplitude as a function of time. For low density conditions (i.e., OD<sub>600</sub> = {0.05, 0.1}) of small patches, fluorescent signals could not be detected. We therefore estimated these functions from a multinomial regression of values taken from OD<sub>600</sub> = {0.5, 1, 2}. Through this process, we used the total time that bacteria were allowed to grow at room temperature for each condition plate to estimate the peak amplitude at each time point (<xref rid="fig2_S3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – supplement 3</xref>). Finally, to minimize confusion about density conditions between experiments, we computed values for relative density by linearly scaling estimated peak amplitude values so that 0.5 µL patches seeded with OD<sub>600</sub> = 10 and grown for 1 hour at room temperature would have relative density equal to 10. We labeled each condition using the relative density rounded to one significant digit.</p>

<title>Behavioral tracking</title>
<p>WormLab<sup>®</sup> (MBF Bioscience) was used for tracking animal behavior (<xref rid="fig1_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – supplement 1E-G</xref>, Video 3). For each video, we adjusted thresholds for pixel intensity and worm dimensions to enable automatic tracking. WormLab then fit the worm’s body at every frame and stitched together a track of each worm across frames. Subsequent manual corrections were required for instances where the software created new worm tracks. This occurred most frequently when animals: 1) encountered the arena border, 2) collided with each other, or 3) overlapped with bubbles or dust particles embedded in the agar. To correct for these discontinuities, we manually “stitched” worm tracks together enabling us to keep track of each animal’s location throughout the duration of the experiment. We exported the location of each animal’s midpoint for further analysis in MATLAB (Mathworks, 2024a). For small, single-patch assays where higher spatial resolution enabled reliable distinction between the head and tail of the animal, we manually confirmed the head-tail and exported 25 points along the animal’s midline (<xref rid="fig1_S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – supplement 2A-C</xref>).</p>
<p>Animals were excluded from analyses when 1) the animal’s location could only be tracked for less than 75% of the video due to the animal escaping the arena and when 2) the location of bacterial patches could not be reliably assessed due to missing or low-quality “contrast” videos (see Bacterial patch location detection).</p>

<title>Patch encounter detection</title>
<p>As the head position of animals in our experiments was difficult to track due to low spatial resolution and limited automated detection of head position using WormLab, we instead tracked the midpoint position of the worm’s body and estimated patch encounters using a set of measured criteria. To do this, we tracked the behavior of worms in higher resolution (∼105 pixels/mm compared to ∼33 pixels/mm and 8 fps compared to 3 fps), single patch assays (<xref rid="fig1_S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – supplement 2A-C</xref>). We found that when the head of the animal was in contact (i.e., within 1 pixel) with the patch edge (see Bacterial patch location detection), the animal’s midpoint was on average 0.46024 mm away (<xref rid="fig1_S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – supplement 2D</xref>). We therefore defined a patch encounter as the time when an animal’s midpoint came within 0.46024 mm of the patch edge. However, this definition led to two types of errors: 1) putative entry events where the animal merely passed by the patch and 2) putative leaving events where the animal did not fully leave the patch.</p>
<p>To remove putative entry events where the animal nearly passed by the patch, we defined an additional distance threshold based on the distance between the animal’s midpoint and the patch edge for all time points when the head was within the patch (<xref rid="fig1_S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – supplement 2E</xref>). The midpoint was almost always (99% of time) within 0.28758 mm of the patch edge. Therefore, we removed patch encounters where the midpoint never got closer than 0.28758 mm from the patch edge. Although this criterion removes most “near miss” events, some events remain where the animal approached the patch, but its head never entered. Further decreasing this threshold (e.g., midpoint must be on patch) would result in real events being excluded due to the animal taking on specific postures where the midpoint remains outside the patch while feeding within the patch. Therefore, we chose to be more liberal (i.e., more false positive patch encounters than false negatives) in our detection of patch encounters. Subsequent analysis of these putative patch encounters removed the majority of remaining false positives (see Patch encounter classification as sensing or non-responding).</p>
<p>To address putative leaving events and avoid splitting a single patch encounter into multiple encounters, we considered that a lawn leaving event is most frequently defined as an event where all body parts have left the patch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. When tracking only the midpoint, it is not possible to ensure that the worm’s entire body has exited the patch. Using the criterion that an animal exits a patch when it’s midpoint exceeds 0.46024 mm from the patch edge accurately predicts exit events most of the time, but under certain scenarios (e.g., animals maintain an outstretched feeding posture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>]) false leaving events were detected. To exclude these leaving events, we analyzed the variability in the distance from the midpoint to the patch edge during on- and off-patch events (<xref rid="fig1_S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – supplement 2F</xref>). We found that on-patch events had low distance variability while off-patch events displayed a bimodal distribution, with some events having high variability as expected, and some events having low variability. We fit a two-component Gaussian mixture model to the off-patch distance variability and found that low variability leaving events could be reliably excluded when the standard deviation of off patch distances was less than 0.22221. We subsequently combined putative patch encounters where variability was below this threshold, resulting in fewer overall encounters.</p>

<title>Patch encounter classification as exploration or exploitation</title>
<p>To classify patch encounters as <italic>exploration</italic> or <italic>exploitation</italic> events, patch encounters were detected (see Patch encounter detection) and two features were computed: 1) duration of patch encounter and 2) average on-patch velocity. Both the duration and velocity features displayed a bimodal distribution with two visible clusters: one with short duration encounters and high on-patch velocity and one with long duration encounters and low on-patch velocity (<xref rid="fig2_S6" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – supplement 6A</xref>). To confirm the existence of two clusters, we conducted a modified version of Silverman’s test for bimodality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. Broadly, Silverman’s test uses kernel density estimation (KDE) to investigate the number of modes in a distribution. By solving for a critical bandwidth at which the KDE switches modality from <italic>j</italic> to <italic>j</italic> +1 modes, one is able to test the null hypothesis that a distribution has modes, versus the alternative that it has more than <italic>j</italic> modes. Following a previously described protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>], we tested the null hypothesis that our data set was unimodal (i.e. <italic>j =</italic> 1). We first mean-centered the matrix <bold><italic>z</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> containing the log transforms of the duration and average velocity of each patch encounter <italic>k</italic>. We then calculated the projection of each data point onto the first principal component (PC1) of the data to get a one-dimensional distribution representing the data in <bold><italic>z</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> (<xref rid="fig2_S6" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – supplement 6B</xref>). The use of principal <italic>components</italic> instead of principle <italic>curves</italic> as described previously was justified as both methods are indistinguishable when <italic>j</italic> = 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. Two modes are visible in both the histogram and KDE of the distribution of PC1 projected data when the KDE is computed using a Gaussian kernel and Silverman’s rule of thumb for bandwidth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref>] defined as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="613674v3_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> where, for this data set, <italic>σ</italic> is the standard deviation, <italic>d</italic> = 1 is the dimensionality, and <italic>n</italic> = 6560 is the number of observations. To test the significance of this distribution being bimodal rather than unimodal, we computed the critical bandwidth <italic>h</italic><sup><italic>*</italic></sup> defined as the minimum bandwidth for which the KDE has only one mode. Following Silverman’s test procedure, we computed a smoothed bootstrap across 2000 replicates by sampling the data with replacement and adding noise such that for any data point <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> and bootstrap resample <italic>b</italic>, we make noisy <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="613674v3_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> where ϵ<sub><italic>i,b</italic></sub> is a standard normal random variable independently drawn for each <italic>i</italic> and <italic>b</italic>. We found that the critical bandwidth <italic>h</italic><sup><italic>*</italic></sup> of our data set was significantly (p &lt; 0.001) greater than that of the bootstrapped data sets which allows us to reject the null hypothesis that the distribution of <bold><italic>z</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> is unimodal and justifies the use of a two-cluster model in classifying these data (<xref rid="fig2_S6" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – supplement 6C</xref>).</p>
<p>After confirming the bimodality of the data set, we classified patch encounters using a two-component Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to estimate <italic>p</italic>(<italic>y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 1 | <bold><italic>z</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>) where for each encounter, <italic>k</italic>, <bold><italic>z</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> are the log transforms of the duration and average velocity of the patch encounter, yk = 1 indicates an <italic>exploitation</italic>, and <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 0 indicates an <italic>exploration</italic> (<xref rid="fig2_S6" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – supplement 6D</xref>).

<title>Patch encounter classification as sensing or non-responding</title>
<p>To classify patch encounters as <italic>sensing</italic> or <italic>non-responding</italic> events, we computed animals’ 1) deceleration upon encounter with the patch edge, 2) minimum velocity during the patch encounter, and 3) maximum change in velocity between the peak velocity immediately prior to the start of the patch encounter and the minimum velocity during the encounter (<xref rid="fig2_S7" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – supplement 7A-B</xref>). Deceleration was defined as the slope of the line fit on an animal’s velocity between -1.5 seconds before and 6.5 seconds after the start of an encounter. Minimum velocity was defined as the absolute minimum velocity observed during the duration of the patch encounter. The maximum change in velocity was computed by subtracting the minimum velocity from the peak velocity within 10 seconds of the patch encounter. The combination of these three metrics reveals two non-Gaussian clusters confirmed by Silverman’s test (p = 0.003) as described in the previous section (<xref rid="fig2_S7" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – supplement 7C-F</xref>). These clusters represent encounters where animals sensed the patch (i.e., slow minimum velocity, large changes in velocity) or did not respond to it (i.e., maintained fast minimum velocity, with little to no change).</p>
<p>We estimated the probability of <italic>sensing <italic>p</italic>(<italic>v</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 1</italic> | <bold><italic>w</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>) where for each encounter, <italic>k, wk =</italic> (<italic>s</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>,<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>,<italic>u</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>) are the three velocity-related features, <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 1 indicates an encounter that was <italic>sensed</italic>, and <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 0 indicates an encounter where <italic>no response</italic> was detected. Using a semi-supervised approach to quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), we labeled a subset of all encounters and iteratively estimated labels on the remaining unlabeled data (<xref rid="fig2_S8" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – supplement 8A-C</xref>, Video 5). To label the data, we made two simple assumptions: 1) animals must have sensed the patch if they exploited it and 2) animals must not have sensed the patch if there was no bacteria to sense. Therefore, all encounters with bacteria-free patches (i.e., LB only, relative density 0) were labeled as true negatives <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 0 and, across 1000 replicates, we probabilistically included <italic>exploitation</italic> encounters <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> =1 estimated from the distribution <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>|<bold><italic>z</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> ∼ Bern <italic>p</italic>(<italic>y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 1 | <bold><italic>z</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>)as true positives <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 1. The semi-supervised QDA method then used these initial labels to iteratively fit a paraboloid that best separated the labeled data, by minimizing the posterior variance of classification. Using this approach, the conditional probability of <italic>sensing p (v</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 1|<bold><italic>w</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>) was estimated for all encounters using QDA and averaged across replicates (<xref rid="fig2_S8" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – supplement 8D-E</xref>).</p>
<p>Although we found that the two clusters were successfully discriminated by this semi-supervised QDA approach, a small subset of encounters (252 of 20109 encounters) could not be reliably classified in this manner as the onset of the patch encounter was not observed. This type of data censoring occurred when the behavioral recording was started after the animal had already entered the patch. Although we could compute deceleration-related metrics for these encounters with the assumption that the animal entered the patch at the first frame, these measurements are censored with a bias towards lower magnitudes of deceleration. Therefore, to better predict the conditional probabilities of <italic>sensing</italic> for these 252 encounters, we assumed that the minimum velocity on-patch <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> was a reliable metric and marginalized the conditional probabilities over the other two metrics (<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> and <italic>u</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>) as defined by
<disp-formula id="ueqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="613674v3_ueqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
We numerically integrated using an adaptive quadrature method over the product of the QDA estimated conditional probability distribution and the kernel density estimate of the joint probability distribution. This procedure resulted in a slight increase (μ= +0.0615, σ = 0.1832) in our estimation of the probability of <italic>sensing</italic> (<xref rid="fig2_S8" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – supplement 8F</xref>).</p>
<p>Altogether, this classification approach resulted in low false positive and false negative rates. Specifically, 3.35% of the time encounters with bacteria-free patches were incorrectly identified as <italic>sensing</italic> while 2.92% of the time <italic>exploitatory</italic> encounters were incorrectly identified as <italic>non-responding</italic>. Further, this classification removed many of the remaining near miss patch encounters in which animals came close to but did not truly enter the patch (see Patch encounter detection). For all analyses, we excluded near miss encounters where the animal’s midpoint never entered the patch and the probability of <italic>sensing</italic> was less than 5% (i.e., <italic>p</italic> (<italic>v</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 1|<bold>w</bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>) &lt; 0.05).</p>

<title>Models of exploitation probability</title>
<p>We consider that the probability of <italic>exploiting</italic> a patch upon any given encounter can be described by a logistic function:
<disp-formula id="ueqn4">
<graphic xlink:href="613674v3_ueqn4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>

where <italic>p</italic>(<italic>y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 1 | <bold><italic>β</italic></bold> · <bold><italic>x</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>)represents the conditional probability that an animal exploited during patch encounter <italic>k</italic>; <bold><italic>x</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> ∈ <italic>R</italic><sup><italic>n</italic></sup> is a vector of covariates; and <bold><italic>β</italic></bold> ∈ <italic>R</italic><sup><italic>n</italic></sup> is a vector of weights that describes how much each covariate influences the animal’s choice. In models compared here, <bold><italic>x</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> includes a combination of a constant element as well as covariates that may empirically influence the decision to exploit: 1) the log-transformed relative density of the encountered patch <italic>k</italic>(<italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>), 2) the duration of time spent off food since departing the last <italic>exploited</italic> patch (<italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>), 3) the log-transformed relative density of the patch encountered immediately before encounter <italic>k</italic> (<italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub>), and 4) the log-transformed relative density of the last <italic>exploited</italic> patch (<italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>).</p>
<p>The observations of <italic>exploitation</italic> and <italic>sensation</italic> for our data are derived predictions from classification models rather than direct measurements (see Patch encounter classification as exploration or exploitation and Patch encounter classification as sensing or non-responding). As such, the labels for both whether a patch encounter was <italic>sensed</italic> by the animal <italic>p</italic> (<italic>v</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 1|<bold><italic>w</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>) and whether the animal <italic>exploited</italic> the patch <italic>p</italic>(<italic>y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 1 | <bold><italic>z</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>), are both reported as probabilities rather than binary, deterministic variables.</p>
<p>To account for uncertainty in <italic>sensation</italic>, we produced 100 sets of “encounter sampled” observations wherein we probabilistically included <italic>sensed</italic> encounters <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 1 estimated from the distribution <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>|<bold><italic>w</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> <italic>∼</italic> Bern(<italic>p</italic>(<italic>v</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 1|<bold><italic>w</italic></bold><italic>k</italic>)). In doing so, we assume that only patch encounters recognized by the animal guide the decision to <italic>exploit</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). After removing <italic>non-responding</italic> encounters where <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 0, we defined observations of all covariates (i.e., <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>, <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>, <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub>, and <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>) using only <italic>sensed</italic> encounters.</p>
<p>To account for uncertainty in <italic>exploitation</italic> we modified the standard maximum likelihood. To understand our approach, consider that standard logistic regression models binary observations as realizations of the Bernoulli distribution <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>|<bold><italic>x</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> ∼ Bern(<italic>p y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 1| <bold><italic>β</italic></bold> · <bold><italic>x</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>)) and that the likelihood for this model is given by
<disp-formula id="ueqn5">
<graphic xlink:href="613674v3_ueqn5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
However, we do not have direct observations of <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> and cannot evaluate the logistic likelihood directly. Rather, we have posterior probabilities of <italic>exploitation</italic> determined by a classifier, denoted by <italic>p</italic>(<italic>y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 1 | <bold><italic>z</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>), where <bold><italic>z</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> are a set of velocity-related features that are distinct from <bold><italic>x</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> (see Patch encounter classification as exploration or exploitation). Thus, rather than maximizing the Bernoulli likelihood, we accommodate our uncertainty about <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> by learning the regression parameters that minimize the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between <italic>p</italic>(<italic>y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>| <bold><italic>β</italic></bold> · <bold><italic>x</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> and the reference probability distribution <italic>p</italic>(<italic>y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> | <bold><italic>z</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>)as given by

</disp-formula>
where <italic>C</italic><sub><bold><italic>β</italic></bold></sub> is a term that is constant with respect to <bold><italic>β</italic></bold>, and the second term is equivalent to the logarithm of the logistic likelihood with <italic>p</italic>(<italic>y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 1 | <bold><italic>z</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>)replacing <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>. Put plainly, minimizing the sum of the KL divergence between our classifier probabilities and logistic regression probabilities over all encounters <italic>k</italic> is equivalent to maximizing the logistic likelihood with our classifier-based <italic>exploitation</italic> probabilities <italic>p</italic>(<italic>y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 1 | <bold><italic>z</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>) as observations instead of direct measurements of <italic>exploitation y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> as given by

</disp-formula>
Notably, when there is no observation uncertainty <italic>p</italic>(<italic>y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 1 | <bold><italic>z</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>) collapses to a delta function on <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 1 and we recover the standard likelihood function. Thus, our method is a generalization of maximum likelihood. To train our model, we therefore fit a standard logistic regression GLM where we provided sets of observations of covariates <bold><italic>x</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> and response variables <italic>p</italic>(<italic>y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 1 | <bold><italic>z</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>) for <italic>sensed</italic> encounters.</p>
<p>The covariates <bold><italic>x</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> included the relative density of the encountered patch <italic>k</italic>(<italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>), the duration of time spent off food since departing the last <italic>exploited</italic> patch (<italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>), the relative density of the patch encountered immediately before encounter <italic>k</italic>(<italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>), and the relative density of the last <italic>exploited</italic> patch (<italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>). For every encounter <italic>k, ρ</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> is the log-transformed relative density of the encounter patch as estimated from experiments using fluorescent bacteria OP50-GFP (as described in Bacterial patch density estimation). <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> is the duration of time spent off food since the beginning of the recorded experiment (i.e., total time elapsed minus duration of time on patch). For the first patch encounter (i.e., <italic>k</italic> =1), this is equivalent to the total time elapsed. <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub> is the log-transformed relative density of the patch encountered immediately before encounter <italic>k</italic>. For the first patch encounter, we initialized this parameter using the approximated relative density of the bacterial patch on the acclimation plates (see Assay preparation and recording in Methods). Acclimation plates contained one large 200 µL patch seeded with OD<sub>600</sub> = 1 and grown for a total of ∼48 hours. The relative density of these acclimation plates was estimated using the same procedure used to estimate values of <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub> (see Bacterial patch density estimation). <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub> is the log-transformed relative density of the most recently <italic>exploited</italic> patch. For the first patch encounter as well as every encounter prior to the first observed <italic>exploitation</italic>, we assume that animals must have <italic>exploited</italic> within the last 24 hours while on the acclimation plates and thus initialized <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub> using the approximated relative density of the bacterial patch on the acclimation plates.</p>

<p>As described above, we used an “encounter sampling” protocol to generate 100 replicate observations of only <italic>sensed</italic> encounters by removing all encounters where <italic>sensing</italic> could not be determined (i.e., <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 0) as randomly estimated from the distribution <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>|<bold><italic>w</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> ∼ Bern(<italic>p</italic>(<italic>v</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 1|<bold><italic>w</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>). For example, we can consider an animal foraging in the single-density, multi-patch environment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Although we detected 10 total encounters <italic>K</italic> =<italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub>,<italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub>, …,<italic>k</italic><sub>10</sub>, several of these encounters had low probabilities of <italic>sensing p</italic>(<italic>v</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = 1|<bold><italic>w</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>).

Using only the data related to this new sequence of encounters <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="613674v3_inline4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, we generated a vector of covariates (i.e., <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>, <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>, <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub>, and <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>).

<title>Exploitation of sensory mutants in single-density, multi-patch environments</title>
<p>To test the utility of our model in identifying covariate-specific phenotypes in animals with varied genotypes, a novel data set of wild-type animals and sensory mutants foraging on single-density, multi-patch environments was generated (<xref rid="fig4_S5" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 - supplement 5A-B</xref>).

(D) Example body postures/orientations (black) of an animal during frames when its head is on the patch edge.

A histogram of this head-to-midpoint distance is plotted, and the median value (blue) is indicated (sample size: 220 animals; 74839 frames). The median head-to-midpoint distance was subsequently used as a threshold for detection of patch encounter and leaving events. For one example animal, the distance between the head (black) or midbody (blue) position and the nearest patch edge (positive = inside patch; negative = outside patch) is plotted for every time point. The edge of the patch (solid black line) and threshold for encounter detection (dashed -.- black line) are indicated. Putative patch encounter (green) and leaving (red) events are shown. (E) Example body postures/orientations of an animal when its head is on the patch. The distance between the midpoint of the animal and the patch edge (blue lines) was calculated. A histogram of this midpoint-to-patch distance is plotted, and the 1<sup>st</sup> percentile (blue) is indicated (sample size: 220 animals; 1571163 frames). This value is used as a threshold for excluding putative encounters where the animal’s midpoint never comes within 0.28768 mm of the patch edge. A 1.5 minute time window of the example animal’s position in (D) is shown.

A subset of putative off-patch events had low standard deviations matching those of on-patch events. A one-dimensional Gaussian mixture model was fit to the off-patch standard deviation values and a threshold was set where the posterior probability of events falling in the high or low variance cluster was 0.5.

<caption><title>Classifying encounters based on duration using a Gaussian mixture model.</title>
<p>(A) As in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, duration for each patch encounter (N = 419 events; 50 worms) was computed and classified as either short or long using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). The distributions of all observed short and long encounters are plotted with duration binned logarithmically. The probability density functions for the two component Gaussians are shown. (B) The posterior probabilities for classification as short or long are sorted for all encounters, highlighting the low posterior variance of the GMM. (C) Given that some patch encounters were not fully observed (i.e., ∼22% of animals were already on patch at the start of the recording and ∼96% of animals were on patch when the recording ended), we identified that ∼14% of observed patch durations were left-censored (i.e., having actual duration ≥ observed duration). Thus, to confirm findings in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E-F</xref>, we re-classified only non-censored observations where both the entry and exit of a patch encounter were observed. As in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, patch encounters for 50 individuals foraging in these patchy environments are plotted across time. Encounters that were uncensored (pink) and censored (gray) are indicated. (D) The distribution of the duration of only fully observed (uncensored) encounters (N = 360 events; 50 worms) is plotted. The component Gaussians for a GMM fitting this subset of data are shown. (E) Sorted posterior probabilities for the uncensored model are shown. (F) The observed start time of each uncensored patch encounter is shown for all short and long duration encounters. Long duration encounters occur significantly later (Mann-Whitney U-Test, ***p&lt;0.001). Violin plots show the KDE and quartiles for each duration type. (G) Posterior probabilities for classification in the long duration cluster are shown for the two models. The uncensored data model results in a slight increase in posterior probabilities of long duration classification but ultimately affected classification of only one of the 419 encounters.</p></caption>

<caption><title>Obtaining intensity profiles for fluorescent bacterial patches.</title>
<p>(A) Fluorescently labeled OP50-GFP bacterial patches were seeded onto agar plates under conditions matching those in the experimental assay. Small patches (0.5 µL) were pipetted in an isometric grid (6 mm center-to-center spacing) on a 16 x 25 mm rectangular template comparable to the one used in behavioral assays. Large patches (20 or 200 µL) were seeded directly onto agar plates. Brightfield and fluorescence images were acquired for every condition at multiple time points of bacterial growth. The fluorescence intensity profile of these images was obtained. (B) Due to uneven illumination within the field-of-view of our imaging system, matched fluorescence images of an empty agar plate were acquired at each time point. These “background” images were smoothed using a two-dimensional averaging filter to remove noise. (C) Fluorescence images of the bacterial patches were normalized to these background images. (D) Locations of bacterial patches within the template were automatically detected using image processing techniques. Each patch was then radially segmented in bins of equal area. The mean pixel intensity value for each bin was computed and used to create an intensity profile of the patch. (E) The patch border and peak were detected using signal processing techniques. Specifically, the patch border was identified by finding a peak in the curvature of the edge profile. Border amplitude was defined as the magnitude of the difference between the patch border and peak. Relative border amplitude was defined as the border amplitude divided by the exposure time. A line was fit to the values of relative border amplitude across numerous time points and experiment days (5 replicates shown as varying color points).</p></caption>

<p>Fluorescently-labeled OP50-GFP bacterial patches were imaged (as described in <xref rid="fig2_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – supplement 1</xref> and Bacterial patch density estimation). Inverted images (darker saturation = more bacteria) are shown here to highlight the range of bacterial densities tested in these experiments. All patches are shown on the same spatial scale and using one of the two linear saturation scales: 1) regular – normalized to show variance in high density patches; 2) augmented (∼22x) – normalized to show variance in low density patches). Each patch shown is labeled with the optical density (OD<sub>600</sub>) at time of seeding and the approximate amount of time bacteria was grown for at room temperature (i.e., 1, 12, or 48 hours).

<p>(A) Relative density of OP50-GFP bacterial patches matched to all assay conditions in this paper are shown. Relative density represents the relative border amplitude (as defined in <xref rid="fig2_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – supplement 1</xref> and Bacterial patch density estimation) normalized to the mean density of patches seeded with 0.5 µL of OD<sub>600</sub> = 10 grown for 1 hour on plates with peptone (blue asterisk). In this manner, the bacterial patches experienced by animals in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> have been set to an average relative density of 10. Violin plots show the KDE and quartiles for each condition. (B) Linear fits for the relative density of bacterial patches in each condition as a function of time are plotted. Saturation of each line corresponds to the relative density as depicted in (A). For each experimental plate, the relative density of bacterial patches was estimated by applying the coefficients from these linear regressions to the total amount of time the bacteria was grown at room temperature.</p></caption>

<p>(A) Values of log-likehood, Aikake Information Criterion (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) were computed for 50,000 replicates of the linear regression model described in Models of exploitation probability. The replicate-by-replicate difference in value of these metrics between the full model (i.e., <bold><italic>β</italic></bold> · <bold><italic>x</italic></bold><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> = <italic>β</italic><sub>0</sub>+<italic>β</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>+<italic>β</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub><italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>+<italic>β</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub>+<italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub> <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub> <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>) and every combination of covariate subsets is plotted here. Log-likelihood values less than zero and AIC or BIC values greater than zero indicate worse model performance of the partial term models as compared to the full model. Percentages indicate the proportion of replicates where the model performed best according to that criterion. Even using BIC, the strictest model criterion, the full model performs better than any other model on the majority of replicates.

Values for each metric at each replicate are colored to match their respective color bar. Metrics are shown for this subset of models to illustrate the addition of each covariate to the model.

<p>Understanding how neural circuits mediate decision-making is a core problem in neuroscience. In this interesting and <bold>important</bold> work, the authors use detailed behavioral analysis and rigorous quantitative modeling to <bold>convincingly</bold> support the idea that the nematode C. elegans uses an &quot;accept-reject&quot; behavioral strategy, based on learned features of its environment, to make decisions upon encountering food patches. The work expands our understanding of the behavioral repertoire of this species, providing a foundation for future mechanistic studies in this powerful model system.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work uses a novel, ethologically relevant behavioral task to explore decision-making paradigms in C. elegans foraging behavior. By rigorously quantifying multiple features of animal behavior as they navigate in a patch food environment, the authors provide strong evidence that worms exhibit one of three qualitatively distinct behavioral responses upon encountering a patch: (1) &quot;search&quot;, in which the encountered patch is below the detection threshold; (2) &quot;sample&quot;, in which animals detect a patch encounter and reduce their motor speed, but do not stay to exploit the resource and are therefore considered to have &quot;rejected&quot; it; and (3) &quot;exploit&quot;, in which animals &quot;accept&quot; the patch and exploit the resource for tens of minutes. Interestingly, the probability of these outcomes varies with the density of the patch as well as the prior experience of the animal. Together, these experiments provide an interesting new framework for understanding the ability of the C. elegans nervous system to use sensory information and internal state to implement behavioral state decisions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work uses a novel, neuroethologically-inspired approach to studying foraging behavior</p>
<p>The studies are carried out with an exceptional level of quantitative rigor and attention to detail</p>
<p>Powerful quantitative modeling approaches including GLMs are used to study the behavioral states that worms enter upon encountering food, and the parameters that govern the decision about which state to enter</p>
<p>The work provides strong evidence that C. elegans can make 'accept-reject' decisions upon encountering a food resource</p>
<p>Accept-reject decisions depend on the quality of the food resource encountered as well as on internally represented features that provide measurements of multiple dimensions of internal state, including feeding status and time.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study by Haley et al, the authors investigated explore-exploit foraging using C. elegans as a model system. Through an elegant set of patchy environment assays, the authors built a GLM based on past experience that predicts whether an animal will decide to stay on a patch to feed and exploit that resource, instead of choosing to leave and explore other patches.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>I really enjoyed reading this paper. The experiments are simple and elegant, and address fundamental questions of foraging theory in a well-defined system. The experimental design is thoroughly vetted, and the authors provide a considerable volume of data to prove their points.</p>
<p>Weakness:</p>
<p>History-dependence of the GLM. The logistic GLM seems like a logical way to model a binary choice, and I think the parameters you chose are certainly important. However, the framing of them seem odd to me. I do not doubt the animals are assessing the current state of the patch with an assessment of past experience; that makes perfect logical sense. However, it seems odd to reduce past experience to the categories of recently exploited patch, recently encountered patch, and time since last exploitation. This implies the animals have some way of discriminating these past patch experiences and committing them to memory. Also, it seems logical that the time on these patches, not just their density, should also matter, just as the time without food matters. Time is inherent to memory. This model also imposes a prior categorization in trying to distinguish between sensed vs. not-sensed patches, which I criticized earlier. Only &quot;sensed&quot; patches are used in the model, but it is questionable whether worms genuinely do not &quot;sense&quot; these patches.</p>
<p>It seems more likely the worm simply has some memory of chemosensation and relative satiety, both of which increase on patches, and decrease while off of patches. The magnitudes are likely a function of patch density. That being said, I leave it up to the reader to decide how best to interpret the data.</p>
<p>Impact:</p>
<p>I think this work will have a solid impact on the field, as it provides tangible variables to test how animals assess their environment and decide to exploit resources. I think the strength of this research could be strengthened by a reassessment of their model that would both simplify it and provide testable timescales of satiety/starvation memory.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work uses a novel, ethologically relevant behavioral task to explore decision-making paradigms in C. elegans foraging behavior. By rigorously quantifying multiple features of animal behavior as they navigate in a patch food environment, the authors provide strong evidence that worms exhibit one of three qualitatively distinct behavioral responses upon encountering a patch: (1) &quot;search&quot;, in which the encountered patch is below the detection threshold; (2) &quot;sample&quot;, in which animals detect a patch encounter and reduce their motor speed, but do not stay to exploit the resource and are therefore considered to have &quot;rejected&quot; it; and (3) &quot;exploit&quot;, in which animals &quot;accept&quot; the patch and exploit the resource for tens of minutes. Interestingly, the probability of these outcomes varies with the density of the patch as well as the prior experience of the animal. Together, these experiments provide an interesting new framework for understanding the ability of the C. elegans nervous system to use sensory information and internal state to implement behavioral state decisions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work uses a novel, neuroethologically-inspired approach to studying foraging behavior</p>
<p>The studies are carried out with an exceptional level of quantitative rigor and attention to detail</p>
<p>Powerful quantitative modeling approaches including GLMs are used to study the behavioral states that worms enter upon encountering food, and the parameters that govern the decision about which state to enter</p>
<p>The work provides strong evidence that C. elegans can make 'accept-reject' decisions upon encountering a food resource</p>
<p>Accept-reject decisions depend on the quality of the food resource encountered as well as on internally represented features that provide measurements of multiple dimensions of internal state, including feeding status and time</p>

My only criticisms have to do with the data interpretation, which I think are easily addressable.</p>

<p>Model design: We agree with the reviewer that past experience is not likely to be discretized into the exact parameters of our model. We have added to our manuscript to further clarify this point (lines 645-647). Investigating the mechanisms behind this behavior is beyond the scope of this project but is certainly an exciting trajectory for future <italic>C. elegans</italic> research.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>osm-6</p>
<p>The argument is that osm-6 animals can't sense food very well, so when they sense it, they enter the exploitation state by default. That is what they appear to do, but why? Clearly they are sensing the food in some other way, correct? Are ciliated neurons the only way worms can sense food? Don't they also actively pump on food, and can therefore sense the food entering their pharynx? I think you could provide further insight by commenting on this. Perhaps your decision model is dependent on comparing environmental sensing with pharyngeal sensing? Food intake certainly influences their decision, no? Perhaps food intake triggers exploitation behavior, which can be over-run by chemo/mechanosensory information?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>osm-6 behavior: We thank the reviewer for pointing out the need to further elaborate on a mechanistic hypothesis to explain the behavior of osm-6 sensory mutants. We agree with the reviewer’s speculation that post-ingestive and other non-ciliary sensory cues likely drive detection of food. We have added additional commentary to our manuscript to state this (lines 529-538).</p>

<p>Impact</p>
<p>I think this work will have a solid impact on the field, as it provides tangible variables to test how animals assess their environment and decide to exploit resources. I think the strength of this research could be strengthened by a reassessment of their model that would both simplify it and provide testable timescales of satiety/starvation memory.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>The authors have addressed most of my concerns.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>The authors provide a considerable amount of processed data (great, thank you!), but it would be even better if they provided the raw data of the worm coordinates, and when and where these coordinates overlapped with patches. This is the raw data that was ultimately used for all the quantifications in the paper, and would be incredibly useful to readers who are interested in modeling the data themselves.</p>
<p>This should not be prohibitive.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Data Availability: We thank the reviewer for pointing out this need. We are uploading all processed data (e.g. worm coordinates relative to the arena and patches) to a curated data storage server. We have updated our data availability statement to state this (lines 684-688).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Search vs. sample &amp; sensing vs. non-sensing.</p>
<p>The different definitions of behaviors in Figures 2H-K are a bit confusing. I think the confusion stems in part from the changing terms and color associations in Figures 2 H-K. Essentially the explore density in Figure 2 H is split into two densities based on the two densities (sensing vs. non-responding) observed in Figure 2I. In turn, the sensing density in Figure 2I is split into two densities (explore vs exploit) based on the two densities observed in Figure 2 H. But the way the figures are colored, yellow means search (Figure 2H) and non-responding (Figure 2I), green means exploit (Figure 2H) which includes sensing and non-responding, but also exclusively sensing (Figure 2I), and blue consistently means exploit in both figures. It might help to use two different color codes for Figures 2H and 2I, and then in 2J you define search as explore AND non-responding, sample as explore AND sensing, and exploit as exploit.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Color schema: While we understand the confusion, we believe that introducing additional colors may also present some misunderstandings. We have decided to leave the figure as it is.</p>
