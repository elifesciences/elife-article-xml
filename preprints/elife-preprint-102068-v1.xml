<title>Abstract</title><p>Alveolar macrophages (AMs) reside in the lower airways and play a crucial role in lung health and response to sterile inflammation and infections. AMs possess remarkable adaptability to different environmental challenges that can persist through their memory capacity (trained immunity). β-glucan has been characterized as a potent inducer of trained immunity by reprogramming hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow generating trained innate cells with enhanced responsiveness. In the present study, we show that systemic administration of β-glucan reprograms alveolar macrophages (AMs) in the lung via neutrophils and IFNγ signalling, in a Dectin1-independent manner. We furthermore demonstrate that AM reprogramming at both the transcriptional and metabolic levels exacerbate lung injury following bacterial (LPS) or viral (polyI:C) challenges. These findings identify an additional facet of β-glucan in trained immunity involving AM reprogramming and shed light on the potential detrimental effects of trained immunity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sepsis, a life-threatening condition resulting from the host’s overwhelming response to infection, continues to pose significant challenges in clinical management and remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Among the various triggers of sepsis, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, is a potent inducer of systemic inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Excessive inflammation associated with sepsis causes tissue damage, organ dysfunction, and ultimately, mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Thus, the magnitude of inflammatory responses must be regulated to resolve infections while preventing collateral tissue damage. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the regulation of inflammation in sepsis is essential for the development of effective therapeutic interventions. Key players in this regulatory network include various immune cells, cytokines, and signalling pathways, which collectively modulate the intensity and duration of inflammatory responses. Dysregulation of these mechanisms can lead to either persistent inflammation or immunosuppression, both of which contribute to the pathogenesis of sepsis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The constant exposure of the lungs to a non-sterile environment leads to the development of a unique immunity by eliminating inhaled foreign particles while minimizing inflammatory-mediated tissue damage. Resident alveolar macrophages (AMs) serve a crucial regulatory function to maintain the delicate balance between inflammation and protecting lung tissue from damage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. AMs originate from fetal liver monocytes and act as vigilant sentinels protecting the airways against invading pathogens and pollutants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Thus, AMs play a pivotal role in orchestrating both the initiation and resolution of immune responses within the lung microenvironment.</p>
<p>Adaptations in innate immune cells are diverse with substantial plasticity to various insults that can be maintained resulting in enhanced (trained immunity) or reduced (tolerance) inflammatory responses to a second stimuli <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Trained immunity is mediated <italic>via</italic> long-term metabolic reprogramming and epigenetic modifications, which can be induced by various stimuli such as the attenuated mycobacteria Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) or β-glucan (a polysaccharidic component of fungi cell wall)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. BCG and β-glucan are able to train monocytes and neutrophils with beneficial impact in cancer or infections <italic>via</italic> the reprogramming of haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) within the bone marrow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. However, there are substantial knowledge gaps in our understanding of trained immunity within tissue-resident macrophages (TRMs) and its regulatory role in maintaining tissue homeostasis under stress conditions. For instance, while the initial LPS-stimulation of macrophages induces a strong inflammatory responses via TLR-4, restimulation with LPS generates tolerance in these macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Thus, the epigenetic reprogramming of innate immune cells and their subsequent responses depends on two signals: the initial training agent and the nature of the second stimuli at an inflammatory site. Here we showed that systemic administration of β-glucan can reprogram AMs in the lungs via neutrophil/type II IFN axis but independent of Dectin-1 signalling. The unique transcriptomic and metabolic profile of AMs render them hyperresponsive to both bacterial or viral stimulation causing dysregulated inflammatory responses with pulmonary damage. The differences in the systemic basal levels of β-glucan in sepsis patients as well as the pulmonary levels of IFNγ can be major factors in determining the hyperresponsiveness in sepsis patients and can be potentially targeted for therapy.</p>

<title>β-glucan-mediated trained immunity aggravates LPS-induced ALI</title>
<p>To investigate whether systemic administration of β-glucan induces trained immunity within the lung, we sought to assess its impact on Acute Lung Injury (ALI) triggered by LPS treatment. We initially evaluated the consequences of β-glucan-mediated training on ALI by administering LPS seven days after training (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). ALI assessment conducted 24 hours post-LPS instillation did not reveal any discernible distinctions attributable to the initial i.p. β-glucan injection. However, ALI was notably exacerbated in mice that had undergone β-glucan training upon subsequent LPS stimulation as demonstrated non-invasively by lung microCT scanners with regards to the increased proportion of poorly- or non-aerated lung segment and to a significant increase in Hounsfield units (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Hounsfield units reflect a coefficient of tissue attenuation and, by extrapolation, tissue composition. Consistent findings were corroborated through two complementary invasive evaluations of ALI. Specifically, the heightened alveolar-capillary permeability following LPS instillation in β-glucan-trained mice was substantiated by elevated lung Evans blue dye concentrations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Histological examination further unveiled a spectrum of notable alterations following LPS instillation, including cellular infiltration, thickened alveolar walls, and the formation of hyaline membranes, observed in β-glucan-trained mice and not PBS controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). The observed cell infiltration 24 hours after LPS instillation was due to a significant recruitment of neutrophils, as assessed in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL; CD11b<sup>+</sup>Ly6G<sup>+</sup>). Strikingly, the frequency and total numbers of neutrophils was doubled in the β-glucan-treated mice, after LPS administration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Concomitant with the increased neutrophil recruitment, CXCL1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> was significantly increased in β-glucan-treated mice when compared to control mice after LPS treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Amplified ALI in β-glucan-trained mice was also associated with increased proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNFα) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G-H</xref>). As AMs are major producers of CXCL1, IL6 and TNFα, we next assessed whether β-glucan increased the proportion or number of AMs and found no significant differences between naïve and β-glucan trained mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). This suggests that that enhanced cytokine production was not due to an increased number of AMs, but rather intrinsic functional changes.</p>

<p>Next, we examined whether the effects of β-glucan-induced immune training persisted in ALI severity. To do so, we administered β-glucan or PBS (control) in mice and after 28 days challenged them with LPS (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). Similar to the 7-day timeframe of β-glucan training, there was increased endothelial permeability of the lungs (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>), and increased immunopathology (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>) in 28-days β-glucan mice challenged with LPS. This increased ALI in β-glucan treated mice after 28 days was associated with a higher concentration of CXCL1, IL6 and TNFα (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1D</xref>) and increased neutrophil infiltration in BAL (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1E</xref>) following LPS instillation. The frequency and number of AMs were not changed between groups (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1F</xref>). Increased production of cytokines was also observed upon <italic>ex</italic> vivo stimulation of AMs isolated from treated mice 28-day post-β-glucan (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1G-H</xref>). Thus, the intrinsic functional changes in AMs suggest that the exacerbation of ALI induced by β-glucan triggered a long-term reprogramming of immune cells rather than an additive effect of lingering inflammation from β-glucan injection. To assess whether this response was specific to bacterial LPS or viral agonists can cause similar responses, we next challenged β-glucan trained mice with a TLR-3 agonist (poly(I:C)) (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>). Similar to the LPS-model, β-glucan treated mice had heightened poly(I:C)-induced ALI shown via increased alveolar-capillary permeability, tissue damage, pro-inflammatory cytokine, and neutrophil infiltration (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2B-E</xref>). In the poly(I:C) model, the number of AMs was also unchanged among groups (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2F</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that systemic β-glucan can maintain a long-term reprogramming in innate immune cells promoting ALI.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>β-glucan augmented ALI is mediated via AM</title>
<p>Although there were no differences in the frequency or absolute number of AMs between β-glucan-treated and control mice, the early heightened response with increased CXCL1 production and the recruitment of neutrophils indicate that the AMs are engaged in the exacerbation of ALI induced by β-glucan. To further characterize the role of these cells in ALI, we locally depleted AMs using intranasally administered clodronate liposomes 2 days before performing the LPS instillation, which is at its peak of AM depletion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Depletion of AMs significantly reduced the production of cytokines TNFα, IL-6, and CXCL1 and the recruitment of neutrophils in BAL, which abolished the β-glucan-induced ALI (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B-D</xref>). To further confirm that tissue-resident AMs are responsible for the increased β-glucan-induced ALI, we used <italic>Csf2rb<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>), which do not naturally develop alveolar macrophages throughout their lifespan but maintain regular levels of bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) and interstitial macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Similar to the AM depletion, the production of cytokines and neutrophil recruitment in BAL was similar between β-glucan treated and control <italic>Csf2rb<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice after LPS administration. Importantly, there was no difference in ALI, as similar levels of proteins were measured in the BAL of β-glucan treated and control <italic>Csf2rb<sup>-/-</sup></italic> after the LPS challenge (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F-H</xref>).</p>

<p>To complement these loss-of-function experiments with a gain-of-function, we adoptively transferred AMs from adult WT control (PBS) or trained (β-glucan) mice to day 2 <italic>Csf2rb<sup>-/-</sup></italic> pups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>) and after 6 weeks challenged these mice with LPS. Remarkably, mice replenished with AMs from β-glucan-trained mice displayed an increased in production of inflammatory cytokines and the recruitment of neutrophils into the BAL (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref>, L). This was associated with increased ALI as they had higher protein levels in their BAL compared to mice who received control AMs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>). Collectively, our data demonstrate that the exacerbation of LPS-induced ALI in β-glucan-trained mice is mediated through AMs, mainly via functional reprogramming rather than a change in quantity or proportion.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>β-glucan reprograms AM</title>
<p>Our findings indicate that β-glucan reprograms AMs causing an increased response to LPS and subsequently enhanced ALI. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the transcriptional state of AMs after seven days training with β-glucan <italic>in vivo</italic>, which were then stimulated with/without LPS <italic>ex vivo</italic> LPS. The rationale for using an <italic>ex vivo</italic> system was to ensure that AMs are uniformly stimulated with LPS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>

<p>Principal component analysis (PCA) of all expressed genes across the four conditions revealed that control and β-glucan trained AMs had distinct transcriptional profiles (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). More precisely, the 4 different conditions explained the largest variance as they spread out across the first principal component (PC), while the variation within replicates was associated to the second and third PC. Next, we investigated the effect of β-glucan trained AMs by comparing the differential gene expression between control and β-glucan treated mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). We found 88 differentially expressed genes (32 up-regulated and 56 down-regulated, with a false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted p value &lt; 0.05 and a log2fold-change cut-off of 1). Despite that only few genes were differentially expressed, gene ontology analysis indicated a strong enrichment of genes involved in innate immune response and defense response to virus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Interestingly, LPS response genes were downregulated in β-glucan-treated mice suggesting that, in response to β-glucan, the LPS response pathway is attenuated or less activated. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) additionally revealed an increase of genes involved in IFNα but a significant decrease of genes involved in TNFα signalling (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we explored how <italic>ex vivo</italic> stimulated AMs responded to LPS using the same differential gene expression analysis. LPS altered the expression of 525 genes (FDR &gt;0.05 log2FC &gt;1.5) with the up regulation of 438 genes including numerous pro-inflammatory genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). As expected, gene ontology analyses revealed that these genes were involved in cellular response to LPS, inhibition of viral genome replication, production of interleukin-1β and cellular response to IL-1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). Additional analysis of GSEA indicated up-regulation of genes involved in TNFα signalling (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>), indicating that LPS and β-glucan both induce interferon responses but have opposite effects on the TNF response pathway.</p>
<p>To delineate how β-glucan training of AMs may affect the subsequent response to LPS, we then compared the fold change of gene expression in response to LPS stimulation between β-glucan trained and untrained AMs. Notably, we observed an upregulation of genes associated with the LPS response (depicted in blue) in the β-glucan trained group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>). This heightened response included a significant increase in the expression of IL-6, IL-1, TNF, and other genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>, J). This increased response to LPS by β-glucan-trained AMs was confirmed at the protein level as they exhibited increased <italic>ex vivo</italic> production of CXCL1 and TNFα (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>). Such an increased response to LPS was also obtained in AMs after 28 days β-glucan training (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1G</xref>). We also observed similar trends in genes associated with the defense response to viruses (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2G</xref>) which is in line with our findings showing an increased ALI to poly(I:C) (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2B-D</xref>). Taken together, β-glucan reprograms AMs to respond robustly to LPS stimulation.</p>
<p>As trained immunity is associated with metabolic rewiring, we next assessed if β-glucan-induced training modified the AM’s metabolic state. Genes involved in both oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis were up-regulated during response to LPS in β-glucan-trained AMs compared to untrained AMs but not at the steady state (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3L</xref>). The Seahorse assay showed while only mitochondrial respiration was increased in β-glucan-trained AMs at the steady state, both mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis were increased during the response to LPS in β-glucan-trained AMs, (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3M</xref>). Taken together, β-glucan functionally reprograms AMs by rewiring their transcriptomic and metabolic states.</p>

<title>IFNγ signaling and neutrophils are required for AM reprogramming</title>
<p>Dectin-1 is the receptor that recognizes β-glucan and is involved in mediating the biological effects of β-glucan-induced training in most cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. To assess the role of Dectin-1 in β-glucan increased LPS-induced ALI, we used the same experimental setup using Dectin-1 deficient mice (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>). Surprisingly, the increased neutrophil infiltration and pro-inflammatory cytokine production in BAL were maintained in β-glucan-treated <italic>Dectin-1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice and there was no change in the AM numbers (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3B-D</xref>).

Similar to wild-type AMs, the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines CXCL1 and TNFα was increased in β-glucan-trained Dectin1-deficient AMs after LPS stimulation (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3F</xref>). This indicates that β-glucan-induced AMs reprogramming is Dectin-1-independent and that AMs are trained via a different signalling pathway. Since we observed type I IFN gene expression is increased in AMs after β-glucan treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>) and type I IFN was previously reported to be involved in AMs training<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, we next assessed the impact of β-glucan on AMs reprogramming in <italic>IfnaR<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, which lack type I IFN signalling (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3G</xref>). Similar to Dectin-1 deficient mice, increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to LPS by β-glucan-treated <italic>IfnaR<sup>-/-</sup></italic> AMs was maintained, demonstrating that β-glucan-induced AMs reprogramming is type I IFN-independent (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3H</xref>).</p>

<p>Considering the concentration of IFNγ was significantly increased in BAL at day 1 post-β-glucan administration, which was associated with the increased number of neutrophils (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G-J</xref>), we next assess the direct role of IFNγ in training of AMs by β-glucan. We selectively depleted IFNγ prior to β-glucan administration <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref>), and found the production of inflammatory cytokines (CXCL1 and TNFα) was significantly reduced in β-glucan trained AMs. Similarly, the depletion of neutrophils prior to β-glucan treatment in mice resulted in significant reduction in inflammatory cytokines in β-glucan trained AMs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4L</xref>). These findings indicate that β-glucan reprograms AMs via IFNγ- and neutrophils-dependent manner.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The evolving field of trained immunity has challenged the boundaries we once drew to discern between the innate and adaptive immune systems. The discovery that the innate immune system can be ‘trained’ to retain memory-like features has provided novel avenues for prophylactic and therapeutic strategies. The use of an adjuvant like β-glucan has been investigated as an anti-infection agent in acute infections or inflammatory conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> as well as an anti-cancer treatment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. While we and others have shown that β-glucan can induce central trained immunity by functionally reprogramming the hematopoietic stem cell compartment in the bone marrow, the present study highlights an additional facet of β-glucan’s immunomodulatory effects on residential immune cells. Here we show that a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of β-glucan can induce trained immunity in the lung alveolar macrophages and functionally reprograms AMs at both the transcriptional and metabolic levels. These findings underscore the occurrence of tissue-specific immune training following systemic treatment, demonstrating processes of β-glucan-mediated peripheral trained immunity occurring in parallel with central immunity. We subsequently demonstrate that β-glucan trained AMs can be detrimental after LPS or poly(I:C) administration causing severe ALI. Thus, this study is shedding light on the deleterious effects of trained immunity and its impact on immunopathology, which is incompletely understood.</p>
<p>There are several key features in trained immunity, including shifts in epigenetic and transcriptomic profiles after initial stimulation that returns to steady states. However, this epigenetic and metabolic remodeling result in long-term memory with heightened responses to diverse secondary stimulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Therefore, two signals are required for the induction of trained immunity: signal 1, which is essential for reprogramming innate immune cells, and signal 2, an environmental cue critical for activating their functional capacity. In this study, we provide evidence supporting this conceptual framework.</p>
<p>β-glucan-trained AMs were able to generate a robust response both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> to bacterial (LPS) or viral (poly(I:C)) ligands. The increased response in β-glucan-trained AM was maintained up to 28 days, which is an indication of long-term reprogramming of AMs. The reprogramming of trained AMs was supported by significant alterations in both the transcriptomic and metabolic states. Using adoptive transfer experiments, we then showed that the functional reprogramming of β-glucan trained AMs persisted even in the absence of the initial systemic β-glucan administration. This finding highlights the persistence of the intrinsic training program in AMs.</p>
<p>AMs are originated from yolk sac and fetal liver monocytes, which seeds the lung as soon as we take our first breath of air <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Importantly, AMs are the first immune cell to response to any particles or pathogens that reach the lower airways of the lungs, thus alterations in their functional capacity can significantly impact subsequent immune responses. For instance, given AMs are in direct contact with surfactant (produced by alveolar type 2 epithelial cells) and invading pathogens, a defect in GM-CSF or TGFβ signalling leads to accumulation of surfactant (alveolar proteinosis) and increased susceptibility to pulmonary infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. AMs are able to sense and integrate multiple environmental signals - such as pH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, osmolarity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, metabolites including fatty acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, extracellular membrane components and danger signals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> – to maintain tissue homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. However, the mechanisms underlying their ability to adapt to environmental stimuli while maintaining lung tissue homeostasis without impairing gas exchange is largely unknown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. AMs exhibit a remarkable plasticity, demonstrating a spectrum of functional polarization that ranges from regulatory to pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory states. For instance, AM anti-inflammatory polarization in a LPS model of sepsis was TNFα dependent, as AMs exposed to TNFα exhibited diminished phagocytosis, superoxide anion (O2-) and CXCL1 production, with reduced neutrophils recruitment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Consequently, these mice had a reduction in lung clearance of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection. Influenza virus was able to induce similar anti-inflammatory function in AMs with decreased CXCL1 production and neutrophils recruitment via type I IFN pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, leading to an increased susceptibility to super bacterial infection. On the other hand, AMs appear to be more resistant to polarization towards a pro-inflammatory state <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. A recent study demonstrated that exposure of lungs to ambient amount of LPS trains AMs in type I IFN dependent, but type II IFN and T cell independent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. However, in our model system, systemic administration of β-glucan trains AMs in a type II IFN dependent, but type I IFN independent manner. Similarly, in live infection models, we and others have identified IFNγ signaling a key player in AM training after BCG vaccination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, influenza infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, pneumococcal infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> and intranasal infection with an adenoviral vector <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Although we have not identified which cells produce IFNγ in the β-glucan model, it has been demonstrated by our group and others that following BCG vaccination, CD4+ T cells are the major source of IFNγ <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, whereas after pulmonary adenovirus infection, CD8+ T cells predominantly produce IFNγ <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Influenza infection has also been described to induce IFNγ-dependent AM training with NK cells being the major source <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Interestingly, we found that neutrophils were also required for β-glucan-mediated AMs training. It has been shown that β-glucan can reprogram HSCs to promote granulopoiesis and the generation of trained neutrophils <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Although we have shown that the recruitment of these trained neutrophils into the lung was required for training AMs, the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in this dialogue is unknown and requires further investigation. Interestingly, we have recently demonstrated that, in addition to GM-CSF and TGFβ signalling, neutrophils are critical for AMs self-renewal and maintenance during early lung development <italic>via</italic> the production of 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. The absence of 12-HETE leads to a significant reduction in the number AMs in adult lungs, enhanced senescence, and consequently increased susceptibility to IAV or SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, there might be a constant bidirectional dialogue between neutrophils and AMs, with neutrophils providing cues from internal organelles to AMs, and AMs offering signals from the external environment to neutrophils, which then return to their graveyard in the BM.</p>
<p>Although we have not directly tested the contribution of circulating monocytes in the initial reprogramming of AMs via β-glucan, the persistence of trained immunity by adoptively transferred AMs into <italic>Csf2rb<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice suggests that the maintenance of the trained AM state was independent of bone marrow derived monocytes. Additionally, the findings from Theobald <italic>et al</italic> indicate that Dectin-1 is the receptor responsible for recognizing β-glucan which has been shown to activate macrophages and induce trained immunity in several models <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Here we found that β-glucan-mediated AM training, when administered systemically, was independent of Dectin-1. There are two potential explanations for this observation. First, it has been shown that β-glucan can also activate signaling via other TLRs, particularly TLR2 or complement receptor 3 (CR3) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, and second as the β-glucan is a particulate, its internalization by phagocytes can also initiate signaling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Additionally, our understanding of how administration of β-glucan in peritoneal cavity leads to HSCs training in the BM and AMs training in thoracic cavity is extremely limited. Thus, addressing the molecular mechanisms of β-glucan signaling pathways (e.g., Dectin1-dependent and independent) in both immune and non-immune cells, as well as its mode of action (e.g., direct access to an organ versus indirect effects via systemic release of cytokines), is necessary to delineate the deleterious versus protective effects of β-glucan-mediated trained immunity.</p>
<p>β-glucan is present in the cell wall of all fungi but will vary between different species and strains. In fact, the differential 1,3 to 1,6 glycosidic branching and molecular weight significantly impacts the response to the compound with a large variability of scientific findings contingent on the type of β-glucan used in a study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Fungi make up a portion of the human microbiome, termed the mycobiome. Several studies have described a high mycotic diversity between different populations, and even significant variability within an individual overtime <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. The variance in gut colonization by fungal species can moreover cause gut dysbiosis which has been associated with poorer outcomes during SARS-CoV-2 infection, sepsis and cancer immunotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. It is tempting to postulate that the levels of the mycobiome as well as its composition can influence subsequent immune reactions partly due to a distinct β-glucan makeup. In fact, antibodies to various types of β-glucan was detected in adult sera with different levels correlating with a person’s occupation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Thus, the quantity and quality of circulating β-glucan in an individual at steady state can remarkably affect the subsequent immune responses to sterile or microbial inflammation. This mechanism(s) provides a basis for host response heterogeneity in sepsis-induced ALI and how basal levels of β-glucan can play a role in excessive inflammation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Understanding these underlying processes may provide important insights for developing novel therapeutic approaches in sepsis.</p>

<title>RNA-seq data analysis</title>
<p>RNA-seq reads were aligned to the Mus musculus genome from Ensembl version 99 using STAR (version 2.7.3a) was used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. All regions overlapped between referenced exons and alignments were counted using featureCounts (subread-1.6.4)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. Low abundance genes were filtered out leaving 12,894 genes for subsequent analysis.</p>
<p>Differential expression analyses were performed using the DESeq2 package (DESeq2 1.40.2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. Gene ontology analysis was realized with the R package TopGO. For gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) a ranked list of the differentially expressed genes was used with clusterProfiler v4.8.2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>, and the Molecular Signatures Database MSigDB v7.5.1.</p>

<title>Extracellular flux analysis</title>
<p>Seahorse assay of isolated cells was performed as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Real-time OCRs of AMs were measured in XF medium (non-buffered RPMI containing 2 mM l-glutamine, 25 mM glucose and 1 mM sodium pyruvate) using a Seahorse Xfe 96 Analyzer (Agilent Technologies). For the mitochondrial stress test, mitochondrial inhibitors oligomycin (1.5 µM), fluorocarbonyl cyanide phenylhydrazone (FCCP) (1 µM), antimycin A and rotenone (0.5 µM) were used as per the manufacturer’s recommendations. In brief, cells were seeded at a density of 100,000 cells per well and 3 basal measurements were taken. Following this, two consecutive measurements were taken following each injection of oligomycin, FCCP and antimycin A with rotenone. All measurements were normalized to cell number using crystal violet dye extraction assay. Oxygen consumption curves, OCRs and ECARs were generated using Wave Desktop 2.3 (Agilent Technologies).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The concept that trained immunity, as defined, can be beneficial to subsequent immune challenges is important in the broad context of health and disease. The significance of this manuscript is the finding that trained immunity is actually a two-edged sword, herein, detrimental in the context of LPS-induced Acute Lung Injury that is mediated by AMs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Several lines of evidence in different mouse models support this conclusion. The postulation that differences in immune responses in individuals are linked to differences in the mycobiome and consequent B-glucan makeup is provocative.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The findings that the authors state are relevant to sepsis, are actually confined to a specific lung injury model and not classically-defined sepsis. In addition, the ontogeny of the reprogrammed AMs is uncertain. Links in the proposed signaling pathways need to be strengthened.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Prével et al. present an in vivo study in which they reveal an interesting aspect of β-glucan, a known inducer of enhanced immune responses termed trained immunity in sterile inflammation. The authors can show, that β-glucan's can reprogram alveolar macrophages (AMs) in the lungs through neutrophils and IFNγ signaling and independent of Dectin1. This reprogramming occurs at both transcriptional and metabolic levels. After β-glucan training, LPS-induced sterile inflammation exacerbated acute lung injury via enhanced immunopathology. These findings highlight a new aspect of β-glucan's role in trained immunity and its potential detrimental effects when enhanced pathogen clearance is not required.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) This manuscript is well-written and effectively conveys its message.</p>
<p>(2) The authors provide important evidence that β-glucan training is not solely beneficial, but depending on the context can also enhance immunopathology. This will be important to the field for two reasons. It shows again, that trained immunity can also be harmful. Jentho et al. 2021 have already provided further evidence for this aspect. And it highlights anew that LPS application is an insufficient infection model.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Only a little physiological data is provided by the in vivo models.</p>
<p>(2) The effects in histology appear to be rather weak.</p>
