<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Acyl-Coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) thioesters are compartmentalized intermediates that participate in in multiple metabolic reactions within the mitochondrial matrix. The limited availability of free CoA (CoASH) in the matrix raises the question of how the local acyl-CoA concentration is regulated to prevent trapping of CoASH from overload of any specific substrate. Acyl-CoA thioesterase-2 (ACOT2) hydrolyzes long-chain acyl-CoAs to their constituent fatty acids and CoASH, and is the only mitochondrial matrix ACOT refractory to inhibition by CoASH. Thus, we reasoned that ACOT2 may constitutively regulate matrix acyl-CoA levels. <italic>Acot2</italic> deletion in murine skeletal muscle (SM) resulted in acyl-CoA build-up when lipid supply and energy demands were modest. When energy demand and pyruvate availability were elevated, lack of ACOT2 activity promoted glucose oxidation. This preference for glucose over fatty acid oxidation was recapitulated in C2C12 myotubes with acute depletion of <italic>Acot2</italic>, and overt inhibition of β-oxidation was demonstrated in isolated mitochondria from <italic>Acot2</italic>-depleted glycolytic SM. In mice fed a high fat diet, ACOT2 enabled the accretion of acyl-CoAs and ceramide derivatives in glycolytic SM, and this was associated with worse glucose homeostasis compared to when ACOT2 was absent. These observations suggest that ACOT2 supports CoASH availability to facilitate β-oxidation in glycolytic SM when lipid supply is modest. However, when lipid supply is high, ACOT2 enables acyl-CoA and lipid accumulation, CoASH sequestration, and poor glucose homeostasis. Thus, ACOT2 regulates matrix acyl-CoA concentration in glycolytic muscle, and its impact depends on lipid supply.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The mitochondrial matrix is replete with acyl-Coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) thioesters that are substrates and products of several reactions, including β-oxidation, branched chain amino acid catabolism, mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS), phospholipid hydrolysis, and covalent acylation reactions. The extent to which matrix acyl-CoA concentrations are regulated is poorly understood, but is metabolically important since CoA availability might become limiting (Abegaz, Martines et al., 2021, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Himms-Hagen &amp; Harper, 2001</xref>), long-chain acyl-CoAs inhibit the activity of some matrix proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Pande &amp; Blanchaer, 1971</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Paulson &amp; Shug, 1984</xref>, Seiler, Martin et al., 2014, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Woldegiorgis &amp; Shrago, 1979</xref>, Woldegiorgis, Yousufzai et al., 1982), and mitochondrial lipid overload is associated with dysregulated glucose metabolism (Anderson, Lustig et al., 2009, Finck, Bernal-Mizrachi et al., 2005, Gavin, Ernst et al., 2018, Koves, Ussher et al., 2008, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Muoio &amp; Neufer, 2012</xref>, Smith, Lin et al., 2021). Mitochondrial acyl-CoA thioesterases (ACOT) hydrolyze acyl-CoA species of different chain lengths to their constituent fatty acids and CoASH (Bekeova, Anderson-Pullinger et al., 2019, Tillander, Alexson et al., 2017) and thus are candidates to regulate matrix acyl-CoA levels.</p>
<p>ACOTs reside in the cytosol, peroxisomes, and in mitochondria. Five ACOTs associate with mitochondria: ACOT2, ACOT7, ACOT9, ACOT11, and ACOT13; all localize to the matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bekeova et al., 2019</xref>), although Acot13 appears to also associate with the outer mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Tillander et al., 2017</xref>). Tissue distribution of ACOTs varies by family member. ACOT7 is expressed mainly in the central nervous system (CNS) and ACOT11 is expressed in brown adipose tissue. ACOT2, ACOT9 and ACOT13 are widely expressed outside of the CNS, often co-expressed in the same tissue, and, together, cover a wide range of acyl-CoA chain length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bekeova et al., 2019</xref>, Tillander, Arvidsson Nordstrom et al., 2014). What distinguishes these three Acots is the sensitivity of their activity to the matrix environment: ACOT9 and ACOT13 activity is strongly inhibited by CoA, whereas ACOT2 activity is insensitive to CoA and to other potential regulators that are present in the matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bekeova et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Tillander et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, ACOT2 may constitutively regulate acyl-CoA levels in the matrix.</p>
<p>The major substrates of ACOT2 are long-chain fatty acyl CoAs, with the highest affinity for C14:0- and C16:0-CoA. Affinity is similar to that of long- and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Acadl, Acadm; the first step of β-oxidation) for those substrates. Thus, Acot2 is well-poised to regulate β-oxidation. Studies of ACOT2 overexpression in hepatocytes supported this potential role of ACOT2 in the regulation of β-oxidation, and also suggested that the long-chain fatty acids released by long-chain acyl-CoA hydrolysis could increase proton leak, presumably via fatty acid cycling within the inner mitochondrial membrane (Moffat, Bhatia et al., 2014). However, the role of endogenous ACOT2 has not been explored, and was the goal of this study. While the liver expresses low levels of ACOT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bekeova et al., 2019</xref>), other organs have high expression, including skeletal muscle (SM) and heart. We reasoned that SM would be an interesting context to examine ACOT2-linked metabolic function because ATP demand and β-oxidation flux vary substantially (e.g., with fiber type, time of day, diet), allowing ACOT2 to be studied across a range of bioenergetic conditions.</p>
<p>Using mice with striated muscle-specific knockout of <italic>Acot2</italic> (Acot2-/-), we found that, <italic>in vivo</italic>, the respiratory quotient of Acot2-/- mice shifted towards even higher glucose oxidation at night. This shift was observed over a wide range of lipid supply. When mice were fed a normal chow diet or fasted overnight, the shift to higher glucose oxidation <italic>in vivo</italic> in Acot2-/- mice was accompanied by evidence for lipid overload in white quadriceps. This metabotype was evidenced by greater levels of acyl-CoAs including β-oxidation intermediates and by loss of correlation between metabolites of adjacent reactions of β-oxidation. This “β-oxidation overload” was mitigated when fasted Acot2-/- mice ran on a treadmill. When mice were fed a high fat diet, the shift to glucose oxidation in Acot2-/- mice was accompanied by lower levels of acyl-CoAs and β-oxidation intermediates, and better correlation between adjacent β-oxidation reactions in quadriceps. High-fat fed Acot2-/- mice showed improved whole-body glucose homeostasis, and lower levels of ceramides and their derivatives in white SM. Altogether, these observations support a model in which ACOT2 facilitates the oxidation of fatty acids in white SM when energy demand and lipid supply are low-to-modest. However, when lipid supply is high, ACOT2 promotes the accumulation of ceramide derivatives in white SM, conditions that could eventually counter glucose disposal. Thus, suppressing ACOT2 activity might be a strategy to defend glucose homeostasis when lipid supply is high.</p>

<title>ACOT2 expression relative to β-oxidation proteins is fiber type dependent</title>
<p>Because the abundance of enzymes and transporters related to substrate metabolism differs in different SM fiber types (Murgia, Nagaraj et al., 2015), and Acot2 (previously known as MTE1) has been linked to mitochondrial metabolism (Cole, Murray et al., 2011, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Himms-Hagen &amp; Harper, 2001</xref>, King, Young et al., 2007, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Moffat et al., 2014</xref>), we first determined the fiber type-specific expression of Acot2 alone, and in relation to the major metabolic pathways that it is hypothesized to influence. To this end, we mined a mass spectrometry-based proteomics resource for mouse single SM fibers (Type 1, 2a, 2×, 2b) obtained from soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Murgia et al., 2015</xref>). We first estimated Acot2 protein abundance, alone, and relative to oxidative phosphorylation (oxphos) capacity (sum of expression of ETC Complex I, III, IV and ATP Synthase subunits) and β-oxidation capacity (sum of levels of β-oxidation proteins). Acot2 expression was highest in Type 1 &gt; Type 2a ≅ Type 2× ≅ Type 2b, whereas its expression relative to oxphos or β-oxidation capacity was Type 1 &gt; 2a &gt; 2b ≅ 2× (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig1A</xref>). ACOT2 potentially competes with long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACADL) for substrate (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig4A</xref>); ACOT2 expression relative to that of ACADL was highest in Type 1 &gt; 2a &gt; 2b ≅ 2× (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig1A</xref>). To obtain further insight into the potential relevance of ACOT2 in different fiber types, we evaluated 1) the capacity for β-oxidation relative to that for oxphos, 2) expression of ACADL relative to that of the upstream long-chain keto acyl-CoA thiolase (HADHB), and 3) expression of ACADL relative to that of upstream CPT2 that re-esterifies long-chain acyl-carnitines to the CoA form. For each of these three comparisons, expression in Type 2× and 2b exceeded expression in Type 1 or 2a (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig1A</xref>). Thus, ACOT2 is least abundant in highly glycolytic Type 2b and 2× fibers, and ACOT2 and/or ACADL in Type 2b and 2× fibers <italic>vs</italic>. Type I or 2a fibers potentially receive the greatest inputs from CPT2 and/or HADHB.</p>

<title>ACOT2 plays a role in the β-oxidation pathway in SM</title>
<p>To investigate the role of endogenous ACOT2 in SM, we used a mouse model with Acot2 depletion in striated muscle (Acot2-/-), driven by the muscle creatine kinase promoter (CKM). The largest SM groups in the mouse comprise mainly Type 2× and 2b fibers. Thus, we focused on the white portion of Quadriceps (Quad) muscle, isolated mitochondria from the white portion of Quad, and also isolated mitochondria from all limb muscles (“mixed SM”). Acot2 was undetectable by western blot analysis of mixed SM mitochondria from Acot2-/- mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig1B</xref>). Thioesterase activity for myristoyl-CoA (C14:0-CoA) was significantly lower in mixed SM mitochondria; residual thioesterase activity likely reflects that from Acot13 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig1C</xref>).</p>
<p>We reasoned that, given the diversity of possible processes that Acot2 could impact, a broad survey approach would allow us to unveil Acot2’s role in SM. The experimental design is summarized in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig1D</xref>; we used diet, fasting, treadmill running of fasted mice, and light vs. dark phase of the day (rest <italic>vs</italic>. active phase, in mice) to generate different levels of lipid supply and energy demand. The intention of a short, 7-day, 60% HFD was to increase lipid supply substantially while avoiding many deleterious effects of a longer exposure. We note that transcript and protein levels of ACOT9 and ACOT13, two ACOTs expressed in SM and sensitive to CoA inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bekeova et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Tillander et al., 2014</xref>)) were similar between Loxp and Acot2-/- Quad in all conditions, as were transcript levels of cytosolic and peroxisomal Acots (Suppl Fig1AB).</p>
<p>To obtain an overview of metabolism in the mitochondria matrix, we measured (in Quad) steady state levels of metabolites produced in the mitochondrial matrix, namely acyl-CoAs (ACoAs: β-oxidation), organic acids (Krebs cycle) and a subset of amino acids including branched chain amino acids (BCAA) whose metabolism, as for fatty acids, is heavily CoA-dependent. Metabolites were measured for all 4 conditions. Only ACoAs showed changes in all 4 conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig1E</xref>). In contrast, organic acids were not affected by Acot2 loss in any condition (Suppl Fig1C), and amino acids (Leu, Val, Gly, Gln) were slightly higher (∼30%) in Chow Acot2-/-, and Val was modestly (∼20%) lower in Fast+run Acot2-/-, but unaffected in Fast and HFD by <italic>Acot2</italic> loss (Suppl Fig1D). These findings support a primary role for ACOT2 in β-oxidation. The results also suggest that ACOT2 is not required for lipoic acid synthesis by the mtFAS pathway since otherwise levels of Krebs cycle metabolites and BCAAs would likely be altered.</p>
<p>Using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS), we obtained absolute levels of the major ACoA species and CoASH. Samples were analyzed as a single batch, thereby facilitating comparisons between genotypes and across conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig1E</xref>). <italic>Acot2</italic> loss was associated with higher ACoA levels for all chain lengths in Chow, without a change in CoASH (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig1E</xref>, black and grey bars). A similar pattern was evident in Fasted, though only medium- and long-chain ACoAs were higher in Acot2-/- Quad, and CoASH was also higher (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig1E</xref>, green and orange bars). When Fasted mice ran on a treadmill (Fast+run), differences between Loxp and Acot2-/- largely disappeared and we note that CoASH was similar between genotypes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig1E</xref>, gold and purple bars). Short term HFD was associated with a rise in ACoAs of all chain lengths in Loxp Quad, but this was not apparent in Acot2-/- Quad, such that levels of ACoAs were lower in Quad of HFD Acot2-/- mice <italic>vs</italic>. Loxp mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig1E</xref>, blue and red bars). CoASH was also lower in Quad from HFD-fed Acot2-/- (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig1E</xref>, blue and red bars). An independent analysis further supported these changes with HFD. Using different cohorts of Loxp and Acot2-/- mice, total CoA (free and bound) was measured by HPLC in hydrolyzed Quad samples and was significantly lower in Quad from HFD-fed Acot2-/- mice (Suppl Fig2).</p>
<p>To estimate if CoASH availability changed in Acot2-/- Quad, we calculated the ratio of CoASH to the sum of ACoAs (short-, medium- and long-chain). Chow and also Fast+run were associated with significantly decreased ratios in Acot2-/- Quad <italic>vs</italic>. Loxp Quad, whereas Fasted was unchanged and HFD tended to be higher (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig1F</xref>). Thus CoA sequestration in Quad (i.e., increased AcoAs) from Chow-fed, Fasted and Fast+run Acot2-/- mice was associated with lower CoASH availability in the Chow and Fast+run conditions. In Quad from HFD-fed Acot2-/- mice, CoASH availability tended to be higher despite the lower CoASH level.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>The impact of ACOT2 on β-oxidation does not depend on changes in protein abundance</title>
<p>We considered whether changes in the capacity of metabolic pathways might underlie changes in ACoA levels. To this end, RNAseq analysis was performed in Quad from mice in Chow, Fasted and HFD conditions. A subset of transcripts is presented in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig2A</xref>. Volcano plots and pathway analyses are presented in Suppl Fig3. Full data sets are available (GEO accession #: GSE234495). In both Chow and Fasted conditions, Acot2 loss had little impact on transcript levels, including those associated with fatty acid uptake into SM and mitochondria; β-oxidation and peroxisomal fatty acid metabolism; CoA biosynthesis, mitochondrial transport and degradation; and fatty acid binding proteins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig2ABC</xref>). Transcript levels of ETC subunits were also unaffected. All the latter was also the case in HFD (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig2ABC</xref>), though Fatty Acid Binding Protein 4 was elevated in Acot2-/- Quad (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig2C</xref>), and small changes were evident in pathways not directly related to metabolism (Suppl Fig3). We note that there were no changes that would be consistent with the activation of the integrated stress response or mTORC1, previously associated with loss of CPT1b or Acyl-CoA synthetase 1 (Vandanmagsar, Warfel et al., 2016, Zhao, Pascual et al., 2019). Western blot analysis was performed for a subset of β-oxidation and CoA metabolism proteins in Quad from Chow- and HFD-fed mice, and showed no change with <italic>Acot2</italic> loss (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig2D</xref>). These negative data suggest that changes in ACoAs in Acot2-/- Quad do not reflect changes in the capacity for fatty acid transport, β-oxidation, or CoA transport and metabolism, but likely reflect changes in flux.</p>

<title>ACOT2 loss facilitates or limits β-oxidation in Quad mitochondria depending on lipid supply</title>
<p>To directly investigate how ACOT2 can alter β-oxidation in SM, bioenergetics analyses were performed using isolated SM mitochondria. Because the analysis of ACoA levels revealed condition-dependent genotype effects (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig1E</xref>), analyses in mitochondria were conducted using different amounts of lipid substrate (palmitoylcarnitine (PCarn)), and over a range of simulated energy demand (achieved by varying in the ADP/ATP ratio using the creatine kinase (CK) clamp approach (Fisher-Wellman, Davidson et al., 2018)). PCarn oxidation generates palmitoyl-CoA and myristoyl-CoA that are substrates for ACOT2. As a first step, experiments were performed in mitochondria from mixed SM. Applying the CK clamp approach to mixed SM mitochondria from Chow- and HFD-fed mice, we could not detect any differences in O<sub>2</sub> consumption rate (JO<sub>2</sub>) with Acot2 loss across a range of ADP/ATP ratio, whether at 20 µM or 40 µM PCarn (Suppl Fig4). We did not detect genotype differences in phosphorylating JO<sub>2</sub> using saturating [ADP], and nor in maximal non-phosphorylating JO<sub>2</sub> (using oligomycin to inhibit the ATP synthase) with 20 µM or 40 µM PCarn. Finally, there was no genotype difference for maximal ADP-stimulated or non-phosphorylating JO<sub>2</sub> when pyruvate/malate was supplied to mitochondria (Suppl Fig4).</p>
<p>We then isolated mitochondria from white Quad and performed bioenergetics analyses. The CK clamp yielded a clear difference with Acot2 loss when we used 20 µM PCarn: JO<sub>2</sub> tended to be higher at the highest ADP/ATP ratio (high energy demand), then fell more rapidly than Loxp mitochondria as ADP/ATP was decreased (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig3A</xref>) such that the slope (“conductance”) was significantly steeper in Acot2-/- Quad mitochondria (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig3B</xref>). Next, using saturating [ADP], we compared JO<sub>2</sub> fueled by 20 <italic>vs</italic>. 40 µM PCarn (and 0.1 mM malate). We first noted that, with saturating [ADP], JO<sub>2</sub> driven by 20 µM PCarn was significantly higher in Acot2-/- <italic>vs</italic>. Loxp mitochondria (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig3C</xref>), consistent with the CK clamp experiment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig3AB</xref>). In contrast, JO<sub>2</sub> with 40 µM PCarn was ∼36% lower than with 20 µM PCarn in Acot2-/- mitochondria, compared to only ∼19% lower in Loxp mitochondria (P = 0.04; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig3C</xref>); this suggests that 40 µM PCarn led to lipid overload that was more pronounced in Acot2-/- mitochondria. In experiments using 20 µM PCarn and saturating [ADP], we noted that JO<sub>2</sub> decreased over time; the drop was greater in Acot2-/- mitochondria (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig3D</xref>), further supporting greater lipid overload. A similar analysis in mitochondria fueled with saturating pyruvate, malate and ADP showed little decrease over the same time interval (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig3E</xref>). Also in the latter condition, JO<sub>2</sub> was similar in Loxp and Acot2-/- mitochondria, and more than 2× the rate observed with 20 µM PCarn (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig3E</xref>); thus genotype differences in PCarn-driven JO<sub>2</sub> did not reflect a limitation of ETC capacity.</p>

<p>To gain insight into whether ACOT2 plays a role in non-phosphorylating JO<sub>2</sub> (i.e., via fatty acid cycling causing proton leak) we measured maximal non-phosphorylating JO<sub>2</sub> using oligomycin to inhibit the ATP synthase. With 20 µM PCarn, non-phosphorylating JO<sub>2</sub> was similar between Loxp and Acot2-/- mitochondria. However, with 40 µM PCarn, non-phosphorylating JO<sub>2</sub> was slightly lower in Acot2-/- <italic>vs</italic>. Loxp mitochondria (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig3F</xref>). To directly evaluate proton leak, JO<sub>2</sub> and membrane potential (delta psi; ΔΨm) were measured in parallel in the same mitochondrial preparation, in the presence of oligomycin and with titration of the electrochemical driving force using antimycin (Complex III inhibitor). By measuring non-phosphorylating JO<sub>2</sub> at the same driving force (ΔΨm), a difference in non-phosphorylating JO<sub>2</sub> indicates a difference in proton leak, (rather than a change in driving force) (see graphical explanation in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig3G</xref>). With 20 µM PCarn, proton leak-driven JO<sub>2</sub> was similar in both genotypes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig3G</xref>). With 40 µM PCarn, proton leak-driven JO<sub>2</sub> was slightly but significantly lower in Acot2-/- mitochondria (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig3G</xref>), indicating a greater proton leak in Loxp <italic>vs</italic>.

<p>Analyses of steady state levels of major ACoA species in Quad (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig1E</xref>) also provided us with the levels of all β-oxidation intermediates (in relative value), for all 4 reactions of β-oxidation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig4A</xref>), for chain lengths from C18 down to C4, in all 4 conditions. In general, the amplitude of the intermediates (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig4B</xref>) showed a similar pattern of change with <italic>Acot2</italic> loss as what we observed for the ACoAs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig1E</xref>, and in relative value in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig4B</xref>). Specifically, for Chow and Fasted conditions in Acot2-/- Quad, while increases in the level of the intermediates were observed for most chain lengths, the most affected chain lengths were C6 and C8 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig4B</xref>). These increases for C6 and C8 intermediates were less apparent when fasted Acot2-/- mice ran on a treadmill (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig4B</xref>). For the HFD condition, the abundance of intermediates was lower in Acot2-/- Quad, for all chain lengths (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig4B</xref>), as was observed for ACoAs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig1E</xref>).</p>
<p>We further analyzed the β-oxidation intermediates by calculating Pearson’s correlation coefficients (r) between adjacent steps of β-oxidation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig4C</xref>). We reasoned that this, together with information about amplitudes, would provide insight into changes in flux <italic>in vivo</italic> (Ferrara, Wang et al., 2008, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Steuer, 2006</xref>). In <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig4C</xref>, each square represents a correlation coefficient coded by color: dark orange for highly correlated (r ≥ 0.75), light orange for moderately correlated (0.6≤ r &lt;0.75), blue for poorly correlated (r &lt; 0.6) (Schober, Boer et al., 2018). Roman numerals indicate the step of β-oxidation (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig4A</xref>). As one approach to statistically compare conditions and genotypes, we performed 2-way ANOVA on the average r values for each comparison (i.e., adjacent reaction, all chain lengths), 4 conditions, and 2 genotype, and used a false discovery rate of 5% for post-hoc pairwise comparisons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig4D</xref>). We also calculated confidence intervals (65%) for the Pearson’s correlation coefficients (Suppl Fig5A), and performed statistics on the lower limit of the confidence intervals using a false discovery rate of 5% (Suppl Fig5B). High correlation is suggestive of first order kinetics, and low correlation indicates a loss of first order kinetics that can have several causes. In Quad from Chow-fed Loxp mice, β-oxidation was well-correlated for long-chain and short-chain species, and moderately correlated for medium-chain species, with only 2 poorly correlated nodes. Loxp Quads from the Fasted and Fasted+run conditions, and most strikingly the HFD condition, showed much less correlation between adjacent steps of β-oxidation as compared to Quad from Chow-fed Loxp mice, especially for medium- and short-chain species; there were 14, 12 and 15 poorly correlated nodes for Fasted, Fasted+run and HDF, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig4C</xref>, “FL/FL”). With loss of ACOT2, β-oxidation in Quad from Chow-fed mice was poorly correlated, with 15 poorly correlated nodes mainly associated with long- and short-chain species. Poor correlation remained evident in Acot2-/- Quad from Fasted mice, with 18 poorly correlated nodes spread across all chain lengths. Treadmill running of fasted Acot2-/- mice led to an improvement in correlation (10 poorly correlated nodes for medium- and short-chain). Finally, in striking contrast to Quad from HFD-fed Loxp mice, Quad from HFD-fed Acot2-/- mice showed well-correlated β-oxidation, with only 7 poorly correlated nodes clustered mainly among the short-chain intermediates. Loss of correlation in Acot2-/- Quad from Chow and Fasted mice, combined with a greater abundance of some β-oxidation intermediates, supports lipid overload during β-oxidation in Acot2-/- Quad, <italic>in vivo</italic>, under those conditions. The analysis also suggests that treadmill running of Fasted Acot2-/- mice relieved lipid overload in Quad (but, nonetheless, sequestered CoASH to an extent that CoASH was lower (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig1F</xref>), and that loss of Acot2 lessened the lipid overload in the HFD condition.</p>
<p>As a second approach to investigate Acot2’s role in β-oxidation in SM, <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used indirect calorimetry (IC) to evaluate <italic>in vivo</italic> substrate utilization in Chow, Fasted and HFD conditions; SM contributes substantially to the indirect calorimetry signal because it is a large (30-40%) fraction of body weight (Kummitha, Kalhan et al., 2014, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Rolfe &amp; Brown, 1997</xref>). There was no difference in body composition in any condition (Suppl Fig6); thus, IC data was expressed per mouse. Whole-body O<sub>2</sub> consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> production (VO<sub>2</sub> and VCO<sub>2</sub>, respectively) showed the expected diurnal pattern in Chow-fed mice (e.g., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Moffat et al., 2014</xref>)) and blunted amplitude in HFD-fed mice (Coomans, van den Berg et al., 2013)(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig5</xref>); thus mice were well-acclimated to the setup. To evaluate for possible energy demand differences, we binned the locomotor activity data into 3 levels (the highest activity bin was not always included during the light phase because of insufficient data points in some mice). Then, in each mouse, the corresponding VO<sub>2</sub>, VCO<sub>2</sub> and respiratory quotient (RQ: VCO<sub>2</sub>/VO<sub>2</sub>) data for each activity bin were averaged. VO<sub>2</sub> was similar between genotypes, except for a decrease in HFD-fed Acot2-/- mice associated with the highest activity bin in the light phase (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig5</xref>, lowest panel). In contrast, Acot2-/- mice showed higher VCO<sub>2</sub> in all conditions, though only during the dark phase of the day (in fasted mice, this was reflected in the higher activity bin) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig5</xref>). RQ was also higher in Acot2-/- mice at night, generally independent of activity level, indicating greater glucose oxidation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig5</xref>).</p>
<p>To gain mechanistic insight into the IC findings, we note the lack of major changes in transcript levels in Quad for proteins involved in β-oxidation or fatty acid handling (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig2ABC</xref>), and nor in the protein abundance of several beta-oxidation enzymes that we queried (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig2D</xref>). We also queried the RNAseq data to determine transcript abundance, in Quad, of glucose transporters and glycolysis enzymes. There were no changes that reached statistical significance using adjusted p values. However, with HFD, we noted slightly higher transcript levels for some glycolytic enzymes in Acot2-/- Quad (<italic>Ldha</italic>: p = 0.03, <italic>Eno1</italic>: p = 0.05, <italic>Aldoa</italic>: p = 0.15, <italic>Gpd1</italic>: p=0.16, PKM: p = 0.11; unpaired t-test), and lower levels for others (<italic>Slc2a3</italic>: p = 0.02; <italic>Hk1</italic>: p = 0.05; unpaired t-test) (Suppl Fig7A). Finally, we tested, in Quad, well-established regulatory mechanisms that bias towards β-oxidation or glucose oxidation, namely pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphorylation (inhibits β-oxidation), levels of malonyl-CoA (inhibits CPT1) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase phosphorylation (inhibits malonyl-CoA synthesis). ACOT2 loss did not alter any of the latter regulatory mechanisms under Chow, Fasting or HFD (Suppl Fig7BCD). Because malonyl CoA levels were very low, we tested levels in mice that were fasted (24 hrs) then refed (6 hrs); malonyl-CoA levels in Quad tripled, but were independent of Acot2 expression (Suppl Fig7D).</p>
<p>To determine if the higher glucose oxidation in Acot2-/- mice was cell-autonomous, <italic>Acot2</italic> was acutely depleted (Acot2 kd) from C2C12 myotubes using different two siRNA duplexes (Suppl Fig8A). Myotubes (6 days after serum withdrawal) were incubated with glucose (10 mM) and palmitate:BSA (6:1, 100 µM palmitate, plus 0.5 mM carnitine). We evaluated the JO<sub>2</sub> sensitive to mitochondrial pyruvate transporter inhibition by UK5099 (2 µM) (Yang, Ko et al., 2014). Acot2 kd resulted in higher JO<sub>2</sub> and greater UK5099-inhibitable JO<sub>2</sub> (Suppl Fig8BD), without a change in total capacity for glucose oxidation, determined using the chemical uncoupler FCCP (Carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone) (Suppl Fig8BD). To evaluate glycolysis, we measured the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) sensitive to 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG). 2-DG-sensitive ECAR and maximal 2-DG-sensitive ECAR (in presence of FCCP) tended to be higher with Acot2 kd (Suppl Fig8CE).</p>
<p>We also evaluated β-oxidation in C2C12 myotubes with acute Acot2 kd, as JO<sub>2</sub> sensitive to the CPT1 inhibitor etomoxir (4 µM) (Divakaruni, Hsieh et al., 2018). To increase reliance on fatty acids for ATP production, myotubes were cultured in substrate-limited media overnight, prior to measurements (see Methods). Recordings were performed with glucose (10 mM) and palmitate:BSA (6:1, 100 µM palmitate, plus carnitine). Prior to etomoxir addition, Acot2 kd myotubes had higher JO<sub>2</sub>. Etomoxir lowered the JO<sub>2</sub> to a similar extent in control and kd cells (Suppl Fig8FH). β-oxidation capacity was also similar, determined using FCCP (Suppl Fig8FH). Prior to etomoxir, 2-DG-sensitive ECAR was higher in Acot2 kd myotubes. Etomoxir increased the ECAR in control and kd cells, but more so in the control (Suppl Fig8GI). These data suggest that β-oxidation was hindered in Acot2 kd cells, necessitating greater glycolysis.</p>

<p>The shift away from β-oxidation <italic>in vivo</italic> revealed by the IC experiments (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig5</xref>) raised the question of the fate of fatty acids in Acot2-/- muscle. To this end, we evaluated lipids in white Quad. We note first that WAT weight was not different in any of the conditions (Suppl Fig6). Targeted lipidomics analysis by LC-HRMS was performed on extracts from Quad harvested from chow- and HFD-fed mice. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref> shows the total abundance for each species.

In Quad from chow-fed mice, there was no genotype difference for any of the lipid species (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig6A</xref>; Suppl Table 1). HFD-feeding led to an increase in diacyl- and triacylglycerides, of similar magnitude, in Quad from Loxp and Acot2-/- mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig6A</xref>), without acyl chain-specific genotype effects (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig6A</xref>; Suppl Table 1). Triacylglycerides were also assayed as total glycerol in hydrolyzed Quad samples, with the same result (Suppl Fig9). In Loxp Quads, HFD also led to robust increases in level of hexosylceramides and sphingomyelins, with no change in ceramides (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig6A</xref>). In contrast, in Quads HFD-fed Acot2-/- mice, there were no changes in the level of hexosylceramides and sphingomyelins, and there was a drop in ceramide levels (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig6A</xref>). Analysis of acyl chain-specific differences did not show a predominance for a particular acyl-chain species in the genotype effects (Suppl Table 1). Triacylglycerides were also measured biochemically in liver and heart, and were similar between genotypes, in both Chow and HFD conditions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig6B</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Four groups of observations support the role of endogenous ACOT2 in SM, especially in white SM. First, three independent approaches indicate that the primary role of ACOT2 is to promote β-oxidation. Indeed, in the absence of ACOT2, mitochondrial glucose oxidation was higher, <italic>in vivo</italic> and in C2C12 myotubes acutely depleted of ACOT2, and the switch to glucose oxidation was most evident when fatty acids and pyruvate were both readily available to be oxidized. Second, <italic>in vivo</italic>, Acot2 mitigated lipid overload in mitochondria from white SM when lipid supply and energy demand were low-to-modest. Alleviation of lipid overload by ACOT2 was also apparent in isolated mitochondria under high lipid supply. Third, in the context of HFD, ACOT2 favored the accumulation of ceramides and ceramide derivatives in white SM, along with slower glucose disposal. Finally, flux through ACOT2 led to higher proton leak in isolated mitochondria under high lipid supply; this may be relevant <italic>in vivo</italic> under high lipid supply and low energy demand. We conclude that, as long as lipid supply is low/modest, ACOT2 regulates matrix acyl-CoA levels in white SM to facilitate β-oxidation. When lipid supply is high, ACOT2 in white SM is still permissive for β-oxidation, but this is accompanied by the accretion β-oxidation intermediates and other lipids that can inhibit insulin signaling, though these effects might be lessened by higher proton leak.</p>

<title>ACOT2 is not required for the mtFAS pathway</title>
<p>We could not find evidence that ACOT2 is required for the mtFAS pathway. The mtFAS pathway is well-known as the source of lipoic acid used as a co-factor by several matrix enzymes (Hiltunen, Chen et al., 2010). More recently, longer chain fatty acids were shown to also be a product of mtFAS (Nowinski, Solmonson et al., 2020), though the identity of the thioesterase that cleaves long-chain acyl groups from acyl carrier protein is unknown. We took the opportunity to investigate this in Acot2-/- mice, but could find no supportive evidence, such as lower ETC capacity in SM, which would have been predicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Nowinski et al., 2020</xref>), or compensatory mitochondrial biogenesis.</p>

<title>ACOT2 facilitates or hinders β-oxidation in white SM mitochondria, depending on lipid supply and ATP demand</title>
<p>Experiments in isolated mitochondria from white SM, using modest and high lipid supply and a range of simulated ATP demand, revealed the scope of possible impact of ACOT2 on β-oxidation. When PCarn supply was modest and simulated ATP demand was high, ACOT2 loss was associated with higher phosphorylating JO<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, the CK clamp demonstrated that conductance for PCarn was higher in Acot2-/- mitochondria. These differences in Acot2-/- mitochondria occurred without obvious changes in the abundance of matrix enzymes. Thus, the most straightforward explanation is that flux through β-oxidation was greater in Acot2-/- mitochondria because long-chain acyl-CoA was not diverted through ACOT2. In other words, when Acot2 is present, long-chain acyl-CoA would be diverted through ACOT2 at the expense of β-oxidation. However, an apparent conflict needs to be addressed, between the latter concept and the finding that β-oxidation is higher in ACOT2 <italic>overexpressing</italic> hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Moffat et al., 2014</xref>). In hepatocytes, ACOT2 overexpression led to higher β-oxidation, and this was largely attributed to higher proton leak (i.e., driven by fatty acids released by ACOT2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Moffat et al., 2014</xref>). ACOT2 could also drive greater β-oxidation if fatty acids released by Acot2 are reactivated by acyl-CoA synthetase on the OMM then oxidized. Consistent with this possibility, we and others showed that most of the palmitate formed from PCarn oxidation (indicative of thioesterase activity) was exported from mitochondria (Gerber, Aronow et al., 2006, Seifert, Bezaire et al., 2008), and that a re-activation cycle was possible in isolated mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Seifert et al., 2008</xref>) (though how fatty acids are exported is unclear). Data from hepatocytes overexpressing Acot2 were also consistent with a re-activation cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Moffat et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, the conditions used here - PCarn (and malate) without added CoA – did not favor the re-activation of fatty acids. Thus, the greater PCarn-driven JO<sub>2</sub> in isolated Acot2-/- mitochondria supplied with modest [PCarn] and high [ADP] is not inconsistent with a role for ACOT2 in promoting β-oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Moffat et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>In mitochondria from white SM, increasing the [PCarn] from 20 to 40 µM did not further increase phosphorylating JO<sub>2</sub> in Loxp samples and resulted in lower JO<sub>2</sub> in Acot2-/- samples. A CoA limitation might explain the results in Loxp but not Acot2-/- mitochondria. Rather, the observations in Acot2-/- mitochondria are consistent with a kinetic model of β-oxidation, based on β-oxidation in liver mitochondria, showing that, with increasing substrate supply, β-oxidation becomes vulnerable to product inhibition and also to feedback inhibition of 3-hydroxy-acyl-CoA dehydrogenase by elevated NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH (Martines, van Eunen et al., 2017, van Eunen, Simons et al., 2013). Our data suggest that inhibition of β-oxidation worsens in white SM mitochondria when ACOT2 is absent.</p>

<title>ACOT2 in muscle facilitates β-oxidation in vivo</title>
<p>The studies in isolated mitochondria showed that, when ACOT2 is absent, diverting more long-chain fatty acyl-CoA into the β-oxidation pathway can increase β-oxidation when ATP demand is high (i.e., when there is little back-pressure on the ETC) and lipid supply is not excessive. With high lipid supply, β-oxidation is associated with increased ACoAs build, suggesting β-oxidation overload, when ACOT2 is absent. To determine how ACOT2 impacts β-oxidation <italic>in vivo</italic>, we measured steady state levels of β-oxidation intermediates in white SM and undertook IC studies, allowing us to evaluate substrate metabolism under a normal range of lipid supply, β-oxidation flux and energy expenditure. Indirect calorimetry showed no evidence for higher β-oxidation; rather, glucose oxidation was higher (higher RQ, reflecting higher VCO<sub>2</sub>). Likewise, C2C12 myotubes acutely depleted of ACOT2 and incubated with glucose and palmitate (plus carnitine) showed higher pyruvate oxidation. Thus both longer-term and acute loss of Acot2 led to higher mitochondrial glucose oxidation, but never to higher β-oxidation, under a range of lipid supply.</p>
<p>In Acot2-/- mice fed regular chow or a 60% fat diet, higher RQ (reflecting higher VCO<sub>2</sub>) was evident mainly during the dark (active) phase of the day, when energy demand is fueled by a mix of glucose and other substrates. In SM under nutrient replete conditions, fatty acids are expected to be the main additional source of fuel. The relative contribution of fatty acids and glucose depends on diet composition, and fatty acyl-CoA-derived acetyl-CoA would compete with pyruvate-derived acetyl-CoA for entry into the TCA cycle. Our IC and isolated mitochondria data suggest that, in this competition scenario, loss of ACOT2 results in less contribution of β-oxidation-derived acetyl-CoA; in other words, ACOT2 would facilitate the access of fatty acyl-CoA-derived acetyl-CoA into the TCA cycle. During the rest phase of the day (for mice, the light phase), energy demand is largely fueled by fatty acids. Because demand is low at this time, β-oxidation capacity can be sufficient to match energy demand even if capacity is curtailed by ACOT2 loss; we propose that this occurred in Acot2-/- mice fed regular chow or fasted overnight, evidenced by the similar RQ (near 0.7) in Loxp and Acot2-/- mice (despite the accumulation of β-oxidation intermediates in Acot2-/- SM). With HFD (i.e., high lipid supply), we propose that β-oxidation capacity becomes vulnerable to inhibition that is mitigated by ACOT2 (evidenced by studies in isolated mitochondria) such that, when ACOT2 is absent, β-oxidation can no longer match even the low energy demand of the rest phase, and the contribution of pyruvate-derived acetyl-CoA to the TCA cycle rises.</p>
<p>The accumulation of β-oxidation intermediates in Acot2-/- SM and the poor correlation between some adjacent reactions of β-oxidation when lipid supply was low/modest (i.e., chow feeding and fasting), indicate that Acot2 is relevant during the rest phase of the day in chow-fed and fasted mice, and that ACOT2 mitigates the build-up of β-oxidation intermediates. That build-up was especially evident for C6- and C8-species is consistent with a kinetic model of mitochondrial β-oxidation flux showing that the medium-chain ketoacyl-CoA thiolase is most vulnerable to inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Martines et al., 2017</xref>). It is notable that some build-up of intermediates and loss of correlation were evident for most chain lengths. This suggests that ACOT13 (similar substrate profile as ACOT2 (Wei, Kang et al., 2009)) or ACOT9 (specificity for C3- and C4-CoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Tillander et al., 2014</xref>)) did not compensate in the SM of chow-fed or fasted mice. Also, ACOT9 and ACOT13 are CoA-inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bekeova et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Tillander et al., 2014</xref>). While the build-up of β-oxidation intermediates in Acot2-/- Quad indicates that more CoA was sequestered in the β-oxidation pathway, the CoASH level was either unchanged (chow-fed Acot2-/- mice), greater (fasted Acot2-/- mice), or greater relative to ACoAs (HDF-fed Acot2-/- mice). We note that CoASH was measured in whole SM. Yet estimates of [CoASH] in mitochondria <italic>vs</italic>. cytosol (Naquet, Kerr et al., 2020), and consideration of relative compartment sizes (Larsen, Nielsen et al., 2012), put the CoASH amount substantially higher in mitochondria <italic>vs</italic>. cytosol, suggesting that CoASH in whole SM mainly reflects the mitochondria pool. Thus, while we cannot rule out that the CoASH pool available for β-oxidation was smaller in Acot2-/- SM, our data and the above arguments suggest that mitochondrial CoASH was not less when ACOT2 was absent.</p>
<p>In Quads from HFD Acot2-/- <italic>vs</italic>. Loxp mice, lower levels of β-oxidation intermediates and CoASH, and more instances of strong correlation between adjacent β-oxidation reactions were unexpected findings in light of the observations in chow-fed and fasted Acot2-/- mice. A different approach - measuring total CoA after hydrolysis of acyl-CoAs - in a different cohort of HFD-fed mice revealed lower levels of total CoAs in Acot2-/- Quad, consistent with the mass spectrometry data. Possibly, the lower CoASH in Quad mitochondria from HFD-fed Acot2-/- mice resulted in substantial activation of ACOT9 and ACOT13; this would be expected to facilitate β-oxidation or to increase the levels of other lipids, depending on the fate of the released fatty acids. Yet, VCO<sub>2</sub> and RQ were higher in HFD-fed Acot2-/- mice during the light phase (and dark phase), consistent with higher glucose oxidation, not β-oxidation. Furthermore, lipidomics analysis revealed either no change (di- and triacylglycerides) or a decrease (ceramides, hexosylceramides and sphingomyelins) in lipids in Acot2-/- SM. Triacylglycerides were also unchanged in liver and heart of Acot2-/- mice <italic>vs</italic>. Loxp. Altogether, these observations indicate that, under high lipid supply, β-oxidation overload in white SM, <italic>in vivo</italic>, is mitigated by ACOT2 loss, though β-oxidation may be more susceptible to CoA limitation because CoASH was lower. Experiments to better understand how CoA is regulated in SM are warranted.</p>

<title>Muscle ACOT2 contributes to proton leak in mitochondria when lipid supply is high</title>
<p>Experiments in mitochondria from white SM showed that Acot2 loss leads to lower proton leak, measured as lower non-phosphorylating JO<sub>2</sub> at a given driving force (Δψm). This occurred when 40 µM PCarn was supplied, but not 20 µM PCarn. Likewise, there was evidence for higher proton leak when Acot2-overexpressing hepatocytes oxidized palmitoyl-CoA, and, <italic>in vivo</italic>, in fasted mice overexpressing Acot2 in hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Moffat et al., 2014</xref>). Collectively, these data from loss- and gain-of-function models indicate that Acot2 can promote proton leak when lipid supply is high.</p>
<p>Evidence <italic>in vivo</italic> that endogenous muscle Acot2 contributes to proton leak in SM mitochondria is provided by the higher VO<sub>2</sub> during the light phase in HFD-fed Loxp mice <italic>vs</italic>. Acot2-/- mice. That an effect of proton leak would be most evident when energy demand is low is consistent with the disproportionately higher proton leak contribution to JO<sub>2</sub> at high Δψm (Nobes, Brown et al., 1990). Yet, an important caveat when considering proton leak <italic>in vivo</italic> is that substrate type and availability, and Δψm, cannot be accounted for. Nonetheless, that ACOT2 may be a source of fatty acids mediating proton leak is interesting because the ability of fatty acids to mediate proton leak across the IMM has long been known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Divakaruni &amp; Brand, 2011</xref>), they can activate proton leak by the adenine nucleotide translocase (Bertholet, Natale et al., 2022)), and by uncoupling protein 1 in brown adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Nicholls, 2021</xref>), but the source of the fatty acids is rarely considered. An ACOT2-mediated proton leak could have important implications; e.g., higher proton leak driven by ACOT2 could mitigate the build-up of β-oxidation intermediates, though the higher level of ACoAs in Quad from HFD <italic>vs</italic>. Chow-fed Loxp mice indicates that an ACOT2-mediated proton leak would not prevent ACoA build-up.</p>

<title>Absence of ACOT2 in muscle improves systemic glucose homeostasis under HFD</title>
<p>Glucose homeostasis has been linked to mitochondrial β-oxidation in SM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anderson et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Finck et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gavin et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Koves et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Muoio &amp; Neufer, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Smith et al., 2021</xref>), and to cellular lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Petersen &amp; Shulman, 2018</xref>). Because our findings revealed a role for endogenous Acot2 in β-oxidation in SM, it was of interest to evaluate glucose homeostasis and lipids SM. The chow-feeding and fasting conditions indicated that ACOT2 facilitates β-oxidation, and lower glucose oxidation. It might be tempting to speculate that preventing β-oxidation overload leads to improved glucose disposal. Yet, the ACoA build-up in Acot2-/- SM was not accompanied by any obvious defect in glucose disposal. On the other hand, under short term HFD, ACOT2 loss was protective against insulin resistance. Though the latter could be related to the lower ceramide levels in Acot2-/- SM, it should be noted that ceramides did not accumulate in SM from HFD-fed Loxp mice. Rather, hexosylceramide and sphingomyelin pools were expanded in Loxp SM, but not in Acot2-/- SM. Overall, these data suggest that Acot2-/- white SM is less at risk of ceramide accumulation when lipid supply is high. Finally, the mechanistic link between ACOT2 and sphingomyelins and ceramides is unclear. While ceramide and sphingolipid biosynthetic or hydrolyzing enzymes have been found in mitochondria of some cell types (Hernandez-Corbacho, Salama et al., 2017), we could not find evidence in SM mitochondria, despite finding several pathway members in heart mitochondria (unpublished). Thus, direct competition between ceramide or sphingolipid biosynthetic enzymes and ACOT2 in SM mitochondria seems unlikely. Even if indirect, our findings support as association between mitochondrial β-oxidation and the ceramide/sphingomyelin pools in white SM.</p>

<title>Acyl/acetyl-CoA shunts and buffers</title>
<p>This study has revealed ACOT2 to be a <italic>bona fide</italic> regulator of matrix acyl-CoA concentrations via the interaction of Acot2 with β-oxidation. That this was especially evident in glycolytic SM, despite the relatively low protein expression of ACOT2 in glycolytic <italic>vs</italic>. oxidative SM might seem surprising. Yet, a recent study describing a shunt that mitigates acetyl-CoA build-up – by reversal of medium chain keto-acyl thiolase (MK, encoded by <italic>Acaa2</italic>) leading to C4-acyl-CoA generation determined that MK expression and the availability of this shunt were lower in glycolytic <italic>vs</italic>. oxidative muscle (Koves, Zhang et al., 2023). Similarly, expression of carnitine acetyl-transferase (CRAT), which also buffers C2- to C4-CoAs (Muoio, Noland et al., 2012), is lower in glycolytic <italic>vs</italic>. oxidative muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Koves et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Murgia et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, altogether, these studies suggest that glycolytic SM may be especially sensitive to lipid overload in part because of the low expression of the individual shunt/buffer mechanism, leading to a low capacity for compensation in glycolytic SM. Another factor might be the increased expression of HADHB relative to ACADL in glycolytic <italic>vs</italic>. oxidation SM that we show in this study. We propose that, in glycolytic <italic>vs</italic>. oxidative muscle, each shunt and buffer is more important for mitigating lipid overload, Acot2 being one of them.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our data support a model in which ACOT2 facilitates β-oxidation in white SM when energy demand and lipid supply are low-to-modest. When lipid supply is high, ACOT2 does not prevent ACoA build-up (β-oxidation overload), and enables the accumulation of ceramide derivatives in white SM. Finally, the impact of ACOT2 loss in striated muscle on glucose homeostasis and SM lipids under high lipid supply raises the question of whether ACOT2 inhibition could be a strategy for mitigating some deleterious effects of lipid overload.</p>

<p>Western blot analysis were done on isolated mitochondria samples or tissue samples quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. The quadriceps tissue was homogenized with a lysis buffer containing: NaCl, 150 mM; HEPES 25 mM; EGTA 2.5 mM; Triton 100X 1%; Igepal 1%; SDS 0.10%;</p>
<p>Sodium deoxycholate 0.50%; Glycerol 10%, Protease inhibitor (Roche 11873580001) and Phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (sodium fluoride 200mM, imidazole 200mM, sodium molybedate 115mM, sodium orthovanadate 200mM, sodium tartrate dihydrate 400mM, sodium pyrophosphate 100mM and β-glycerophosphate 100mM), using a glass/Teflon homogenizer at 300 rpm, followed by incubation on ice for 45 min, then spin at 18000g at 4°C for 20 min. From the supernatant, protein concentration was measured by bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA). Samples were loaded onto a 10% or 12% polyacrylamide gel (for Licor-conjugated secondary antibodies) or a 4-12% Bis-Tris gel (chemiluminescence (ECL)-conjugated secondaries), electrophoresed, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and blocked with Odyssey blocking buffer diluted in PBS (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA) or with TBS-T plus 3% BSA. The membrane was incubated overnight in primary antibodies (see Table, below) diluted in TBS-T with 0.02% NaN3. Secondary antibodies were diluted 1:20000 in 5% skim milk (LI-COR anti-MS 92632212 and anti-Rb 92632213) or in TBS-T 1:50000 for ECL (Thermo Fisher anti-MS 31473 and anti-Rb 31460).

<title>ELISA - Insulin measurement</title>
<p>The chow fed mice were fasted overnight, the HFD mice were fasted for 6h before the blood samples were collected for serum isolation. Samples were obtained from a small nick at the end of the mouse’s tail. They were incubated on RT for 30min, centrifuged on 4°C, 1500g, for 10min and the blood serum was transferred into clean tubes, stored on -80°C until the experiment. Samples were also collected after 15 min of the oral injection of 2ug of glucose for 1g of body weight of chow fed mice and 1ug of glucose for 1g of body weight of HFD mice. For the insulin measurement we used ALPCO Insulin Rodent Chemiluminescence ELISA kit. The measurement and the analysis were done based on the protocol included in the kit.</p>

<title>CoA extraction, derivatization and quantification by HPLC</title>
<p>The samples were processed as previously described in (Zano, Pate et al., 2015). For the total CoA measurements we used 30-50 mg of quadriceps tissue. The samples were homogenized in 2 ml of ice cold 1 mM KOH for 30 seconds at 600 rpm in a glass/Teflon Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. This step was followed by an addition of 500 μl of 125 mM KOH to bring the pH ≈ 12 and vortex. The tubes with the samples were parafilmed and incubate at 55°C for 2 h, to hydrolyze CoA thioesters to free CoA. In the next step we added 160 μl of 1M Trizma-HCl pH∼ 3.9 to bring the pH ≈ 8, which is optimal for the reaction with mBBr. We added 10 μl of 100 mM mBBr (Echelon Biosc. F-0030) dissolved in acetonitrile and incubated the samples at RT in dark for 2h. In next step we acidified the samples with the addition of 100 μl of glacial acetic acid, centrifuged the samples at 500 g for 10 minutes at 27°C. The supernatant was applied on an already equilibrated 2-(2-pyridyl)ethyl columns (Sigma 54127-U) with 1 ml of 50% MeOH with 2% acetic acid. In the next step the columns were washed with 2 × 1 ml of 50% MeOH with 2% acetic acid and 1 ml of water. The fraction containing derivatized CoA was eluted with 2 × 1 ml of 95% ethanol with 50 mM ammonium formate and then 2 × 1 ml of 90% methanol with 15 mM ammonium hydroxide into a glass vial. Samples were dried under nitrogen gas, resuspend in 300 μl of water by vortexing and incubating at room temperature for 10 minutes. In next step the samples were transferred to a Spin-X Centrifuge Tube Filter (Costar, Cat# 8161, 0.22 µm Cellulose Acetate) and centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 minutes. At the end the samples were transferred to HPLC vial. We prepared mBBr-CoA standard. 2 mM Free CoA (Sigma C3019) was combined with 2 mM mBBr in 100 mM TrisHCl pH = 8 and incubated in dark at RT for 2 h. The resulting mBBr-CoA was used for constructing the standard curve. The samples were analyzed by HPLC, as described by Shumar et al., 2015, using a Waters Alliance e2695 system equipped with a 2489 UV/Vis detector and a Kintex 4.6 × 150 mm, 3 μm C-18 column (Phenomenex) kept at 35°C. Fifteen microliters of the samples were injected onto the column, and the flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. The HPLC elution was the following: 0–2.0 min, 90% buffer A (50 mM KH2PO4, pH4.6), 10% buffer B (acetonitrile); 2.0–9.0 min concave gradient to 25% B; 9.0–23 min linear gradient to 40% B; 23.0–30 min linear gradient to 90% A and column equilibration in 90% A. Monobromobimane-CoA was detected by monitoring the absorbance at 393 nm and quantified using a standard curve.</p>

<title>Analysis of acyl-CoAs (absolute values) of β-oxidation intermediates</title>
<p>Acyl-CoAs were extracted by the method of Minkler, <italic>et al</italic>., (Minkler, Kerner et al., 2008) using internal standards generated as previously described (PMID: 25572876) and spiked into each sample and calibration standard, then analyzed by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) using the method validated previously (Frey, Feldman et al., 2016, Snyder, Basu et al., 2014). Briefly, previously harvested heart samples were weighed still frozen and 650 µl of acetonitrile:isopropanol (3:1 v/v) and 100 µl of the yeast acyl-CoA internal standard library (derived from pan6-deficient <italic>Sacharomyces cerevisiae</italic> grown in [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>315</sub>N<sub>1</sub>]-pantothenic acid-containing media) were added to the samples. Samples were vortex mixed then probe tip sonication, five times 30 pulses with ½ second delay, followed by 5 min vortexing, and 10 min sonication in water bath to homogenize the tissue. Next 250 µl of 100 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (pH 6.7, prepared fresh) was added to the samples, vortex mixed, then centrifuged at 16000 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatant was transferred into a glass tube and 125 µl of glacial acetic acid was added to acidify the samples before solid phase extraction (SPE). 2-(2-pyridyl)ethyl-functionalized silica SPE columns were conditioned with 1 ml of acetonitrile: isopropanol: water: acetic acid (9:3:4:4 v/v/v/v), the acidified samples were loaded on the columns, the columns were washed with 2 ml of acetonitrile:isopropanol:water:acetic acid (9:3:4:4 v/v/v/v), then eluted into fresh glass tubes with 1 mL methanol:250 mM ammonium formate (4:1 v/v). The samples were evaporated to dryness under nitrogen gas and re-dissolved in 100 μl of water:acetonitrile (7:3 v/v) for LC-HRMS analysis.</p>
<p>5 µL injections of the extracted acyl-CoAs were analyzed on an Ultimate 3000 Quaternary UHPLC coupled to a Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer operating in the positive ion mode with a heated ESI probe in an IonMax Source housing as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Frey et al., 2016</xref>). Samples were kept in a temperature controlled autosampler at 6 °C and LC separation was performed as previously described on a Waters XBridge 3.5 μm particle size C18 2.1 × 150 mm column. LC conditions were as follows modified from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Snyder et al., 2014</xref>); column oven temperature 25 °C, solvent A water with 5 mM ammonium acetate, solvent B 95:5 acetonitrile: water with 5 mM ammonium acetate, solvent C (wash solvent) 80:20 acetonitrile: water with 0.1% formic acid. The gradient was as follows: 0.2 mL/min flow at 98% A and 2% B for 1.5 min, 80% A 20% B at 5 min, 100% B at 12 min, 0.3 mL/min 100% B at 16 min, 0.2 mL/min 100% C at 17 min, held to 21 min, then re-equilibrated at 0.2 mL/min flow at 98% A and 2% B from 22 to 28 min. Flow from 4–18 minutes was diverted to the instrument. Operating conditions on the mass spectrometer were as follows; auxiliary gas 10 arbitrary units (arb), sheath gas 35 arb, sweep gas 2 arb, spray voltage 4.5 kV, capillary temperature 425 °C, S-lens RF-level 60, aux gas heater temperature 400 °C, in-source CID 5 eV. Acquisition used alternating full scans from 760–1800 m/z at 140,000 resolution and data independent acquisition looped 3 times with all fragment ions multiplexed at a normalized collision energy of 20 at a resolution of 280,000.</p>

<title>Organic acids and amino acids extraction and LC-MS</title>
<p>Quadriceps tissue samples were harvested and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. The samples were powdered on dry ice and ∼25 mg of the powder was used for the extraction. We used the protocol from Chicco et al., 2018 with some modification. To each sample was added 1 ml of MeOH:ACN:water (5:3:2 v/v/v) and incubated on ice for 30 min with vortexing every 5 min. Then the samples were centrifuged at 10000xg and 4 °C for 15 min, and the supernatant was transferred to clean Eppendorf tubes. Samples used to detect citric acid, glutamine and serine were directly used for LC-MS analysis. Samples used for the detection of leucine, isoleucine, valine and glycine were further concentrated and then used for analysis. Samples for detection of aKG were concentrated and derivatized. Samples for detection of succinic acid and malic acid were directly derivatized after extraction. The concentration step was combined with deproteinization. The samples were mixed with ACN (1:3 v/v), vortexed for 1 min, incubated at - 20 °C for 20 min then dried overnight in a hood. The samples were resuspended in 1/10 of the original extract volume. Before injection, the samples were centrifuged for 30 min at 4 °C and 10000g. In the derivatization step (adopted from Yip et al., 2017) 30 µl of the extract was used. 2 µl of 1 M aniline (in 1:1 v/v water/ACN) was added (pH &gt; 7) 2 µl of 1 M EDC (dissolved in water) was added. The samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C, then quenched with 1 µl of formic acid (pH &lt; 7). Before injection the samples were centrifuged for 30 min at 4 °C and 10000xg. Metabolites were analyzed on a Waters Acquity I-Class UPLC system coupled to a Synapt G2Si HDMS mass spectrometer in positive ion mode with a heated electrospray ionization (ESI) source in a Z-spray configuration. LC separation was performed on a Waters Acquity UPLC BEH 1.7 µm 2.1 × 50 mm column equipped with a Vanguard C18 precolumn. For derivatized metabolites a 0.6 mL/min gradient of 95/5 to 15/85 A/B in 4 min followed by washing and reconditioning the column, whereas for polar metabolites a 0.6 mL/min isocratic run at 95/5 A/B was used. Eluent A is 0.1% v/v formic acid in water and B is 0.1% v/v formic acid in ACN. Conditions on the mass spectrometer were as follows: capillary voltage 0.5 kV, sampling cone 40 V, source offset 80 V, source 120 °C, desolvation 250 °C, cone gas 0 L/h, desolvation gas 1000 L/h and nebulizer 6.5 bar. The analyzer was operated in resolution mode and low energy data was collected between 100 and 1500 Da at 0.2 sec scan time. MS<sup>e</sup> data was collected using a ramp trap collision energy 20-40 V, and masses were extracted from the TOF MS TICs using an abs width of 0.005 Da. Peak picking and integration was automated using Waters Unifi 1.4.</p>

<title>Tissue preparation for lipids extraction</title>
<p>Pieces of 20-30 mg of frozen tissues were cut on a tile kept in dry ice with a new blade kept in dry ice. The tissue was added to low retention Eppendorf tube prepared with 0.6 mL 80% methanol (MeOH) and 20 µL SPLASH® LIPIDOMIX (diluted 1:1 with methanol from original #330707 Avanti solution) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alablaster, AL) and kept in dry ice. Samples were pulse sonicated for 30x half-second pulse on ice and kept on ice for 20 min for metabolites extraction. Each tube was then vortexed 3x 30 seconds each. The tissue homogenates was then moved to a 10 mL glass Pyrex tube with screw cap. The Eppendorf tubes were rinse with 0.5 mL methanol and added to same glass tube. 5 mL methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) was added to each of the tubes and then tubes were shaken vigorously for 30 min. 1.2 mL water was added to each tubes and vortexed for 30 sec each. Centrifugation for 10 min @ 1000xg created two phases. The top clear phase was moved to a clean glass Pyrex tube and dried down under nitrogen. 100 µL MTBE/MeOH=1/3 (v/v) was used to re-suspend the residue. The sample was spun down at 10, 000 × g for 10 min at 4°C and only the top 50 µL were transferred to a HPLC vial for LC-MS analysis. A pooled sample was created by mixing 10 µL of each re-suspended sample. 2 µL injections were made.</p>

<title>Liquid chromatography high resolution -mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) for lipids</title>
<p>Separations were conducted on an Ultimate 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using an Ascentis Express C18, 2.1 × 150 mm 2.7μm column (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The flow-rate was 0.4 m /min, solvent A was water:acetonitrile (4:6 v/v) with 0.1% formic acid and 10 mM ammonium formate and solvent B was acetonitrile:isopropanol (1:9 v/v) with 0.1% formic acid and 10 mM ammonium formate. The gradient was as follows: 10 % B at 0 min, 10 % B at 1 min, 40 % B at 4 min, 75 % B at 12 min, 99 % B at 21 min, 99 % B at 24 min, 10 % B at 24.5 min, 10 % at 30 min. Separations were performed at 55 °C. For the HRMS analysis, a recently calibrated QE Exactive-HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used in positive ion mode with an HESI source. The operating conditions were: spray voltage at 3.5 kV; capillary temperature at 285°C; auxiliary temperature 370°C; tube lens 45. Nitrogen was used as the sheath gas at 45 units, the auxiliary gas at 10 units and sweep gas was 2 units. Same MS conditions were used in negative ionization mode, but with a spray voltage at 3.2 kV. Control extraction blanks were made in the same way using just the solvents instead of the tissue homogenate. The control blanks were used for the exclusion list with a threshold feature intensity set at 1e10<sup>^5</sup>. Untargeted analysis and targeted peak integration was conducted using LipidsSearch 4.2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as described by Wang et al (DOI: 10.4155/bio-2021-0098). An external mass calibration was performed using the standard calibration mixture approximately every three days. All samples were analyzed in a randomized order in full scan MS that alternated with MS2 of top 20, with HCD scans at 30, 45 or 60 eV. Full scan resolution was set to 120,000 in the scan range between <italic>m/z</italic> 250–1800. The pool sample was run every 15 samples. Lipids quantification was done from the full scan data. The areas were normalized based on the amount of the internal standard added for each class (see Table, below). All amounts were normalized to the original tissue weight.</p>

<p>O<sub>2</sub> consumption (JO<sub>2</sub>) was measured using the Seahorse XFe24 Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, Billerica, MA, USA). C2C12 cells were cultured in DMEM media with 4.5g/l D-glucose, L-glutamine, 110 mg/l sodium pyruvate (Gibco 11995-065) with addition of 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin. The differentiation was initiated with the change of media containing 2% FBS. The seahorse measurement was ran on the seventh day of differentiation. We used knockdown cells, which were prepared using 10 pmol/well (of 6 well cell culture plate) Acot2 or control siRNA (Origene) and 1.5ul of Lipofectamine RNAiMAX using forward transfection. For part of the experiments the cells were overnight cultured in substrate limited media (DMEM Sigma D5030, 3.7 g/l NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.5 mM glucose, 1 mM glutamine, 0.5 mM carnitine, 1% FBS pH 7.4 at 37°C).

<p>This study presents new data highlighting the importance of appropriate coenzyme A handling in the mitochondria for maintaining appropriate energy production capacity. Several findings regarding the role of a key metabolic enzyme in how skeletal muscle cells use different substrates for energy production are <bold>valuable</bold> and supported by <bold>solid</bold> evidence, but there are concerns whether the data support the conclusion that ACOT2 regulates mitochondrial matrix acyl-CoA levels in white skeletal muscle to facilitate fatty acid oxidation β-oxidation.</p>

<p>This study examined whether mitochondrial acyl-CoA thioesterase-2 (ACOT2) regulates mitochondrial matrix acyl-CoA levels. Acot2 deletion in murine skeletal muscle (SM) resulted in acyl-CoA build-up. When energy demand and pyruvate availability were elevated, a lack of ACOT2 activity promoted glucose oxidation. This preference for glucose over fatty acid oxidation was recapitulated in C2C12 myotubes with acute depletion of Acot2. In mice fed a high-fat diet, ACOT2 enabled the accretion of acyl-CoAs and ceramide derivatives in glycolytic SM, and this was associated with worse glucose homeostasis compared to when ACOT2 was absent. The authors suggest that ACOT2 supports CoASH availability to facilitate β-oxidation in glycolytic SM when lipid supply is modest. However, when lipid supply is high, ACOT2 enables acyl-CoA and lipid accumulation, CoASH sequestration, and poor glucose homeostasis. Thus, ACOT2 regulates matrix acyl-CoA concentration in glycolytic muscle, and its impact depends on lipid supply.</p>
<p>Based on the data provided in this study, the authors propose that ACOT2 regulates mitochondrial matrix acyl-CoA levels in white skeletal muscle to facilitate fatty acid oxidation β-oxidation. However, I do not believe the data supports this concept, since ACOT2 deletion actually increased fatty acid oxidation in the mitochondrial JO2 studies. In addition, there are some problems with the experimental data that the authors need to address. This includes the experimental conditions used to assess JO2 in the mitochondria, and not using Cre control mice.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript from Bekeova et al. entitled &quot;Acyl-CoA thioesterase-2 facilitates P-oxidation in glycolytic skeletal muscle in a lipid supply dependent manner&quot; examines whether loss of acyl-CoA thioesterase-2 (ACOT2) in the mitochondrial matrix of skeletal muscle alters mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism. The authors generate data demonstrating that under normal chow conditions, loss of ACOT2 increases mitochondrial respiration of long-chain fatty acid, but also increases susceptibility to the build-up of metabolic intermediates. However, during short-term high-fat feeding (7 days), mice with knockout of skeletal muscle ACOT2 had better glucose and insulin tolerance. Interestingly, skeletal muscle ACOT2 knockout mice on chow and high-fat diet utilized more glucose during the active (dark cycle) portion of the day. These data suggest that ACOT2 may be a potential therapeutic target to improve glucose homeostasis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The use of creatine kinase cre recombinase to specifically target striated muscle localizes the genetic manipulation, thus increasing the rigor of these experiments by limiting potential off-site changes in ACOT2 expression. Also, the assessment of mitochondrial respiration and response to changes in energy change via the creatine kinase clamp technique is a strength. These data provide a measurement of isolated mitochondrial respiration at physiologically relevant concentrations of ATP and ADP, while also allowing for assessment of how these mitochondria respond to changes in free energy (Fisher-Wellman et al. 2018). The indirect calorimetry data provides systemic physiological context to the striated muscle-specific genetic manipulation, while also allowing for the examination of how this change in skeletal muscle ACOT2 impacts systemic responses to different energy challenges. Finally, the extensive metabolomics, transcriptomics, and lipidomics analysis, not only provides a wealth of data but is used to further the authors' investigation of skeletal muscle ACOT2 activity in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and glucose homeostasis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Several general confounding factors exist in the experimental design that could potentially impact the interpretation of the observed outcomes. First, all mice were housed at housing temperatures (22C) below the thermoneutral zone, which has been well described by many investigators to result in dramatically increased energy expenditure. Changes in total and resting energy expenditure could alter the skeletal muscle and systemic utilization of lipids, response to high-fat diet, and glucose homeostasis. Second, no dietary control was observed in these experiments. While this did not impact outcomes when the diets were not compared, once the authors began to compare normal chow to high-fat diet, numerous differences in the composition of these diets could impact the outcomes. Third, the extended food withdrawal before the glucose- and insulin tolerance tests puts the mouse in a state of extreme energy stress more akin to starvation than fasting, which can negatively impact outcomes (Ayala et al. 2010, Virtue &amp; Vidal-Puig 2021). Fourth, the use of the Seahorse platform for the assessment of respiration of isolated mitochondria is highly debatable (Schmidt et al. 2021), particularly when the investigators also used high-resolution respirometry specifically designed for the purpose of measuring isolated mitochondrial oxygen consumption. Importantly, the use of the Seahorse platform to assess cellular respiration in this investigation is quite appropriate. Finally, while the authors present data demonstrating that ACOT2 expression is highest in Type I fibers compared to the various Type II fiber types, a large number of the experiments are performed in a muscle that is primarily composed of Type II fibers. The authors briefly acknowledge this limitation. But, is important for the reader to keep this in mind when trying to consider how these findings would translate to humans.</p>
<p>Impact:</p>
<p>The authors have generated data that implicates skeletal muscle mitochondrial coenzyme A handling as a therapeutic target in the improvement of glucose homeostasis. While the exact role of increased tissue lipid burden on insulin action, glucose uptake, and substrate metabolism is still debated, the association between increased tissue lipid and impaired tissue- and systemic glucose handling is very strong. The data herein suggest that ACOT2 represents a pharmaceutical target to improve systemic glucose homeostasis in the population with obesity.</p>

<p>Cells can oxidize diverse substrates in the mitochondria to sustain cellular energy metabolism. However, all of these substrates require covalent thioester linkage to coenzyme A (CoA). Thus, multiple energy metabolism substrates could potentially compete for a limited pool of mitochondrial CoA. Cells encode a set of mitochondrial acyl-CoA thioesterases (ACOTs) that free CoA up by removing attached substrates. The authors hypothesized that ACOT2, a mitochondrial ACOT with a preference for long-chain acyl-CoA substrates that arise during the oxidation of lipids as a fuel source, could regulate the balance of substrates used in the mitochondria by reducing the oxidation of lipids by removing them from CoA and freeing the mitochondrial pool of CoA for use by other substrates.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, the authors generated mice with loss of ACOT2 in the skeletal muscle, where this is most expressed, and assayed the CoA composition of muscle and their glucose/fatty acid catabolism in mice that were challenged with different diets, fasting or exercise to expose the muscle to different substrates conditions. These experiments were complemented with biochemical analysis of mitochondria isolated from the muscle of control and ACOT2 animals exposed to a variety of substrates and challenged with different simulated energy demands.</p>
<p>On the basis of these convincing experiments, the authors argue that loss of ACOT2 both in vivo and in vitro interestingly increases glucose oxidation, while not increasing oxidation of lipids. This is particularly surprising as the CoA competition model would predict that ACOT2 loss would increase lipid oxidation while hindering glucose oxidation. The authors argue that ACOT2 facilitates lipid oxidation due to ACOT2 reversal of lipid ligation to CoA preventing feedback inhibition of the lipid oxidation pathway that occurs when lipid supply outstrips the ability of the lipid oxidation pathway to metabolize the lipids. These findings will be valuable for the field of metabolism providing insight into how ACOTs regulate substrate catabolism in cells and tissues.</p>
