<title>Abstract</title><p>The voltage- and pH-gated Slo3 potassium channel is exclusively expressed in mammalian spermatozoa. Its sensitivity to both voltage and alkalization plays a crucial role in sperm fertility, which is tightly coupled to the capacitation process. Here we show that sperm-enriched divalent cation Zn<sup>2+</sup> undergoes dynamic alteration in spermatozoa during capacitation. We also found that intracellular Zn<sup>2+</sup> regulates alkalinization-induced hyperpolarization in mice spermatozoa which is mediated by Slo3 channel. Further examination of zinc regulation in mouse Slo3 (mSlo3) revealed that, in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte expression system, intracellular zinc directly inhibits mouse Slo3 currents in dose-dependent manner at micromolar concentrations, with exceptionally slow dissociation. By combining MD simulations and electrophysiology, we also identified amino acid residues contributing to the Zn<sup>2+</sup> slow dissociation from Slo3 channels. Our studies uncover the importance of intracellular zinc dynamics and its regulatory role in ion channels during sperm capacitation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Zinc is an essential metal ion involved in numerous biological functions, including as a regulatory component to various proteins such as enzymes, transcription factors, and ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fayyazuddin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Maret, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Sun et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Vallee &amp; Falchuk, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Zheng et al., 2001</xref>). In the reproductive system, spermatozoa is a type of cell that is known to have high intracellular zinc content, which influences its production, maturation, and physiological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chia et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fallah et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Henkel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Riffo et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Yamaguchi et al., 2009</xref>). Zinc is also present in the seminal fluid at high concentrations (∼1-1.5 mM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Henkel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Riffo et al., 1992</xref>), and extensive studies have elucidated their role in regulating sperm physiology. For instance, extracellular zinc has been shown to influence human sperm motility, which negatively correlates with the concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Henkel et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">2005</xref>). Another study also suggested that increased zinc concentration inhibits sperm motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Riffo et al., 1992</xref>). Despite considerable evidence that sperm motility is regulated by extracellular zinc, intracellular zinc has also been implicated in playing a regulatory role. One study demonstrated that chelating intracellular zinc reduces sperm motility and velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Sørensen et al., 1999</xref>). However, the underlying mechanism by which zinc regulates sperm motility remains unclear.</p>
<p>During fertilization, spermatozoa undergo capacitation, a series of physiological processes that determine the success of fertilizing the egg within the female reproductive tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Austin, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chang, 1951</xref>). This capacitation involves the changes of activities in various ion channels, which leads to diverse physiological changes, such as pH, calcium level, and membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Arnoult et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Breitbart, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Publicover et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Vredenburgh-Wilberg &amp; Parrish, 1995</xref>; Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Zeng et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">1996</xref>). Moreover, recent studies have shown that the activity of ion channels is regulated by zinc. Indeed, extracellular zinc has been shown to inhibit the flagellar voltage-gated proton channel Hv1, which is supposed to control intracellular pH in human sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Grahn et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lishko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the high levels of zinc in spermatozoa regulates their physiological properties.</p>
<p>In the present study, we find that intracellular zinc is exported during capacitation, indicating that zinc dynamics in spermatozoa play an important role in fertilization. Furthermore, zinc significantly inhibited the alkalinization-induced hyperpolarization in mouse sperm, which is mediated by Slo3 (K<sub>Ca</sub>5.1), a sperm specific pH- and voltage-gated potassium channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Schreiber et al., 1998</xref>; X. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>We further discovered that intracellular zinc directly inhibits mouse Slo3 (mSlo3) currents using <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. Of note, this inhibition is pH-dependent, voltage-dependent and has a long-lasting inhibitory effect even after the washout. Coexpression of mSlo3 with the auxiliary subunit Lrrc52, to mimic the native environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Yang et al., 2011</xref>; X. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Zeng et al., 2015</xref>), consistently demonstrates zinc’s inhibitory effect. Additionally, we identify potential key amino acids in the mSlo3 channel that serve as the zinc binding site. Our findings highlight the importance of intracellular zinc dynamics and its regulatory role over ion channels during capacitation in spermatozoa.</p>

<title>Intracellular zinc is exported from sperm during capacitation</title>
<p>To investigate the role of intracellular zinc during capacitation, we monitored the intracellular zinc concentration utilizing the zinc-sensitive fluorophore FluoZin3-AM. Fluorescence signals were successfully detected in both the head and flagellum of isolated mice spermatozoa (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). As expected, the head of the spermatozoa showed a stronger fluorescence signal compared to the flagellum, likely due to its higher zinc capacity. We also treated spermatozoa with Toyoda, Yokoyama, Hoshi (TYH) medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Toyoda et al., 1971</xref>), which is well established capacitation-inducing medium <italic>in vitro</italic>. We observed that there was a gradual and significant decrease in fluorescence intensity in both regions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), particularly prominent in the flagellum (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). This decline suggests the active release of intracellular zinc from sperm flagellum during capacitation.</p>

<p>Additionally, we examined the effect of intracellular zinc on sperm motility before and after capacitation (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1—figure supplement 1A-E</xref>). We incubated the isolated spermatozoa with cell permeable Zn<sup>2+</sup> chelator N,N,N’,N’-Tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN) and measured the motility parameters before and after capacitation. We found that VAP (average path velocity), VCL (curvilinear velocity), and VSL (straight-line velocity) were influenced by the TPEN treatment only after the capacitation, as shown in <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. These results demonstrate that the dynamics of zinc levels during capacitation potentially contributes to sperm motility, highlighting the importance of zinc action in sperm physiology.</p>

<title>Intracellular zinc inhibits the alkalinization-induced hyperpolarization in sperm</title>
<p>It is already known that sperm capacitation is well associated with the increase of intracellular pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Vredenburgh-Wilberg &amp; Parrish, 1995</xref>; Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zeng et al., 1996</xref>), which leads to the hyperpolarization of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Arnoult et al., 1999</xref>; Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Zeng et al., 1995</xref>) as well as the elevation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Breitbart, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Publicover et al., 2007</xref>) through diverse ion channel activities. To explore whether these pathways are influenced by intracellular zinc, we used perforated patch-clamp techniques. It has been reported that under the whole-cell current clamp of mouse epididymal spermatozoa, resting membrane potential (Vm) is hyperpolarized after intracellular alkalinization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Navarro et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, we applied 10 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, which is routinely used to alkalize intracellular pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Madshus, 1988</xref>), to spermatozoa. As expected, we observed that it hyperpolarized the membrane by −17.37 ± 2.89 mV; n=6 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E, G</xref>). Then, we applied 10 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl with 100 µM zinc pyrithione (ZnPy), a zinc ionophore. In contrast to the control group, there was no remarkable hyperpolarization in the presence of ZnPy as the ΔVm was 0.99 ± 3.56 mV; n=3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F, G</xref>). These findings indicate that either extracellular or intracellular zinc inhibits the alkalinization-induced hyperpolarization in mouse sperm.</p>
<p>To examine the possibility that intracellular, but not extracellular, zinc is responsible for inhibiting the alkalinization-induced hyperpolarization, we measured membrane potential of sperm using the patch-clamp technique in conventional whole-cell configuration with pH<sub>i</sub> = 6.0 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). In the test group, the patch pipette contained 100 µM ZnCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>), while the control group did not (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>). In consistent with the perforated patch-clamp results, we observed alkalinization-induced hyperpolarization upon applying NH<sub>4</sub>Cl in the control (ΔVm= −24.12 ± 5.885 mV; n=5; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I, K</xref>). In contrast, no alkalinization-induced hyperpolarization was observed in the 100 µM ZnCl<sub>2</sub> group (ΔVm= −6.80 ± 1.18 mV; n=4; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J, K</xref>). These results confirmed that intracellular zinc indeed inhibits alkalinization-induced hyperpolarization in mouse sperm.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Zinc inhibits mouse Slo3 (mSlo3) current</title>
<p>Our findings suggest that intracellular zinc inhibits a key process in sperm capacitation, specifically the alkalinization-induced hyperpolarization. Previous studies have identified the pH-and voltage-dependent potassium channel Slo3 is responsible for the principal K<sup>+</sup> current (I<sub>KSper</sub>) in mice spermatozoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Navarro et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Santi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Schreiber et al., 1998</xref>; X. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Zeng et al., 2011</xref>). Given this context, we next investigated whether intracellular zinc acts directly on the Slo3 channel.</p>
<p>We expressed the mSlo3 channel in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte expression system and conducted inside-out patch-clamp recordings. The bath solution was initially set to pH 8.0, and recordings were performed using a high-speed perfusion system. A ramp pulse from −100 mV to + 100 mV with a holding potential of −60 mV was applied. We observed a robust pH- and voltage-dependent mSlo3 current at pH 8.0 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, B</xref>), consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Leonetti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Schreiber et al., 1998</xref>; X. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). The application of 100 µM of ZnCl<sub>2</sub> resulted in the inhibition of 36.62 ± 4.76 % (n=6) of mSlo3 current (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, B</xref>). Of note, the inhibited mSlo3 current by zinc was never restored after the wash out of zinc even for more than 30 seconds. However, when pH 6.0 was applied to completely abolish the mSlo3 current, followed by the application of pH 8.0, the mSlo3 current recovered (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, B</xref>). We also determined the IC<sub>50</sub> of zinc inhibition by applying zinc at concentrations 0.1, 1, 10, 100, and 1000 µM for 30 seconds. The dose-response curve, fitted to the Hill equation with a standard slope (Hill slope of −1.0), yielded an IC<sub>50</sub> = 145.2 µM (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>

<p>We also tested the effect of zinc at a lower pH of 7.5. We observed the pH- and voltage- dependent mSlo3 current at this pH. However, the 100 µM of ZnCl<sub>2</sub> application did not affect the mSlo3 current (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D-F</xref>). To rule out instrumental and human error, we also tested the effect of pH 6.0 which suppresses Slo3 activity. As expected, the application of pH 6.0 completely inhibited the mSlo3 current, and the subsequent application of pH 7.5 restored the current (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D-F</xref>).</p>
<p>We also conducted step pulse protocols from −100 mV to +180 mV with a holding potential of −60 mV to assess whether zinc inhibition is voltage-dependent. At pH 8.0, we observed a robust mSlo3 current, which was inhibited by 100 µM ZnCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G, H</xref>). The current-voltage (I-V) relationship indicated voltage-dependent zinc inhibition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>). The ratio of I<sub>zinc</sub> to I<sub>control</sub> plotted against membrane potential also demonstrated that zinc inhibition of mSlo3 current is voltage-dependent (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, we plotted the conductance-voltage (G-V) relationship by calculating the conductance from the maximum current amplitude at steady-state, as the tail current recordings of mSlo3 were unsuccessful. We noted that V<sub>50</sub> of mSlo3 current shifted to more hyperpolarized potentials in the presence of zinc (V<sub>50</sub> control = 80.67 ± 2.32; V<sub>50</sub> zinc = 49.68 ± 1.38; n=13; <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>As we observed the long-lasting inhibitory effect of zinc on mSlo3 current, we examined whether a zinc chelator could restore the mSlo3 current to the baseline level without applying acidic pH. We used 5 mM EGTA, a divalent cation chelator which strongly chelates zinc (Kd<sub>(Zn)</sub> ∼1 nM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hu et al., 2009</xref>). Zinc-inhibited mSlo3 current could not be recovered by pH 8.0 alone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I</xref>). However, significant current recovery was observed when 5 mM EGTA was included in the pH 8.0 bath solution (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2J</xref>). Specifically, 5 mM EGTA recovered 49.22 ± 16.98 % of the mSlo3 current (n=5), compared to pH 8.0 alone, which showed no significant recovery (5.62 ± 9.22 %; n= 7), as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2K</xref>.</p>
<p>Additionally, we investigated the presence of endogenous zinc in Slo3 by perfusing Ph 8.0 followed by 5 mM EGTA at the beginning of the recording to detect any changes in the baseline current. The baseline current showed a slight increase upon perfusion with 5 mM EGTA, indicating the presence of endogenous zinc affecting the baseline current in Slo3 (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these results showed that zinc has a long-lasting inhibitory effect on mSlo3 current that cannot be reversed by pH 8.0 alone. The inhibitory effect is pH-dependent, as complete inhibition at pH 6.0 followed by recovery at pH 8.0 was observed. In addition, zinc inhibition is voltage-dependent, and the application of 5 mM EGTA, which strongly chelates zinc, can partially recover mSlo3 current.</p>

<title>E169 and E205 located within VSD are important for the sustained zinc inhibition of mSlo3 current</title>
<p>To elucidate the mechanism of zinc inhibition on the mSlo3 channel, we aimed to identify the structural determinants required for this inhibition using a range of computational tools and mutagenesis. First, we used the AlphaFold3 structure prediction webserver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Abramson et al., 2024</xref>) to predict the zinc binding site on the mSlo3 channel. Notably, the prediction has shown that the majority of the zinc binding sites are located in the channel’s intracellular regulator of K<sup>+</sup> conductance (RCK) domain, which consists of RCK1 and RCK2, with very few zinc sites in the transmembrane domain (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

<p>To validate the site within the intracellular region, we conducted site-directed mutagenesis on intracellular domain focusing on RCK1, RCK1/RCK2 linker, and RCK2 (H354R, H383R, H423R, H516R, H564R, H606A, H695R, and H720R) to assess changes in channel sensitivity to zinc. However, we did not observe any significant decrease in the percentage of current inhibition (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). We also generated a chimera where RCK2 of mSlo3 was replaced with RCK2 from mSlo1, but this chimera exhibited slightly increased sensitivity to zinc (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). Taken together, this concludes that, unlike Slo1, the zinc binding site is unlikely to be located in the RCK or the intracellular domain of the channel.</p>
<p>We then diverge our focus to the intracellular site of the channel. Given that zinc has been shown to shift the G-V relationship of the mSlo3 channel and its complex with Lrrc52 (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>), we suspect that the binding site is more likely to be located in the transmembrane (TM) region. To enhance the prediction within the transmembrane segment, we computationally truncated the intracellular domain, allowing a key binding site to be found near E169 and E205 within the voltage-sensing domain (VSD) with the AlphaFold3 structure prediction webserver (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Next, we conducted triplicates of 200 ns molecular dynamics simulations of the AlphaFold3 full-length Slo3 tetrameric structure to validate this binding site where the Slo3 channel is solvated in 0.15 M ZnCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.15 M KCl (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>).

<p>To test the stability of zinc within E169 and E205, we removed all the ZnCl<sub>2</sub> in the simulation box, leaving just 4 zinc ions near E169 residues and conducted three separate simulations for 200 ns, leading to 12 data points.

All of these mutants exhibited similar current inhibition by zinc compared to wildtype (WT = 29.58 ± 4.47 %, n=7; D162S = 19.85 ± 6.71 %, n=3; E169A = 44.17 ± 10.14 %, n=4; E205 = 33.08 ± 5.14 %, n=4; E326 = 27.54 ± 0.89 %, n=2; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B, C</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, when we analyzed the percentage of current recovery of all the mutants, E169A and E205A showed significant current recovery upon the wash-out by pH 8.0 alone (WT = 5.62 ± 9.22 %, n=7; D162S = 0.86 ± 21.71 %, n = 3; E169A = 48.74 ± 15.81 %, n=4; E205A = 48.65 ± 7.19 %, n=4; E326 = −3.27 ± 1.01 %, n=2; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B, D</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5—figure supplement 1C, E</xref>). Taken together, in consistent with MD simulation results, our electrophysiological recordings demonstrated that the long-lasting inhibitory effect of zinc was partly abolished by these mutations. Thus, our findings highlight the contribution of E169A in the bottom of S3 domain and E205A in the bottom of S4 domain in zinc-mediated inhibition of mSlo3 current.</p>

<title>Zinc alters the dynamics of VSD motion in mSlo3</title>
<p>Given the observed zinc-induced shift in the G-V relationship of both mSlo3 and mSlo3+mLrrc52, along with MD simulations and mutagenesis data, it is likely that VSD is involved in zinc inhibition of mSlo3. Then, we performed voltage-clamp fluorometry (VCF) experiments to track the motion of the VSD in the presence and absence of zinc. First, to identify suitable site for labeling with TMRM, we performed VCF scanning by introducing Cys mutations one at a time at the top of S3, S3-S4 linker, and the top of S4 of mSlo3 VCF construct (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Two native, extracellular cysteines were mutated to avoid non-specific labeling (mSLo3 C19S/C131S) and the desired Cys mutations were then added on this double-mutant background. Initial scanning of VCF constructs L188C, K189C, S190C, and N191C (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6—figure supplement 1A-E</xref>) conjugated with TMRM resulted in no detectable fluorescence intensity (F) changes (ΔF). Subsequently, we coexpressed the mSlo3 VCF constructs with mLrrc52 to increase the level of mSlo3 expression in heterologous expression system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Leonetti et al., 2012</xref>). Out of three mutants coexpressed with mLrrc52 (L193C, G194C, and L195C; <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6—figure supplement 1F-H</xref>), L193C, which is located in the top of S4 domain, produced fluorescence intensity changes in response to voltage steps (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>) (ΔF/F= 1.15 ± 0.24 %; n=4).</p>

<p>We next performed VCF recordings in the absence and presence of zinc. Oocytes were held at −60 mV and the step pulses were applied from −160 mV to + 160 mV. Fluorescence change could be observed in response to voltage steps (ΔF/F<sub>Control</sub> = 2.84 ± 0.47 % at +160 mV; n=7; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). A puff of 10 mM zinc solution was then manually injected into the same oocyte using a glass needle with positive pressure. 60 seconds post-injection, a second set of step pulses was applied to record the response under zinc application (ΔF/F<sub>Zinc</sub> = 2.53 ± 0.52 % at +160 mV; n=7; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). In the presence of zinc, the V<sub>50</sub> of fluorescence-voltage (F-V) relationship was shifted into more depolarized potentials (V<sub>50</sub> control = −21.68 ± 3.04; V<sub>50</sub> zinc = 27.04 ± 1.05; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study aims to understand the roles of intracellular zinc in sperm physiology, focusing on sperm capacitation. Our results demonstrated that intracellular zinc is exported from spermatozoa during capacitation. We further discovered that intracellular zinc regulates alkalinization-induced hyperpolarization in mice spermatozoa, mediated by Slo3 channel. Detailed analysis of zinc’s regulatory effects mSlo3 in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte expression system revealed that intracellular zinc directly inhibits mSlo3 currents with exceptionally slow dissociation. By combining MD simulations and electrophysiology, we identified amino acid residues important for zinc-mediated inhibition of Slo3 activities.</p>

<title>Zinc levels are dynamic during capacitation</title>
<p>Using FluoZin3-AM for zinc imaging, we confirmed the presence of intracellular zinc in sperm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), which is consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Henkel et al., 1999</xref>). Our observations revealed that treatment with capacitation medium induced a decrease in zinc fluorescence intensity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B, C</xref>), suggesting that zinc levels are dynamic during capacitation. Previous studies using boar, bull and human spermatozoa have identified four distinct patterns of zinc localization associated with the state of capacitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kerns et al., 2018</xref>). In non-capacitated sperm, high concentration of zinc is present throughout the whole sperm from the sperm head to the whole sperm-tail, and the subcellular zinc localization shifts to a medium level in both the sperm head and the sperm tail mid piece (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kerns et al., 2018</xref>). In congruent with this, our findings also demonstrated a decrease in fluorescence intensity in both the head and flagellum of mice spermatozoa during capacitation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B, C</xref>). We also observed that zinc chelator significantly affected the sperm motility only after, but not before, capacitation (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These findings indicate that zinc dynamics play a crucial role in controlling sperm motility during the capacitation process.</p>
<p>To maintain zinc homeostasis, two protein families facilitate the transport of Zn<sup>2+</sup> across cellular and intracellular membranes in opposite directions: zinc transporter proteins (ZnT) and Zrt-, Irt-like proteins (ZIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kambe et al., 2004</xref>). ZIP12 has been reported to be highly expressed in mouse testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zhu et al., 2022</xref>), as well as ZnT-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Elgazar et al., 2005</xref>). The functional significance of other ZnTs and ZIPs, particularly those related to capacitation, is still largely unclear, leaving the mechanisms of zinc transport in sperm during capacitation poorly understood.</p>

<title>Intracellular zinc directly inhibits mSlo3 channels</title>
<p>Our findings from inside-out patch-clamp recordings indicate that zinc directly inhibits mSlo3 channels in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Zinc inhibition in mSlo3 channels is dependent on pH (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-E</xref>), voltage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G-H</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2</xref>—figure supplement 1A, B) and exhibits a long-lasting inhibitory effect (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I, K</xref>). This sustained inhibitory effect of zinc can be partially restored by EGTA, a divalent ion chelator with high affinity for zinc (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2J, K</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2</xref>—figure supplement 1C, D). Previous studies indicate that zinc also regulates the Slo channel family, albeit with varying effects among Slo3 channel subtypes: zinc activates Slo1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hou et al., 2010</xref>) while inhibiting Slo2.2 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Budelli et al., 2016</xref>; J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). Zinc may produce these opposite effects on Slo2.2 and Slo1 by binding to distinct, non-conserved sites among the subtypes (J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Zinc inhibition on mSlo3 channels is characterized by the slow dissociation of zinc from the channel (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I-K</xref>). Similar slow dissociation has been observed in zinc-regulated ion channels and receptors, such as NMDA and glycine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Paoletti et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Trombley et al., 2011</xref>). In NMDA receptors, high zinc affinity results in slow dissociation, which has been suggested to have a physiological relevance in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Paoletti et al., 1997</xref>). Glycine receptors show complex responses depending on the balance of agonist and antagonist concentrations and whether the receptors have been pre-incubated with zinc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Trombley et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the relatively high IC<sub>50</sub> of zinc inhibition for mSlo3 channels (145.2 µM), the slow dissociation usually indicates high-affinity binding. This might be due to the ∼40-second zinc application time in our study, which may have been insufficient to fully observe the effects at lower concentrations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B, C</xref>). Extended exposure of intracellular zinc in sperm could potentially result in greater inhibition.</p>
<p>Our results also show that when mSlo3 is coexpressed with Lrrc52 the lower concentration of zinc was sufficient to inhibit mSlo3 channels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Although we still did not identify the exact mechanism underlying it, Lrrc52 shifts the gating of mSlo3 to more hyperpolarized potentials and lower pH, making the channel easier to open (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Leonetti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Yang et al., 2011</xref>; X. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Zeng et al., 2015</xref>). Considering that the zinc inhibition of Slo3 depends on membrane potential and intracellular pH, it is understandable that the presence of this auxiliary subunit would lead to more efficient inhibition by zinc.</p>

<title>Structural determinants of zinc inhibition in the mSlo3 channel</title>
<p>We identified potential key amino acids in the mSlo3 channel that may serve as zinc binding sites using MD simulations and amino acid mutagenesis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>; <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Previous studies on the Slo channel family indicates that zinc binding sites are located in RCK1 domain for Slo1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hou et al., 2010</xref>) and RCK2 domain for Slo2.2 (J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). However, in mSlo3 channel, our results didn’t show that either RCK1 or RCK2 may serve as zinc binding site (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4— figure supplement 1</xref>). Our MD simulations focusing on transmembrane region of mSlo3 channel suggest two possible zinc binding locations: one located within the intracellular part of the VSD and another one close to the pore (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B, C</xref>; <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Given that zinc affects the G-V relationship of mSlo3 and its complex with Lrrc52, we focused on the VSD site.</p>
<p>Our analysis of current recovery for mutants in the VSD region revealed that E169A and E205A showed significant recovery upon wash-out with pH 8.0. This result aligns with MD simulations showing faster zinc dissociation for both E169A and E205A, indicating their contributions in zinc-mediated inhibition. Thus, the cluster of negative residues within the VSD serve as the zinc binding site in the mSlo3 channel.</p>
<p>However, our single amino acid mutations in this site, which contains clustered negative residues, did not significantly change zinc-mediated current reduction compared to the wildtype. This may be due to mutating one single amino acid might not be sufficient to fully elucidate other contributing residues in the predicted mSlo3 zinc binding site. Thus, more extensive mutagenesis studies will be needed to fully understand zinc inhibition in mSlo3.</p>

<title>Physiological relevance of zinc inhibition of the mSlo3 channel in mouse sperm</title>
<p>Zinc is thought to be involved in capacitation and the acrosome reaction, suggesting its role in regulating sperm fertilizing ability <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aonuma et al., 1978</xref>). This finding is supported by studies indicating that seminal zinc inhibits sperm’s ability to undergo the acrosome reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Riffo et al., 1992</xref>). However, the specific function of intracellular zinc in relation to the capacitation process has not been thoroughly investigated. Previous research indicates that zinc inhibits sperm motility in ejaculation medium as well as acrosome reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Henkel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Riffo et al., 1992</xref>), leading to the hypothesis that zinc might influence capacitation.</p>
<p>Slo3 plays a critical role in sperm fertility, since mice lacking Slo3 are infertile despite their normal sperm morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Santi et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, our previous work showed that VSP-deficient sperm exhibited enhanced Slo3 channel activity, which indirectly increases Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and results in abnormal sperm motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kawai et al., 2019</xref>). Taken together, our findings suggest that intracellular zinc is potentially a key regulator of sperm capacitation, functioning through inhibition of the Slo3 channel. Therefore, this study highlights the critical role of intracellular zinc in the regulation of sperm capacitation.</p>

<p>Patches were perfused with: (1) bath solution containing 184 mM potassium gluconate, 10 mM KOH and 10 mM HEPES in pH 6.0, 7.5, and 8.0; (2) zinc-containing bath solution at pH 7.5 and pH 8.0, with zinc concentrations of 0.1, 1, 10, 100, and 1000 µM. (3) bath solution containing 5 mM EGTA in pH 8.0. All pH values were adjusted using methanesulfonic acid. Slo3 macroscopic currents were evoked by an alkaline pH and by a depolarizing ramp pulse (from −100 mV to +100 mV with the holding potential of either - 60 mV or 0 mV) or step pulses (from −100 mV to +180 mV with the holding potential at - 60 mV). All bath solutions were perfused using a high-speed perfusion system ALA-VM8 OCTAFLOW (ALA Scientific Instruments Inc.)</p>

<title>Voltage-clamp fluorometry (VCF) recording of mSlo3</title>
<p>In mSlo3 VCF construct, the target labeling site (in S3-S4 linker) was substituted with cysteine residue. Two native, extracellular cysteines were mutated to avoid non-specific labeling (mSLo3 C19S/C131S). Oocytes for VCF recordings were labeled with Tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide (TMRM) (Invitrogen). In prior to VCF recordings, oocytes were incubated in a labeling solutions (120 mM K-methanesulfonate (MES), 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4) containing 10 µM TMRM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Savalli et al., 2006</xref>) on ice for 1 hour. Labeled oocytes were then rinsed in TMRM-free ND96 solution four times and kept in the dark until and throughout the recording.</p>
<p>Oocytes were placed in a recording chamber with the animal pole facing upward and held at −60 mV. For screening experiments, step pulses ranging from −80 mV to +160 mV were applied, while pulses from −160 mV to +160 mV were used for direct zinc injection experiments. For the VCF recording in the absence and presence of zinc, voltage steps were first applied to record the initial response. Subsequently, a puff of 10 mM zinc solution was manually injected into the same oocyte using a glass needle and positive pressure. Sixty seconds post-injection, a second set of step pulses was applied to record the response under zinc application. In VCF recording, borosilicate glass capillaries (Harvard Apparatus) were used with a resistance of 0.2–0.4 MΩ when filled with 3 M KOAc and 10 mM KCl. Bath solution contained 96 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4-7.5, with NaOH was used for recordings.</p>
<p>Fluorometric recordings were performed with an upright fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX50WI) equipped with a water immersion objective lens (Olympus XLUMPLAN FL 20x/1.00) to collect the emission light from the voltage-clamped oocytes. The light from LED source (MCWHL8 Thorlabs) was applied through a band-pass excitation filter (531 nm/40 nm BrightLine: Semrock). Emitted light was passed through band pass emission filter of 593nm/40nm (BrightLine, Semrock). The emission signals were detected by a photomultiplier (H10722-20; Hamamatsu Photonics). The detected emission intensities were acquired by a Digidata 1440A (Axon Instruments) and Clampex 10.3 software (Molecular Devices) at 25 kHz for VCF mutants screening and 50 kHz for VCF recording in the absence and presence of zinc. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio, VCF recording was repeated 3 times. Averaged data were used for data presentation and analysis.</p>

<title>Three-dimensional structural modeling of mouse Slo3 and prediction of zinc binding site</title>
<p>The amino acid sequence of mouse Slo3 (mSlo3) (O54982-1) was obtained from the UniProt database (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) and was retrieved from NCBI NP_032458.3 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). The sequence (only the transmembrane region from residue M1 to G330, or the full-length protein) was input to the AlphaFold3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Abramson et al., 2024</xref>) structural modelling web platform to generate an initial structure with (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) or without (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>) 50 zinc ions.

<title>Flooding simulations</title>
<p>The full-length mSlo3 from the AlphaFold3 webserver was trimmed to remove long disordered regions (residue 1-18, 616-698 and 1050-1121), resulting in 12 separate chains. The mSlo3 complex was embedded into the POPC bilayer and solvated in 0.15 M NaCl and 0.15 ZnCl<sub>2</sub> using CHARMM-GUI Membrane Builder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). The production run simulations were simulated with a 2 fs timestep using the CHARMM36m forcefield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Huang et al., 2016</xref>) in GROMACS 2023.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abraham et al., 2023</xref>). The system was then energy minimized and equilibrated using the standard six steps CHARMM-GUI equilibration protocol. This includes the following set-up: The protein backbone was restrained at the force constant of 4000, 2000, 1000, 500, 200 and 50 kJmol<sup>-1</sup>nm<sup>-2</sup>, the protein side chains were restrained with the force constant of 2000, 1000, 500, 200, 50, and 0 kJmol<sup>-1</sup>nm<sup>-2</sup>, the lipids non-H atoms were restrained at the force constant of 1000, 400, 400, 200, 40 and 0 kJmol<sup>-1</sup>nm<sup>-2</sup> and the dihedral restraint was set at the force constant of 1000, 400, 200, 200, 100 and 0 kJmol<sup>-1</sup>rad<sup>-2</sup>. The simulations were equilibrated with a 1 fs timestep for 125 ps for the first three steps, and then to a 2 fs timestep for 500 ps the next two, and 5 ns for the final step. The first two steps were conducted with the NVT ensemble, whereas the last four were conducted with the NPT ensemble. All equilibration runs were conducted at 310 K using Berendsen thermostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Berendsen et al., 1984</xref>). In all NPT ensemble equilibration, the semi-isotropic pressure was maintained at 1 bar using Berendsen barostat. The production runs were conducted for 200 ns under 310 K using the v-rescale thermostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bussi et al., 2007</xref>). The semi-isotropic pressure of all systems was maintained at 1 bar using a C-rescale barostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bernetti &amp; Bussi, 2020</xref>). All simulations were carried out in triplicates, where velocity was randomly generated at the beginning of every simulation. All simulation frames were saved every 0.1 ns.</p>

<p>Based on the flooding simulations, the binding pose for Zn<sup>2+</sup> is adjusted so that the ion is 3-4 Å away from E169. This results in the system with 4 Zn<sup>2+</sup> per system, one per subunit. The system was then energy minimized using the steepest descent algorithm and equilibrated with the Cα restraint at 1000 kJ kJmol<sup>-1</sup>nm<sup>-2</sup> for 10 ns. The production run was conducted for 200 ns, with the same barostat and thermostat setting as the flooding simulation.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Inside-out patch-clamp data were analyzed using Clampfit 11.3 software (Molecular Devices), Igor Pro 6.22A (Wavemetrics), and GraphPad Prism 10. Analysis of current-voltage (I-V) were obtained from the maximum current amplitude at steady-state. I-V relationship was fitted with Boltzmann equation:

where G is a scaling factor (maximum conductance or current), V<sub>50</sub> is the midpoint, and s is the slope value.</p>
<p>And then the I-V relationship in the presence of 100 µM of ZnCl<sub>2</sub> was fitted with Woodhull equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Woodhull, 1973</xref>) to express the current as a function of voltage, incorporating both the voltage-dependent gating of the channel and the voltage-dependent blocking of the channel:

</disp-formula>
<p>where V<sub>block</sub> is the voltage at which blocking is half-maximal, Slope<sub>block</sub> is the slope factor for the voltage dependence of the blocking effect, and δ is the fraction of the membrane potential that the blocking ion experiences.</p>
<p>V<sub>rev</sub> is the reversal potential and was calculated with following equation as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Schreiber et al., 1998</xref>) using Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation:

<p>Conductance-voltage (G-V) relationship of Slo3 were obtained from conductance calculation using the following equation:
<disp-formula id="eqn5">
<graphic xlink:href="628223v1_eqn5.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
V<sub>rev</sub> was calculated using <xref rid="eqn4" ref-type="disp-formula">equation (4)</xref> and fitted to Boltzmann equation in (1), adjusted for G-V.</p>
<p>IC<sub>50</sub> (half maximal inhibitory concentration) was calculated using equation while constraining the Hill Slope to a constant value of −1.0:
<disp-formula id="eqn6">
<graphic xlink:href="628223v1_eqn6.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where I<sub>max</sub> is the maximal current when inhibition is minimal, I<sub>min</sub> is the minimal current inhibition is maximal, and X is the inhibitor concentration.</p>
<p>Arithmetic operations were performed by Clampfit to compensate bleaching from the fluorescence traces:
<disp-formula id="eqn7">
<graphic xlink:href="628223v1_eqn7.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where [time] is the value of the point given by Clampfit.</p>
<p>All the compensated traces were then normalized by setting each baseline level (F signal at −60 mV, the holding potential) to be 1, to calculate the % F change:

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In their manuscript, Andriani et al. show intracellular zinc is exported from sperm during capacitation and suppresses the alkalinization-induced hyperpolarization in sperm. Intracellular zinc inhibits Slo3 current, which is enhanced by the co-expression of gamma subunit Lrrc52. Computational studies reveal that the Zn binding site on mSlo3 is located near E169 and E205, which are involved in the sustained zinc inhibition of mSlo3 current. The authors propose that intracellular zinc plays a key role in sperm capacitation by inhibiting the Slo3 channel.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, the work appears well-designed (e.g., oocyte patch-clamp experiments), and clearly presented. Three-dimensional structural modeling and flooding simulations are executed.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The simple mutagenesis analysis of E169 and E205 showed partial abolishment, but the molecular mechanism by which zinc inhibits Slo3 current is not yet fully shown. The authors should consider performing more extensive experiments, such as creating double mutants or combination mutants involving other residues. Additionally, could other mechanisms explain the role of zinc in regulating the Slo3 current?</p>
<p>While elucidating the mechanism of Slo3 is interesting, there is substantial literature indicating how zinc regulates channel functions at a molecular level. Given this, the manuscript should provide a deeper understanding by clearly elucidating the molecular mechanism of the regulation of Slo3 current by zinc.</p>
<p>
The manuscript includes no experimental data on the mechanism of intracellular zinc export during sperm capacitation, despite being crucial for the regulation of sperm function.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, Andriani and colleagues are examining the potential role of Zn flux in sperm and its effect on Slo3 channels. This is an interesting question that is likely critical to how sperm function properly and Slo3 channels are a possible candidate for a downstream molecule that is impacted by Zn. In this paper, the authors use Zn imaging, sperm motility assays, and electrophysiology to show that Zn flux impacts sperm function. They then go on to look at the impact Zn has on Slo3 current and propose a binding site based on MD simulations. While the ideas are interesting, the experiments are not well described in many places making understanding the results very difficult. In addition, critical controls are missing throughout the paper.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The question of how Zn flux impacts membrane potential and sperm motility is an important one. Moreover, Slo3 presents an interesting candidate or the target of Zn regulation. The combination of methods used here also has the potential to uncover mechanisms of Zn regulation of Slo3.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Much of the paper lacks experimental description which makes interpretation quite difficult, or a detailed discussion is missing. Examples include:</p>
<p>(1) Figure 1, particularly the Zn imaging, is not sufficiently described. How is the fluorescence intensity measured? A representative ROI? The whole tail and head? Are the sperm immobile? If not, there is evidence that motion artifacts can significantly distort these sorts of measures from Calcium measurements in Cilia. Were there controls done? Is the small amount of Zn seen in the tail above the background?</p>
<p>(2) The second half of Figure 1 is also not well described. What is the extracellular solution in the recordings? When you apply the Zn ionophore, do you expect influx or efflux? I assume efflux is based on the conclusions but this should be discussed explicitly.</p>
<p>(3) Figure 2H labels the Y axis, &quot;normalized current&quot;. Normalized to what? Why do neither of the curves end at 1? A better description of what this figure represents is needed.</p>
<p>(4) The alpha fold simulations are not well described. How many Zn binding sites were found? Are all of the histidine mutations in Figure 4 Supplement 1 the ones that were found?</p>
<p>(5) There is no discussion of physiological intracellular Zn concentration. How much Zn is inside the sperm? How much if likely Free vs buffered? Is 100uM a reasonable physiological concentration?</p>
<p>There are a number of areas where the interpretation is not well supported by the data including:</p>
<p>(6) You say in the Figure 4 supplement, that &quot;we did not observe any significant decrease in the percentage of current inhibition.&quot; But that is a pretty misleading statement. There are large changes (increases) in the amount of zinc inhibition. These might be allosteric changes but I don't think you can safely eliminate these as relevant Zn binding sites. Also, some of these mutations appear to allow at least some unbinding of Zn.</p>
<p>(7) Following up on the above point, it seems unfair to conclude that the D162S, E169A, and E205 mutants are part of the inhibitory binding site for Zn when the mutation has no effect on inhibition and only an effect on the washout. The mutations on the intracellular side also had an impact on the washout so it seems equally likely that they are the critical residues based on your data.</p>
<p>(8) Nowhere in the paper do you make the specific link between Zn flux and membrane hyperpolariation via Slo3. You show that Zn flux changes the ability of the sperm to hyperpolarize and you show that Slo3 is inhibited by Zn but the connection between the two is not demonstrated. There appears to be a specific Slo3 blocker. If you use this in sperm, do you no longer see the Zn effect?</p>
<p>(9) In the second half of Figure 1, the authors suggest that there is &quot;no hyperpolization in 100uM Zn. That is not really true. It is reduced but not absent.</p>
<p>(10) The claim that Lrcc52 with Slo3 shows a higher current inhibition at pH 7.5 than pH 8 is not well supported because there are only 3 replicates in the 7.5 case. In addition, the claim is made in the test that 100uM ZnCl2 &quot;already inhibited mSlo3+Lrcc52 at pH7.5&quot;, contrasted with mSlo3 alone, is not tested statistically.</p>
<p>In a number of places, better controls are needed.</p>
<p>(11) How specific is this effect for Zn? Mg2+, for instance, is also a divalent cation that is in the hundreds of uM range inside the cell. Does it exert the same effect? Each ion certainly has unique preferred coordination geometries, does your predicted binding with MD show what you might expect for tetrahedral coordination with Zn? Did you test other divalent cations functionally or in silicon?</p>
<p>(12) For the VCF experiments, a significantly higher concentration of Zn was used (10mM). What is the reason for this? There is no discussion of how much a &quot;puff&quot; is. Assuming you are using the RNA injector it is probably on the order of 50nL or less. Assuming the volume of an oocyte is 1uL that would argue that the final concentration is 500uM or higher. But this is also complicated by potential local effects of high Zn at the injection site, artifacts of injecting that much metal, and the fact that a great deal of the Zn will likely be bound to other things inside the cell. Better controls are needed for this experiment.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study titled &quot;Zinc is a Key Regulator of the Sperm-Specific K+ Channel (Slo3) Function&quot; aims to investigate the role of intracellular zinc in sperm capacitation and its regulation of the sperm-specific Slo3 potassium channel. Capacitation is a crucial physiological process that enables sperm to fertilize an egg, and membrane hyperpolarization through Slo3 activation is a well-established event in this process. The authors propose that intracellular zinc dynamically decreases during capacitation and inhibits Slo3-mediated K⁺ currents, thereby playing a regulatory role in sperm function.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Novel Contribution to Sperm Physiology.</p>
<p>The study provides new insights into how zinc dynamics contribute to sperm capacitation, specifically through its direct inhibition of Slo3 activity.</p>
<p>
Previous research has focused primarily on extracellular zinc's effect on sperm function; this work expands the discussion to intracellular zinc regulation, an area with limited prior investigation.</p>
<p>(2) Strong Electrophysiological Evidence.</p>
<p>The study employs inside-out patch-clamp recordings in Xenopus oocytes to demonstrate zinc's direct inhibition of Slo3 currents.</p>
<p>
The observed slow dissociation of zinc from Slo3 suggests a long-lasting regulatory effect, adding to the understanding of ion channel modulation in sperm cells.</p>
<p>(3) Molecular Mechanistic Insights</p>
<p>Using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and mutagenesis, the authors identify potential zinc-binding sites within Slo3's voltage-sensing domain (VSD), particularly E169 and E205.</p>
<p>These computational predictions are supported by electrophysiological recordings, strengthening the argument that zinc directly binds and inhibits Slo3.</p>
<p>(4) Physiological Relevance and Functional Implications</p>
<p>The study suggests that zinc inhibition of Slo3 could contribute to sperm motility regulation during capacitation.</p>
<p>The authors provide sperm motility assays as supporting evidence, showing that zinc chelation affects motility only after capacitation has begun, suggesting a dynamic role of intracellular zinc in the capacitation process.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the study presents compelling electrophysiological data and molecular insights, there are several critical gaps that must be addressed before fully supporting the physiological relevance of the findings.</p>
<p>(1) The authors should measure the effects in sperm cells using the patch-clamp technique to directly record Slo3 currents. By normalizing Slo3 currents to cell capacitance at different intracellular zinc concentrations, the authors can quantitatively assess the extent of Slo3 inhibition by zinc and strengthen the physiological relevance of their findings.</p>
<p>(2) Lack of Controls in Non-Capacitated Sperm</p>
<p>The claim that zinc is exported from sperm during capacitation needs stronger experimental validation.</p>
<p>The authors did not include a control group of non-capacitated sperm in key fluorescence imaging experiments, making it difficult to confirm that the observed zinc decrease is capacitation-specific rather than a general zinc redistribution process.</p>
<p>To strengthen this conclusion, experiments should be performed in non-capacitating conditions to determine whether intracellular zinc levels remain unchanged.</p>
<p>(3) Unclear Role of Zinc in Physiological Capacitation</p>
<p>The study clearly demonstrates zinc inhibition of Slo3 but does not sufficiently establish how this affects capacitation at a functional level.</p>
<p>Additional motility and capacitation markers should be analyzed to confirm that zinc influences sperm behavior beyond Slo3 inhibition.</p>
<p>(4) Insufficient Data on Zinc-Slo3 Specificity</p>
<p>The authors should consider using quinidine, a known washable Slo3 inhibitor, to confirm that zinc acts specifically on Slo3 channels rather than other endogenous ion channels.</p>
<p>The study would benefit from including washout controls in the inside-out patch-clamp recordings, as seen in Figure 3-Supplement 1, to confirm that zinc inhibition is reversible or long-lasting.</p>
<p>(5) Missing Discussion of Zinc's Role in CatSper Regulation</p>
<p>The study focuses solely on Slo3 but does not mention CatSper, the principal Ca²⁺ channel essential for sperm capacitation.</p>
<p>Zinc has been reported to inhibit CatSper activity, which could significantly impact sperm function.</p>
<p>The discussion should address whether zinc's effect on Slo3 represents a broader regulatory mechanism influencing multiple ion channels during capacitation.</p>
<p>Final Assessment</p>
<p>This work presents important findings on zinc regulation of Slo3 channels, supported by strong electrophysiological and molecular analyses. However, the physiological relevance of these findings remains unclear due to missing controls, and needs additional functional assays. Addressing these issues would significantly enhance the manuscript's scientific rigor and impact.</p>
