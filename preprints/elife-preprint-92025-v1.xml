<title>Abstract</title><p>Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have great potential to be used as alternatives to embryonic stem cells (hESCs) in regenerative medicine and disease modelling, thereby avoiding ethical issues arising from the use of embryo-derived cells. However, despite clear similarities between the two cell types, it is likely they are not identical. In this study we characterise the proteomes of multiple hiPSC and hESC lines derived from independent donors. We find that while hESCs and hiPSCs express a near identical set of proteins, they show consistent quantitative differences in the expression levels of a wide subset of proteins. hiPSCs have increased total protein content, while maintaining a comparable cell cycle profile to hESCs. The proteomic data show hiPSCs have significantly increased abundance of vital cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins required to sustain high growth rates, including nutrient transporters and metabolic proteins, which correlated with phenotypic differences between hiPSCs and hESCs. Thus, higher levels of glutamine transporters correlated with increased glutamine uptake, while higher levels of proteins involved in lipid synthesis correlated with increased lipid droplet formation. Some of the biggest metabolic changes were seen in proteins involved in mitochondrial metabolism, with corresponding enhanced mitochondrial potential, shown experimentally using high-resolution respirometry. hiPSCs also produced higher levels of secreted proteins including ECM components and growth factors, some with known tumorigenic properties as well as proteins involved in the inhibition of the immune system. Our data indicate that reprogramming of human fibroblasts to iPSCs effectively restores protein expression in cell nuclei to a similar state to hESCs, but does not similarly restore the profile of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins, with consequences for cell phenotypes affecting growth and metabolism. The data improve understanding of the molecular differences between induced and embryonic stem cells with implications for potential risks and benefits for their use in future disease modelling and therapeutic applications.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Human embryonic stem cells (hESC) are derived from the inner cell mass of a pre-implantation embryo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. They show prolonged undifferentiated potential, as well as the ability to differentiate into the three main embryonic germ layers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, making them excellent models for studying disease mechanisms, development and differentiation. However, their use remains restricted by regulations, based in part upon ethical considerations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Over a decade ago, methods allowing the induction of pluripotent stem cells from fibroblast cultures, in both human and mice, were developed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. These reports showed that by exogenously expressing a small set of key transcription factors (Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc and Klf4), a somatic cell could be reprogrammed back into a pluripotent state, characterised by their capacity for self-renewal and ability to differentiate into the three main germ layers. These human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) show many key features of their physiological embryonic stem cell (hESC) counterparts, while avoiding many of the ethical issues regarding the use of stem cells derived from embryos.</p>
<p>Since the discovery of reprogramming methods, hiPSC lines have attracted great interest, particularly for their potential use as alternatives to hESCs in regenerative medicine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> and disease modelling, including studies on monogenic disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, and some late onset diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. However, to understand the value of using hiPSCs in regenerative therapy, drug development and/or studies of disease mechanisms, it is important to establish how similar hiPSCs are to hESCs at the molecular and functional levels. To address this, multiple studies have compared hiPSCs and hESCs, using a variety of assays, including methylation analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, transcriptomics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> and even quantitative proteomics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. It should be noted, however, that many of these earlier studies were performed at a time when reprogramming protocols were less robust<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> and when the depth of proteome coverage and quantitative information that could be obtained was lower than today.</p>
<p>In this study, we have addressed the similarity of hiPSCs to hESCs by performing a detailed proteomic analysis, comparing a set of hiPSC lines derived from human primary skin fibroblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> of independent, healthy donors, with several independent hESC lines. The data highlight that while both types of stem cell lines have very similar global protein abundance profiles, they also show some specific and significant quantitative differences in protein expression. In particular, the reprogramed iPSC lines consistently display higher total protein levels, predominantly affecting cytoplasmic proteins required to sustain higher growth, along with mitochondrial changes, and an excess of secreted proteins, with impact upon cell phenotypes.</p>

<title>hESCs and hiPSCs display quantitative differences in protein abundances</title>
<p>For this study, we compared multiple hESC and hiPSC lines, all derived from different donors and cultured using identical growth conditions. First, the expression levels of the main pluripotency markers were verified in each of the lines, with no differences detected between the respective hESC and hiPSC cell types (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). From these data representative sets of four hiPSCs and four hESCs lines were selected for detailed proteomic analysis using mass spectrometry. The proteomes were characterised using tandem mass tags (TMT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, within a single 10-plex (Table S1) and using MS3-based synchronous precursor selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> (SPS). To further optimise quantification accuracy, each sample was allocated to a specific isobaric tag to minimise cross-population reporter ion interference (Fig.1b), as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. In total 8,491 protein groups (henceforth referred to as ‘proteins’), were detected at 1% FDR, with &gt;99% overlap between the proteins detected from both the hESC and hiPSC lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). However, it is important to highlight that TMT is not the right method to use when looking for proteins that are specific to one condition or population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>To provide a quantitative comparison of the respective proteomes, we focussed on analysing the 7,878 proteins that were detected with at least 2 unique and razor peptides (see methods). After confirming that there were no differences in the abundance levels of histones between the two cell types (Fig. S1), protein copy numbers were estimated via the “proteomic ruler”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> (see methods). The copy number data highlighted that both the hESC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>) and hiPSC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>) proteomes display a similar dynamic range, with estimated protein copy numbers extending from a median of less than 100 copies, to over 100 million copies per cell. Furthermore, the composition of the respective proteomes is highly similar. Both cell types display high expression levels of ribosomal proteins, protein chaperones and glycolytic enzymes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>&amp;g), consistent with rapid proliferation and dependence on glycolysis for energy generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. It is only when the quantitative data are examined in more detail that differences between the cell types become apparent (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h</xref>). A principal component analysis (PCA), based on the protein copy numbers, revealed a clear separation between the two stem cell populations within the main component of variation, which accounted for 69% of variance. The PCA suggested that the independent iPSC lines were clearly different to the hESC lines, and vice versa.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Standard normalisation methods mask changes in total protein content in hiPSCs compared to hESCs</title>
<p>A previous proteomic study reported that there were virtually no protein level differences between hESCs and hiPSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. However, in that study the intensity data were median normalised. We therefore decided to compare two different normalisation methods: i.e., the previously used median normalisation method and the “proteomic ruler”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. The median normalisation produces concentration-like results and is frequently used to normalise proteomic data. With this approach, our data also show no major differences in protein abundances between the hESC and hiPSC lines (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>), i.e. ∼94% of all proteins displayed no significant changes in abundance (FC&gt;1.5-fold; q-value &lt; 0.001), similar to the previously reported conclusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. However, median (or total intensity) normalisation methods lack the capacity to detect changes in absolute abundance, cell size or protein content. By artificially forcing all medians to be almost identical, such changes are invisible.</p>

</fig>
<p>This is not the case for the results produced with the “proteomic ruler”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. The copy number-based analysis enables an approximation to absolute protein abundance and can reveal changes in cell mass as we previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Using the proteomic ruler method highlighted systematic differences between hESCs and hiPSCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>), with 56% (4,408/7,878) of all proteins detected significantly increased in hiPSCs (FC&gt;1.5-fold; q-value &lt; 0.001). In contrast, only 40 proteins (0.5%) showed significantly lower expression levels in hiPSCs. With thousands of proteins displaying higher abundance, we hypothesised that hiPSCs have higher total protein content, compared to hESCs. Using the protein copy numbers to estimate the total protein content showed that hiPSCs had &gt;50% higher protein content compared to hESCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). To validate this observation, an independent assay (EZQ<sup>TM</sup> assay; see methods), was used to measure the total protein yield from similar numbers of freshly grown hiPSCs and hESCs. From these experiments, the calculated protein amount per million cells was 74% higher (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>; p-value=0.0018) in hiPSCs, relative to hESCs. We conclude that hiPSCs have a higher total protein content.</p>
<p>Changes in protein content could potentially be linked to differences in the cell cycle profile. Hence, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to study the cell cycle distribution of hESCs and hiPSCs. The FACS data showed that hiPSCs have significantly higher forward scatter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>), correlated to increased cell size, as well as significantly higher side scatter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>), correlating to increased cell granularity. However, the FACS analysis revealed no significant differences between hiPSCs and hESCs in the percentage of cells at each of the cell cycle stages (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). We conclude that hiPSCs have significantly higher total protein content, with increased size and granularity, but that these differences with hESCs are independent of changes in cell cycle distribution.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>hiPSCs have elevated nutrient transporters, metabolic proteins, and protein and lipid synthesis machinery</title>
<p>To maintain a higher protein content than hEScs with a comparable cell cycle profile, hiPSCs would require higher protein synthesis capacity, which in turn requires nutrients and energy. Energy metabolism in primed pluripotent stem cells is largely dependent on glycolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, which is sensitive to glucose uptake and lactate shuttling. Therefore, we compared the expression of the respective glucose and lactate transporters between hiPSCs and hESCs. The data showed both main glucose transporters, GLUT1 (SLC2A1) and GLUT3 (SLC2A3), had higher abundance in hiPSCs, as did the lactate transporters SLC16A1 and SLC16A3 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Other rate limiting enzymes, including Hexokinase 1 (HK1) and 2 (HK2) were also significantly increased within hiPSCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>), suggesting increased glycolytic potential.</p>

<p>Nutrient uptake is mostly handled by the SLC (solute carrier) group of membrane transporters. Analysis of the 15 most upregulated SLC transporters in hiPSCs compared to hESCs showed that they mostly belonged to two categories, i.e., amino acid and mitochondrial transporters (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). Amino acids are vital to sustain high rates of protein synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> and the data showed that 11/12 amino acid transporters were significantly increased in hiPSCs, compared to hESCs, including the hyper abundant, present at &gt;4 million copies per cell, protein SLC3A2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). The highest fold increases, &gt;4-fold, was seen for SLC38A1 and SLC38A2, both of which are major glutamine transporters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We next examined whether the increased abundance of the glutamine transporters had phenotypic impact, i.e., whether it correlated with increased glutamine uptake within hiPSCs. To test this hypothesis, we measured the uptake of radio-labelled glutamine in both hiPSCs and hESCs (see methods). The data showed that hiPSCs had a median of &gt;90% higher uptake of glutamine, compared to hESCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). Glutamine has been reported to be the most consumed amino acid in hESCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> and its catabolism to be one of the vital metabolic pathways that can provide ATP and more importantly biosynthetic precursors required to sustain growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Hence, we also explored the abundance of enzymes involved in glutaminolysis and found that vital proteins, including GLS, GLUD1, GPT2 and GOT2, were also significantly higher in hiPSCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>).</p>
<p>Having established that hiPSCs have increased expression of nutrient transporters and higher expression of enzymes in key metabolic pathways, compared with hESCs, we next looked at the machinery required for protein synthesis. The levels of many of the proteins involved in ribosome subunit biogenesis, including ribosomal proteins, were higher in hiPSCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>). The increased expression of translation machinery components, nutrient transporters and many metabolic enzymes is consistent with the increased total protein content seen within hiPSCs.</p>
<p>The data also highlighted increased fatty acid (FA) and lipid droplet (LD) synthesis potential in hiPSCs, with increased abundance of the SREBP1 (SREBF1; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h</xref>), master regulator of lipid synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, as well as FASN (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3i</xref>) and SCD (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3j</xref>). Similarly, a crucial regulator for LD assembly, PLIN3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3k</xref>), displayed &gt;2-fold increased abundance in hiPSCs. To examine the potential phenotypic impact of this increased abundance of proteins involved in LD synthesis, we performed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses to compare hiPS and hES cells. This showed that LDs were clearly visible in hiPSCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3l</xref>), but not visible in hESCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3m</xref>). We conclude that the hiPSCs have elevated levels of LDs, resulting from the increased expression of proteins involved in lipid synthesis and LD assembly.</p>

<p>The analysis of transporter proteins revealed a cluster of 22/27 mitochondrial transporters were significantly increased in hiPSCs, including the hyper abundant, &gt;10 million copies per cell, ATP/ADP transporter (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). A subset of 14 transporters displayed &gt;2-fold increased abundance and this included the acylcarnitine transporter SLC25A20 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>), which is part of the carnitine shuttle in the beta oxidation pathway. Other component of the shuttle, CPT1A, displayed over 4-fold higher abundance in hiPSCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>), suggesting an important role. Data showed it was not just fatty acid oxidation but also synthesis that was affected, with proteins acting in the mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mFAS) pathway also increased in abundance. MCAT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref>), MECR (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4h</xref>) and OXSM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4i</xref>) all displayed ∼2-fold higher abundance in hiPSCs compared to hESCs. These results have a metabolic relevance as mFAS has been reported to control the electron transport chain (ETC) activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, which was also increased in hiPSCs as subunits of all 5 ETC complexes increased in abundance in hiPSCs and with complex II and III showing the most prominent effects (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4j</xref>). Complex II is also part of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, which displayed increased in abundance in the majority of proteins involved in the pathway (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4k</xref>).</p>
<p>As the proteomic data showed clear differences between hiPSCs and hESCs in the levels of mitometabolism proteins, we performed experiments to explore whether this was reflected in phenotypic differences between hiPSCs and hESCs. This was tested using high-resolution respirometry (see Methods). The data showed that hiPSCs had a higher P/E control ratio to hESCs, which denotes an increased capacity of the phosphorylation system to produce ATP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4l</xref>). We conclude that hiPSCs have elevated levels of mitometabolism proteins relative to hESCs, resulting in higher respiratory activity.</p>

<title>hiPSCs upregulate secreted proteins affecting their microenvironment</title>
<p>Among the most upregulated proteins in hiPSCs were a subset of secreted proteins. Secreted proteins are of great importance because changes in their absolute abundance can affect the extracellular environment. These secreted proteins mostly represented 4 categories: structural extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, growth factors, protease inhibitors and proteases (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). The ECM can provide both support for cells as well as active participation in cell signalling by providing domains for growth factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. It can also be reshaped by tumours to promote cancer cell growth and migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. The data show that both the laminins, and collagens were all increased in abundance in hiPSCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). Collagens are reported to alter the stiffness of the ECM and their synthesis is iron intensive. Interestingly, the data also show that proteins involved in importing and storing iron were increased in abundance in hiPSCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c-f</xref>).</p>

<p>The data also showed that 13 growth factors were increased in abundance in hiPSCs, compared to hESCs. A subset of these, i.e., FGF1, FGF2 and NODAL, are reported to have direct relevance to the maintenance of pluripotency and can modulate important processed in PSCs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g</xref>).

<title>hiPSCs display increased abundance of immunosuppressive proteins</title>
<p>NODAL wasn’t the only growth factor in TGFB family member that was increased in hiPSCs, with TGFB1 displaying a ∼5-fold increase in abundance in hiPSCs compared to hESCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5j</xref>). Besides its role as a growth factor, TGFB1 has been shown to have important roles in the regulation of the immune response, promoting the generation of regulatory T cells, while inhibiting the generation and function of effector T cells. As immunogenicity of PSCs is a topic of relevance to clinical adaptations, we looked for differences in modulators of the immune response.</p>
<p>Arginine availability is vital to effector T cells and other leukocytes, where depletion mediated by Arginase has been shown to be linked to and T cell inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Our data show that hiPSCs have ∼2.5-fold higher abundance of ARG1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5k</xref>).

<p>hiPSCs also displayed increased abundance of inhibitory ligands that supress the immune function of other leukocytes.

<title>hiPSCs display reduced abundance of H1 histones</title>
<p>A striking feature of this proteomic study is how few proteins (&lt;1%; 40/7,878), showed significantly decreased abundance in hiPSCs, compared to hESCs. A high proportion of these proteins affected nuclear processes. Thus, an overrepresentation analysis showed that proteins whose abundance was decreased in hiPSCs were enriched in GO terms related to DNA recombination, nucleosome positioning and chromatin silencing (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). Notably, this included four H1 histones, which are reported to influence nucleosomal repeat length<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> and stabilise chromatin structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>.

<p>As histone variants have very similar protein sequences, where peptides can match to multiple H1 histones, a peptide level analysis was necessary to deconvolute the signal (Fig. S2). The Andromeda search engine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> assigns peptide intensities to a protein following a razor peptide approach, where the intensity of a peptide is assigned to only one protein, regardless if its unique or shared. This makes the analysis of specific variants challenging at the protein level. Hence, we focussed on a peptide specific analysis and found that the intensity of the peptides between that were shared between these 3 H1 histones displayed a consistent reduction in abundance in hiPSCs (Fig. S2).</p>
<p>The systematic reduction in abundance in hiPSCs seen with H1 histone variants was not seen for members of the other histone families. Evaluating either the concentration (Fig. S1), or copy numbers (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6f</xref>), across all histones, showed no significant differences in expression between hiPSCs and hESCs. Furthermore, for core histones, including H3 and H4, there were no significant abundance differences seen within either the proteomics data(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6g</xref>&amp;h), or in additional western blot analyses that we performed to validate these conclusions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6i</xref>&amp;j). However, we did detect differences between hiPSCs and hESCs in the expression of histone H2 variants, with H2AFV (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6k</xref>), H2AFY (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6l</xref>) and H2AFY2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6m</xref>), all increased in abundance in hiPSCs. As histone H2 variants also have high sequence similarity and shared peptides, we also performed a peptide level analysis, which validated that both shared and unique peptides displayed the same pattern showing increased abundance in hiPSCs (Fig. S3). Thus, we conclude that there are opposing effects for histone H1 and histone H2 variants, with the former decreased and the latter increased in abundance in hiPSCs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Induced pluripotent stem cells can provide vital models for clinical research and future therapies, which makes understanding their similarities and any specific differences with embryo-derived human stem cells vital. This study provides a detailed comparison of the proteomes of multiple hiPSC and hESC lines, with the major conclusion that while they express a near identical set of proteins, with similar abundance ranks, they also display important quantitative differences. In particular, our data indicate that fibroblast reprogrammed hiPSCS display considerable differences in the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteome compared to hESCs, while the nuclear proteome, was more similar between the two cell types. Furthermore, additional microscopy analyses and functional assays show that the systematic differences in the proteomes of the respective hiPSCs and hESCs have impact on cell phenotypes, most notably affecting mitochondria, metabolic activity and transport.</p>
<p>Using estimated protein copy numbers, our data show that only &lt;1% of proteins were significantly decreased in abundance in hiPSCs compared to hESCs, and this included multiple H1 histones, while in contrast, ∼ 56% of all proteins quantified were significantly increased (fold change&gt;1.5 and q-value &lt;0.001), with most of these increases affecting cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins and activities. The MS data show that total protein levels are higher overall in hiPSCs as compared with hESCs, a result that was independently validated and confirmed using an EZQ protein assay. This difference in total protein content was shown by FACS not to result from differences between hiPSCs and hESCs in cell cycle progression. Instead, the increased protein levels in hiPSCs correlated with increased levels of the protein translational machinery, along with increased metabolic and mitochondrial activity and higher levels of nutrient transport.</p>
<p>These results highlight an important technical point relating to data normalisation and its effect on the interpretation of such data. By using a standard median normalisation (concentration-based approach), instead of the proteomic ruler<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, the difference in total protein content between the cell types, involving the increased abundance of thousands of proteins, is not apparent. Hence a cell type with 4-fold higher protein content would display virtually no significant differences as long as the protein ranks and concentration remained similar. This would result in an erroneous conclusion that there is little to no change in protein expression between hiPSCs and hESCs, while the orthogonal data suggest otherwise.</p>
<p>Having established that hiPSCs displayed higher total protein content than corresponding hESC lines, we sought to understand how this could be maintained. To maximise protein synthesis nutrient availability and energy production are key<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. The proteomic data show that vital nutrient transporters, known to be important for growth and protein production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> were significantly increased in hiPSCs compared to hESCs. In particular the 3 glutamine transporters (SLC1A5, SLC38A1 and SLC38A2) were all significantly increased in abundance, with additional functional assays showing that this correlated with higher levels of glutamine uptake measured in hiPSCs. Glutamine has been previously shown to fuel growth and proliferation in rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, and could be sustaining higher rates in hiPSCs.</p>
<p>Nutrients provide the fuel, but it is the metabolic proteins that are the engines that convert them to energy. Here our data showed that proteins involved in both glycolysis and glutaminolysis were significantly increased in abundance in hiPSCs. When cells preferentially use the glycolytic pathway, i.e stem cells and cancer cells, there is increased demand for biosynthetic precursors and NADPH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. These precursors can be supplied via the glutaminolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> linked to the TCA, both important mitochondrial processes and both with significantly increased in hiPSCs along with other proteins involved in the electron transport chain. Differences in the mitochondria between hiPSCs and hESCs have been previously reported, but whether they originate from the reprogramming process or are induced by the increased nutrient uptake remains a point of interest.</p>
<p>Secreted proteins, such as growth factors and ECM proteins, are a category of great interest, because their absolute abundance can affect the surrounding cellular microenvironment. hiPSCs were found here to show increased expression levels of growth factors that are linked to cancer and immunosuppression. For example FGF2, an important growth factor for primed pluripotent stem cells, has been shown that to promote ERK activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>, stimulating protein synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Thus, the increased abundance of FGF2 could be a feedforward loop further driving/sustaining growth in hiPSCs, however that growth potential is also linked to breast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> and gastric cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> as well as gliomas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Another important growth factor that is increased in abundance in hiPSCs is TGFB1, a known potent inhibitor of T cell responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. We note that the immunogenicity of pluripotent stem cells has important consequences for cell therapy applications. Our data suggest that hiPSCs might have a higher immune evasion potential via multiple mechanisms. They display increased abundance of secreted T cell inhibitors like TGFB1 and ARG1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>, along with inhibitory ligands such as CD276, CD200 and CD47. An increased inhibitory capacity, combined with tumorigenic potential of hiPSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>, raises some concerns about the suitability of using reprogrammed hiPSCs for certain types of therapeutic applications.</p>
<p>In summary, our data show that hiPSCs and hESCs, despite their clear similarities, are not identical at both the protein and phenotypic levels. We show that reprogrammed hiPSCs differ from hESCs predominantly in their cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteome, leading to measurable functional differences affecting their metabolic activity and growth potential. These data can help to inform future strategies to mitigate for these differences as hiPSCs continue to be used in important clinical applications and as disease models.</p>

<p>TMT labelled samples were analysed on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer coupled to a Dionex RSLCnano HPLC (Thermo Scientific). Samples were loaded onto a 100 µm × 2 cm Acclaim PepMap-C18 trap column (5 µm, 100 Å) with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 7 min and a constant flow of 4 µL/min. Peptides were separated on a 75 µm × 50 cm EASY-Spray C18 column (2 µm, 100 Å; Thermo Scientific) at 50 °C using a linear gradient from 10% to 40% B in 153 min with a flow rate of 200 nL/min. Solvents used were 0.1% formic acid (A) and 80% ACN/0.1% formic acid (B). The spray was initiated by applying 2.5 kV to the EASY-Spray emitter. The ion transfer capillary temperature was set to 275 °C and the radio frequency of the S-lens to 50%. Data were acquired under the control of Xcalibur software in a data-dependent mode. The number of dependent scans was 12. The full scan was acquired in the orbitrap covering the mass range of <italic>m/z</italic> 350 to 1,400 with a mass resolution of 120,000, an AGC target of 4×10<sup>5</sup> ions and a maximum injection time of 50 ms.

<title>High-resolution respirometry in wibj_2 and H1 stem cells</title>
<p>Mitochondrial respiration was studied in digitonin-permeabilised WIBJ2 and WA01 stem cells (10 μg / 10<sup>6</sup> cells) to keep mitochondria in their architectural environment. The analysis was performed in an oxygraphic chamber with thermostat set to 37°C with continuous stirring (Oxygraph-2 k, Oroboros instruments, Innsbruck, Austria). Cells were collected with trypsin, pelleted, and then placed in MiR05 respiration medium (110 mM sucrose, 60 mM lactobionic acid, 0.5 mM EGTA, 3 mM MgCl2, 20 mM taurine, 10 mM KH2PO4, 20 mM HEPES adjusted to pH 7.1 with KOH at 30°C, and 1 g/l BSA essentially fatty acid free). Substrate-Uncoupler-Inhibitor titration protocol number 2 (SUIT-002)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup> was used to determine respiratory rates. Briefly, after residual oxygen consumption in absence of endogenous fuel substrates (ROX, in presence of 2.5 mM ADP) was measured, fatty acid oxidation pathway state (F) was evaluated by adding malate (0.1 mM) and octanoyl carnitine (0.2 mM) (OctMP). Membrane integrity was tested by adding cytochrome c (10 μM) (OctMcP). Subsequently, the NADH electron transfer-pathway state (FN) was studied by adding a high concentration of malate (2 mM, OctMP), pyruvate (5 mM, OctPMP), and glutamate (10 mM, OctPGMP). Then succinate (10 mM, OctPGMSP) was added to stimulate the S pathway (FNS), followed by glycerophosphate (10 mM, OctPGMSGpP) to reach convergent electron flow in the FNSGp-pathway to the Q-junction. Uncoupled respiration was next measured by performing a titration with CCCP (OctPGMSGpE), followed by inhibition of complex I (SGpE) with rotenone (0.5 μM, SGpE). Finally, residual oxygen consumption (ROX) was measured by adding Antimycin A (2.5 μM). ROX was then subtracted from all respiratory states, to obtain mitochondrial respiration. Results are expressed in pmol · s<sup>−1</sup> · 10<sup>6</sup> cells. The P/E control ratio, which reflects the control by coupling and limitation by the phosphorylation system, was subsequently calculated by dividing the OctPGMSGpP value by the OctPGMSGpE value.</p>

<p>Two hiPSC lines (wibj_2 and oaqd_3) with 3 technical replicates each were compared to two hESC lines (SA121 and SA181) with 3 technical replicates of each. Both hiPSCs and hESCs were plated in 6-well plates 2 days before the transport assay (5e4 cells/cm2 – this gives 1e6 cells/well on “uptake day”). The cell growth media was carefully aspirated so as not to disturb the adherent monolayer of cells. They were washed gently by pipetting with 5 mls preheated (37°C) uptake solution (HBSS (pH 7.4), GIBCO) and aspirating off. This was repeated 3 times. They were then incubated with 0.5 ml of uptake solution containing [<sup>3</sup>H]glutamine (5 μCi/ml; perkin elmer, NET 55100) in either the presence or absence of L-glutamine (5 mM; sigma) for 2 min.</p>
<p>Glutamine uptake was stopped by removing the uptake solution and washing cells with 2 ml of ice-cold stop solution (HBSS with 10 mM nonradioactive L-glutamine) three times. After the third wash, the cells were lysed in 200 μl of 0.1% SDS and 100 mM NaOH, and 100 μl was used to measure the radioactivity associated with the cells. Finally 100 μl sample was added to scint vials containing 3 mls scintillant (<italic>OptiPhase HiSafe</italic> 3, Perkin Elmer). β-radioactivity was measured with Tri-Carb 4910TR liquid scintillation counter.</p>

The pellets were cut into small pieces, washed 3 times in cacodylate buffer and then post-fixed in 1% OsO4 with 1.5% Na ferricyanide in cacodylate buffer for 60 min. After another 3 washes in cacodylate buffer they were contrasted with 1% tannic acid and 1% uranyl acetate. The cell pellets were then dehydrated through alcohol series into 100% ethanol, changed to propylene oxide left overnight in 50% propylene oxide 50% resin and finally embedded in 100% Durcupan resin (Sigma). The resin was polymerised at 60°C for 48hrs and sectioned on a Leica UCT ultramicrotome.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors compared four types of hiPSCs and four types of hESCs at the proteome level to elucidate the differences between hiPSCs and hESCs. Semi-quantitative calculations of protein copy numbers revealed increased protein content in iPSCs. Particularly in iPSCs, proteins related to mitochondrial and cytoplasmic were suggested to reflect the state of the original differentiated cells to some extent. However, the most important result of this study is the calculation of the protein copy numbers per cell, and the validity of this result is problematic. In addition, several experiments need to be improved, such as using cells of different genders (iPSC: female, ESC: male) in mitochondrial metabolism experiments.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The focus on the number of copies of proteins is exciting and appreciated if the estimated calculation result is correct and biologically reproducible.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The proteome results in this study were likely obtained by simply looking at differences between clones, and the proteome data need to be validated. First, there were only a few clones for comparison, and the gender and number of cells did not match between ESCs and iPSCs. Second, no data show the accuracy of the protein copy number per cell obtained by the proteome data.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Pluripotent stem cells are powerful tools for understanding development, differentiation, and disease modeling. The capacity of stem cells to differentiate into various cell types holds great promise for therapeutic applications. However, ethical concerns restrict the use of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Consequently, induced human pluripotent stem cells (ihPSCs) offer an attractive alternative for modeling rare diseases, drug screening, and regenerative medicine. A comprehensive understanding of ihPSCs is crucial to establish their similarities and differences compared to hESCs. This work demonstrates systematic differences in the reprogramming of nuclear and non-nuclear proteomes in ihPSCs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors employed quantitative mass spectrometry to compare protein expression differences between independently derived ihPSC and hESC cell lines. Qualitatively, protein expression profiles in ihPSC and hESC were found to be very similar. However, when comparing protein concentration at a cellular level, it became evident that ihPSCs express higher levels of proteins in the cytoplasm, mitochondria, and plasma membrane, while the expression of nuclear proteins is similar between ihPSCs and hESCs. A higher expression of proteins in ihPSCs was verified by an independent approach, and flow cytometry confirmed that ihPSCs had larger cell sizes than hESCs. The differences in protein expression were reflected in functional distinctions. For instance, the higher expression of mitochondrial metabolic enzymes, glutamine transporters, and lipid biosynthesis enzymes in ihPSCs was associated with enhanced mitochondrial potential, increased ability to uptake glutamine, and increased ability to form lipid droplets.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
While this finding is intriguing and interesting, the study falls short of explaining the mechanistic reasons for the observed quantitative proteome differences. It remains unclear whether the increased expression of proteins in ihPSCs is due to enhanced transcription of the genes encoding this group of proteins or due to other reasons, for example, differences in mRNA translation efficiency. Another unresolved question pertains to how the cell type origin influences ihPSC proteomes. For instance, whether ihPSCs derived from fibroblasts, lymphocytes, and other cell types all exhibit differences in their cell size and increased expression of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins. Analyzing ihPSCs derived from different cell types and by different investigators would be necessary to address these questions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this study, Brenes and colleagues carried out proteomic analysis of several human induced pluripotent (hiPSC) and human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines. The authors found quantitative differences in the expression of several groups of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins. Overall, hiPSC expressed higher levels of proteins such as glutamine transporters, mitochondrial metabolism proteins, and proteins related to lipid synthesis. Based on the protein expression differences, the authors propose that hiPSC lines differ from hESC in their growth and metabolism.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The number of generated hiPSC and hESC lines continues to grow, but potential differences between hiPSC and hESC lines remain to be quantified and explained. This study is a promising step forward in understanding of the differences between different hiPSC and hESC lines.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
It is unclear whether changes in protein levels relate to any phenotypic features of cell lines used. For example, the authors highlight that increased protein expression in hiPSC lines is consistent with the requirement to sustain high growth rates, but there is no data to demonstrate whether hiPSC lines used indeed have higher growth rates.</p>
<p>The authors claim that the cell cycle of the lines is unchanged. However, no details of the method for assessing the cell cycle were included so it is difficult to appreciate if this assessment was appropriately carried out and controlled for.</p>
<p>Details and characterisation of iPSC and ESC lines used in this study were overall lacking. The lines used are merely listed in methods, but no references are included for published lines, how lines were obtained, what passage they were used at, their karyotype status, etc. For details of basic characterisation, the authors should refer to the ISSC Standards for the use of human stem cells in research. In particular, the authors should consider whether any of the changes they see may be attributed to copy number variants in different lines.</p>
<p>The expression data for markers of undifferentiated state in Figure 1a would ideally be shown by immunocytochemistry or flow cytometry as it is impossible to tell whether cultures are heterogeneous for marker expression.</p>
<p>TEM analysis should ideally be quantified.</p>
<p>All figure legends should explicitly state what graphs are representing (e.g. average/mean; how many replicates (biological or technical), which lines)? Some data is included in Methods (e.g. glutamine uptake), but not for all of the data (e.g. TEM).</p>
<p>Validation experiments were performed typically on one or two cell lines, but the lines used were not consistent (e.g. wibj_2 versus H1 for respirometry and wibj_2, oaqd_3 versus SA121 and SA181 for glutamine uptake). Can the authors explain how the lines were chosen?</p>
<p>The authors should acknowledge the need for further functional validation of the results related to immunosuppressive proteins.</p>
<p>Differences in H1 histone abundance were highlighted. Can the authors speculate as to the meaning of these differences?</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors compared four types of hiPSCs and four types of hESCs at the proteome level to elucidate the differences between hiPSCs and hESCs. Semi-quantitative calculations of protein copy numbers revealed increased protein content in iPSCs. Particularly in iPSCs, proteins related to mitochondrial and cytoplasmic were suggested to reflect the state of the original differentiated cells to some extent. However, the most important result of this study is the calculation of the protein copy numbers per cell, and the validity of this result is problematic. In addition, several experiments need to be improved, such as using cells of different genders (iPSC: female, ESC: male) in mitochondrial metabolism experiments.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The focus on the number of copies of proteins is exciting and appreciated if the estimated calculation result is correct and biologically reproducible.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The proteome results in this study were likely obtained by simply looking at differences between clones, and the proteome data need to be validated. First, there were only a few clones for comparison, and the gender and number of cells did not match between ESCs and iPSCs. Second, no data show the accuracy of the protein copy number per cell obtained by the proteome data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer in their assessment that more independent stem cell clones and an equal gender balance would be preferable. We will mention these considerations as limitations of our study and encourage a larger-scale follow-up.</p>
<p>Regarding the estimated copy numbers, we would like to highlight that they have been extensively in the field, with direct validation of the differences in copy numbers with orthogonal methods like FACS2-4,7,10. Furthermore, the original paper directly compared the copy numbers estimated using the “proteomic ruler” to spike-in protein epitope signature tags and found remarkable concordance. This was performed with a much older generation mass spectrometer with reduced peptide coverage, and the author predicted that higher coverage would increase the quantitative performance.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Pluripotent stem cells are powerful tools for understanding development, differentiation, and disease modeling. The capacity of stem cells to differentiate into various cell types holds great promise for therapeutic applications. However, ethical concerns restrict the use of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Consequently, induced human pluripotent stem cells (ihPSCs) offer an attractive alternative for modeling rare diseases, drug screening, and regenerative medicine.</p>
<p>A comprehensive understanding of ihPSCs is crucial to establish their similarities and differences compared to hESCs.</p>
<p>This work demonstrates systematic differences in the reprogramming of nuclear and non-nuclear proteomes in ihPSCs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the positive assessment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors employed quantitative mass spectrometry to compare protein expression differences between independently derived ihPSC and hESC cell lines. Qualitatively, protein expression profiles in ihPSC and hESC were found to be very similar. However, when comparing protein concentration at a cellular level, it became evident that ihPSCs express higher levels of proteins in the cytoplasm, mitochondria, and plasma membrane, while the expression of nuclear proteins is similar between ihPSCs and hESCs. A higher expression of proteins in ihPSCs was verified by an independent approach, and flow cytometry confirmed that ihPSCs had larger cell sizes than hESCs. The differences in protein expression were reflected in functional distinctions. For instance, the higher expression of mitochondrial metabolic enzymes, glutamine transporters, and lipid biosynthesis enzymes in ihPSCs was associated with enhanced mitochondrial potential, increased ability to uptake glutamine, and increased ability to form lipid droplets.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While this finding is intriguing and interesting, the study falls short of explaining the mechanistic reasons for the observed quantitative proteome differences. It remains unclear whether the increased expression of proteins in ihPSCs is due to enhanced transcription of the genes encoding this group of proteins or due to other reasons, for example, differences in mRNA translation efficiency. Another unresolved question pertains to how the cell type origin influences ihPSC proteomes. For instance, whether ihPSCs derived from fibroblasts, lymphocytes, and other cell types all exhibit differences in their cell size and increased expression of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins. Analyzing ihPSCs derived from different cell types and by different investigators would be necessary to address these questions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the Reviewer that our study does not provide a mechanistic reason for the quantitative differences between the two cell types. However, we will include an expanded section in the discussion where we discuss the potential causes.</p>
<p>
We also agree studying hiPSCs reprogrammed from different cell types, such as blood lymphocytes, would be of great interest and will include a section about this within the discussion to encourage further research into the area.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Brenes and colleagues carried out proteomic analysis of several human induced pluripotent (hiPSC) and human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines. The authors found quantitative differences in the expression of several groups of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins. Overall, hiPSC expressed higher levels of proteins such as glutamine transporters, mitochondrial metabolism proteins, and proteins related to lipid synthesis. Based on the protein expression differences, the authors propose that hiPSC lines differ from hESC in their growth and metabolism.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The number of generated hiPSC and hESC lines continues to grow, but potential differences between hiPSC and hESC lines remain to be quantified and explained. This study is a promising step forward in understanding of the differences between different hiPSC and hESC lines.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>It is unclear whether changes in protein levels relate to any phenotypic features of cell lines used. For example, the authors highlight that increased protein expression in hiPSC lines is consistent with the requirement to sustain high growth rates, but there is no data to demonstrate whether hiPSC lines used indeed have higher growth rates.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully disagree with the reviewer on this point. Our data shows that hESCs and hiPSCs show significant differences in protein mass and cell size, validated by the EZQ assay and FACS, while having no significant differences in their cell cycle profiles. Thus increased size and protein content would require higher growth rates to sustain the increased mass, which is what we show.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors claim that the cell cycle of the lines is unchanged. However, no details of the method for assessing the cell cycle were included so it is difficult to appreciate if this assessment was appropriately carried out and controlled for.</p>
<p>
We apologise for this omission; the details will be included in the revised version of the document.</p>
<p>Details and characterisation of iPSC and ESC lines used in this study were overall lacking. The lines used are merely listed in methods, but no references are included for published lines, how lines were obtained, what passage they were used at, their karyotype status, etc. For details of basic characterisation, the authors should refer to the ISSC Standards for the use of human stem cells in research. In particular, the authors should consider whether any of the changes they see may be attributed to copy number variants in different lines.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer on this. The hiPSC lines were generated by the HipSci consortium in the Wellcome Sanger Centre as described in the flagship HipSci paper13. We cite the flagship paper which specifies in great detail the reprogramming protocols and quality control measures, including looking at copy number variations13. However, we agree that we did not make this information easily accessible for readers. We also believe it is relevant to also explicitly include this information on our manuscript instead of expecting readers to look at the flagship paper. These details will be added to the revised version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The expression data for markers of undifferentiated state in Figure 1a would ideally be shown by immunocytochemistry or flow cytometry as it is impossible to tell whether cultures are heterogeneous for marker expression.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer on this. FACS is indeed much more quantitative and a better method to study heterogeneity. However, we did not have protocols to study these markers using FACS.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>TEM analysis should ideally be quantified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that it would be nice to have a quantitative measure.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>All figure legends should explicitly state what graphs are representing (e.g. average/mean; how many replicates (biological or technical), which lines)? Some data is included in Methods (e.g. glutamine uptake), but not for all of the data (e.g. TEM).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer completely. These points will be remediated in the revised version of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Validation experiments were performed typically on one or two cell lines, but the lines used were not consistent (e.g. wibj_2 versus H1 for respirometry and wibj_2, oaqd_3 versus SA121 and SA181 for glutamine uptake). Can the authors explain how the lines were chosen?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will include these details within the updated manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors should acknowledge the need for further functional validation of the results related to immunosuppressive proteins.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer and will add a clear sentence in the discussion making this point explicitly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Differences in H1 histone abundance were highlighted. Can the authors speculate as to the meaning of these differences?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Regarding H1 histones, our study of the literature as well as interaction with chromatin and histone experts both within our institute and externally have not shed light into what the differences could imply. We think this is an interesting result that merits further study, but we don’t have a clear hypothesis on the consequences.</p>
<p>In summary, we thank the reviewers for their comments and will prepare a revised version that addresses their suggestions.</p>
