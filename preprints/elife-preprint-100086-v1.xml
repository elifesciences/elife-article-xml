<title>Abstract</title><p>The evolutionary introduction of asymmetric cell division (ACD) into the developmental program facilitates the formation of a new cell type, contributing to developmental diversity and, eventually, to species diversification. The micromere of the sea urchin embryo may serve as one of those examples: An ACD at the 16-cell stage forms micromeres unique to echinoids among echinoderms. We previously reported that a polarity factor, Activator of G-protein Signaling (AGS), plays a crucial role in micromere formation. However, AGS and its associated ACD factors are present in all echinoderms and across most metazoans, leaving a question of what evolutionary modification of AGS protein or its surrounding molecular environment contributed to the evolutionary acquisition of micromeres only in echinoids. In this study, we learned that the GoLoco motifs at the AGS C-terminus play critical roles in regulating micromere formation in sea urchin embryos. Further, other echinoderms’ AGS or chimeric AGS that contain the C-terminus of AGS orthologs from various organisms showed varied localization and function in micromere formation. In contrast, the sea star or the pencil urchin orthologs of other ACD factors were consistently localized at the vegetal cortex in the sea urchin embryo, suggesting that AGS may be a unique variable factor that facilitates ACD diversity among echinoderms. Consistently, sea urchin AGS appears to facilitate micromere-like cell formation and accelerate the enrichment timing of the germline factor Vasa during early embryogenesis of the pencil urchin, an ancestral type of sea urchin. Based on these observations, we propose that the molecular evolution of a single polarity factor facilitates ACD diversity while preserving the core ACD machinery among echinoderms and beyond during evolution.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Asymmetric cell division (ACD) is a developmental process that facilitates cell fate diversification by distributing fate determinants differently between daughter cells. It is an essential process for multicellular organisms since it creates distinct cell types, leading to different tissues in an organism. For example, in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> embryonic neuroblasts divide asymmetrically to produce apical self-renewing neuroblasts and basal ganglion mother cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bate, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Doe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Doe et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hartenstein &amp; Campos-Ortega, 1984</xref>). In <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans,</italic> the zygote divides asymmetrically to form a large anterior and a small posterior blastomere with distinct cell fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Schnabel et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Sulston et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Watts et al., 1996</xref>). In mammals, neuroepithelial cells undergo ACD to produce apical self-renewing stem cells as well as basal neural progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chenn &amp; McConnell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Haydar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Konno et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Noctor et al., 2004</xref>). A set of polarity factors conserved across phyla regulates these highly organized ACD processes. However, the timing and location of such controlled ACD often occur randomly, even within the same phylum, providing uniqueness to the developmental program of each species. Therefore, we hypothesize that drastic changes in the ACD machinery are unnecessary. Instead, a slight modification in the ACD machinery may drive the formation of a new cell type and the change in the developmental program, contributing to species diversification in the process of evolution.</p>
<p>In this study, we use echinoderm embryos as a model system to test this hypothesis. Echinoderms are basal deuterostomes and include sea urchins, sea stars, and sea cucumbers, among others. In the well-studied echinoderm models, the sea urchin and sea star embryos, the first ACD or symmetry break occurs at the 8-cell stage, where a horizontal cell division separates animal and vegetal blastomeres that contribute to ectoderm and endomesoderm lineages, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). However, in the next cell cycle at the 16-cell stage, the sea urchin embryo undergoes an apparent unequal cell division, producing four micromeres at the vegetal pole. In contrast, the sea star embryo undergoes seemingly an equal cell division (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>The micromere formation in the sea urchin embryo is a highly controlled ACD event since this cell lineage undergoes autonomous cell specification and functions as organizers as soon as it is formed at the 16-cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Horstadius, 1928</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ransick &amp; Davidson, 1993</xref>). For example, micromeres autonomously divide asymmetrically again to produce large and small micromeres that are committed to two specific lineages of skeletogenic cells and the germline, respectively, at the 32-cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Okazaki, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Yajima &amp; Wessel, 2011</xref>). This early segregation of the germline is unique to sea urchins among echinoderms (Juliano et al., 2009; Fresques et al., 2016). Further, micromeres induce endomesoderm specification (e.g., gastrulation) even when they are placed in the ectopic region of the embryo, such as the animal cap, suggesting they function as a major signaling center in this embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Horstadius, 1928</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ransick &amp; Davidson, 1993</xref>). The removal of sea urchin micromeres results in compromised or delayed endomesoderm development and compensatory upregulation of a germline factor, Vasa, to presumably start over the developmental program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ransick &amp; Davidson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Voronina et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, other echinoderms undergo minor unequal cell divisions during early embryogenesis, yet they may not be linked to specific cell fate or function. For example, in sea star embryos, the removal of smaller cells does not impact embryonic patterning, and unequal cell divisions appear to be not necessarily linked to specific cell fate regulation or function (Barone et al., 2022). Similarly, even in sea urchin embryos, the non-micromere blastomeres at the 16-cell stage can change the cell fate in response to external cues, including the signaling from micromeres. Recent studies using single-cell RNA-seq analysis further support these observations by demonstrating the earlier molecular segregation of the micromere lineage, while other cell lineages appear to undergo more regulative development (Foster et al., 2019; Massri et al., 2021).</p>
<p>Fossil records and phylogenetic tree analysis suggest that sea urchins diverged relatively later from the common ancestor of echinoderms (Bottjer et al., 2006; Wada and Sato et al., 1994). Since micromeres are unique to echinoids (sea urchins, sand dollars, pencil urchins), they are considered to have emerged later during sea urchin diversification, which has dramatically changed the developmental style in the sea urchin embryo (Emura and Yajima, 2022). To understand how this unique lineage has emerged during evolution, we previously identified the Activator of G-protein signaling (AGS) (Pins in <italic>Drosophila</italic>; LGN in mammals) as a major regulator of micromere formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Poon et al., 2019</xref>). AGS is a polarity factor and plays a role in the ACD of many organisms (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">di Pietro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kotak, 2019</xref>; Rose &amp; Gonczy, 2014; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Siller &amp; Doe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wavreil &amp; Yajima, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Yu et al., 2006</xref>). In the sea urchin (<italic>S. purpuratus;</italic> Sp), SpAGS localizes to the vegetal cortex before and during micromere formation, and its knockdown inhibits micromere formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Poon et al., 2019</xref>). On the other hand, in the sea star (<italic>P. miniata;</italic> Pm), PmAGS shows no cortical localization nor any significant role in ACD during early embryogenesis. Furthermore, the pencil urchin (<italic>E. tribuloides;</italic> Et) is an ancestral type of the sea urchin and diverged around 252 million years ago, which is located between the sea star and the sea urchin. The Et embryo exhibits an intermediate developmental program of the sea urchins and sea stars. It stochastically forms zero to four micromere-like cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). In these embryos, EtAGS localizes to the vegetal cortex only when the embryos form micromere-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Poon et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting a close correlation between cortical AGS localization and micromere-like cell formation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the introduction of sea urchin AGS into sea star embryos induces random unequal cell divisions by recruiting the spindle poles to the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Poon et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that SpAGS facilitates unequal cell divisions even in other echinoderm species. Phylogenetic analysis of AGS orthologs across taxa suggests that AGS orthologs increased the functional motif numbers over the course of evolution, likely allowing additional molecular interactions and mechanisms to modulate ACD in a more nuanced manner in higher-order organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wavreil and Yajima, 2020</xref>). Supporting this hypothesis, indeed, prior studies suggest that the higher-order mouse AGS ortholog (LGN) can substitute for its fly ortholog (Pins) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, while the basal-order fly Pins cannot substitute its chick ortholog function in chick, the higher-order organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Yu et al., 2003</xref>; Saadaouri et al., 2017). These observations led us to hypothesize that the molecular evolution of AGS orthologs drives ACD diversity across taxa, contributing to the developmental diversity within each phylum. In this study, through a series of molecular dissection experiments, we demonstrate that the AGS C-terminus is a variable region and creates its functional diversity in ACD control, facilitating the developmental variations among echinoderms. This study provides insight into how the molecular evolution of a single polarity contributes to developmental diversity within each phylum.</p>

<title>The N-terminal TPR domain is vital for restricting SpAGS localization and function at the vegetal cortex</title>
<p>AGS consists of two functional domains: the N-terminus contains tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR), and the C-terminus contains G-protein regulatory motifs (GoLoco, GL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bernard et al., 2001</xref>). AGS switches between a closed and open structure based on the intramolecular interaction between the TPR and GL motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Du &amp; Macara, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Johnston et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Nipper et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Pan et al., 2013</xref>). The TPR motifs regulate protein-protein interaction with various partners such as Inscuteable (Insc) for its proper cortical localization or Nuclear Mitotic Apparatus (NuMA) for its microtubule-pulling force generation. In contrast, the GL motifs interact with the heterotrimeric G-protein subunit Gαi for its anchoring to the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bowman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Culurgioni et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Culurgioni et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Du &amp; Macara, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Parmentier et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Yu et al., 2000</xref>). Studies investigating AGS mechanisms in fly and mammals reveal that Pins/LGN (AGS orthologs) generally remain in the autoinhibited form in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Du &amp; Macara, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Johnston et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Nipper et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). At the time of ACD, Insc recruits Pins/LGN to the cortex through Gαi. This Gαi-binding releases Pins/LGN from its autoinhibition and allows it to interact with NuMA, which recruits the motor protein dynein to generate pulling forces on the microtubules and facilitate ACD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bowman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Culurgioni et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Izumi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Parmentier et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Schaefer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Siller et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Williams et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Yu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Yuzawa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zhu et al., 2011a</xref>).</p>
<p>To test whether sea urchin (<italic>S. purpuratus</italic>; Sp) AGS functions in ACD similarly to its orthologs, we first investigated the role of its N-terminus by constructing a series of GFP-tagged deletion mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). AGS-1F is missing the first three TPR motifs, AGS-2F the first four, and AGS-3F the entire TPR domain of SpAGS Open Reading Frame (ORF). The mRNA for these deletion constructs was co-injected with 2x-mCherry-EMTB, a microtubule marker, to visualize the cell cycle phase, spindle location, and orientation. We counted the number of embryos with vegetal cortical localization and conducted a quantitative analysis by measuring the ratio of cortical and non-cortical signal intensity at the 16∼32-cell stage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-C</xref>). Embryos injected with full-length SpAGS (Full AGS) or AGS-1F exhibited vegetal cortex-specific localization. In contrast, AGS-2F and AGS-3F showed uniform cortical localization (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-C</xref>). These results suggest that TPR4-6 is necessary for restricting AGS to the vegetal cortex, whereas TPR1-3 appears to play a less critical role in controlling AGS localization.</p>

Since none of the AGS-3F-injected embryos formed normal micromeres, “micromere-like cells” were counted based on their vertical cell division, not relative to their size. Statistical analysis was performed against Control by One-Way ANOVA. <bold>G-H</bold> Brightfield images show the representative phenotypes scored in the corresponding graph (H) at 2 dpf. We categorized embryos into three groups, namely, “full development,” with embryos reaching the pluteus stage with complete gut formation and skeleton; “delayed development,” with some gastrulation but no proper skeleton; and “failed gastrulation.” As many of the abnormal-looking embryos fell into the median of the latter two categories, we scored only the embryos reaching full development in the graph. Control represents embryos injected with dye only. Statistical analysis was performed against Control by One-Way ANOVA. <bold>I,</bold> Single Z-slice confocal imaging was used to focus on the vegetal cortex. Embryos were stained with AGS (orange) and Gɑi (green) antibodies. White arrows and arrowheads indicate the signals at the vegetal cortex and ectopic cortical signals, respectively.

</fig>
<p>In the control and the AGS-1F groups, micromeres were approximately half the size of the macromeres. In contrast, they were three-quarters the size in the AGS-2F group and almost the same size in the AGS-3F group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D-E</xref>), resulting in failed micromere formation even in the presence of the endogenous SpAGS (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). In these embryos, we also scored embryonic development at two days post fertilization (2 dpf) when gastrulation occurs. The AGS-1F mutant mostly showed normal development with extended skeletal rods, whereas AGS-2F and AGS-3F dramatically compromised development with incomplete skeleton extension or gut formation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G-H</xref>). Since these N-terminal deletions appear to cause a dominant negative phenotype, we did not knock down endogenous SpAGS in these experiments.</p>
<p>These results suggest that the N-terminal TPR domain is necessary to restrict SpAGS localization at the vegetal cortex. The TPR deletion disables AGS mutants from maintaining the autoinhibited form. It may thus induce their binding to Gαi at every cortex and compete out the endogenous SpAGS at the vegetal cortex. Notably, Gαi localization was also recruited to the exact ectopic location as AGS-2F and -3F mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I</xref>), suggesting that the SpAGS C-terminus is sufficient to control the Gαi localization at the vegetal cortex. Protein sequences of AGS orthologs across echinoderms are almost identical in their N-termini, suggesting that the AGS N-terminus serves as a core functional domain (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). In contrast, the AGS C-terminus appears highly variable across echinoderms.</p>

<title>The C-terminal GL1 motif is essential for SpAGS localization and function in ACD</title>
<p>To test whether a variable AGS C-terminus creates functional diversity in ACD, we made a series of GFP-tagged C-terminus deletion SpAGS mutants that are missing different GL motifs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>).

Next, we knocked down endogenous AGS by morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (MO), which was previously validated for the specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Poon et al., 2019</xref>). We tested whether these deletion mutants could rescue micromere formation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). The GL1 deletion significantly reduced micromere formation.

<p>To determine whether the sequence or positioning of GL1 is essential for the SpAGS function, we next made a series of mutants where the GL motifs were interchanged or replaced (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>).

<p>We quantified the function of these AGS mutants in the endogenous AGS-knockdown background. AGS1111 and AGS2222 mutants failed to restore micromere formation at the 16-cell stage, while AGS4234 and AGS2134 mutants rescued micromere formation similarly to Full AGS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Furthermore, Full AGS, AGS2134, and AGS4234 showed comparable development at 2 dpf. In contrast, the AGS1111 and AGS2222 showed disrupted development (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E-F</xref>). These results suggest that the GL1 sequence is not essential, but its position is vital. In contrast, the sequence of GL3 or GL4 appears to be critical for restricting AGS localization to the vegetal cortex, perhaps by maintaining the autoinhibited form of AGS through their interaction with the TPR domains. AGS1111 and AGS2222 mutants were thus unable to sustain a closed/inactive state, resulting in a constitutively active form all around the cortex.</p>
<p>To test this model further, we made two additional SpAGS mutants, AGS4444 and AGS-GL1GL2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). AGS4444 localized properly at the vegetal cortex, whereas AGS-GL1GL2 showed significantly fewer embryos with vegetal cortical localization (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H-I</xref>). Furthermore, AGS-GL1GL2 showed impaired function in micromere formation and development compared to Full AGS control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J-K</xref>). On the other hand, AGS4444 showed no significant difference in the proportion of embryos with micromeres at the 16-cell stage and normal development at 2 dpf compared to the Full AGS control. These results further support the contention that GL3 and GL4 are essential for maintaining the SpAGS in a closed form. Additionally, the position of GL1 is critical for SpAGS localization and function.</p>

<p>Since the N-terminal sequences of SpAGS and PmAGS are almost identical (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>), we hypothesize that the variable C-terminus made a difference in AGS localization and function at the vegetal cortex. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a series of chimeric SpAGS mutants that replaced its C-terminus with that of other AGS orthologs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). These AGS orthologs include human LGN, <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Dm) Pins, and EtAGS, which are all involved in ACD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gonczy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Schaefer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wavreil &amp; Yajima, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zhu et al., 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">2011b</xref>) as well as human AGS3 and PmAGS, neither of which is involved in ACD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Saadaoui et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>The chimeras of ACD-facilitating orthologs (EtGL, LGNGL, DmGL) showed no significant difference in the vegetal cortical localization and micromere function compared to the SpAGS control (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G-J</xref>). In contrast, chimeras of no-ACD-facilitators (AGS3GL and PmGL) failed in micromere formation and function. These results suggest that the AGS C-terminus creates ACD diversity by largely reflecting the original function of each ortholog in the host species. Of note, <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pins chimera (DmGL) showed reduced micromere formation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>), which may be due to fewer functional domains with reduced efficacy in the higher-order organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wavreil and Yajima, 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, AGS-PmGL unexpectedly showed cortical localization (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>), while PmAGS showed no cortical localization (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). This result suggests that other elements of SpAGS outside of its C-terminus can drive its vegetal cortical localization but not function. Aurora A phosphorylates the linker serine region, enabling Dlg to bind and activate Pins in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Johnston et al., 2009</xref>). To test if this serine is essential for SpAGS localization, we mutated it to alanine (AGS-S389A in <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A</xref>). Compared to the Full AGS control, the mutant AGS-S389A showed reduced vegetal cortical localization (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3B-C</xref>) and function (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3D-E</xref>). Furthermore, we replaced the linker region of PmAGS with that of SpAGS (PmAGS-SpLinker in <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4A-B</xref>). However, this mutant did not show any cortical localization nor proper function in ACD (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4C-F</xref>). Therefore, the SpAGS C-terminus is the primary element that drives ACD, while the linker region serves as the secondary element to help cortical localization of AGS.</p>
<p>Lastly, in humans, it is proposed that the interdomain sequence between GL2 and GL3 is important for intramolecular interaction with TPR through phosphorylation, mediating the autoinhibitory state of LGN differently from that of AGS3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Takayanagi et al., 2019</xref>). To test this possibility, we made mutants targeting the residues unique to the AGS3 GL2-GL3 interdomain region (green and red residues in <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>): three serine residues were mutated to alanine, and three other residues (G, N, Y) were replaced with the corresponding residues of LGN. Consistent with our hypothesis, the chimera replaced with the LGN residues (AGS3GL-GL2GL3) gained the proper localization and function, while the chimera with serine alterations (AGS3GL-3S/A) failed to function in ACD (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3C-E</xref>). These results suggest that specific amino acid residues within the GL3 motif are critical, likely mediating interaction with TPR domains and the autoinhibited state of AGS. This result aligns with the earlier results of AGS1111 and AGS2222, which failed in ACD. On the other hand, potential serine phosphorylation between GL2-GL3 motifs appears to be irrelevant to the AGS function.</p>
<p>Overall, we conclude that the variable C-terminus of AGS orthologs facilitates ACD diversity. At the same time, the N-terminus and the linker region of AGS appear to help mediate its autoinhibited state, which regulates its cortical localization (summary diagrams in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>

<p>We cloned the sea urchin orthologs of these ACD factors and tagged each ORF with a GFP reporter.

Furthermore, we tested for physical interaction by performing the proximity ligation assay (PLA) for AGS and ACD factors (Insc, NuMA, Dlg). The results suggest these factors physically interact with AGS at the vegetal cortex (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Hence, the core ACD machinery is present at the vegetal cortex and interacts with AGS.

Furthermore, in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Poon et al., 2019</xref>), we identified that SpAGS recruits the spindle poles to every cortex when overexpressed (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7A</xref>, arrows). Similarly, SpAGS at least partially recruits its partner proteins to the ectopic cortical region, which we never observed in the control group (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7B-C</xref>, arrows). These results support the idea that SpAGS directly recruits the molecules essential for micromere lineage segregation. Indeed, <italic>in situ hybridization</italic> (ISH) analysis suggests that the downstream genes regulated by micromere signaling, such as endomesoderm marker genes (<italic>wnt8</italic>, <italic>foxa</italic>, <italic>blimp1b,</italic> and <italic>endo16</italic>), decreased their expression territories in the AGS-knockdown embryos (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). In contrast, ectoderm (<italic>foxq2</italic>) and skeletogenic mesoderm (<italic>ets1, alx1, tbr1,</italic> and <italic>sm50)</italic> marker genes showed no significant change in their expressions by AGS knockdown. Overall, these results suggest that SpAGS directly recruits multiple ACD factors and fate determinants necessary for micromere formation and function as an organizer, facilitating the downstream gene expressions necessary for endomesoderm specification.</p>

<title>AGS serves as a variable factor in the conserved ACD machinery</title>
<p>AGS shows a variable C-terminal domain and appears to be a primary factor for facilitating ACD diversity. However, is AGS the only variable factor among the ACD machinery? To test this question, we cloned and injected orthologs of other ACD factors, such as Insc and Dlg, from pencil urchins (Et) or sea stars (Pm) into sea urchins. Both Insc and Dlg showed relatively conserved functional domains among three echinoderms with an extra PDZ domain present in PmDlg (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A-B</xref>; S8-9). Importantly, these Pm and Et ACD factors showed cortical localization at the vegetal cortex in the sea urchin embryo (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9C-F</xref>). These results are in stark contrast to the earlier results of Pm/Et AGS, which showed varied localization and function in ACD. Therefore, Insc and Dlg might not be the significant variable factors.</p>

<p>To determine how dominantly SpAGS facilitates ACD diversity, we introduced SpAGS, EtAGS, or PmAGS into the pencil urchin, an ancestral type of sea urchin, and compared their function. We co-introduced Vasa-mCherry to identify the development of the germline, which is one of the micromere descendants. Pencil urchin embryos typically form 0-4 micromere-like cells randomly (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10A</xref>). Notably, only SpAGS injection increased the formation of micromere-like cells in the resultant pencil urchin embryos. In contrast, EtAGS and PmAGS showed no significant difference from the negative control (Vasa-mCherry only, <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10B</xref>). This result suggests that SpAGS increases the frequency of micromere-like cell formation in pencil urchin embryos.</p>

<p>Sea urchin embryos show Vasa enrichment in micromeres at the 16-cell stage. In contrast, pencil urchin embryos show such enrichment later in the larval stage (3-4 dpf), which is more similar to the timing of the germline segregation in sea star embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Juliano &amp; Wessel, 2009</xref>). We observed that SpAGS increased the Vasa signal enrichment in micromere-like cells compared to the control (Vasa-mCherry only) at the 16-cell stage. On the other hand, other AGS orthologs showed no significant difference from the control (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10C-D</xref>). Nearly 80% (80.12% ± 3.75) of the SpAGS-introduced embryos showed co-enrichment of AGS and Vasa in micromere-like cells, while the EtAGS and PmAGS groups showed only 49.2% ± 8.94 and 43.37% ± 3.94 enrichment, respectively (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10E</xref>). Consistently, the SpAGS group showed the earlier segregation of Vasa-positive cells similar to sea urchin embryos at 1 dpf (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10F-G</xref>), potentially accelerating the lineage segregation of the pencil urchin embryo.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The introduction of ACD in early embryogenesis of the sea urchin led to the formation of a new cell type, micromeres, with a critical organizer function. In the sea urchin, SpAGS is essential for micromere formation, while other echinoderm embryos show no cortical AGS localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Poon et al., 2019</xref>). This study demonstrates that the GL1 motif of SpAGS is key for its vegetal cortical localization and function in micromere formation.</p>
<p>Importantly, this unique role of the GL1 motif appears to be conserved across organisms. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pins and humans LGN, GL1 is free from TPR binding, making it essential for the recruitment of Pins/LGN to the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Nipper et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Takayanagi et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, the evolutionary introduction of the GL1 motif into SpAGS likely increased recruitment affinity to the vegetal cortex, inducing ACD in the sea urchin embryo.</p>
<p>The GL1 deletion significantly disrupted micromere formation, while its replacement with other GL motifs had no effect. Therefore, the GL1 position rather than the sequence is essential for SpAGS function in ACD regulation. In contrast, GL3 and GL4 sequences are crucial for SpAGS activity, which also appears to be conserved across organisms. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pins and human LGN, GL2-3 and GL3-4 sequences, respectively, are essential for their intramolecular interactions with TPR motifs, which control Pins/LGN’s autoinhibited conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Nipper et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Pan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Smith &amp; Prehoda, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Takayanagi et al., 2019</xref>). In a closed conformation, Pins/LGN are unable to bind to Mud/NuMA. Therefore, Gαi binding to GL1 relieves the autoinhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Du &amp; Macara, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Nipper et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Takayanagi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Pan et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, the TPR4-6 motifs are necessary to restrict SpAGS localization to the vegetal cortex, suggesting their interactions with GL motifs to maintain autoinhibition.</p>
<p>While the role of AGS protein in spindle orientation has been established in several model organisms, it was unknown if or how far AGS could regulate the fate determinants to facilitate ACD diversity. In this study, we learned that SpAGS is essential for the recruitment of ACD factors, such as Insc and NuMA, and fate determinants, such as Vasa and β-catenin, to micromeres. Notably, in pencil urchin embryos, SpAGS recruited Vasa protein into micromeres, suggesting SpAGS may be sufficient to recruit necessary fate determinants to create cell lineage segregation in another species. Although such a lineage segregation of micromeres may be mediated solely by ACD, their function as organizers might require additional changes in the developmental program of the entire embryo. For example, sea urchin embryos have a robust hyaline layer to keep blastomeres together, which presumably increases the cell-cell interaction and may also enhance cell signaling during early embryogenesis. In contrast, a hyaline layer is not or little present in sea star or pencil urchin embryos, respectively. At present, we do not know what developmental changes are upstream or downstream of micromere formation during sea urchin diversification. It will be important to identify in the future how far SpAGS impacts the developmental program other than inducing ACD and what other developmental elements play critical roles in establishing micromeres as a new cell lineage and organizers during sea urchin diversification.</p>
<p>Overall, we conclude that the GL1 motif unique to sea urchin AGS orthologs is critical for SpAGS function in micromere formation. Since the unique role of the GL1 motif appears to be conserved across organisms, including <italic>Drosophila</italic> and humans, it is possible that the GL1 motif was once lost in the echinoderm common ancestor and recovered during sea urchin diversification. The recovery of this GL1 motif also resumed the interaction between SpAGS and other ACD machinery, such as NuMA, Insc, and Dlg, at the cortex in a similar manner to its orthologs Pins and LGN in other phyla, resulting in the controlled ACD and further interactions with fate determinants to form a new cell type in the sea urchin embryo. Therefore, unlike random unequal cell divisions that do not alter cell fates, AGS-mediated cell divisions appear to be highly organized and may be programmed to cause cell fate changes. Considering great variations within the C-terminus of AGS orthologs and their immediate impact on micromere formation, we propose that AGS is a variable factor in facilitating ACD diversity among echinoderm embryos, contributing to developmental diversity within a phylum. Future studies in other taxa are awaited to prove this concept further.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Previous work has shown that the evolutionarily-conserved division-orienting protein LGN/Pins (vertebrates/flies) participates in division orientation across a variety of cell types, perhaps most importantly those that undergo asymmetric divisions. Micromere formation in echinoids relies on asymmetric cell division at the 16-cell stage, and these authors previously demonstrated a role for the LGN/Pins homolog AGS in that ACD process. Here they extend that work by investigating and exploiting the question of why echinoids but not other echinoderms form micromeres. Starting with a phylogenetics approach, they determine that much of the difference in ACD and micromere formation in echinoids can be attributed to differences in the AGS C-terminus, in particular a GoLoco domain (GL1) that is missing in most other echinoderms.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>There is a lot to like about this paper. It represents a superlative match of the problem with the model system and the findings it reports are a valuable addition to the literature. It is also an impressively thorough study; the authors should be commended for using a combination of experimental approaches (and consequently generating a mountain of data).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There is an intriguing finding described in Figure 1. AGS in sea cucumbers looks identical to AGS in the pencil urchin, at least at the C terminus (including the GL1 domain). Nevertheless, there are no micromeres in sea cucumbers. Therefore another mechanism besides GL motif organization has arisen to support micromere formation. It is a consequential finding and an important consideration in interpreting the data, but I could not find any mention of it in the text. That is a missed opportunity and should be remedied, ideally not only through discussion but also experimentation. Specifically: does sea cucumber AGS (SbAGS) ever localize to the vegetal cortex in sea cucumbers? Can it do so in echinoids? Will that support micromere formation?</p>
<p>The authors point out that AGS-PmGL demonstrates enrichment at the vegetal cortex (arrow in 5G, quantifications in 5H), unlike PmAGS. AGS-PmGL does not however support ACD. They interpret this result to indicate &quot;that other elements of SpAGS outside of its C-terminus can drive its vegetal cortical localization but not function.&quot; This is a critical finding and deserves more attention. Put succinctly: Vegetal cortical localization of AGS is insufficient to promote ACD, even in echinoids. Why should this be?</p>
<p>The authors did perform experiments to address this problem, hypothesizing that the difference might be explained by the linker region, which includes a conserved phosphorylation site that mediates binding to Dlg. They write &quot;To test if this serine is essential for SpAGS localization, we mutated it to alanine (AGS-S389A in Fig. S3A). Compared to the Full AGS control, the mutant AGS-S389A showed reduced vegetal cortical localization (Fig. S3B-C) and function (Fig. S3D-E). Furthermore, we replaced the linker region of PmAGS with that of SpAGS (PmAGS-SpLinker in Fig. S4A-B). However, this mutant did not show any cortical localization nor proper function in ACD (Fig. S4C-F). Therefore, the SpAGS C-terminus is the primary element that drives ACD, while the linker region serves as the secondary element to help cortical localization of AGS.&quot;</p>
<p>The experiments performed only make sense if the AGS-PmGL chimeric protein used in Figure 5 starts the PmGL sequence only after the Sp linker, or at least after the Sp phosphorylation site. I can't tell from the paper (Figure S3 indicates that it does, whereas S5 suggests otherwise), but it's a critical piece of information for the argument. Another piece of missing information is whether the PmAGS can be phosphorylated at its own conserved phosphorylation site. The authors don't test this, which they could at least try using a phosphosite prediction algorithm, but they do show that the candidate phosphorylation site has a slightly different sequence in Pm than in Et and Sp (Fig. S4A). With impressive rigor, the authors go on to mutate the PmAGS phosphorylation site to make it identical to Sp. Nothing happens. Vegetal cortical localization does not increase over AGS-PmGL alone. Micromere formation is unrescued.</p>
<p>There is therefore a logic problem in the text, or at least in the way the text is written. The paragraph begins &quot;Additionally, AGS-PmGL unexpectedly showed cortical localization (Figure 5G), while PmAGS showed no cortical localization (Figure 5B).&quot; We want to understand why this is true, but the explanation provided in the remainder of the paragraph doesn't match the question: according to quite a bit of their own data, the phosphorylation site in the linker does not explain the difference. It might explain why AGS-PmGL fails to promote micromere formation, but only if the AGS-PmGL chimeric protein uses the Pm linker domain (see above).</p>
<p>Another concern that is potentially related is the measurement of cortical signal. For example, in the control panel of Figure 5C, there is certainly a substantial amount of &quot;non-cortical&quot; signal that I believe is nuclear. I did not see a discussion of this signal or its implications. My impression of the pictures generally is that the nuclear signal and cortical signal are inversely correlated, which makes sense if they are derived from the same pool of total protein at different points of the cell cycle. If that's the case (and it might not be) I would expect some quantifications to be impacted. For example, the authors show in Figure S3B that AGS-S389A mutant does not localize to the cortex. However, this mutant shows a radically different localization pattern to the accompanying control picture (AGS), namely strong enrichment in what I assume to be the nucleus. Is the S389 mutant preventing AGS from making it to the cortex? Or are these pictures instead temporally distinct, meaning that AGS hasn't yet made it out of the nucleus? Notably, the work of Johnston et al. (Cell 2009), cited in the text, does not show or claim that the linker domain impacts Pins localization. Their model is rather that Pins is anchored at the cortex by Gαi, not Dlg, and that is the same model described in this manuscript. In agreement with that model and the results of Johnston et al., a later study (Neville et al. EMBO Reports 2023) failed to find a role for Dlg or the conserved phosphorylation site in Pins localization.</p>

<p>This study from Dr. Emura and colleagues addresses the relevance of AGS3 mutations in the execution of asymmetric cell divisions promoting the formation of the micromere during sea-searching development. To this aim, the authors use quantitative imaging approaches to evaluate the localisation of AGS3 mutants truncated at the N-terminal region or at the C-terminal region, and correlate these distributions with the formation of micromere and correct development of embryos to the pluteus stage. The authors also analyse the capacity of these mutated proteins to rescue developmental defects observed upon AGS3 depletion by morpholino antisense nucleotides (MO). Collectively these experiments revealed that the C-terminus of AGS3, coding for four GoLoco motifs binding to cortical Gaphai proteins, is the molecular determinant for cortical localisation of AGS3 at the micromeres and correct pluteus development. Further genetic dissections and expression of chimeric AGS3 mutants carrying shuffled copies of the GoLoco motifs or four copies of the same motifs revealed that the position of GoLoco1 is essential for AGS3 functioning. To understand whether the AGS3-GoLoco1 evolved specifically to promote asymmetric cell divisions, the authors analyse chimeric AGS3 variants in which they replaced the sea urchin GoLoco region with orthologs from other echinoids that do not form micromeres, or from Drosophila Pins or human LGN. These analyses corroborate the notion that the GoLoco1 position is crucial for asymmetric AGS3 functions. In the last part of the manuscript, the authors explore whether SpAGS3 interacts with the molecular machinery described to promote asymmetric cell division in eukaryotes, including Insc, NuMA, Par3, and Galphai, and show that all these proteins colocalize at the nascent micromere, together with the fate determinant Vasa. Collectively this evidence highlighted how evolutionarily selected AGS3 modifications are essential to sustain asymmetric divisions and specific developmental programs associated with them.</p>
