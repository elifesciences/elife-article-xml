<title>Abstract</title><p>The apicoplast is a four-membrane plastid found in the apicomplexans, which harbors biosynthesis and organelle housekeeping activities in the matrix. However, the mechanism driving the flux of metabolites, in and out, remains unknown. Here we used TurboID and genome engineering to identify apicoplast transporters in <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>. Among the many novel transporters, we show that one pair of apicomplexan monocarboxylate transporters (AMTs) appears to have evolved from a putative host cell that engulfed a red alga. Protein depletion showed that AMT1 and AMT2 are critical for parasite growth. Metabolite analyses supported the notion that AMT1 and AMT2 are associated with biosynthesis of isoprenoids and fatty acids. However, stronger phenotypic defects were observed for AMT2, including in the inability to establish <italic>T. gondii</italic> parasite virulence in mice. This study clarifies, significantly, the mystery of apicoplast transporter composition and reveals the importance of the pair of AMTs in maintaining the apicoplast activity in apicomplexans.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The phylum Apicomplexa encompasses thousands of intracellular parasites, including <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. spp., the notorious agent of malaria, and <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, the highly successful parasite that infects almost all warm-blooded animals and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Plattner and Soldati-Favre, 2008</xref>). It is believed that apicomplexan evolution included two key independent, and sequential, endosymbiotic events, finally leading to the common ancestor of the chromalveolates (e.g. alveolates, heterokonts, oomycetes and Cryptomonads) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cavalier-Smith, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Gould et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Janouskovec et al., 2010</xref>). This ancestor eventually gave rise to the apicomplexans, most of which still contain a secondary non-photosynthetic plastid, the apicoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">McFadden and Yeh, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Obornik et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Salomaki and Kolisko, 2019</xref>). Though endosymbiont origins of the apicoplast were proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Köhler et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">McFadden et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Wilson et al., 1996</xref>), it is believed that the apicoplast originates from a red alga (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Foth and McFadden, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">McFadden and van Dooren, 2004</xref>). Therefore, the apicoplast membranes have been proposed to evolve from the red algal plastid, the algal plasma membrane and the host endomembrane when counting from the innermost to outermost membranes of the apicoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Gould et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">McFadden and Yeh, 2017</xref>). This heavily compartmentalized feature poses great challenges for metabolic integration of the organelle within these parasites and, in particular, the transport of metabolites across these membrane systems.</p>
<p>The apicoplast houses essential biosynthetic pathways. These pathways include the fatty acid synthesis type II (FASII) pathway, methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, Fe-S cluster biosynthesis pathway, (partial) heme biosynthesis pathway and lysophosphatidic acid synthesis pathway (using the FASII products) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Amiar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fata and Rabuzzi, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Jomaa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kloehn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Krishnan et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Ralph et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Tjhin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Waller et al., 1998</xref>). They are able to make critical components of fatty acids and isoprenoid precursors for the parasites, in <italic>T. gondii</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">McFadden and Yeh, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Ramakrishnan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Striepen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Vaughan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Yeh and DeRisi, 2011</xref>). The apicoplast FASII pathway in <italic>T. gondii</italic> is key to understand the metabolic flexibility, and can become essential under metabolic adaptation conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Amiar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Botté et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Krishnan et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Primo et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, the apicoplast maintains housekeeping activities for genome replication, transcription and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Low et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">McFadden and Roos, 1999</xref>). Accordingly, it requires adequate supplies of carbon molecules, energy, reducing equivalents, cofactors, amino acids, nucleotides as well as inorganic ions, to feed the biosynthetic pathways and plastid maintenance activities in the matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kloehn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">McFadden and Yeh, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Ralph et al., 2004</xref>). However, compared to plant plastids, the nature of the channels and transporters in the apicoplast remains obscure.</p>
<p>The apicoplast biosynthetic pathways were characterized through a homology/bipartite signal-based approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Foth et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Ralph et al., 2004</xref>). A similar approach was utilized to identify phosphate translocators in <italic>T. gondii</italic> (i.e. <italic>Tg</italic>APT1) and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (i.e. <italic>Pf</italic>iTPT and <italic>Pf</italic>oTPT), and a two-pore channel TPC in <italic>T. gondii</italic>. These transporters are capable of supplying phosphorylated carbons, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brooks et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fleige et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Karnataki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Lim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Mullin et al., 2006</xref>), and calcium to the apicoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Li et al., 2021</xref>). It was proposed that an early step in the endosymbiotic event was to integrate transporters that exchange metabolites across the membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cavalier-Smith, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Weber et al., 2006</xref>). Consistent with that, studies demonstrated that 57-58% of the chloroplast transporters have an origin in the putative host cell in the first endosymbiosis while 20-30% are from bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Karkar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Tyra et al., 2007</xref>). It is plausible that a complex transporting system was produced in the evolution of the secondary plastid (i.e. the apicoplast).</p>
<p>Recent studies suggested that we still do not know the major source of pyruvate required for the biosynthesis pathways in the apicoplast of <italic>T. gondii</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Swift et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Xia et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, identifying the apicoplast transporter composition and their functions is critical for an understanding of how these transporters evolved and how the organelle maintains its metabolic and housekeeping activities. In this study, we utilized the apicomplexan model organism <italic>T. gondii</italic> to screen apicoplast membrane proteins, identified from available computational and proteomic information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barylyuk et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Boucher et al., 2018</xref>) and from our APT1-TurboID proximity proteomic candidates, and discovered several novel apicoplast transporters. Among the many transporter candidates, one pair of monocarboxylate transporters (AMTs) appeared to have evolved from the putative host cell involved in the evolution of the secondary plastid. Detailed analyses support association of the AMTs with the apicoplast biosynthesis pathways likely by supplying the pathways with substrates. This study opens up the possibilities of tackling difficult questions of substrate transport and especially for the pair of monocarboxylate transporters in <italic>T. gondii</italic> and in other members of this phylum of deadly parasites.</p>

<title>Discovery of novel transporters in the apicoplast of <italic>T. gondii</italic></title>
<p>To identify apicoplast transporter proteins in <italic>T. gondii</italic>, we first analyzed candidates identified in recent studies using combined proteomic and computational analyses in <italic>T. gondii</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barylyuk et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Boucher et al., 2018</xref>). The hyperplexed localization of organelle proteins (hyperLOPIT) assigned 129 proteins to the apicoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barylyuk et al., 2020</xref>), of which three proteins were likely transporters, i.e. APT1 (Transmembrane Domain, TMD=6), one major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter (TGME49_309580) (HAP1, hypothetical apicoplast protein 1) and one hypothetical protein (TGME49_267690) (HAP2) (Table S1). We also mined an apicoplast proteomic dataset obtained by the BioID fusion at acyl carrier protein (ACP) in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Boucher et al., 2018</xref>), which reported 16 transmembrane domains (TMDs) ≥ 6 protein candidates, and two additional candidates annotated as ABC transporters (TMDs&lt;6). We identified the orthologues in <italic>T. gondii</italic> using the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Boucher et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Sayers et al., 2018</xref>), resulting in 8 candidates in <italic>T. gondii</italic>. They were temporarily named as HAP3-9 (Table S1). Taken together, these datasets provided only limited numbers of candidate transporters.</p>
<p>To better define the repertoire of apicoplast transporters, we employed a biotin proximity labeling strategy that is useful for defining organelle proteomes. A promiscuous biotin ligase tag called TurboID was endogenously fused with APT1, using a CRISPR approach (Table S2-4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Branon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brooks et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Long et al., 2018</xref>). The apicoplast Acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) is a strongly biotinylated protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Zuther et al., 1999</xref>), which might provide a clear and strong streptavidin labeling at the apicoplast (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Though the streptavidin signal and the protein itself were slightly diffused (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Karnataki et al., 2007</xref>), APT1 was reported to mainly localize to four of the apicoplast membranes by an Immuno-Electron Microscopy approach for HA epitopes tagged at the C-terminus of APT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Karnataki et al., 2007</xref>). This feature of APT1 thus provided good biotinylation labeling at potential proteins localized to membranes of the organelle. Predictably, many additional bands present on the APT1-TurboID lane were likely to be apicoplast proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The resultant mass-spectrometry datasets (N=3 for each) (Dataset S1) were analyzed by comparing the APT1-fusion to the parental line (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and Table S5). This analysis showed that APT1 itself has the highest <italic>p</italic>-value associated with its enrichment in the TurboID line, as would be expected for a bait protein. The TMD candidates (TMD≥6 and 2≤TMD&lt;6) were evenly distributed on the volcano map plotted by fold changes against <italic>p-</italic>values in a similar pattern to the distribution of known apicoplast proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and Table S6). These features suggested that APT1-TurboID had enriched apicoplast proteins. Thereafter, we compiled a list of the hits in order of TMD numbers, and selected all transporter candidates (including carriers) and hypothetical proteins (TMD≥6) as candidates (Table S7). These candidates were merged with the previously described ones (HAP1-9) and temporarily named as HAP10-50 (Table S8).</p>

<p>After the above candidate selections, as described in our workflow (Figure1D), we compiled a list of 50 candidates (HAP1-50) for endogenous tagging and IFA analysis in <italic>T. gondii</italic>. We successfully generated endogenous HAP-6Ty fusion lines (46 HAPs) using a CRISPR-Cas9 tagging approach (Figure S1A and Tables S2-4), as described in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Long et al., 2017b</xref>). Indirect fluorescence assay (IFA) showed that many HAP-6Ty fusions were localized to foci inside the parasites, resembling the position of the apicoplast location (Figure S1A), whereas some candidates were likely to be in the cytosolic vesicles (e.g. HAP13, HAP30, HAP35), the apical region (e.g. HAP19) or other structures (e.g. HAP22) (Figure S1B). Further analysis was performed by co-localization of the fusions with an apicoplast marker ACP, which showed that many of the foci had only partial or no co-localization with ACP (Figure S2A). However, strict analyses clearly identified 15 HAP fusions that were almost perfectly co-localized with ACP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>Of the 15 novel apicoplast membrane proteins, we identified in <italic>T. gondii</italic> that 12 proteins are annotated as putative transporters or carriers in TOXODB, and 3 are annotated as hypothetical proteins (TMD≥6) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref> and Table S9). These novel proteins included 1 from hyperLOPIT, 3 from ACP-BirA and 14 from our APT1-TurboID (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>), among which three of these proteins were shared between the APT1-TurboID and the combinations of hyperLOPIT and ACP-BirA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). Collectively, TurboID proved to be a reasonably robust approach for the identification of putative apicoplast transporters.</p>

<title>Novel transporters are mostly conserved in the Apicomplexa</title>
<p>To determine if the apicoplast transporters we identified in <italic>T. gondii</italic> are conserved in the Apicomplexa, we searched for orthologues of these novel proteins in different species, as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-B</xref>. The chromalveolate hypothesis proposed a plastid origin in a common ancestor of a single red alga, which unites the Alveolates with the chromists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cavalier-Smith, 1999</xref>). We identified orthologues in species belonging to the taxa using a powerful Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profiling strategy. The best hits (the cutoff E-value: 1×10<sup>-7</sup>) remained on the list of resultant orthologues in these species, which were then used for conservation analyses in the ComplexHeatmap package in R (v4.2.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gu et al., 2016</xref>) (Table S10, contains the hits with E-values). The conservation heatmap showed that proteins with conserved transport domains (HAP1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 28, 33, 34, 41 and 50) are mostly conserved in the Apicomplexa (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), including the Gregarina and <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> that have lost the apicoplast. Further analysis revealed that most orthologues with the exception of HAP3 and HAP4, can be identified in green algae, red algae and plants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). As the red alga is considered to have given rise to the ancestor of the secondary plastid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Gould et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Janouskovec et al., 2010</xref>), the results thus indicated that those transporters were possibly derived from the red alga.

<title>AMT1 and AMT2 might have critical roles in metabolic integration of the apicoplast</title>
<p>Several transporters, such as HAP1, 3, 4, and 34 and 50, are predicted to be essential in <italic>T. gondii</italic> and in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-B</xref>, and Table S9 contains the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> orthologues with fitness scores) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Sidik et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). The analyses with InterProScan showed that three of these transporters (HAP1, 3 and 4) belong to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) (Figure S2B). The MFS is a large family of transporters capable of transporting small solutes in response to chemiosmotic ion gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Pao et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Walmsley et al., 1998</xref>). These MFS transporters contain a pair of monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) with 11-12 TMDs (Figure S2C). The MCTs play essential roles in the transport of nutrients, such as pyruvate, lactate, amino acids and so on, in the plasma membrane of human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Felmlee et al., 2020</xref>). These features attracted our intense attention, and thus named the MCTs as <bold>A</bold>picoplast <bold>M</bold>onocarboxylate <bold>T</bold>ransporters (AMTs, AMT1 for HAP3, TGGT1_233540; AMT2 for HAP4, TGGT1_297245).</p>
<p>We noticed that these two transporters are absent in red algae, green algae and plants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). This observation is in contrast to APT1, which was identifiable in these primary plastid-containing taxa (e.g. plants) but not in cyanobacteria (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Evolution and phylogenetic analyses suggested that the plant orthologues of APT1 are derived from a putative host cell that previously engulfed a cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Knappe et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Weber et al., 2006</xref>). The pair of AMTs appears similar to the APT1 situation, indicating that they were possibly derived from the heterotrophic protist – the putative host cell - that previously engulfed a red alga. The AMTs were identifiable in the photosynthetic relative (e.g. <italic>Chromera velia</italic>) of the apicomplexans, and a distant relative taxa of Oomycetes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), indicating a broader conservation in these species. We further analyzed orthologues in selected species of apicomplexans and found that most species contain at least two identifiable orthologues, including <italic>Crytosporidium spp</italic>. (Table S11). Collectively, the pair of AMTs is likely to have critical roles in metabolic integration of the endosymbiont in the parasite cytosol during evolution.</p>

<title>AMT1 and AMT2 are essential for the parasites</title>
<p>The confocal imaging showed that AMT1-6Ty was almost perfectly co-localized with AMT2-6HA (Figure S3A), suggesting that the putative transporters are highly likely to be localized at the apicoplast membranes. In support of this model, immuno-Electron Microscopy (immuno-EM) provided a further piece of evidence, supporting the membrane localization of AMT1 and AMT2 (Figure S3B). Due to the complexity of the apicoplast membranes, and heterogeneity of immunolabeling, the precise topology of AMT1 and AMT2 within the apicoplast membranes merits future investigation. To analyze the physiological functions of the AMTs, we generated the conditional knockdown lines using an IAA-inducible degron (AID) system in <italic>T. gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Brown et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Long et al., 2017b</xref>). The CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing approach was utilized to specifically fuse the AID-6Ty at the 3’-terminus of the genes in the IAA receptor (TIR1) expressing line RH TIR1 (Figure S4A). To conditionally study both proteins together, we fused AMT2 with AID-3HA at the 3’-terminus in the background of AMT1-AID-6Ty, creating a double knockdown line AMT1-AID-6Ty/AMT2-AID-3HA (dKD). Correct integration of the AID fragments was confirmed by diagnostic PCR as demonstrated in the schematic diagram (Figure S4A-B). As expected, the AID fusions were efficiently and stably depleted in IAA treatments for 3-36 hours, as shown on Western blots (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). It was noteworthy that Western blots detected two bands in the single and double AID fusion lines, which might be the precursor and mature forms of AMT1 and AMT2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). So far, several membrane proteins have been identified in the apicoplast of <italic>T. gondii</italic>, four of which were observed to be processed (FtsH1, TiC20, ATrx1 and TPC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">DeRocher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Karnataki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Karnataki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">van Dooren et al., 2008</xref>). Yet, at least ATrx1 and FtsH1 lack canonical signal peptides. However, in <italic>P. falciparum,</italic> PfiTPT is processed and cleaved, while PfoTPT is unprocessed due to its absence of a signal peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Mullin et al., 2006</xref>). The processing and topology of AMTs is complex and unpredictable in <italic>T. gondii,</italic> thus requiring further work to clarify the origin of either the processing hypothesis, alternative splicing or alternative initiator codons in the parasite. Further analysis by IFA showed that the AID fusions were correctly localized to the apicoplast and were depleted within 24 hours of IAA treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and Figure S4C); however, the parasite bodies were morphologically normal. To assess lytic growth of the AID lines, we assayed plaque formation of the AID parasites on host cell monolayers for 7 days. We observed that the AID lines grown in IAA did not form discernible plaques (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), which was supported by further analysis of the plaque numbers and areas (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D-E</xref>). In summary, the AMTs are potentially essential for <italic>in vitro</italic> parasite growth.</p>

<p>We wondered if parasite replication contributed to the plaque defects. The parasites were grown in IAA for 24 hours, followed by scraping, purification and re-infection for the assay in the 2<sup>nd</sup> 24 hours and 3rd 24 hours. Using IFA analysis of the parasites, we observed that parasite replication was significantly affected in the first 24 hours of growth and became worse in the following cycles of 24 hours, especially the 3<sup>rd</sup> 24 hour period (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). These results suggested that depletion of the transporters caused strong growth defects and delayed death of the parasites. We wondered if depletion of the proteins could cause loss or breakdown of the apicoplast, as reported previously for many apicoplast proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kennedy et al., 2019b</xref>). ACP, an apicoplast marker, was used to test the apicoplast status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Waller et al., 1998</xref>). We observed that ACP partially diffused in the cytosol of intracellular parasites grown in IAA for 24 hours (Figure S5A), whereas it completely diffused in the cytosol of extracellular parasites that had grown in IAA for 24 hours (Figure S5B). This observation suggested swelling or breakdown of the apicoplast in the intracellular or extracellular parasites depleted with the AMTs, respectively. Detailed analysis of the phenotypes showed that the ACP diffusion gradually increased while comparing the three cycles for the same AID line in both the intracellular and extracellular parasites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G-H</xref>). However, it was as low as ∼30% in AMT1-AID, compared to those (60-70%) in AMT2-AID and dKD (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G-H</xref>). These results suggested that depletion of AMT2-AID resulted in much more severe defects (swelling or breakdown) of the apicoplast than that of AMT1-AID, and further depletion of AMT1-AID had no further effect.</p>

<title>Depletion of the proteins resulted in defects in metabolic pathways</title>
<p>Based on the evolutionary predictions and features of monocarboxylate transporters, we suspected that the AMTs might be involved in transport of substrates, such as pyruvate, lactate, amino acids, as reported for human MCTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Felmlee et al., 2020</xref>). As such, depletion of AMT1 and AMT2 would result in reduced levels of the metabolites isopentenyl pyrophosphate (isoprenoid precursors, IPP) and fatty acids in <italic>T. gondii</italic>. We first designed experiments to examine the possible defect of IPP synthesis in the AID lines upon induction, by assaying the capabilities of endocytic trafficking of GFP vesicles to the vacuolar compartment (VAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dou et al., 2014</xref>). Our recent data showed that GFP transport to the VAC following its uptake from host cell cytosol is dependent on protein prenylation of Rab1B and YKT6.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). These proteins are modified at the C-terminal motif by isoprenoids, the synthesis of which could be specifically inhibited by atorvastatin at the host cells and by zoledronate in the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Li et al., 2013</xref>), as demonstrated in a schematic and in positive experiments (TIR1 with two drugs at IC50 concentrations) with reduced GFP transport (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-B</xref>). Therefore, measuring the endocytic trafficking of GFP vesicles in parasites in the absence/presence of atorvastatin could reflect levels of protein prenylation and isoprenoids (IPP). The substrates modified at the proteins were mainly derived from the apicoplast biosynthesis pathway - the MEP pathway. We then assayed the TIR1 and AID lines by growing them in GFP expressing HFF monolayers, where experimental groups were controlled by absence/presence of atorvastatin and IAA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), and where LHVS was added to avoid degradation of GFP in the VAC. Following endocytosis of GFP vesicles by the micropore (manuscript in press), GFP vesicles were successfully transported to and accumulated in the VAC of TIR without IAA, with a high percentage (&gt;20%) of parasites containing GFP foci (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). In contrast, the GFP vesicles diffused through the cytosol, and were unable to accumulate at the VAC in the AID parasites grown in IAA with the absence/presence of atorvastatin, as shown by significantly reduced percentages (∼8%) of the parasites in the AID lines induced for 12 hours (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). We further tested Rab1B stability in the AMT-AID lines grown in IAA for 12 hours, which showed a strong defect of reduced protein abundance of Rab1B by scoring of parasites with normal or abnormal level of Rab1B using an IFA approach (Figure S5C). This phenotype was observed in parasites with a reduced supply of isoprenoids by drug inhibition or knockdown of prenyl-transferase GGT-2 (unpublished data). These results altogether thus suggested that the IPP synthesis is significantly decreased in the AID lines depleted with the transporters. However, it was noteworthy that parasites depleted with AMT1-AID and AMT2-AID had similar levels of reduced GFP transport and parasites with reduced protein abundance of Rab1B at the 12 hours of IAA induction, suggesting that depletions of AMT1 and AMT2 resulted in similar levels of IPP reduction in parasites.</p>

<caption><p>Depletion of AMT1 and AMT2 caused defects of MEP and FASII pathways (A-C) The MEP activity was strongly affected in the AID lines.

<p>Our results in <italic>T. gondii</italic> reported a physiological effect that was observed in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, where inhibition of the MEP pathway by fosmidomycin caused disruption of hemoglobin transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Howe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kennedy et al., 2019a</xref>). Herein, our results underscored the importance of the transporters for supporting the MEP pathway in the apicoplast. This was further manifested by a reduced level of mitochondrial membrane potential detected by mitotracker red in the AMT1-AID or AMT2-AID lines grown in IAA for 24 hours (Figure S5D). IPP is the precursor for synthesis of ubiquinone, an essential electron carrier required for electron transport in the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kennedy et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sleda et al., 2022</xref>). The reduced mitochondrial potential was also observed in the parasites depleted with APT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brooks et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, the reduced mitochondrial membrane potential provided another piece of evidence supporting the notion of defective IPP synthesis in parasites depleted with the transporters.</p>
<p>We further examined activity of the FASII pathway in the TIR1 and AID lines grown in IAA for 18 hours, by testing metabolites (e.g. FA) in the parasites using untargeted metabolomics (GCMS and LCMS). The metabolomics detected 66 metabolites in total in these lines (Dataset S2). After analyses using Dunnette’s multiple comparison methods, 15, 23, and 34 differential metabolites were identified in the parasite groups depleted with either AMT1-AID, AMT2-AID or both (dKD) (Table S12), in comparison with TIR1. Interestingly, three AID lines shared 13 differential metabolites (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). The shared metabolites included fatty acids and lipids, such as myristic acid (C14 fatty acid), palmitoleic acid (C16 fatty acid), trans-oleic acid (C18 fatty acid) and phospholipids containing C14 and C18 fatty acids (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D-E</xref>). These results were consistent with previous studies where inactivated FASII proteins led to reduced synthesis of fatty acids up to 18 carbons long, and exogenous additions of the C14 and C16 fatty acids could complement growth defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Liang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Ramakrishnan et al., 2012</xref>). Studies suggested that lipids can be partially acquired from the host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Krishnan et al., 2020a</xref>), which includes those in the endocytic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Koreny et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Wan et al., 2023</xref>). Here we observed that the endocytic vesicles containing GFP were diffused in the parasite cytosol, indicating that the host cell-derived lipids were not affected in the protein-depleted parasites. We then concluded that depletion of the transporters significantly impaired the <italic>de novo</italic> biosynthesis of fatty acids by the FASII activity in the parasite. In contrast to the same level of reduced endocytic trafficking of GFP vesicles in the AID lines, an overall trend toward lower levels of myristic acid (C14 fatty acid), palmitoleic acid (C16 fatty acid) and trans-oleic acid (C18 fatty acid) was observed in AMT2-AID and tKD parasites in comparison with the AMT1-AID parasites (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>. These results supported the notion of a stronger impairment of the FASII pathway in parasites depleted with AMT2-AID.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, the metabolomics also identified metabolites related to the TCA cycle, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamic acid, and succinic acid (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>), which were shared among three of the AID lines. This would likely result from defective membrane potential caused by a reduced supply of IPP for synthesis of ubiquinone, as described above, or synthesis of heme that requires co-operation between the mitochondrion and the apicoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Harding et al., 2020</xref>). Another two metabolites, creatine and lactic acid, were likely associated with reduced metabolic levels in the parasites (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). The untargeted metabolomics tends to identify differential metabolites by comparing the AID to TIR1 lines. Pyruvate was not identified, as it is actually a product of glycolysis in the cytosol. Collectively, the transporters are expectedly associated with the MEP and FASII pathways, to support synthesis of IPP and FA in the apicoplast.</p>

<title>Depletion of AMT2 affects stability of ACC1</title>
<p>Depletion of AMT2 resulted in stronger defects on ACP diffusion and synthesis of fatty acids, suggesting a more important role of AMT2 in the apicoplast. To find out the reason for this, we first examined the protein level of one AMT (fused with 6HA) in another AMT’s AID-Ty line, thus assuring no reciprocal effect on protein level. After IAA induction for 36 hours, we did not see obvious changes to protein levels in the 6HA fusions in the AID-Ty lines on western blots and IFA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-B</xref>). Considering a MCT could transport biotin in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Daberkow et al., 2003</xref>), we wondered if AMT2 was able to transport biotin for activation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase ACC1, which is a key enzyme in FASII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Zuther et al., 1999</xref>). ACC1 was endogenously fused with 6HA in the AID lines by a CRISPR approach. Upon protein depletion in IAA for 36 hours, ACC1 was found to be gone only in the AMT2-AID parasites, but not in the AMT1-AID parasites, as demonstrated by Western blots (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Further analysis showed that ACC1 was gone in some parasites within a single vacuole in the AMT2-AID-depleted parasites, where ACP was clearly stained with a slight diffusion (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Based on the presence or absence of ACC1 in parasites of the vacuoles, we can classify the vacuoles into three types - all parasites without ACC1 (type 1), one parasite (type 2) or two parasites (type 3) with ACC1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). The quantification assay showed that only ∼40% of the vacuoles contained one or two parasites with ACC1 signal (type 2 and type 3) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). However, ACC1 in those parasites was still biotinylated, as shown in streptavidin stains (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). Collectively, AMT2 is associated with stability of ACC1 in a way, as yet, unknown, but unrelated with biotin availability in the apicoplast.</p>

<title>AMT2 is essential to parasite virulence in mice</title>
<p>We next examined the <italic>in vivo</italic> growth of the AID parasites in mice administered with IAA. Prior to the mice assay, we attempted to gain further information about the ultra-structures of the apicoplast upon depletion of the AMTs. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrated that the four membranes surrounding the apicoplast remained visible, but were loosened, and the interior of the organelle appeared less dense and even electron lucent in the AID parasites, which had been induced for 24 hours in comparison with the TIR1 parasites (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). We further quantified the apicoplasts with a reduced electron density in the AID parasites induced for 12, 24 and 36 hours vs the TIR1 in IAA for 36 hours, by examining 300 parasites in each time point. This examination showed that the apicoplast numbers identified by TEM dropped in the AMT1-AID parasites, when induced for 24 hours and 36 hours, and the numbers dropped by much greater levels in the AMT2-AID parasites, following 12 hours of IAA induction (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Notably, the apicoplast was identified only 3 times in the AMT2-AID parasites at 36 hours induction. Accordingly, the percentage of the abnormal apicoplast increased for both of the AID lines. In contrast, depletion of AMT2-AID resulted in much higher levels of abnormal apicoplasts at the three induction time points, compared to those in parasites depleted with AMT1-AID (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). These results suggested that depletion of AMT1 caused modest loss of the apicoplast, yet the AMT2 depletion appeared to have a greater effect on the apicoplast loss.</p>

<p>The parental line TIR1 and its derivative lines (AMT1-AID, AMT2-AID and dKD) were then used to intraperitoneally infect mice, at 100 parasites per mouse, followed by administering the mice orally and intraperitoneally with IAA in a solution on a daily basis. Those mice infected with TIR1 succumbed to lethal toxoplasmosis by day 10 post infection (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Conversely, the IAA treatment ultimately prevented acute virulence caused by the parasite lines with the AMT2 depletion (i.e. AMT2-AID and dKD), and it postponed mouse death by the AMT1-AID depletion. We next tested sera extracted from the surviving mice (which were infected by AMT2-AID) by performing IFA on <italic>T. gondii</italic> parasites. The IFA showed that the mouse sera clearly recognized proteins of the parasitophorous vacuoles of the parasites (Figure S6A). We also further analyzed the efficacy of protein degradation of the AMT1-AID fusions in mice, by treatment with or without IAA for 24 hours after 5 days of growth, as illustrated in Figure S7B. It was clear that AMT1-AID was efficiently degraded in mice by the treatment of IAA in only 24 hours (Figure S6B). These results demonstrated that the mice infection assays were robust. However, the strong growth impairment conferred by AMT1 depletion in parasites in cell culture surprisingly resulted in only reduced parasite virulence in mice. We assume that this discrepancy is related to the relatively modest defects, such as the ACP diffusion/apicoplast abnormality (revealed by TEM)/FASII activity, as observed in the AMT1-depleted parasites. Thus, the remaining apicoplast is still functionally generating an adequate amount of metabolites, allowing the parasites to survive in mice. However, the discrepancy is possibly associated with different transport capabilities of substrates by AMT1 and AMT2. Though this does not perfectly explain the discrepancy, weaker phenotypes in AMT1-depleted parasites argue for this possibility. Collectively, AMT2 was obviously essential for establishing <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection and virulence in mice.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Most of the apicomplexan parasites, such as <italic>T. gondii</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium spp</italic>., harbor a vestigial plastid, which undergoes several fitness-conferring or essential metabolic pathways in the matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kloehn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Lim and McFadden, 2010</xref>). However, the transporters that are responsible for exchanging metabolites between the apicoplast and the parasite remain elusive, due to difficulties in identification of those transporters in the multiple membranes that surround the organelle. Here we fully exploited the currently available data, and the high-efficiency of proximity biotin labeling and CRISPR-Cas9 tagging approaches in the model apicomplexan <italic>T. gondii</italic>, and discovered several novel transporters in the apicoplast. Among those putative transporters, most of them appear to be derived from the endosymbiont (i.e. a red alga) in the evolution of the secondary plastid, and only the pair of monocarboxylate transporters AMT1 and AMT2 is likely to be derived from the putative host cell that originally engulfed the endosymbiont. Protein depletion of the AMT1 and AMT2 using a highly efficient technique, the TIR1-AID system, resulted in defects of plaque formation <italic>in vitro</italic>, ACP diffusion/apicoplast loss and biosynthetic pathways of the MEP and FASII. However, depletion of AMT2 clearly caused stronger defects including ACP diffusion/apicoplast loss, FASII produced fatty acids, ACC1 stability and removal of mouse virulence. These results indicate that complex transporting functions are likely to exist in the apicoplast involving AMT1 and AMT2.</p>
<p>Recent studies have highlighted the difficulty in identifying apicoplast transporters, because of strong backgrounds in the proteomics resulting from high activity and nonspecific labeling of the biotin ligase (BioID) fused with apicoplast proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Boucher et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Sayers et al., 2018</xref>). This remained true for our proximity proteomics from APT1-TurboID. Fortunately, our focused screening leveraged high efficiency by genomic editing in <italic>T. gondii,</italic> yielding positive results for 12 putative transporters. These novel transporters provided an important resource for evolution and functional analyses. Their conservation, including in plastid-deficient taxa, i.e. Gregarina and Cryptosporidia, indicates that these proteins were relics of the former plastid in evolution via endosymbiont gene transfers (EGT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Gould et al., 2008</xref>). Studies suggested that the metabolic integration of the primary plastid (e.g. chloroplast) was mainly driven by targeting transporters from a heterotrophic protist - the host cell, but not from the endosymbiont - cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Karkar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Tyra et al., 2007</xref>). However, our preliminary study in evolution indicated that most novel transporters were likely to be derived from the endosymbiont. In sharp contrast, the pair of monocarboxylate transporters (AMT1 and AMT2) may have an origin in a heterotrophic protist – the putative host cell. This observation therefore provides a perspective that the pair of AMTs may play critical roles in the metabolic integration of the algal endosymbiont into the parasites.</p>
<p>Our immuno-EM and confocal imaging provided a strong support for the membrane localization of the pair of transporters AMT1 and AMT2 in the apicoplast, indicating that the AMTs are likely to transport substrates in the membranes. We observed that the AMTs appeared to have two bands on Western blot, which might be processed versions, or produced by alternative splicing or produced by an alternative initiator codon. Concerning the processing and targeting, apicoplast membrane proteins in <italic>T. gondii</italic> appear to be more complex than those in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, by comparison to PfiTPT and PfoTPT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Mullin et al., 2006</xref>). Our phenotypic analysis showed that depletion of the transporters AMT1 and AMT2 caused strong defects on plaque formation and parasite replication, suggesting that both transporters are critical on the apicoplast membranes. However, we observed disparate degrees of phenotypic disruption in the AMT1-depleted and AMT2-depleted parasites. Depletion of AMT2 always caused stronger defects in ACP diffusion, FASII fatty acids, apicoplast loss and mouse virulence. AMT2 is additionally associated with loss of ACC1, a key enzyme for FASII, found in the majority of parasites in a vacuole, likely providing another piece of evidence to explain the greater phenotypic defects. Several attempts to delete ACC1 failed in our study, supporting a critical role of ACC1 in the FASII process. Genetic studies suggest that depletion of FASII enzymes led to loss of apicoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Krishnan et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Liang et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, the observation of ACC1 loss supports stronger phenotypes in AMT2-AID depleted parasites. In addition, depletion of the AMTs caused an initially gradual defect, but then a much more focused sharper defect in parasite replication in the 3<sup>rd</sup> 24 hours and showed a delayed death phenotype. Previous studies showed that parasite replication exhibited gradual deceases upon depletion of TPC and APT1 by utilization of a low efficient knockdown strategy - the tetracyclin-inducible system (TATi) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brooks et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Li et al., 2021</xref>). It is unknown whether the TATi system would mask the growth phenotype, yet, the AMT depletion appeared to have such a sharper change in the third cycle (24 hours in a growth cycle). Collectively, the AMTs are critical to parasites, yet AMT2 is more important to the apicoplast membrane function.</p>
<p>Based on knowledge of MCTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Felmlee et al., 2020</xref>), the pair of AMTs is likely to transport pyruvate, lactate, amino acids and other substrates. We thus suspect that AMT1 and AMT2 might be associated with transporting pyruvate and amino acids, since these are essential for the apicoplast metabolism. Pyruvate is the central metabolite that connects many metabolic pathways in living organisms. It must be imported into organelles for specific metabolic pathways, as suggested with pyruvate import by the NHD1/Bass2-protein coupling function in the chloroplast of C4 plants, and by the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier MPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bricker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Furumoto, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Furumoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gasperotti et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Herzig et al., 2012</xref>). In <italic>T. gondii</italic>, and <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, studies have suggested that the major pyruvate source has still not been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Niu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Swift et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Xia et al., 2019</xref>). Pyruvate is one of the key carbon sources for the condensation with triose phosphates to initiate the biosynthesis pathway of MEP in the parasite. Meanwhile, pyruvate is the only carbon source in the FASII pathway for biosynthesis of fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brooks et al., 2010</xref>). The possible role on pyruvate import by the AMTs could provide a good explanation for the defects on MEP and FASII pathways, specifically, the phenotypes reflecting the reduced levels of IPP synthesis in the AMT-depleted parasites. We attempted to define this possible function of the AMTs by a pyruvate sensor PyronicSF in the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arce-Molina et al., 2020</xref>), and by a complementation of an <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> knockout strain that is deficient in pyruvate import (a generous gift from Prof. Kirsten Jung) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gasperotti et al., 2020</xref>).Hhowever, several attempts with these approaches were not successful in generating the strain required for detailed examination of pyruvate import capability either in the parasite or in the <italic>E. coli</italic> strain.</p>
<p>Our work successfully identifies several novel apicoplast transporters, thus greatly unravelling the mystery of the apicoplast membrane composition and opening up possibilities to tackle difficult questions about metabolite transport in the apicomplexans. The most intriguingly findings in this study are the identification of the pair of monocarboxylate transporters AMT1 and AMT2, which are likely derived from the putative host cell that engulfed a red algal during the evolution of this group of parasites. Metabolic analysis together with other phenotypic analyses supported the notion that the pair of AMTs is associated with the MEP and FASII biosynthesis pathways. However, though both transporters belong to the MCTs, the phenotypic defects differ greatly, supporting a complex function for AMT2 in the apicoplast, however, the substrates transported by the AMTs still await further clarification. Collectively, the monocarboxylate transporters are likely to control similar essential processes in related protists, especially in other members of this phylum of deadly parasites.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Limitations of This Study</title>
<p>This study has begun to look into the possibly evolutional origins of newly identified transporters although, as yet, observations are preliminary and await further analysis to clarify specific questions, as demonstrated in the detailed evolutionary analysis of chloroplast transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Karkar et al., 2015</xref>). Our further analysis on the phenotypes of two of these transporters, AMT1 and AMT2, using parasites depleted with these activities, demonstrates differing degrees of defects at critical points in the parasite’s physiology and metabolism. We also observed similar phenotypes reflecting decreasedlevels of the MEP biosynthesis activity upon depletion of AMT1 and AMT2, indicating that phenotypic outcomes did not result from apicoplast abnormality, since other phenotypic outcomes were more severe in the AMT2-depleted parasites. We predict, therefore, that the metabolic defects possibly result from a reduced supply of substrates by each of the transporter. It is noteworthy that other studies provided us with comparable knowledge in phenotypes in TPC-depleted and APT1-depleted parasites. In these parasites, metabolic defects in the apicoplast pathways were observed by indirect measurements as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brooks et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Li et al., 2021</xref>). However, these phenotypes were possibly caused by pleiotropic effects of apicoplast loss, since they were analyzed by a comparably slow inactivation system to deplete the transporters of TPC and APT1 (with an induction of at least 3-4 days). Nevertheless, in our case with a highly efficient inactivation system, we still cannot exclude the effect of apicoplast loss on phenotypic results caused by depletion of the AMTs. Therefore, a more precise understanding of the functions of the AMTs will require further identification of the topology, protein interactions and substrate transport capability in the complex configuration of the apicoplast membranes. Our work, as yet, unsuccessful, in attempting to use a pyruvate sensor and/or a heterologous expression the AMTs in <italic>E. coli</italic>, is the first attempt to examine the transport capability of pyruvate by AMT1 and AMT2. Thereafter, the application of more sophisticated approaches, such as <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, an improved <italic>E. coli</italic> system, or a yeast expression system, may enable us to tackle the important question of substrate transport by AMT1 and AMT2. Future progress in this direction will thus shed critical insights into the discrepancies in parasite growth that we observe when comparing cell culture versus infections in mice.</p>

<title>Generation of Plasmids and <italic>T. gondii</italic> Lines</title>
<p>A CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA 3’ plasmid (Table S3) targeting a region close to a stop codon at a specific gene can efficiently produce Cas9 and sgRNA to create DNA double strand breaks (DSB) in parasites, which facilitates the integration of a tagging amplicon at the 3’ terminus of a specific gene. The sgRNA specific sequences were selected, as described in our previous protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Brown et al., 2018</xref>). The sequences were integrated into the pCas9 plasmid using a basic seamless cloning and assembly kit (CU201-02, TransGen Biotech) with primers listed in Table S4, as described in our recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Wan et al., 2023</xref>). The amplicon for a specific integration at the DSB was generated from a generic tagging plasmid (Table S3) using a pair of primers L and T (Table S4), as described in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Long et al., 2017b</xref>), which was illustrated in Fig. S4A. These generic plasmids included pL-6Ty-HXGPRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Brown and Sibley, 2018</xref>), pL-6HA-DHFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Long et al., 2017a</xref>), pL-6HA-HXGPRT (addgene #86552) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Long et al., 2017b</xref>), pL-TurboID-4Ty-DHFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Wan et al., 2023</xref>), pL-AID-6Ty-DHFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Wan et al., 2023</xref>) and pL-AID-3HA-HXGPRT (addgene #86553) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Long et al., 2017b</xref>). One additional generic plasmid pL-AID-GFP-HXGPRT was generated using pL-AID-3HA-HXGPRT as the PCR template of plasmid backbone, followed by cloning the GFP fragment into the backbone with primers listed in Table S4. The amplicon generated by primers L and T from the generic plasmids contains short homologs (HR1 and HR2, 41 bp) for targeting the upstream (HR1) of the stop codon and the downstream (HR2) of the Cas9 cleavage site (DSB), resulting in integration of epitope tags or AID fragments in frame with the encoding sequences of specific genes. The drug-selected lines were sub-cloned, followed with screening with diagnostic PCR, IFA and western blots. The resistance markers containing LoxP sites can be excised by transfection with pmini-Cre, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Heaslip et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>GFP acquisition assay</title>
<p>HFF cells expressing cytosolic GFP were prepared in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Wan et al., 2023</xref>). In brief, pLVX-EF1a-GFP-IRES-puromycin was combined with packaging plasmids psPAX2 (addgene #12260) and pMD2.G (addgene #12259) in Opti-MEM I (31985062, Gibco), and mixed with Fugene HD (E2311, Promega), and transfected into 293T cells. Viruses were collected and mixed with polybrene in a 12-well plate well containing 30-50% confluent HFF-1 cell monolayers. After 24 hours of post-transduction, the cell monolayers were re-seeded with incubation of puromycin (2.5 μg/ml) for 3 days. The cell monolayers were then maintained and expanded in D5 media. The TIR1 and AID lines were grown in the cell monolayers with IAA, 10 μM LHVS and 12.5 μM atorvastatin for 12, 24 or 36 hours. LHVS inhibits cysteine protease CPL to accumulate GFP derived from host cell cytosol, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dou et al., 2014</xref>), Atorvastatin can inhibit synthesis of FPP and GGPP in host cells, to decrease the supply of FPP and GGPP from the host cells to the parasites.

<p>The apicoplast, a non-photosynthetic vestigial chloroplast, is a key metabolic organelle for the synthesis of certain lipids in apicomplexan parasites. Although it is clear metabolite exchange between the parasite cytosol and the apicoplast must occur, very few transporters associated with the apicoplast have been identified. The current study combines data from previous studies with new data from biotin proximity labeling to identify new apicoplast resident proteins including two putative monocarboxylate transporters termed MCT1 and MCT2. The authors conduct a thorough molecular phylogenetic analysis of the newly identified apicoplast proteins and they provide compelling evidence that MCT1 and MCT2 are necessary for normal growth and plaque formation in vitro along with maintenance of the apicoplast itself. They also provide indirect evidence for a possible need for these transporters in isoprenoid biosynthesis and fatty acid biosynthesis within the apicoplast. Finally, mouse infection experiments suggest that MCT1 and MCT2 are required for normal virulence, with MCT2 completely lacking at the administered dose. Overall, this study is generally of high quality, includes extensive quantitative data, and significantly advances the field by identifying several novel apicoplast proteins together with establishing a critical role for two putative transporters in the parasite. The study, however, could be further strengthened by addressing the following aspects:</p>
<p>Main comments:</p>
<p>1. The conclusion that condition depletion of AMT1 and/or AMT2 affects apicoplast synthesis of IPP is only supported by indirect measurements (effects on host GFP uptake or trafficking, possibly due to effects on IPP dependent proteins such as rabs, and mitochondrial membrane potential, possibly due to effects on IPP dependent ubiquinone). This conclusion would be more strongly supported by directly measuring levels of IPP. If their or technical limitations that prevent direct measurement of IPP then the author should note such limitations and acknowledge in the discussion that the conclusion is based on indirect evidence.</p>
<p>2. The conclusion that condition depletion of AMT1 and/or AMT2 affects apicoplast synthesis of fatty acids is also poorly supported by the data. The authors do not distinguish between the lower fatty acid levels being due to reduced synthesis of fatty acids, reduced salvage of host fatty acids, or both. Indeed, the authors provide evidence that parasite endocytosis of GFP is dependent on AMT1 and AMT2. Host GFP likely enters the parasite within a membrane bound vesicle derived from the PVM. The PVM is known to harbor host-derived lipids. Hence, it is possible that some of the decrease in fatty acid levels could be due to reduced lipid salvage from the host. Experiments should be conducted to measure the synthesis and salvage of fatty acids (e.g., by metabolic flux analysis), or the authors should acknowledge that both could be affected.</p>

<p>In this study Hui Dong et al. identified and characterized two transporters of the monocarboxylate family, which they called Apcimplexan monocarboxylate 1 and 2 (AMC1/2) that the authors suggest are involved in the trafficking of metabolites in the non-photosynthetic plastid (apicoplast) of Toxoplasma gondii (the parasitic agent of human toxoplasmosis) to maintain parasite survival. To do so they first identified novel apicoplast transporters by conducting proximity-dependent protein labeling (TurboID), using the sole known apicoplast transporter (TgAPT) as a bait. They chose two out of the three MFS transporters identified by their screen based and protein sequence similarity and confirmed apicoplast localisation. They generated inducible knock down parasite strains for both AMC1 and AMC2, and confirmed that both transporters are essential for parasite intracellular survival, replication, and for the proper activity of key apicoplast pathways requiring pyruvate as carbon sources (FASII and MEP/DOXP). Then they show that deletion of each protein induces a loss of the apicoplast, more marked for AMC2 and affects its morphology both at its four surrounding membranes level and accumulation of material in the apicoplast stroma. The authors attempted to decipher the function of the transporters on metabolic functions of the apicoplast: (a) notably for IPP synthesis through the assessment of vesicle import allowed by IPP-based anchors, which was found to be affected in the mutants, as well as (b) apicoplast fatty acid synthesis by indirect assessment of vesicle import. However, none of them directly concluded on the actual function of the transporters. Furthermore heterologous complementation in bacterial system also failed to demonstrate the transporters' function.</p>
<p>However, this study is very timely, as the apicoplast holds several important metabolic functions (FASII, IPP, LPA, Heme, Fe-S clusters...), which have been revealed and studied in depth but no further respective transporter have been identified thus far. hence, new studies that could reveal how the apicoplast can acquire and deliver all the key metabolites it deals with, will have strong impact for the parasitology community as well as for the plastid evolution communities. The current study is well initiated with appropriate approaches to identify two new putatively important apicoplast transporters, and showing how essential those are for parasite intracellular development and survival. However, in its current state, this is all the study provides at this point (i.e. essential apicoplast transporters disrupting apicoplast integrity, and indirectly its major functions, FASII and IPP, as any essential apicoplast protein disruption does). The study fails to deliver further message or function regarding AMC1 and 2, and thus validate their study. Currently the manuscript just describes how AMC1/2 deletion impacts parasite survival without answering the key question about them: what do they transport. The authors yet have to perform key experiments that would reveal their metabolic function. Ideally the authors would work further and determine the function of AMC1 and 2.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The apicoplast, a non-photosynthetic vestigial chloroplast, is a key metabolic organelle for the synthesis of certain lipids in apicomplexan parasites. Although it is clear metabolite exchange between the parasite cytosol and the apicoplast must occur, very few transporters associated with the apicoplast have been identified. The current study combines data from previous studies with new data from biotin proximity labeling to identify new apicoplast resident proteins including two putative monocarboxylate transporters termed MCT1 and MCT2. The authors conduct a thorough molecular phylogenetic analysis of the newly identified apicoplast proteins and they provide compelling evidence that MCT1 and MCT2 are necessary for normal growth and plaque formation in vitro along with maintenance of the apicoplast itself. They also provide indirect evidence for a possible need for these transporters in isoprenoid biosynthesis and fatty acid biosynthesis within the apicoplast. Finally, mouse infection experiments suggest that MCT1 and MCT2 are required for normal virulence, with MCT2 completely lacking at the administered dose. Overall, this study is generally of high quality, includes extensive quantitative data, and significantly advances the field by identifying several novel apicoplast proteins together with establishing a critical role for two putative transporters in the parasite. The study, however, could be further strengthened by addressing the following aspects:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank very much the reviewer for his/her positive evaluation of our work. To address the detailed function of the transporters, in the past three months, we have re-constructed plasmids (with codon-optimized DNA sequences of the genes) for expression of the transporters in a regular expression E. coli strain (BL21DE3) and in a pyruvate import knockout E. coli strain (a gift from Prof. Kirsten Jung), to examine the transport capability in vitro. And, we have also re-constructed a new plasmid containing a new leading peptide for targeting the pyruvate sensor PyronicSF to the apicoplast in the parasite, to probe the possible substrate pyruvate. However, we did not successfully observe expression of the transporters in the above E. coli strains, and we were unable to target the sensor to the correct localization (the apicoplast) in the parasite. As a result, all efforts have led the study to the current version of manuscript on the functional identification of transporters. We will keep working on this aspect, attempting to dissect out the exact transport function of the transporters in the future. In the current manuscript, we have discussed the limitations of our study in the last part of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Main comments</p>
<p>1. The conclusion that condition depletion of AMT1 and/or AMT2 affects apicoplast synthesis of IPP is only supported by indirect measurements (effects on host GFP uptake or trafficking, possibly due to effects on IPP dependent proteins such as rabs, and mitochondrial membrane potential, possibly due to effects on IPP dependent ubiquinone). This conclusion would be more strongly supported by directly measuring levels of IPP. If there are technical limitations that prevent direct measurement of IPP then the author should note such limitations and acknowledge in the discussion that the conclusion is based on indirect evidence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank the reviewer very much for the suggestions. We have tried to establish the measurement of IPP using a commercial company in recent months, yet we have not been successful in making the assay work. Considering the problem of indirect evidence, we have discussed this limitation in the discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The conclusion that condition depletion of AMT1 and/or AMT2 affects apicoplast synthesis of fatty acids is also poorly supported by the data. The authors do not distinguish between the lower fatty acid levels being due to reduced synthesis of fatty acids, reduced salvage of host fatty acids, or both. Indeed, the authors provide evidence that parasite endocytosis of GFP is dependent on AMT1 and AMT2. Host GFP likely enters the parasite within a membrane bound vesicle derived from the PVM. The PVM is known to harbor host-derived lipids. Hence, it is possible that some of the decrease in fatty acid levels could be due to reduced lipid salvage from the host. Experiments should be conducted to measure the synthesis and salvage of fatty acids (e.g., by metabolic flux analysis), or the authors should acknowledge that both could be affected.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank the reviewer very much for comments and suggestions. We partially agree with the comments that the depletion of transporters could affect lipids scavenged from the host cells, as endocytic vesicles are indeed derived from the parasite plasma membrane at the micropore and potentially from the host cell endo-membrane system, as demonstrated with the micropore endocytosis in our previous study (pmid: 36813769). Our latest study has addressed this by showing that the endocytic trafficking of GFP vesicles is regulated by prenylation of proteins (e.g. Rab1B and YKT6.1), depletion of which resulted in diffusion of GFP vesicles, but not disappearance of GFP vesicles in the parasites (pmid: 37548452), indicating that the vesicles (containing lipids) enter the parasites. In the current manuscript, the percentage of parasites containing GFP foci was significantly reduced in AMT1/AMT2-depleted parasites, and instead, parasites containing GFP diffusion appeared and the percentage was almost equal to the reduced level of parasites with GFP foci. These results suggested that endocytic vesicles (e.g. GFP vesicles) were continuously generated by the micropore in the parasites depleted with AMT1/AMT2, and that the vesicle trafficking was regulated by proteins modified by IPP derivatives that were derived from the apicoplast. Based on these observations, we considered that lipids in endocytic vesicles should not contribute to the reduced level of fatty acids and other lipids in parasites depleted with AMT1/AMT2. We have added in a short discussion concerning the fatty acids and lipids reduced in the parasites.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>In this study Hui Dong et al. identified and characterized two transporters of the monocarboxylate family, which they called Apcimplexan monocarboxylate 1 and 2 (AMC1/2) that the authors suggest are involved in the trafficking of metabolites in the non-photosynthetic plastid (apicoplast) of Toxoplasma gondii (the parasitic agent of human toxoplasmosis) to maintain parasite survival. To do so they first identified novel apicoplast transporters by conducting proximity-dependent protein labeling (TurboID), using the sole known apicoplast transporter (TgAPT) as a bait. They chose two out of the three MFS transporters identified by their screen based and protein sequence similarity and confirmed apicoplast localisation. They generated inducible knock down parasite strains for both AMC1 and AMC2, and confirmed that both transporters are essential for parasite intracellular survival, replication, and for the proper activity of key apicoplast pathways requiring pyruvate as carbon sources (FASII and MEP/DOXP). Then they show that deletion of each protein induces a loss of the apicoplast, more marked for AMC2 and affects its morphology both at its four surrounding membranes level and accumulation of material in the apicoplast stroma. This study is very timely, as the apicoplast holds several important metabolic functions (FASII, IPP, LPA, Heme, Fe-S clusters...), which have been revealed and studied in depth but no further respective transporter have been identified thus far. hence, new studies that could reveal how the apicoplast can acquire and deliver all the key metabolites it deals with, will have strong impact for the parasitology community as well as for the plastid evolution communities. The current study is well initiated with appropriate approaches to identify two new putatively important apicoplast transporters, and showing how essential those are for parasite intracellular development and survival. However, in its current state, this is all the study provides at this point (i.e. essential apicoplast transporters disrupting apicoplast integrity, and indirectly its major functions, FASII and IPP, as any essential apicoplast protein disruption does).

Currently, the manuscript just describes how AMC1/2 deletion impacts parasite survival without answering the key question about them: what do they transport? The authors yet have to perform key experiments that would reveal their metabolic function. I would thus recommend the authors work further and determine the function of AMC1 and 2.</p>

<p>Figure 1: more information on APT1 would be helpful for readers to interpret the results from turboID e.g., consider showing an illustration showing, according to Karnataki et al 2007 that APT1 likely occupies all 4 membranes of the apicoplast. Also, according to DeRocher et al 2012, APT1 N-term and C-term are both cytosolically exposed, at least in the outermost membrane. The orientation in the other membranes is not known.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank very much the reviewer for the suggestions. We analyzed the localization information of APT1 in T. gondii, based on the studies as the reviewer proposed (Karnataki, et al., 2007; DeRocher et al., 2012). The HA tag at the C-terminus of APT1 was distributed at the four membranes of the apicoplast, indicating that the topology of APT1 might be difficult to be defined at the membranes. Considering this information, we felt hesitant to clearly describe the topology in a schematic diagram about the protein APT1. Nevertheless, the TurboID tagging at the C-terminus of APT1 was an excellent model for identification of potential transporters localized at membranes of the apicoplast. We have put more information about the topology of APT1 in the manuscript, thus providing a better understanding of the proteomic results.</p>

<p>Lines 351-355: The authors refer to Figure 4D to support this statement, but presumably they mean 4E. Also, the authors use the terms C14, C16, and C18.

Finally, the authors should determine if there is a statistically significant difference between levels of these fatty acids between AMT1 KD and AMT2 KD. If not, they should suggest there is an overall trend toward lower levels of these fatty acids in AMT2 KD parasites compared to AMT1 KD parasites.</p>

<p>Major points:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The metabolomic data on fatty acid synthesis and isoprenoid levels is relevant but cannot inform about the function of the transporter, since any protein causing loss of the apicoplast would behave in such a manner, i.e. block the apicoplast pathways.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank very much the reviewer for the comment. We agree with this comment. We have thus discussed these points in a subsection in the Discussion, pointing out some of the limitations in the study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Currently, the manuscript fails to directly prove what AMC1 and AMC2 transports, potentially pyruvate as suggested to putatively fuel FASII and MEP/DOXP. Further experimental approaches using exogenous complementation and/or metabolomic analyses using stable isotope labelling (for example) should potentially bring light to the putative functions of AMC1/2.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank very much the reviewer for the comments. As described above, we attempted several approaches to find out the substrates that the AMT1 and AMT2 transports. However, we could not successfully express the proteins in E. coli strains, and we did not generate a T. gondii strain that a pyruvate sensor was properly targeted to the apicoplast. At the end of the Discussion, we have a subsection that discusses the limitations of this study. We hope that our future approaches will be able to tackle these difficulties on the substrate identification.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Furthermore, the authors have not considered other pathways of interest, like heme or lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)n synthesis, which are two other key pathway, which may be related to AMC1/2 function.
Those proposed experiments represent an important body of work, required to bring light to their metabolic functions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank very much the reviewer for the comments. We thought about that, but we finally decided to mainly discuss two of the pathways that the transporters might participate in, since the transporters contain specific domains on the proteins sequences that potentially are associated with pyruvate.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Further, the authors might have partially missed some referencing and data about the apicoplast in their introduction (and potentially to address other facets of the apicoplast metabolic functions/capacities in regards to AMC1/2 function): the introduction referencing and explanations are somehow not fully exact/precise for the part of the apicoplast and its pathway: references about the apicoplast, discovery and origin are not citing the original work (that should be Wilson et al. 1996, McFadden et al. 1996, Kohler et al. 1997,), same for the discovery of FASII and MEP./DOXP (Waller 1998, Jomaa et al...). The introduction (and the study?) lacks information about other key functions of the apicoplast: heme synthesis, lysophosphatidic acid synthesis (using FASII products). The explanations about the roles of FASII/DOXP are partial and not fully citing important references: Krishnan et al. 2020, and Amiar et al. 2020 are also key to understanding how the role of FASII is metabolically flexible depending on nutrient content. A whole part on the fact that FASII is not only dispensible but can also become essential under metabolic adaptations conditions, are missing (Botté et al. 2013, Amiar et al. 2020, Primo et al. 2021). These novel important facets of parasite biology should be mentioned as well as directly linked to the author's topic. This is more minor but could bring new ideas to the authors.</p>
