<title>Abstract</title><p>The circadian clock enables organisms to synchronize biochemical and physiological processes over a 24-hour period. Natural changes in lighting conditions, as well as artificial disruptions like jet lag or shift work, can advance or delay the clock phase to align physiology with the environment. Within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, circadian timekeeping and resetting rely on both membrane depolarization and intracellular second-messenger signaling. Voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) facilitate calcium influx in both processes, activating intracellular signaling pathways that trigger <italic>Period</italic> (<italic>Per</italic>) gene expression. However, the precise mechanism by which these processes are concertedly gated remains unknown.</p>
<p>Our study demonstrates that cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) activity is modulated by light and regulates phase shifts of the circadian clock. We observed that knocking down Cdk5 in the SCN of mice affects phase delays but not phase advances. This is linked to uncontrolled calcium influx into SCN neurons and an unregulated protein kinase A (PKA) – calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaMK) – cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) signaling pathway. Consequently, genes such as <italic>Per1</italic> are not induced by light in the SCN of Cdk5 knock-down mice. Our experiments identified Cdk5 as a crucial light-modulated kinase that influences rapid clock phase adaptation. This finding elucidates how light responsiveness and clock phase coordination adapt activity onset to seasonal changes, jet lag, and shift work.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The circadian system coordinates biochemical and physiological functions in our body, synchronizing them with the environmental day-night cycle. Misalignment of the internal body clock with the external light-dark cycle, caused by shift work or jet lag, leads to inefficient regulation of body functions. Consequently, circadian misalignment can result in obesity, cancer, addictive behaviors, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how the environment impacts the clock and how these entities interact.</p>
<p>In mammals, the master circadian clock is located in the ventral part of the hypothalamus, just above the optic chiasm, in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). These nuclei coordinate daily cycles of physiology and behavior <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Molecular daily oscillations are generated at the cellular level by a cell-autonomous transcription-translation feedback loop (TTFL) involving a set of clock genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> and post-translational modifiers such as kinases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Circuit-level interactions among SCN cells produce a coherent daily oscillation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, which can be modulated by light signals to match the environmental light-dark cycle. Light is perceived by melanopsin-containing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) in the eye, and the signal produced in these cells travels via the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT) to the SCN <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. The release of glutamate at the RHT terminals stimulates AMPA/NMDA receptors, leading to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into the SCN <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Additionally, the activity of various kinases is altered, including DARPP-32 (dopamine and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of 32 kD), PKA (protein kinase A), and CaMK (Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent kinases). This cascade culminates in the phosphorylation of CREB (cyclic AMP response element binding protein) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref> - <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. This event promotes chromatin phosphorylation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> and acetylation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> via the recruitment of CRTC1 (cAMP-regulated transcriptional co-activator 1) and the histone acetyltransferase CBP (CREB-binding protein), involving the clock protein PER2. Consequently, immediate-early gene and clock gene expression is induced <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, causing a phase shift of the TTFL in oscillating cells of the SCN <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. This manifests at the behavioral level as a change of locomotor activity onset (phase shift) the day after the light pulse. The direction of the phase shift depends on the clock’s temporal state. Light perceived in the early night promotes phase delays, while a light pulse late at night promotes phase advances. Light in the middle of the day does not alter the clock phase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. For this so-called resetting of the circadian clock, the <italic>Per1</italic> and <italic>Per2</italic> genes appear to be important in mice. While <italic>Per1</italic> is essential for phase advances, <italic>Per2</italic> function is necessary for phase delays <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) are classified into high voltage-activated channels, which include L-type, and low voltage-activated subtypes, also known as T-type channels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. T-type VGCCs are involved in phase delays, whereas L-type VGCCs are related to phase advances <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1, Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2, and Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 belong to the T-type channel family, which is critically important for neuronal excitability <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. The activity of these T-type channels is regulated by various kinases, including PKA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, PKC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, and Cdk5 (cyclin-dependent kinase 5) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Cdk5 is a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase that forms a complex with its neural activators p35 or p39 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> and cyclin I <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. The complex of Cdk5 and its activators controls various neuronal processes such as neurogenesis, neuronal migration, and synaptogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. <italic>In vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments show that Cdk5 kinase activity is low in the light phase and high in the dark phase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. It regulates the circadian clock in the SCN via phosphorylation of PER2 at serine 394. Upon phosphorylation by Cdk5, PER2 is stabilized and enters the nucleus to participate in the regulation of the TTFL and CREB-related transcriptional events <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Since Cdk5 regulates the T-type channel Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> and the circadian clock via PER2 phosphorylation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, we analyzed the potential role of Cdk5 in the light-mediated clock resetting mechanism.</p>

<title>Cdk5 knock-down in the SCN impairs light-induced phase delays</title>
<p>Light perceived during the dark period elicits changes in the clock phase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. To test whether <italic>Cdk5</italic> plays a role in this process, we knocked down <italic>Cdk5</italic> in the SCN via stereotaxic application of adeno-associated viruses (AAVs). We injected an adenovirus expressing shRNA to silence <italic>Cdk5</italic> (shCdk5) and, as a control, an adenovirus expressing a control shRNA (scr) into the SCN <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Consistent with our previous observations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, we found that silencing <italic>Cdk5</italic> in the SCN reduced its expression in the SCN (Supplementary Fig. 1a) and the expression of PER2 (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Under constant darkness (DD) conditions, this knock-down of <italic>Cdk5</italic> shortened the clock period in male mice, as assessed by wheel-running activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a, b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 1c). This period was not influenced by light pulses (Supplementary Fig. 1d). However, the onset of activity was affected after releasing mice into constant darkness (DD). Light at zeitgeber time (ZT) 14 (where ZT0 is lights on and ZT12 is lights off) delayed the clock phase, whereas light at ZT22 advanced it in control (scr) animals, with light at ZT10 having no effect (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a, c</xref>, Aschoff type II protocol). The animals with silenced <italic>Cdk5</italic> in the SCN (shCdk5) behaved similarly to controls (scr), except for ZT14. Light did not elicit a phase delay at this time, suggesting that <italic>Cdk5</italic> plays a role in the phase delay mechanism. Similar results were obtained for female animals (Supplementary Fig. 1e-g).</p>

</fig>
<p>To corroborate our observations, we performed the same experiment in DD (Aschoff type I protocol). The shCdk5 animals displayed a shorter period compared to scr controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d, e</xref>), consistent with previous observations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. After determining each animal’s clock period, we administered light pulses of 15 minutes at circadian times (CT) 10, CT14, and CT22 for each animal (orange stars, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Light at CT10 had no effect on both the shCdk5 and scr control mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). Light applied at CT14 promoted a phase delay in scr control mice.</p>
<p>However, silencing of <italic>Cdk5</italic> impaired the delay of the clock phase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d, f</xref>), which is consistent with the observation at ZT14 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a, c</xref>). Light at CT22 elicited normal phase advances in shCdk5 and scr controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d, f</xref>), similar to the light pulse applied at ZT22 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a, c</xref>). From these experiments, we conclude that <italic>Cdk5</italic> plays a role in delaying the clock phase in response to a light pulse in the early activity period of mice.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Cdk5 activity is modulated by light in the early night</title>
<p>Given that Cdk5 plays a significant role in the phase shift of the circadian clock, we investigated whether the light signal at ZT14 could affect the levels of Cdk5 and its co-activator p35 in the SCN. To this end, we collected SCN samples at ZT14 in the dark or after a 15-minute light pulse and performed a western blot on total protein extracts. To ensure proper light induction, we measured the light-dependent phosphorylation of PKA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, b</xref>), CaMKII and CREB (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b, c, d). We confirmed that PKA, CaMKII and CREB phosphorylation levels increased in response to light in the SCN (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 2a, b, c, d). Interestingly, we observed that light could also increase the p35 protein level, although the levels of Cdk5 remained unaffected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, c</xref>). Given the increase in p35 levels due to light, we wondered whether this event would affect the kinase activity of the Cdk5/p35 complex. We performed an <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay using immunoprecipitated Cdk5 from SCN tissue collected from mice either not exposed to light or exposed to light at ZT14. We used the recombinant histone H1 as a substrate in the presence of radioactive ATP <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Surprisingly, our results indicated that Cdk5 kinase activity decreased in response to light (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d, e</xref>), suggesting that light may affect the interaction between Cdk5 and p35. To test this hypothesis, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation experiment using an antibody against Cdk5. Our results revealed that SCN extracts from mice that received a light pulse at ZT14 contained less p35 in a complex with Cdk5 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>).</p>

<p>Taken together, the results support the hypothesis that light affects Cdk5 activity by interfering with the formation of the Cdk5/p35 complex.

<p>The CREB/CRE transcriptional pathway has been shown to be activated by calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Pharmacological inhibition of CaMKII but not of MAPK affected light-induced phase delays in hamsters <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Therefore, we tested whether phosphorylated CaMKII (p-CaMKII) is affected by the knock-down of <italic>Cdk5</italic> in the SCN of mice. We observed that p-CaMKII presence (alpha isoform) in the cytoplasm of SCN cells increased after light at ZT14 compared to no light in control animals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, left panels). In shCdk5 SCN, however, p-CaMKII was already present before the light pulse in significantly higher levels than controls (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, control Supplementary Fig. 3d). This result indicates that <italic>Cdk5</italic> is gating the phosphorylation of CaMKII alpha.</p>
<p>CaMKII has been shown to shuttle Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin (Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CAM) to the nucleus to trigger CREB phosphorylation and gene expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Therefore, we investigated whether CAM localization was influenced by a light pulse and whether <italic>Cdk5</italic> plays a role in this process. We observed that in control animals, CAM was distributed evenly in the cytoplasm of cells in SCN tissue before a light pulse. However, after the light pulse, it was localized around the nuclei (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). Interestingly, in the SCN of shCdk5 animals, CAM was already localized around the nuclei before the light administration and remained there after the light pulse, suggesting that <italic>Cdk5</italic> is gating CAM localization in the cell.</p>
<p>Once delivered to the nucleus, Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CAM triggers a highly cooperative activation of the nuclear CaMK cascade, including CaMKIV, to rapidly phosphorylate CREB for the transcription of target genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Therefore, we tested whether a light pulse affected the phosphorylation of CaMKIV and whether this was influenced by <italic>Cdk5</italic>. In control animals, we detected p-CaMKIV to be strongly present in the SCN after, but not before, a light pulse (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>, control Supplementary Fig. 3e). In shCdk5 SCN, p-CaMKIV was always detectable, independent of the light pulse (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). This indicated that Cdk5 was gating phosphorylation of CaMKIV.</p>
<p>Calcium entry is regulated by channels, such as T-type VGCC, which are involved in phase delays <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Previous reports show that Cdk5 directly or indirectly can phosphorylate Cav3.1 <italic>in vitro</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Thus, we looked at the influence of light and <italic>Cdk5</italic> on the T-type channel Cav3.1 using immunohistochemical staining. We observed that the level of Cav3.1 protein was significantly increased on the surface of SCN cells after the light pulse (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>, blue bars). This suggests that light inhibits internalization and degradation of this channel. Interestingly, in the <italic>Cdk5</italic>-depleted SCN cells, Cav3.1 staining was already high on the cell surface before the light signal (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>, red bars). We observed no difference in the Cav3.1 signal between SCN samples obtained from shCdk5 mice before and after the light pulse (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>, red bars), suggesting that <italic>Cdk5</italic> may be directly or indirectly involved in the regulation of Cav3.1 localization. This is consistent with previously described effects of Cdk5 on the cellular localization of other receptors such as the D2 and TRPV1 receptors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Cdk5 modulates neuronal activity in response to light at ZT14</title>
<p>Neuronal activity in response to light at ZT14 requires calcium influx. At night, neuronal cell membranes are hyperpolarized, creating a Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient. A light stimulus at night promotes membrane depolarization and VGCC activation, which evokes a Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into SCN neurons, ultimately changing the phase of the circadian clock <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Our results shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref> indicate that Cdk5 regulates the gating between light and the CaMKII pathway, which relies on Ca<sup>2+</sup> availability. Thus, we tested whether Cdk5 regulated the light-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into SCN neurons. To this end, we employed <italic>in vivo</italic> calcium imaging to assess changes in calcium levels in the SCN in freely moving mice after 15 minutes of a light pulse given at ZT14. First, we injected an adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing the shCdk5 sequence into the SCN to silence <italic>Cdk5</italic>. This AAV co-expresses the calcium indicator GCaMP7 under the neuron-specific synapsin 1 promoter. As a control, we injected an AAV carrying a non-specific shRNA (scrambled sequence) instead of shCdk5 (see Materials and Methods). Consistent with our previous results, the construct expressing shCdk5 in the SCN produced a shortened free-running period in mice (Supplementary Fig. 4a-c). Animals injected with AAV were implanted with a chronic optical fiber placed above the SCN to allow for longitudinal imaging of GCaMP7 signals using fiber photometry. After habituation, ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> (or the ratio of change in GCaMP7 fluorescence to the baseline fluorescence, see methods) was recorded before and after light pulse delivery at ZT14 in both groups of mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>).</p>

<p>Previous studies have described that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated CREB transcription of target genes requires PKA activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. However, it is not clear whether there is a parallel (synergistic) relationship between PKA and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways or whether they are sequentially dependent on each other (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>, cartoon model). To address this question, we performed the following FRET experiment. NIH 3T3 cells were stimulated with forskolin in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> with EGTA (Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>, red line), without EGTA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>, blue line) or completely depleted of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>, orange line). We observed that under normal conditions the FRET signal decreased, comparable to the signal seen in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">figure 5a</xref>, indicating higher Ser-133 KID phosphorylation compared to the baseline (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>, blue line). When we added EGTA (removing Ca<sup>2+</sup>), the FRET signal increased to the baseline level after forskolin treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>, red line). The cells depleted of Ca<sup>2+</sup> were also not responsive to the forskolin stimulus, as the FRET signal moved towards the baseline level within 30 minutes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>, orange line). Together, our results indicate that CREB phosphorylation is modulated by Cdk5 via Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, as suggested in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref>. Interestingly, PKA did not appear to directly phosphorylate CREB, as CREB did not pull-down p-PKA in an immunoprecipitation experiment. In contrast, p-CaMKIV did interact with CREB (Supplementary Fig. 5b, c), suggesting that CREB is most likely phosphorylated by CaMKIV, which is probably indirectly regulated by PKA activity.</p>
<p>Next, we aimed to investigate what the possible pathway could be through which PKA regulates CaMKIV. Previous studies have shown that Cdk5 regulates PKA activity via DARPP32 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). Therefore, we asked whether DARPP32 phosphorylation was light-dependent and whether Cdk5 would modulate this process. We sacrificed mice either receiving a light pulse at ZT14 or no light. Cryo-sections containing the SCN were stained with an antibody recognizing phosphorylated Thr-75 (pThr-75) of DARPP32. We observed that DARPP32 is highly phosphorylated at ZT14, with the light signal significantly reducing the phosphorylation levels in the cytoplasm and nuclei (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>, blue bars; Supplementary Fig. 5d, e). In contrast, silencing of <italic>Cdk5</italic> led to a dramatic decrease in the pThr-75 signal in the cytoplasm and nuclei of SCN cells at ZT14, and light did not have an effect (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>, red bars, Supplementary Fig. 5e). These observations are consistent with the view that Cdk5 phosphorylates DARPP32 and that light inhibits this process.</p>
<p>Non phosphorylated DARPP32 promotes PKA activity, characterized by phosphorylation at Thr-197 in the catalytic site of PKA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Therefore, we asked whether decreased levels of p-DARPP32 after the light stimulus at ZT14 could inversely correlate with the phosphorylation state of PKA. We performed immunostaining on coronal brain sections containing the SCN using an antibody recognizing the phosphorylated Thr-197 of PKA. We observed that PKA phosphorylation significantly increased after the light pulse in the SCN tissue obtained from control (scr) mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>, right panel, blue bars). However, in SCN from shCdk5 mice, the phosphorylation level was already elevated before the light pulse compared to scr control (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>, left panels, top micrographs), and it was also sustained after the light pulse (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>, left panels, bottom micrographs, right panel, red bars). Our results indicate that Cdk5 gates PKA phosphorylation induced by the light pulse at ZT14. Many observations indicate that active PKA can stimulate the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through Cav3 T-type voltage-gated channels, including Cav3.1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. The molecular mechanism normally requires physical interaction between the channel and PKA, followed by phosphorylation, which influences the gating properties <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Therefore, we performed a co-immunostaining in the same SCN sections collected before (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) to detect both Cav3.1 and phospho-PKA (the active form). We observed that the colocalization between Cav3.1 and phospho-PKA dramatically increased after the light pulse in the SCN tissue of control (scr) mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>, scr left panels yellow color, and blue bars in the right panel). Interestingly, the colocalization level of the two proteins was already high in the shCdk5 SCN tissue before the light pulse, compared to controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref> scramble vs. shCdk5, left panel, top micrographs). The colocalization level between Cav3.1 and phospho-PKA in the shCdk5 tissues was not influenced by the light pulse (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>, right panel, red bars). Altogether our results suggest that Cdk5 gates the PKA-Cav3.1 interaction in response to the light signal at ZT14 in an indirect way via DARPP32.</p>

<p>In agreement with previous studies, <italic>Per1</italic> and <italic>Dec1</italic> mRNA expression was induced by light, peaking at 1hour after the stimulus. Conversely, <italic>Per2</italic> and <italic>Dec2</italic> mRNA expression was not affected by the light pulse at ZT14 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a-d</xref>, blue bars) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. Knock-down of <italic>Cdk5</italic> abolished this light-driven <italic>Per1</italic> and <italic>Dec1</italic> gene induction (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a, c</xref>, red bars), indicating the involvement of <italic>Cdk5</italic> in the light-driven activation process of these clock genes. As previously reported, expression of the clock gene <italic>Bmal1</italic> was not light-inducible <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup> and was not affected by shCdk5 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e</xref>). The injection of the control scr and shCdk5 constructs was successful, as demonstrated by the expression of <italic>eGFP</italic> mRNA in the analyzed SCN (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6f</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, the knock-down of <italic>Cdk5</italic> did not affect light-mediated induction of <italic>cFos</italic> expression, which peaked at 0.5 hours after the light pulse (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6g</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Egr1</italic>, another immediate early gene involved in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>, was light-inducible in control but not in shCdk5 animals (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6h</xref>). This suggests that the immediate early gene <italic>cFos</italic> is regulated by a different mechanism compared to <italic>Egr1</italic> and the clock genes <italic>Per1</italic> and <italic>Dec1</italic> in response to a light stimulus at ZT14.</p>
<p>Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) has been described to play a role in phase-shifting the SCN clock <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the light-induced expression of clock genes is localized in VIP-positive cells in the SCN, which are essential for clock resetting <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. Therefore, we tested whether <italic>Vip</italic> gene expression is affected by shCdk5. We observed that a light pulse did not significantly induce <italic>Vip</italic> expression in the SCN, nor did shCdk5 affect its general expression (Supplementary Fig. 6a). This suggests that <italic>Cdk5</italic> does not regulate <italic>Vip</italic> expression and modulate phase shifts via VIP.</p>
<p>Salt inducible kinase 1 (<italic>Sik1</italic>) is involved in the regulation of the magnitude and duration of phase shifts by acting as a suppressor of the effects of light on the clock <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. Therefore, we tested how a light pulse affected <italic>Sik1</italic> expression in the SCN and whether <italic>Cdk5</italic> might play a role in its regulation. We observed that <italic>Sik1</italic> was significantly induced by a light pulse in the SCN of control mice after 0.5 hours. However, the knock-down of <italic>Cdk5</italic> abolished this induction (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6i</xref>). This suggests that <italic>Cdk5</italic> modulates <italic>Sik1</italic> expression to regulate the magnitude of the behavioral response to light.</p>
<p>The light-inducible small G-protein Gem limits the circadian clock phase-shift magnitude by inhibiting voltage-dependent calcium channels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. We tested whether a light pulse affected <italic>Gem</italic> expression in the SCN and whether this involved Cdk5. We observed that <italic>Gem</italic> was significantly induced by light 1 hour after light administration (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6j</xref>, blue bars). Interestingly, knock-down of <italic>Cdk5</italic> abolished this induction (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6i</xref>, red bars), but <italic>Gem</italic> levels seemed to be slightly elevated already before light administration (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6i</xref>, time point 0). This indicates that Cdk5 influences light induced <italic>Gem</italic> expression and may also affect basal <italic>Gem</italic> expression before the light pulse. Similar results for light induced gene expression in shCdk5 SCN were observed in SCN of <italic>Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup></italic> mutant mice (Supplementary Fig. 6b, c).</p>
<p>Phase shifts of the circadian clock can also be studied in cell cultures using forskolin instead of light as a stimulus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. In accordance with our <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), expression of <italic>Per1</italic> but not <italic>Per2</italic> mRNA was induced in synchronized NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells after forskolin treatment (Supplementary Fig. 6d, e, blue bars). Comparable to the experiments in the SCN, <italic>Per1</italic> induction was abolished in <italic>Cdk5</italic> knock-out cells (Supplementary Fig. 6d). In contrast<italic>, cFos</italic> mRNA induction was not affected in <italic>Cdk5</italic> knock-out cells (Supplementary Fig. 6f), consistent with our observations in the SCN (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6g</xref>).</p>
<p>Collectively, our expression data provide evidence that <italic>Cdk5</italic> regulates light- and forskolin-mediated expression of genes critical for the regulation of phase delays of the circadian clock. Immediate early genes, such as <italic>Egr1</italic>, are regulated in a similar manner, whereas others, such as <italic>cFos</italic>, are regulated by a different mechanism not involving <italic>Cdk5</italic>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we investigated the role of Cdk5 in rapid phase shifts of the circadian clock. We found that Cdk5 activity is regulated by light and that Cdk5 is necessary for phase delays but not phase advances. We identified Cdk5 to play a major role in the modulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and gating of the PKA-CaMK-CREB signaling pathway, coordinating it with the presence of PER2 in the nucleus of SCN cells.</p>
<p>In a previous study, we identified the protein kinase Cdk5 to regulate the phosphorylation and nuclear localization of the clock protein PER2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Because PER2 and protein kinases are involved in the photic signaling mechanism of clock phase adaptation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>, we tested the involvement of Cdk5 in this process. The phenotype of <italic>Cdk5</italic> knock-down (shCdk5) in the SCN of mice resembled the phenotypes observed in <italic>Per2</italic> mutant (<italic>Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup></italic>) and neuronal <italic>Per2</italic> knock-out (n<italic>Per2</italic> ko) mice. ShCdk5, as well as <italic>Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup></italic> and n<italic>Per2</italic> ko animals, showed strongly reduced phase delays in response to a short light pulse given at ZT14 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a, c</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> or CT14 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d, f</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. These mouse lines displayed a shortened period consistent with previous observations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b, e</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. Our results indicate that Cdk5 is not only involved in the regulation of the circadian clock mechanism via nuclear localization of PER2 but also plays an important role in the molecular mechanism that leads to a delay of clock phase in response to a light pulse in the early dark phase or early subjective night.</p>
<p>Since Cdk5 mediates the effects of light at the behavioral (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) level, we tested the influence of light on Cdk5 protein accumulation and kinase activity in the SCN at ZT14 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). We observed no change in the protein accumulation of Cdk5. On the other hand, Cdk5 kinase activity was reduced in the SCN after a light pulse at ZT14 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d, e</xref>), which was surprising in the context of increased p35 levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, c</xref>) and augmented PKA phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, b</xref>). However, this observation is in line with what we previously reported, where we demonstrated that Cdk5 kinase activity was low during the light phase and higher during the dark phase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. It appeared, however, that p35 was not interacting with Cdk5 after light at ZT14 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). Additional interactions of Cdk5 with unknown proteins may also be lost (Supplementary Fig. 2e). These observations suggest that Cdk5 was most likely modified in response to light leading to loss of interaction with p35 and other proteins. Ser159 of Cdk5 mediates the specificity of the Cdk5-p35 interaction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>, and therefore, phosphorylation of this site by an unknown kinase may mediate the loss of Cdk5 activity. Several additional phosphorylation sites in Cdk5 have been identified, of which phosphorylation of S47 renders Cdk5 inactive <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. Which one of the phosphorylation sites in Cdk5 is modulated by light and what additional interactors may be involved in this process remains to be established.</p>
<p>Light in the early portion of the dark phase elicits phase delays, which involve T-type calcium channels, PKA-signaling, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, ending in the phosphorylation of CREB (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>). We observed that in shCdk5 mice, CREB was already phosphorylated in the absence of light, although the total protein amount did not change (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 3a, b). Similarly, CaMKII and CaMKIV were shown to be phosphorylated and, therefore, activated only after the light pulse in control animals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b, d</xref>). Conversely, these kinases were highly phosphorylated in a light-independent manner in the SCN of shCdk5 animals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b, d</xref>), indicating that Cdk5 had a suppressive function on the phosphorylation of CaMKII and CaMKIV.</p>
<p>A stimulus can promote calmodulin (CAM) involving CaMKII gamma to translocate from calcium channels to the nucleus to promote CaMKIV phosphorylation and activation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Unexpectedly, we observed that a light stimulus can have a similar but distinct effect on CAM in SCN cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). CaMKII alpha was phosphorylated after a light pulse at ZT14, which led to perinuclear localization of CAM in control mice, while this localization pattern was already observed in shCdk5 animals independently of the light stimulus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). In control mice that received no light, CAM showed a diffuse expression pattern similar to the T-type calcium channel Cav3.1 at ZT14.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this light-driven localization pattern was echoed by the change in cellular distribution of the T-type calcium channel Cav3.1 known as internalization/externalization. Again, the presence of Cdk5 suppressed the localization of this channel to the cell membrane in the absence of light, with light allowing localization to the cell membrane (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). This observation is reminiscent of investigations described previously in which Cdk5 appeared to play an important role in channel translocation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup> as well as in receptor translocation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Thus, our findings are in accordance with the view that Cdk5 plays a crucial role in light stimulus driven cell dynamics.</p>
<p>Calcium plays an important role in circadian and phase-shifting biology <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Circadian calcium fluxes in the cytosol of SCN neurons have been demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>, and they change rapidly as a response to light perceived by the retina <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. We performed <italic>in vivo</italic> live imaging to detect Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in the SCN using fiber photometry with protein-based Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators such as GCaMP <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup>. With this approach, we observed that calcium fluxes in the SCN of control mice increased during and after a light pulse, but this change was significantly dampened in shCdk5 animals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b, c</xref>). Interestingly, although the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was generally reduced in the SCN of shCdk5 mice, we observed random Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity, which was independent of any light stimulus. These transients were observed also at the beginning of ZT14, before the light pulse (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b, c</xref>). These results may indicate the presence of a calcium leak reminiscent of the already active phosphorylation cascade observed in the shCdk5 SCN in the absence of light (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). We do not know, however, whether internal calcium stores involving ryanodine receptors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup> are altered by Cdk5 as well and how this would contribute to the observed phenotypes.</p>
<p>The PKA signaling pathway is involved in the resetting of the circadian phase (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>). Interference with PKA activation in the early subjective night led to reduced phase delay responses as observed <italic>in vitro</italic> in the SCN <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Here we find that Cdk5 plays an inhibitory role in PKA phosphorylation and activation. The FRET approach shows that in cells the lack of Cdk5 makes cells unresponsive to forskolin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>), an agent known to mitigate phase shifts in cells via PKA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Interestingly, PKA appears to influence phase shifts and CREB phosphorylation indirectly via a Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent mechanism (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>) with phosphorylated CaMKIV being the kinase that phosphorylates CREB (Supplementary Fig. 5b, c). This observation is in contrast with previous studies that suggested a direct phosphorylation of CREB by PKA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. However, p-PKA is mostly located in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>) while p-CaMKIV is in the nuclei (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). Furthermore, our experiments indicate that CREB did not interact with p-PKA but did with p-CaMKIV (suppl Fig. 5b, c), supporting the notion that PKA regulates CREB phosphorylation indirectly via CaMKIV in the SCN.</p>
<p>Because we observed that PKA was already phosphorylated in the dark when Cdk5 was silenced (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5e</xref>), we asked how Cdk5 could negatively regulate PKA phosphorylation. A previous study described that Cdk5 can phosphorylate DARPP32 to suppress PKA activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>. Furthermore, <italic>Darpp-32</italic> KO mice show attenuated phase delays <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> resembling shCdk5 mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). In accordance with these studies, we found an inverse correlation between p-DARPP32 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>) and p-PKA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>), implying that Cdk5 indirectly inhibits PKA activity via DARPP32. However, phosphatases such as PP2A and calcineurin, which de-phosphorylate DARPP32 including the Cdk5 phosphorylation site, may be involved in this process as well <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>. Upon light treatment and increase of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, these phosphatases would dephosphorylate DARPP32 and thereby inactivate it, leading to PKA activation. This process may occur in parallel to the Cdk5 regulation of DARPP32 contributing to a sustained activation of the light signaling pathway via PKA activation.</p>
<p>Our results imply that PKA action on CREB might be mediated via T-type calcium channels such as Cav 3.1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>). This assumption is reasonable because PKA can phosphorylate Cav 3.1 channels and increase electrical conductivity, which leads to a higher influx of Ca<sup>2+ 26</sup>. To that extent, our results indicate that a higher co-localization of p-PKA with Cav 3.1 is associated with an activation of the CaMK pathway and CREB phosphorylation.</p>
<p>Light-induced phosphorylation of CREB leads to induction of immediate early genes and clock genes (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>). Accordingly, we observed that the clock genes <italic>Per1</italic> and <italic>Dec1</italic> but not <italic>Per2</italic>, <italic>Dec2,</italic> and <italic>Bmal1</italic> were induced in the SCN by light at ZT14 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a-e</xref>, blue bars) consistent with previous findings <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. The light induction of <italic>Per1</italic> and <italic>Dec1</italic> was abolished in shCdk5 animals (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a, c</xref>, red bars) as well as in <italic>Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup></italic> mutant mice (Supplementary Fig. 6b, c), suggesting involvement of Cdk5 and Per2 in induction of these genes. In contrast, light induction of the immediate early gene <italic>cFos</italic> was neither affected in shCdk5 nor <italic>Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup></italic> SCN (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6g</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 6f), resembling the normal <italic>cFos</italic> induction in <italic>Per2</italic> KO animals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. This indicates that the light signaling mechanism for <italic>cFos</italic> induction is different from the one mediating induction of <italic>Per1</italic> and <italic>Dec1</italic>. Interestingly, however, the light-inducible genes <italic>Sik1</italic> and <italic>Gem,</italic> which are involved in limiting the effects of light on the clock <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup> were not light-inducible in shCdk5 animals (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6i, j</xref>) supporting the view that the factors that drive (<italic>Per1, Dec1</italic>) or limit (<italic>Sik1, Gem</italic>) the effects of light on the clock are regulated by the same mechanism. Interestingly, neither lack of <italic>Per1</italic>, <italic>Dec1</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup> nor <italic>Sik1</italic> or <italic>Gem</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup> alone abolish phase delays. Of note is that lack of <italic>cFos</italic> or <italic>Egr1</italic> did not affect phase delays either <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), which is important in circadian light responses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>, was not inducible by a light pulse at ZT14 in control as well as shCdk5 animals (Supplementary Fig. 6a), indicating that Cdk5 acts upstream of VIP signaling. Overall, the present data suggest that Cdk5 not only regulates the light-sensitive PKA - CaMK-CREB signaling pathway but ultimately also affects gene expression. For the transcriptional activation of those genes, nuclear PER2 protein is necessary, which is regulated by Cdk5 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. The combination of lack of induction of many genes in the Cdk5-regulated pathway is responsible for the manifestation of rapid behavioral phase delays.</p>
<p>Based on this and our previous studies, we propose the following molecular model for light-mediated phase delays (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). The model is divided into two parts. One part describes the state before the light pulse, and the second part the mechanism after the light pulse. The state before the light pulse (ZT12-14) is depicted in the gray area in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>. As reported previously, Cdk5 is active right after dark onset <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, depicted as the active Cdk5/p35 complex (blue). This has two consequences: 1) PER2 (red) is phosphorylated and translocates to the nucleus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, and 2) DARPP32 is phosphorylated and thus inhibiting PKA activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>. Hence, before the light pulse at ZT14, the nucleus is supplied with PER2, which appears to be necessary for light-mediated behavioral phase delays <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. In parallel, the signaling pathway necessary to phosphorylate CREB is turned off. This state can then be dramatically changed when light is applied at ZT14 evoking glutamate and PACAP release at the synapses between the RHT and the SCN. Interaction between p35 and Cdk5 is abolished (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) thereby inactivating Cdk5 and stopping phosphorylation of PER2 and DARPP32. Since significant amounts of PER2 are already in the nucleus this probably has no consequences on nuclear PER2 function. However, DARPP32 is not phosphorylated anymore and the block on PKA is released. At the same time, PKA becomes phosphorylated due to PACAP and cAMP signaling, leading to activation of Cav3.1 by PKA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. This results in CaMKII and CaMKIV phosphorylation and, ultimately, to the phosphorylation of CREB in the nucleus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Phospho-CREB builds up a complex with CRTC1/CBP and PER2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> to activate gene expression of the <italic>Per1, Dec1, Sik1,</italic> and <italic>Gem</italic> genes. In the activation complex the amount of PER2 present in the nucleus may at least in part affect the magnitude of the phase delay, which is depending on the time the light pulse is given. In conclusion, Cdk5 activity is gating both processes, the pre-light condition as well as the post-light condition, leading to a concerted activation of a set of light-responsive genes that impinge on behavioral phase delays in response to nocturnal light exposure.</p>

<caption><title>Model of Cdk5 gated light signal.</title>
<p>(<bold>a</bold>) Cdk5 is active during the dark portion of the day. Active Cdk5 with its co-activator p35 phosphorylates PER2, which leads to stabilization and nuclear translocation of this protein that is abundant at ZT12. At the same time CDK5 phosphorylates DARPP32, which inhibits the PKA signaling pathway. (<bold>b</bold>) Light perceived in the dark phase at ZT14 leads to detachment of p35 from Cdk5 stopping Cdk5 activity. DARPP32 is not phosphorylated and hence can’t inhibit PKA. PKA that is activated by the light signal is phosphorylated and can mediate CREB phosphorylation via T-type calcium channels (Cav3.1) and the CaMK pathway leading to a transcriptionally active complex on the CRE element present in the promoters of many light responsive genes such as <italic>Per1</italic>, <italic>Dec1</italic>, <italic>Gem</italic> and <italic>Sik1</italic>. Overall, a light pulse at ZT14 will activate CREB phosphorylation and a protein complex will form. This complex needs phosphorylated PER2 that has accumulated in the nucleus between ZT12 and ZT14 to initiate the transcription of light-responsive genes. Both arms are necessary to build up a transcriptionally functional complex. Both arms depend on the presence and activity of CDK5, which therefore gates the light signal at ZT14. It is very likely that the amount of PER2 protein in the nucleus determines at least in part the magnitude of the phase delay, which depends on the timing of the light signal.</p></caption>

<title>Animals and housing</title>
<p>All mice were housed with chow food (3432PX, Kliba-Nafag) and water ad libitum in transparent plastic cages (267 mm long, ×207 mm wide, ×140 mm high; Techniplast Makrolon type 2 1264C001) with a stainless-steel wire lid (Techniplast 1264C116), kept in soundproof ventilated chambers at constant temperature (22 ± 2 °C) and humidity (40 – 50%). All mice were entrained to a 12-h light–dark cycle (LD cycle), and the time of day was expressed as Zeitgeber time (ZT; ZT0 lights on, ZT12 lights off). Four-month-old 129/C57BL6 mixed males were used for the experiments. Housing and experimental procedures were performed per the guidelines of the Schweizer Tierschutzgesetz and the declaration of Helsinki.

<title>Locomotor activity monitoring</title>
<p>Locomotor activity parameters were analyzed by monitoring wheel-running activity, as described in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup>, and calculated using the ClockLab software (Actimetrics). To analyze free-running rhythms, animals were entrained to LD 12:12 and released into constant darkness (DD). The internal period length was determined from a regression line drawn through the activity onsets of ten days of stable rhythmicity under constant conditions, calculated using the respective inbuilt functions of the ClockLab software (Acquisition Version 3.208, Analysis Version 6.0.36). For better visualization of daily rhythms, locomotor activity records were double-plotted, which means that each day’s activity is plotted twice, to the right and below that of the previous day. For the analysis of light-induced resetting, we used Aschoff type II and I protocols <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>. For type II, mice maintained in LD 12:12 were subjected to a 15 min. light pulse (LP, 500 lux) at ZT10 (no phase shift), 14 (phase delay), and 22 (phase advance). Subsequently, they were released into DD for ten days, and phase shift was measured. For type I, mice maintained in DD were subjected to a 15 min. light pulse at Circadian Time (CT) 10, 14, or 22. A circadian hour equals 1/24 of the endogenous period (τ), calculated as follows: circadian hour = tau/24 hours. To convert ZT hours to CT hours, we performed the following calculations:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>CT12 Day B - CT12 Day A + τ - 24 hrs</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>CTX0-12 = CT12Day B – X* 1 circadian hour [X= CT12-CTx]</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>CTX12-24 = CT12Day B + X * 1 circadian hour [X= CTx- CT12]</p></list-item>
</list>
The phase shift was determined by fitting a regression line through the activity onsets of at least 7 days under LD conditions before the light pulse and a second line through the activity onsets of at least 7 days under DD after the light pulse. The first two days after the administration of the light pulse were not considered for the calculation of the phase shift. The distance between the two regression lines determined the phase shift. Before starting any new protocol, mice were allowed to stabilize their circadian oscillator for 10 days. The corresponding figure legends indicate the number of animals used in the behavioral studies.</p>

Due to GCaMP7b variable photobleaching (i.e., the loss of fluorescence intensity as a function of light exposure), we filtered the demodulated signal using a 3 order Savitzky-Golay filter (every 100 s), and detrended it using a hug-line. We then calculated the ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> as follows:

<graphic xlink:href="579499v2_ueqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
Finally, the ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> was cut to the light pulse as follows: a) 5 minutes before the light pulse, b) 15 minutes during the light pulse and c) 15 minutes after the light. To exclude differences in the duration of the light pulse (± 20 seconds), the period analyzed was of 14 minutes. All data processing was performed using custom-written Matlab scripts.</p>

<title>Live FRET imaging</title>
<p>The protocol was performed as before <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. The following plasmid was used for the project: ICAP-NLS Vector carrying <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Transfected NIH3T3 cells were starved for 4 h with 0.5% FBS DMEM. Subsequently, cells were washed twice with 1×HBTS without CaCl2 and MgCl2 (25 mM HEPES, 119 mM NaCl, 6gr/L Glucose, 5 mM KCl) and resuspended in the same buffer. NIH3T3 cells were imaged using an inverted epifluorescence microscope (Leica DMI6000B) with an HCX PL Fluotar 5x/0.15 CORR dry objective, a Leica DFC360FX CCD camera (1.4 M pixels, 20 fps), and EL6000 Light Source, and equipped with fast filter wheels for FRET imaging. Excitation filters for CFP and FRET: 427 nm (BP 427/10). Emission filters for CFP: 472 (BP 472/30) and FRET: 542 nm (BP 542/27). Dichroic mirror: RCY 440/520. One frame every 20 sec was acquired for at least 90 cycles (0.05 Hz frequency), and the recording lasted at least 30 min. The baseline response in the presence of HBTS was recorded for 2 min and 40s. At minute 3:00, 100 µM Forskolin, 2 mM CaCl2, and 2 mM MgCl2 were added to the cells. The time-lapse recordings were analyzed using LAS X software (Leica). Two regions of interest (ROI) were randomly selected for each cell, and 50 cells per plate were chosen randomly. A first ROI delimiting the background and a second ROI including the cell nucleus of NIH3T3 cell expressing NLS KIDKIX were used per cell. The ROI background values were subtracted from the ROI cell values for each channel. For baseline normalization, the FRET ratio R was expressed as a ΔR/R, where ΔR is R–R0, and R0 is the average of R over the last 120 s prior stimulus.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis of all experiments was performed using GraphPad Prism6 software. Depending on the data type, either an unpaired t-test or one- or two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni or Tukey’s post-hoc test was performed. Values considered significantly different are highlighted. [p&lt;0.05 (*), p&lt;0.01 (**), or p&lt;0.001 (***)].</p>
<p>Data were compared via two-way repeated-measures ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni’s corrections for multiple comparisons. Data distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally tested. All data are displayed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). No power calculations were performed to determine sample sizes, but similarly sized cohorts were used in previous studies. The experimenters were not blind to the conditions when acquiring or analyzing the data.</p>
<p>Sample numbers are indicated in the corresponding figure legends, and test details are only reported for significant results. Figures were prepared in Adobe Illustrator 2022.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> chronobiological study in mice suggests that light modulated activity of Cdk5 activity on the PKA-CaMK-CREB signaling pathway provides missing molecular mechanistic details to understand light-induced circadian clock phase delays during the early night, but not for phase advances in the morning.

<p>In the manuscript Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) activity is modulated by light and gates rapid phase shifts of the circadian clock Brenna et al., study the role of Cdk5 on circadian rhythms, the authors aim to elucidate the role of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5 (Cdk5) in modulating circadian rhythms, particularly in response to light cues. They hypothesized that Cdk5 acts as a gatekeeper, regulating the sensitivity of the circadian clock to light-induced phase shifts.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>• Novelty: The study presents a novel mechanism by which Cdk5 influences circadian rhythms, particularly its role in modulating the light-induced phase-shifting response.</p>
<p>
• Experiments: The authors have employed a combination of molecular, cellular, and behavioural techniques, including genetic manipulations, biochemical assays, and electrophysiology, to investigate the role of Cdk5. The set of experiments performed in this work is non-trivial, done to a high standard and the additional experiments, data and textual alterations presented following the 1st round of review needs to be lauded.</p>
<p>
• Data: The data is well-presented in clear figures and appropriately described in the text.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>• Although I found the data on Cdk5 gating light responses highly convincing there could be additional mechanisms which the authors have duly acknowledged and discussed in their text.</p>
<p>
In my assessment, the authors have convincingly demonstrated that Cdk5 plays a critical role in gating the light-induced phase-shifting response of the circadian clock. Their results strongly support their conclusions, as evidenced by their findings:</p>
<p>
This study provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying circadian rhythm regulation and the impact of light on the circadian clock. The findings have the potential to influence future research in the field of chronobiology and may have implications for understanding and treating circadian rhythm disorders.</p>
<p>
The methods and data presented in this study are valuable to the field and can be used to further investigate the role of Cdk5 and other signalling pathways in circadian rhythm regulation.</p>
<p>
Broader context</p>
<p>
The circadian clock is a fundamental biological process that regulates various physiological functions, including sleep-wake cycles, hormone secretion, and metabolism. Disruptions to the circadian clock have been linked to a variety of health problems, such as sleep disorders, metabolic disorders, and cancer. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie circadian rhythm regulation is essential for developing effective treatments for these disorders.</p>
<p>All in all, I have no reservations regarding the manuscript titled &quot;Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) activity is modulated by light and gates rapid phase shifts of the circadian clock by Brenna et al. After consideration of the authors' revisions, I believe the manuscript has been significantly improved. I commend the authors for their diligence in addressing the reviewers' comments and for the quality of their research.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<p><bold>Reply to reviewer comments:</bold></p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) Given the interpretations of this study hinge on the specificity of the antibodies used in immune fluorescence, the authors should provide full western-blot images of all their antibodies in supplementary information.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The commercial antibodies have been validated by the provider.</p>
<p>Additionally, we did our own tests. Of note is that proper validation of any antibody is only possible by using a knockout mouse for each protein analyzed (i.e. for pPKA wt vs. <italic>pka</italic> ko mice). This is not possible, because we do not have all these knock-out strains. However, specific proteins like pPKA, pCAMKII, and pCAMKIV are known to be increased by a light pulse. We show by western blot that pPKA (Fig. 2a, b) and pCamKII (Fig. S2a, b) are increased in wt animals mirroring what we observed in the immunofluorescence. These results suggest that the signal is specific to these antibodies. We provide a full panel of western blots, including the other proteins studied by immunofluorescence such as pCamKIV, pCREB, CaV 3.1, and pDARP32 and show that they detect a protein of the expected size. Full Western-blots mentioned in the manuscript are shown in Supplementary Figure 7. Below are additional validations of antibodies used in the immunofluorescence experiments.</p>

<p>(2) The explanation in the results section surrounding Fig. 4 seems to be specific for the representative trace rather than the group. Specifically, does the following statement apply to all the replicates?  &quot; A Ca2+ transient was observed right before the light was given at ZT14 (Fig. 4b), which showed the same magnitude as those observed during and after the light stimulus&quot;.</p>
<p>If not this should be corrected.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have replaced now Fig. 4b with an average trace of all experiments. The individual traces can be seen in supplementary figure 4d.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Are lines 236 -244 and figure 5A/B demonstrating shCDK5 being similar to no-calcium or EGTA conditions at the level of CREB not contradicting Figure 3 which argues that the reason behind the increase in CAMK-phosphorylation and pCREB following shCDK5 is increased basal calcium? If this is the case then why does removing the external calcium phenocopy shCDK5 in these cells? The authors need to clarify this and give an explanation.</p>
<p>(4) The authors should explain why they see an equivalent level (or more) of CREB activation, 5 minutes following forskolin activation in Ca2+-free condition (apparent in the case of shCDK5 and EGTA) in the FRET assay. Does this not imply PKA is the most likely candidate mediating this reaction at this stage? Given this interaction has been demonstrated in multiple (other) experiments including in vitro isolated enzyme experiments involving CREB and PKA (E.G. fig 6A in PMID: 2900470) an absence of p-PKA pulldown is not sufficient to justify the non-involvement of PKA (PMID: 22583753). This statement needs support in the form of positive data or acknowledging the limitations in the text (conditions, single technique, etc).</p>
<p>(5) The authors should better explain the fret pairs used in the experiments involving ICAP for the reader's benefit - a reduction in fluorescence as a function of CREB activation is non-intuitive.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We answer all three questions (3-5) together since they belong to the same concept.</p>
<p>(1) How FRET works.</p>
<p>The Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) technique is widely used to investigate molecular interactions between proteins such as CREB: CBP in living cells. We used a sensor called ICAP (an Indicator of CREB Activation due to Phosphorylation) published by Friedrich and colleagues in 2010</p>
<p>(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M110.124545">https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M110.124545</ext-link>). The sensor is composed of three different elements: 1) the KID domain of CREB containing the Ser-133, which is phosphorylated upon forskolin induction in our experimental setup, 2) the KIX domain of CBP, which is responsible for the dimerization with phospho-CREB and 3) a short linker that separates the KID with the KIX domain. KID is flanked by a cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), while KIX is flanked by a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). When KID is not phosphorylated, the ICAP conformation allows CFP - stimulated by blue UV light - to transfer energy to YFP, producing FRET resulting in yellow light emission. Therefore, the ratiometric analysis FRET/CFP shows FRET &gt; CFP. After a stimulus (forskolin), the serine-133 in KID is phosphorylated and KID can bind to KIX. The dimerization separates CFP from YFP, resulting in decreased FRET and increased CFP-dependent blue light emission (see Author response image 3 below). Therefore, the ratiometric analysis FRET/CFP shows FRET&lt;CFP over time (usually within 20’ after the forskolin stimulus).</p>

<p>(2) The ‘apparent’ contradiction between Figure 5A and Fig 3.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, the chosen FRET method is ratiometric, meaning that a relative FRET signal in fluorescence is measured compared to the baseline (absence of forskolin, assay buffer). The FRET experiment can only tell whether there is a change in the phosphorylation state of KID during the live imaging comparing the baseline to the period after the forskolin treatment. The result produces a delta [ (time after forskolin)(baseline)]. The higher the delta, the more KID is phosphorylated after forskolin treatment. If KID phosphorylation is not increased compared to the baseline, the FRET signal tends to return to the baseline with a reduced delta [ (time after forskolin)-(baseline)]. Therefore, the experiment does not tell at the quantitative level the amount of KID (CREB domain) phosphorylation before the stimulus. It only tells whether after the stimulus the phosphorylation is increased producing or not a delta. This means that the lack of delta can be caused by: A) high KID phosphorylation in the baseline which does not further increase after the forskolin stimulus; B) very low KID phosphorylation in the baseline which does not increase after the forskolin stimulus. In Fig. 5A, wt cells (orange trace, lines, and double arrow) show a higher delta compared to the ko cells (blue trace, lines, and double arrow). The result indicated that the phosphorylation of CREB (KID domain) is increased after the forskolin stimulus only in the wt. To that extent, the results are in line with the experiment that we show in Figure 3. Indeed, the increased delta in CREB phosphorylation is observed only in the scramble animals, where it is lost in the ko (the blue double arrow indicates the delta in the scramble).</p>

<p>(3) The FRET signal within 3 minutes after forskolin stimulation</p>
<p>The signal mentioned by the reviewers at 5’ is an artifact given by the light diffraction promoted by the addition of Forskolin in DMSO which propagates through the plate. The same effect is observed in the only DMSO treatment (Fig.S5). Therefore, it needs not to be taken into account. The amplitude of this signal in this window of time is due to many independent variables (buffer composition, cell shape, room temperature, pipetting), therefore it is not possible to speculate any consideration about it. We never consider this time window for describing our results.</p>

<p>(4) Role of PKA and considerations about experiments performed in Fig. 5a and b</p>
<p>To answer the question about the role of PKA, we believe it is a pivotal player. Our results indicate that PKA might promote CaV3.1, the entrance of calcium, and therefore, CAM Kinase pathway activation leading to CREB phosphorylation (Fig. 5). However, if the calcium is depleted, even a channel activation mediated by PKA cannot propagate the signal. For that reason, when we deplete calcium in wt cells as we do in the experiment performed in Figure 5B the activation of PKA alone cannot promote the CREB phosphorylation associated with a reduction of the FRET signal. As mentioned before, the FRET method gives a binary answer. It means either a higher or lower delta comparing time after forskolin to baseline. It cannot give stoichiometric info about the level of calcium and/or phosphorylation in the baseline. To that extent, the FRET experiment in Figure 5A cannot be connected to the experiment in Figure 5B. The method is the same, but the scientific questions are different. In Figure 5A we demonstrate that CDK5 plays a role in the PKA activation pathway. In Figure 5B we demonstrate that the general pathway needs calcium.</p>
<p>We modified the text accordingly.</p>

<p>(6) The presentation of the data in Figure 6 seems to be divergent from the rest of the data presentations. Please make it more consistent and also provide more explanations. Specifically, the authors suggest increased P-CREB nuclear localization (and an increase in phosphorylated PKA/CAMK) following shCDK5. Won't this lead to an increase in Per1, Dec1, cFos, and Sik1 basally (pre-light pulse)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We followed the reviewer's suggestion and present data in Figure 6 as done before in the manuscript. The reviewers should also consider our papers published before (Brenna et al., 2019; Brenna et al., 2021). In these papers, we demonstrate two important concepts that are in line with this manuscript. First, the lack of CDK5 promotes PER2 degradation and lack of nuclear translocation (Brenna et al., 2019). Second, PER2 plays a scaffold role in promoting the formation of the CREB transcriptional complex involved in the regulation of the expression of light-dependent genes (Brenna et al., 2021). Therefore, the take-home message here is that even if a lack of Cdk5 promotes a higher basal level of CREB phosphorylation, it also promotes PER2 degradation. Therefore, without PER2, the CREB-dependent gene expression is reduced. For this reason, we say that CDK5 gates phase shift (via PKA-CAM Kinases-CREB axis) of the circadian clock (via PER2).</p>

<p>(7) The authors should discuss why calcium-sensitive phosphatases such as PP2A (PMID: 23752926) or calcineurin (PMID: 10217279) are not considered candidates for dephosphorylation of DARPP32 as these are described previously (CDK5) and conditions of increased calcium as seen here would favour these enzymes. The phospho-T75 data are supportive, but such additional discussion could be important given the past demonstrations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewers for the great insight. The pathway that promotes the T75 phosphorylation/dephosphorylation indeed includes many players as calcineurin and PPA2A. We mention this in the discussion now as follows:</p>
<p>However, phosphatases such as PP2A and calcineurin, which de-phosphorylate DARPP32 including the Cdk5 phosphorylation site, may be involved in this process as well (Girault and Nairn, 2021). Upon light treatment and increase of Ca2+ these phosphatases would dephosphorylate DARPP32 and thereby inactivate it, leading to PKA activation. This process may occur in parallel to the Cdk5 regulation of DARPP32 contributing to a sustained activation of the light signaling pathway via PKA activation.</p>

<p>(8) additional details on the knock-downs would be helpful:</p>
<p>- the relative amount of reduction in gene expression upon shRNA treatment should be provided  - How was the exact viral delivery and reduction in shRNA-induced knock-down confirmed for the individual animals?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The validation of Cdk5 knockdown was widely performed in the previous paper (Brenna et al., 2019, Fig2-Fig supp1, and Fig3-Fig suppl2). We used the same mice. We confirmed the goodness of the silencing also in the supp figure 1A of the current paper.</p>

<p>(9) The authors only focus on male mice. This is rather incomplete, as it leaves away an important half of biological reality. Testing relevant aspects of the work in female mice would close this significant gap and also increase the number of biological replicates, which can still be considered relatively low.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion. We injected female mice and performed the Ashoff type-II light pulse experiment at ZT14 and observe the same phenotype as for male mice. This is stated now in the paper and the data are shown in supplemental figure 1 e-f.</p>

<p>(10) Given the roles of CdK5 in circadian clock period length regulation, but also light-induced phase delays, it would be interesting for a broader audience to discuss possible expectations of CdK5's roles, e.g.</p>
<p>(a) How will other circadian parameters, eg. activity bouts (numbers, length, activity onset/ offset) be affected?</p>
<p>(b) How does that relate to sleep, sleep phases?</p>
<p>(c) What is the expected impact on other physiological rhythms, eg food intake, cortisol levels?</p>
<p>(d) What are the expected effects on circadian oscillation of gene expression in other brain regions, organs?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewers for the observations.</p>
<p>a) The activity was discussed in the previous paper (Brenna et al. 2019). ShCdk5 mice show a reduced activity in both DD and LD 12:12 compared to wt, mirroring the Per2 brdm phenotype (Figure- Suppl3, with the difference mostly observed at night time (Figure 2-suppl4).</p>
<p>We also demonstrate in Suppl Fig1 b, c of the current paper that light pulse does not affect the period length either in scramble mice or in sh Cdk5.</p>
<p>b) We performed preliminary experiments with SCN shCdk5 knock-down animals and compared them to scr control mice using the Piezo sleep system. Total sleep was not different, however during the dark phase shCdk5 animals tended to sleep a bit more, similar to the neuronal Per2 KO animals (Wendrich et al., 2023 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3390/clockssleep5020017">https://doi.org/10.3390/clockssleep5020017</ext-link> ). After sleep-deprivation no differences were observed between shCdk5 and scr animals. This was comparable to the neuronal Per2 KO animals that also showed no phenotype after sleep deprivation.</p>
<p>c) and d) We did not investigate food intake, cortisol, or other parameters involving peripheral clocks. We did not investigate the gene expression in other brain regions because the SCN is the main brain region involved in the regulation of the circadian clock phase shift. However future studies will address these questions.</p>
