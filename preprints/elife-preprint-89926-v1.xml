<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>In a developing nervous system, axonal arbors often undergo complex rearrangements before neural circuits attain their final innervation topology. In the lateral line sensory system of the zebrafish, developing sensory axons reorganize their terminal arborization patterns to establish precise neural microcircuits around the mechanosensory hair cells. However, a quantitative understanding of the changes in the sensory arbor morphology and the regulators behind the microcircuit assembly remain enigmatic. Here, we report that Semaphorin7A (Sema7A) acts as an important mediator of these processes. Utilizing a semi-automated three-dimensional neurite tracing methodology and computational techniques, we have identified and quantitatively analyzed distinct topological features that shape the network in wild-type and Sema7A loss-of-function mutants. In contrast to those of wild-type animals, the sensory axons in Sema7A mutants display aberrant arborizations with disorganized network topology and diminished contacts to hair cells. Moreover, ectopic expression of a secreted form of Sema7A by non-hair cells induces chemotropic guidance of sensory axons. Our findings demonstrate that Sema7A functions both as a juxtracrine and as a secreted cue to pattern neural circuitry during sensory organ development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pathfinding axons are directed to their appropriate synaptic targets by a variety of guidance cues. While approaching or traversing the target field, the growth cones of migrating axons encounter secreted or cell surface-attached ligands and respond by steering toward or away from their sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Fine-grained control of these factors is critical for the establishment of proper neural circuitry.</p>
<p>The zebrafish’s lateral line provides a tractable <italic>in vivo</italic> system for exploring the mechanisms that guide the assembly of neural circuits in a peripheral nervous system. In particular, it is possible to detect individual hair cells and the sensory axons that innervate them throughout the first week of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). The primary posterior lateral line on each side of the zebrafish’s tail consists of about seven neuromasts, which contain mechanoreceptive hair cells of opposing polarities—half sensitive to headward (rostrad) water motion and the complementary half to tailward (caudad) water motion—that cluster at their centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). The sensory axons of the lateral-line nerve branch, arborize, and consolidate around the basolateral surfaces of the hair cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). To aid in an animal’s swimming behavior, these hair cells sense water currents and relay signals to the brain through the sensory axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). The well-defined structure of the ramifications and synaptic contacts of the sensory axons highlight the need to determine the molecular signals behind the assembly of such precise microcircuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). We adopted a candidate-gene strategy to seek factors that direct the growth of afferent growth cones in the zebrafish’s lateral line. Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data identified the <italic>semaphorin7a</italic> (<italic>sema7a</italic>) gene to be highly expressed in hair cells of that organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Semaphorins are important regulators of axonal growth and target finding during the patterning of diverse neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). The semaphorin family includes proteins that are secreted, transmembrane, and cell surface-attached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Among these, Semaphorin7A (Sema7A) is the only molecule that is anchored to the outer leaflet of the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Unlike many other semaphorins, which act as repulsive cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), Sema7A is involved in promoting axon growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) and imparting directional signals by interacting with the integrin and plexin families of receptors residing on the pathfinding axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Sema7A likely occurs <italic>in vivo</italic> in both GPI-anchored and soluble forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), and studies of neuronal explants confirm that both forms can induce directed axonal outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Furthermore, it has been proposed that the GPI anchor is cleaved by membrane-resident GPI-specific phospholipases (GPI-PLs) or matrix metalloproteases to release the Sema7A into the extracellular environment and thus regulate dynamic cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Because these observations indicate that Sema7A might influence neuronal development both as a juxtracrine and as a diffusive signal, we investigated the role of Sema7A in sculpting a vertebrate peripheral sensory organ.</p>

<title>Sema7A expression and localization in hair cells</title>
<p>The zebrafish genome contains a single <italic>sema7a</italic> gene that produces two transcripts. One transcript encodes Sema7A-GPI, a full-length, GPI-linked, cell surface-attached protein. The second transcript yields Sema7A<sup>sec</sup>, a protein with a truncated C-terminus, which we conjecture is secreted into the local environment. Each transcript encodes an N-terminal signal sequence and a single copy of the conserved sema domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Using primers that flank the regions encoding the sema domain and the distinct C-termini of the two transcripts, we performed reverse transcription and polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) to identify both the membrane-anchored and the secreted transcript in developing larvae (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Single-cell RNA sequencing data also have shown that the <italic>sema7a</italic> transcript is particularly enriched in the immature and mature hair cells of the neuromast during early larval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), a period when sensory axons of the posterior lateral line contact hair cells and form synapses with them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Indeed, we have observed Sema7A to be specifically localized in both mature and immature hair cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B-E</xref>).</p>
<p>As neuromasts mature, the contacts between sensory axons and hair cells increase in number, become stabilized, and establish synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Because Sema7A can modulate axon guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>) and synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), we wondered whether the level of Sema7A also changes during neuromast development. Upon quantifying the average intensity of Sema7A, we found similar expression in rostrally and caudally polarized hair cells of neuromasts at 1.5, 2, 3, and 4 days post fertilization (dpf). The average Sema7A intensity increased significantly over this period in both rostrally and caudally polarized hair cells. At 1.5 dpf, the neuromasts harbor primarily immature hair cells that make minimal contacts with sensory axons and do not form stable association with axonal terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). At this stage the average Sema7A intensity in hair cells remained low. By 2-4 dpf the hair cells mature to form stable contacts and well-defined synapses with the sensory axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). The average Sema7A intensity in hair cells at each of these stages rose to levels that significantly exceeded those of 1.5 dpf neuromasts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). This rise in the amount of Sema7A during neuromast maturation supports a role for Sema7A in the guidance of sensory axons and their interaction with hair cells.</p>
<p>We additionally demonstrated an anisotropic distribution of Sema7A along the apicobasal axis of each hair cell. As neuromasts develop through 2, 3, and 4 dpf, Sema7A remained highly enriched in the subapical region of the hair cell, the site of the Golgi network. This localization suggests that Sema7A—like other proteins of the semaphorin family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>)—is directed to the plasmalemma through Golgi-mediated vesicular trafficking. While Sema7A maintained a high level in the subapical region, the protein increasingly accumulated at the base of the hair cell: the Sema7A level at the hair cell base was low at 2 dpf, but increased sharply by 3 dpf and 4 dpf (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">G</xref>). During this period the hair cells increase in number and mature, whereas the associated sensory axons arborize to contact multiple hair cells and form robust synaptic boutons at their bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). The progressive enrichment of Sema7A at the hair cell base and sensory-axon interface (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">F</xref>; Video 1) suggests that Sema7A acts as a mediator of contacts between sensory axons and hair cells.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Sema7A restricts sensory axons around clustered hair cells</title>
<p>If Sema7A guides and restricts the sensory arbors at and around the hair cells clustered in a neuromast, then inactivating Sema7A function should disrupt this process. To test this hypothesis, we obtained a <italic>sema7a</italic> mutant allele (<italic>sema7a<sup>sa24691</sup></italic>) with a point mutation that introduces a premature stop codon in the conserved sema domain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The homozygous mutant, hereafter designated <italic>sema7a<sup>−/−</sup></italic>, should lack both the secreted and the membrane-attached forms of Sema7A. The average intensity of Sema7A immunolabeling in hair cells diminished by 61% in <italic>sema7a<sup>−/−</sup></italic>larvae (0.34 ± 0.01 arbitrary units) in comparison to controls (0.87 ± 0.01 arbitrary units). In a few cases we observed minute accumulations of Sema7A at the subapical region, but little or no protein at the base of the mutant hair cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) In a micrograph of a 3 dpf <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neuromast, Myosin VI (green) marks the hair cells (green dashed lines) in which the level of Sema7A (orange) is highly reduced, with sporadic localization in the subapical region (arrowheads) and none in the basolateral (arrow) region. A plot of normalized Sema7A intensity from 99 control and 100 <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> hair cells quantitates the effect. (B,C) Surface views of a control and a <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neuromast at 4 dpf depict the interaction of the sensory arbors (magenta) with hair cell clusters (green). In the control, the arbors intimately contact the hair cells, with a few exceptions (arrowhead). In the <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mutant, the arbors direct many aberrant projections (arrowheads) away from the hair cell cluster. The two immature hair cell pairs in the <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neuromast are indicated by arrows. (D,E) Skeletonized networks portray the three-dimensional topology of the sensory arbors from the control and the <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neuromasts depicted in panels B and C. The pseudocolored trajectories depict the increase in arbor contour length from each point of arborization, defined as the point at which the lateral line branch (magenta) contacts hair cell cluster. (F,G) Micrographs depict the skeletonized networks of the combined 4 dpf hair cell clusters, whose centers are located at (0,0). The X- and Y-coordinates represent the anteroposterior (AP) and the dorsoventral (DV) axes of the larva, respectively. Positive values of the X- and Y-coordinates represent the posterior and ventral directions, respectively. Combined skeletonized network traces from 27 control and 27 <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant neuromasts are represented. H) The plot denotes the densities of the sensory arbors around the center of the combined hair cell clusters for 35 control (magenta) and 27 <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (red) neuromasts at 4 dpf. The shaded area marks the region proximal to the boundary of the combined hair cell cluster. (I) The plot quantifies the degree of contact of the sensory arbors to their hair cell clusters in individual neuromasts from both control (magenta) and <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants (red), each point represents a single neuromast. Thirty-three, 29, and 35 neuromasts were analyzed from 2 dpf, 3 dpf, and 4 dpf control larvae, respectively. Seventeen, 53, and 27 neuromasts were analyzed from 2 dpf, 3 dpf, and 4 dpf <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant larvae, respectively.

</fig>
<p>To characterize the impact of the <italic>sema7a<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mutation on arbor patterning, we utilized doubly labeled transgenic fish <italic>Tg(myo6b:actb1-EGFP;neurod1:tdTomato)</italic> that marked the hair cells and the sensory axons of the posterior lateral line with distinct fluorophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). In control neuromasts, the sensory axons approached, arborized, and consolidated around the bases of clustered hair cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Although the sensory axons approached the hair cells of <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neuromasts, they displayed aberrant arborization patterns with wayward projections that extended transversely to the organ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). To quantitatively analyze the arborization morphology, we traced the sensory arbors in three dimensions to generate skeletonized network traces that depict–as pseudocolored trajectories–the increase in arbor length from the point of arborization (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">E</xref>).</p>
<p>To visualize the hair cell clusters and associated arborization networks from multiple neuromasts, we aligned images of hair cell clusters, registered them at their hair bundles, from neuromasts at 2 dpf, 3 dpf, and 4 dpf. Throughout development, the arborization networks of control neuromasts largely remained within the contours of the hair cell clusters; the few that reached farther nonetheless lingered nearby (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). This result suggests that an attractive cue retained the axons near the sensory organ. In <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neuromasts, however the neuronal arbors failed to consolidate within the boundaries of hair cell clusters and extended far beyond them (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C-H</xref>; Video 2).</p>
<p>We quantified the distribution of the sensory arbors around the center of the combined hair cell clusters. For both the control and the <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neuromasts, the arbor densities peaked proximal to the boundaries of the hair cell clusters. Beyond the cluster boundaries, in control neuromasts at 2 dpf, 3 dpf, and 4 dpf the arbor densities fell sharply at respectively 31.7 µm, 36.6 µm, and 32.7 µm from the center. In <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neuromasts of the same ages, the sensory arbors extended respectively 38.5 µm, 51.4 µm, and 56.6 µm from the center (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">J</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Furthermore, we quantified the degree of contact of the sensory arbors to their hair cell clusters in individual neuromasts from both control and <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mutants. In control neuromasts, the degree of contact was 83 ± 1 % (mean ± SEM) at 2 dpf and 84 ± 1 % at 3 dpf, but significantly increased to 90 ± 1 % at 4 dpf (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This observation indicates that the sensory arbors reinforce their association to the hair cell clusters as neuromasts develop. However, in <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neuromasts such contact was significantly reduced. Only 69 ± 4 % of sensory arbors at 2 dpf were closely associated with the corresponding hair cell clusters, a value that remained at 67 ± 2 % at both 3 dpf and 4 dpf (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). These findings signify that, with simultaneous disruption of both signaling modalities of Sema7A, the organ fails to restrict the localization of sensory arbors and has significantly diminished contact with them.</p>

<title>Sema7A patterns the arborization network’s topology</title>
<p>Accurate spatial arrangement of the neuronal projections around hair cells is essential for proper retrieval and transmission of sensory information. Mutations that perturb proper assembly of sensory neuronal microcircuits lead to hearing impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Quantitative insight into the wiring pattern is therefore essential to identify systematic aberrations in the microcircuit arising from genetic deficits. The three-dimensional skeletonized network traces allowed us to accurately delineate the microcircuit topology across individuals, developmental stages, and genotypes from living animals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). To quantitatively analyze the arbor network, we defined five topological attributes: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) nodes, denoted as junctions where arbors branch, converge, or cross; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) loops, comprising minimal arbor cycles forming topological holes; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) bare terminals, defined as arbors with free ends; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) the node degree, calculated as the number of first-neighbor nodes incident to a node; and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>) the arbor curvature, measured as the total curvature of a bare terminal (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).

<p>To determine how internode connectivity is distributed across networks, we quantified the distribution of node degrees along the relative height of the hair cell cluster across individuals, developmental stages, and genotypes. As for most other real-world networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), we observed a highly skewed node-degree distribution: the majority of nodes had low node degrees (three and four) and a small number of nodes—often acting as hubs, like the arborization initiation point—had high node degrees (five to seven). The node degree varied from three to seven in control larvae and three to six in <italic>sema7a<sup>−/−</sup></italic> larvae. Across developmental stages and genotypes, the high node degrees primarily occurred at the base (region from 0 % to 10 % of the cluster height) of the hair cell cluster and acted as hubs for the majority of branching events. Low node degrees primarily occurred along the basolateral region (region from 10 % to 60 % of the cluster height) of the hair cell cluster. The apical region (region from 60 % to 100 % of the cluster height) was sparsely populated with low node degrees. The network’s hierarchical organization along the organ’s axis suggests that arbors receive sensory inputs at multiple levels, allowing the network to carry out robust neural computations. Even though nodes of low degree were most prevalent between genotypes across developmental stages, their distribution along the relative organ axis became significantly different at 4 dpf, with nodes in control larvae localized higher along the axis than in <italic>sema7a<sup>−/−</sup></italic> larvae (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

<p>An average of 9.3 sensory axonal branches approach the hair cell cluster of a neuromast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Pathfinding of sensory axons around the hair cell cluster results in the formation of axonal fascicles that form numerous loops and bare terminals, which determine the microcircuit topology (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). To optimally surround and contact the hair cell cluster, do the sensory arbors prefer to adopt one topological feature over the other? To address this question, we measured the correlation between the number of bare terminals and the number of loops across individuals, developmental stages, and genotypes. In both 2 dpf and 3 dpf larvae, the distributions remained highly scattered across individuals and genotypes. However, by 4 dpf in the control larvae the arbor network contained either a high number of loops with a low number of bare terminals or a high number of bare terminals with a low number of loops. This result suggests that the stereotypical circuit topology observed in the mature organ emerges from distinct events in which individual arbors transition from forming bare terminals to forming closed loops encircling topological holes. That we did not observe a similar transition in <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neuromasts of the same age suggests that Sema7A regulates the switch between these two distinct topological features (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">E</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Measurement of the contour length of both bare terminals and loops additionally revealed that across developmental stages in control larvae the sensory arbors followed a three-step process to choose the appropriate topological feature: arbors shorter than 10 µm always formed bare terminals; arbors between 10 µm and 30 µm began to switch between features, with arbors longer than 20 µm strongly preferring to form loops; and arbors longer than 30 µm always formed loops. These results imply that the switch between bare terminals and loops is partly dependent on the length of the arbors. However, this characteristic topological preference was significantly perturbed in the <italic>sema7a<sup>−/−</sup></italic> larvae across developmental stages, as many of the sensory arbors longer than 30 µm remained as bare terminals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">G</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, in 4 dpf control neuromasts the majority of the loops contained four nodes and utilized 30-40 µm of arbors to form closed cycles. These conserved topological attributes were significantly perturbed in the <italic>sema7a<sup>−/−</sup></italic>larvae of same age (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">E</xref>; <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A-D</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These findings indicate that Sema7A tightly regulates the sensory arbor loop formation, including the preferred loop length and number of nodes per loop, to properly surround and contact the hair cell cluster.</p>
<p>As observed previously, bare terminals in control neuromasts project transverse to the organ and linger nearby, often curving back to form new loops and contact the hair cell cluster (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). To analyze the propensity of the bare terminals to curl backward, we measured their total curvatures, defined as the sum of the curvature at each point along the length of an arbor. Henceforth, we address the total curvature as the curvature of a bare terminal. We classified the bare terminals in two categories: high-curvature arbors with curled morphology and curvature greater than <italic>π</italic>/6 (30 degrees); and low-curvature arbors with linear morphology and curvature less than <italic>π</italic> /6. In control neuromasts 44.8 % of arbors had low curvature compared to 56.4 % in <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neuromasts at 4 dpf. Concomitantly, 55.2 % of arbors had high curvature in control neuromasts compared to 43.6 % in <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neuromasts at 4 dpf (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>; <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">F</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These observations further confirm our hypothesis that a Sema7A-mediated attractive cue is involved in orienting bare neural arbors toward the hair cell cluster to potentially form loops.</p>
<p>In summary, we propose that Sema7A regulates four key aspects of the topology of the arborization network: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) the node degree complexity along the organ’s axis; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) the transition of arbors from bare terminals to loops; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) the preference for forming loops containing four nodes with 30-40 µm of arbors; and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) the preference of bare terminals to adopt higher curvature.</p>

<title>Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> is a sufficient chemoattractive cue for sensory axon guidance</title>
<p>Because genetic inactivation of the <italic>sema7a</italic> gene disrupts both signaling modalities of the cognate protein, we could not assess the specific activity of the Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> diffusive cue in guiding lateral-line sensory axons. To independently verify the potential role of that isoform, we therefore expressed the secreted variant ectopically and investigated the resultant arborization patterns.</p>
<p>Analysis of the microcircuit connectivity of the neuromasts has demonstrated bare sensory-axonal terminals in the perisynaptic compartments, where they do not contact the hair cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). We speculate that these bare terminals are attracted by a Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> diffusive cue. To test this hypothesis, we ectopically expressed Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> protein tagged with the fluorophore mKate2, then analyzed its effect on the morphology of sensory arbors. Fertilized one-cell embryos were injected with the <italic>hsp70:sema7a<sup>sec</sup>-mKate2</italic> plasmid and raised to 3 dpf. Larvae expressing the transgenesis marker—the lens-specific red fluorescent protein mCherry—were heat-shocked, incubated to allow expression, and subsequently mounted for live imaging. In these larvae, a random mosaic of cells—often embryonic muscle progenitors in the dermomyotome or mature myofibers—expressed the exogenous Sema7A<sup>sec</sup>-mKate2 protein. We selected only those neuromasts in which an ectopic integration had occurred near the network of sensory arbors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A,B</xref>). In all 22 such cases, we observed robust axonal projections from the sensory arbor network toward the ectopically expressing Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> cells. When the exogenous <italic>sema7a<sup>sec</sup></italic> integration occurred in embryonic muscle progenitor cells, which reside in a superficial layer external to the muscle fibers and adjacent to the larval skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>), the projections were able to form direct contacts with them (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>; Videos 3, 4). But more often, when mature myofibers expressed the exogenous Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> deep in the myotome, the axonal projections approached those targets but failed to contact them (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, Videos 5, 6). This behavior likely arose because other components in the myotomal niche—including the fibrous epimysium, other myofibers, myoblasts, and immature myotubes whose surroundings are permeable to diverse diffusive cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>)—physically obstructed direct interaction of the extended neurites with the ectopically expressing myofibers. All 18 of the injected but not heat-shocked control larvae did not express ectopic Sema7A<sup>sec</sup>, and we did not observe aberrant projections from the sensory arbor network (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>).</p>

(B) A schematic drawing of a sensory arbor from a heat-shocked larva depicts an extended axonal projection (arrowhead) that reaches toward the myofibers expressing the ectopic Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> protein. Parameters that quantitate the accuracy of the extended axonal projections toward the ectopic Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> sources are denoted.

One elongates (cyan arrowhead) along the somite boundary to reach and contact an ectopically integrated muscle progenitor cell (white dashed line) and the other (red arrowhead) reenters the posterior lateral-line nerve while following a second ectopic source. The through-focus scans (i–iii) from the epidermis to the dermomyotome and the three-dimensional (3D) surface reconstruction (iv) reveal the intimate contact between the aberrant sensory arbor (arrowheads) and the muscle progenitor cell. (D) In a micrograph of an ectopically expressing Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> (orange) larva, the sensory arbor (magenta) extends a single aberrant axonal process (cyan arrowhead) to reach ectopically integrated myofibers (white dashed line). The through-focus scans (i–iii) from the epidermis to the dermomyotome and the 3D surface reconstruction (iv) reveal the proximal association of the aberrant sensory arbor (arrowheads) to the myofibers. Melanocytes (yellow arrowhead) along the horizontal myoseptum intermittently block the visibility of the lateral-line nerve.

<p>To measure the accuracy of the extended axonal projections in finding the ectopic Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> source, we defined three parameters: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) the source path, denoted as the linear distance from the point of arborization to the boundary of an ectopically expressing Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> cell; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) the projection path, representing the linear distance from the point of arborization to the terminus of the extended projection; and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) the projection proximity, calculated as the linear distance from the terminus of the extended axonal projection to the nearest boundary of the ectopically expressing Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> cell (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). We quantified these parameters from 18 of the 22 mosaic integration events; in the remainder the extended axonal projections– although following the ectopic source–reentered the posterior lateral-line nerve so that identification of the axon terminals was not possible (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-A</xref>”; Video 7). When we plotted the projection path length against the source-path length, we observed a nearly perfect correlation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). This result signifies that irrespective of the location of the ectopic source–whether proximal or distal to the sensory arbor network–the Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> cue sufficed to attract axonal terminals from the sensory arbor. Furthermore, the low average projection-proximity length of 3.5 ± 0.7 µm (mean ± SEM) indicated that the extended projection terminals remained either in contact (8 of 18) or in the vicinity (10 of 18) of the ectopic Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> sources (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). These observations together demonstrate that the Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> diffusive cue is sufficient to provide neural guidance <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>As the posterior lateral-line ganglion matures, newly formed neurons extend their axonal growth cones along the posterior lateral-line nerve to reach the neuromasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). We wondered whether the axonal projections that had yet to be associated with a neuromast could also respond to an ectopic source of Sema7A<sup>sec</sup>. Indeed, on five occasions in which <italic>sema7a<sup>sec</sup></italic> integration had occurred between two neuromasts, we detected neurite extensions from the posterior lateral-line nerve to the ectopic Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> source (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B-B</xref>”; Videos 8-10). The responsiveness of the posterior lateral-line axons to Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> might therefore be an intrinsic property of the neurons that does not require the neuromast microenvironment.</p>

<title>Sema7A deficiency impacts synaptic assembly</title>
<p>Contact stabilization between an axon and its target cell is essential for synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Neural GPI-anchored proteins can act as regulators of various synaptic-adhesion pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). In the mouse olfactory system, GPI-anchored Sema7A is enriched in olfactory sensory axons and mediates sustained interaction with the dendrites of mitral and tufted cells in the olfactory bulb to establish synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). In the developing mouse brain–particularly in Purkinje cells–GPI-anchored Sema7A instead regulates the elimination of synapses onto climbing fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). The role of anchored Sema7A in regulating synaptic architecture can thus vary according to the cell type and developmental stage. Our demonstration that Sema7A is necessary to consolidate the contact between sensory axons and hair cells during neuromast development suggests a possible role in regulating synaptic structure.</p>
<p>Proper synaptogenesis requires the correct spatial organization of the presynaptic and postsynaptic apparatus at the apposition of two cells. At the interface between hair cells and sensory axons, the synaptic network involves two scaffolding proteins in particular: ribeye, a major constituent of the presynaptic ribbons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>), and membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK), a conserved group of proteins that organize postsynaptic densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Utilizing these scaffolding proteins as markers, we investigated the impact of the <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutation on synapse formation. To analyze the distribution of presynaptic densities–immunolabeled with an antibody against the ribeye-associated presynaptic constituent C-terminal binding protein (CTBP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>)–we counted the number and measured the area of CTBP punctae from multiple neuromasts at several stages of neuromast development (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). The CTBP punctae in each hair cell ranged from zero to seven across developmental stages. In the zebrafish’s posterior lateral line, the formation of presynaptic ribbons is an intrinsic property of the hair cells that does not require contact with lateral-line sensory axons. However, sustained contact with the sensory axon influences the maintenance and stability of ribbons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). As neuromasts matured from 2 dpf to 4 dpf, we identified similar distribution patterns with a characteristic increase in the number of CTBP punctae in both control and <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic>larvae (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). This result implies that the formation of new presynaptic ribbons is not perturbed in the mutants, even though there are on average fewer CTBP punctae (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>). Measurement of the areas of CTBP punctae also showed similar distributions in both genotypes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>, F) but the average area of presynaptic densities was reduced in the mutants (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D-F</xref>).</p>

<p>Because GPI-anchored Sema7A lacks a cytosolic domain, it is unlikely that Sema7A signaling directly induces formation of presynaptic ribbons. Instead, GPI-anchored Sema7A might induce postsynaptic assembly on the apposed neuronal membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). To characterize the distribution of the postsynaptic aggregates–immunostained with a pan-MAGUK antibody– we performed analyses similar to those above (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">J</xref>). At 4 dpf, 68.3 % of the hair cells in the control neuromasts were associated with at least one MAGUK punctum.

The average number of MAGUK punctae also declined in the mutants (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G-I</xref>). As control neuromasts matured from 2 dpf to 4 dpf, the MAGUK punctae showed a shift toward smaller sizes, suggesting that the postsynaptic structure fragmented into smaller entities as observed in other excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). At 4 dpf, 77.5 % of the hair cells in the control neuromasts had postsynaptic densities with areas between 0.10 µm<sup>2</sup> and 0.40 µm<sup>2</sup>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The specification of neural circuitry requires precise control of the guidance cues that direct and restrict neural arbors at their target fields and facilitate synapse formation. In the lateral-line neuromast of the zebrafish, we have identified Sema7A as an essential cue that regulates the interaction between hair cells and sensory axons. We have discovered dual modes of Sema7A function <italic>in vivo</italic>: the chemoattractive diffusible form is sufficient to guide the sensory arbors toward their target, whereas the membrane-attached form likely participates in sculping accurate neural circuitry to facilitate contact-mediated formation and maintenance of synapses. Our results suggest a potential mechanism for hair cell innervation in which a local Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> diffusive cue consolidates the sensory arbors at the hair cell cluster and the membrane-anchored Sema7A-GPI molecule regulates microcircuit topology and synapse assembly.</p>
<p>The role of Sema7A in regulating diverse topological features of the arborization network suggests that microcircuits of control and <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic>neuromasts display important functional differences. Loss of Sema7A disrupts the hierarchical organization of the node-degree distribution along the organ’s axis, as well as the preference towards forming loops containing four nodes with 30-40 µm of arbors. What benefit does the network gain from surrounding the hair cell cluster with closed loops instead of bare terminals? The network may actively form loops to contribute to the neuromast’s overall structure and function, or else emerge as a consequence of the arbors navigating the intervening spaces between the hair cells and support cells. Through our ectopic expression of Sema7A<sup>sec</sup>, we have observed that free spaces and physical obstructions can shape arbor morphologies, such as in the myotomal niche. However, we speculate that the precise patterning of the network—with characteristic looping behaviors—is not merely a byproduct of neuromast architecture, but rather contributes to the network’s ability to perform robust neural computations and faithfully transmit sensory information to higher processing centers in the posterior lateral-line ganglion and medial octavolateralis nucleus in the hindbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Further studies are necessary to dissect the potential role of these topological features in performing robust neural computations in the lateral-line microcircuit.</p>
<p>Recent studies have begun to dissect the molecular mechanisms of semaphorin signaling in axonal navigation. In explants derived from the murine olfactory bulb, Sema7A interacts directly with integrinβ1 to trigger downstream signaling effectors involving focal adhesion kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinases, which are critical regulators of the cytoskeletal network during axonal pathfinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Moreover, the interaction between Sema7A and its receptor plexinC1 activates the rac1-cdc42-PAK pathway, which alters the actin network to promote axonal guidance and synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). We speculate that lateral-line sensory axons utilize similar mechanisms to sense and respond to Sema7A in the establishment of microcircuits with hair cells.</p>
<p>During early development of the posterior lateral line, the growth cones of sensory axons intimately associate with the prosensory primordium that deposits neuromasts along the lateral surface of the larva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). The growth of the sensory fibers with the primordium is regulated by diverse neurotrophic factors expressed in the primordium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). Impairing brain-derived or glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factors and their receptors perturbs directed axonal motility and innervation of hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). Lateral-line hair cells are particularly enriched in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>) and other chemotropic cues (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Because the sensory axons of <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants reliably branch from the lateral-line nerve to reach hair cell clusters, these chemoattractive factors might compensate in part for the absence of Sema7A function. Although sensory axons are strict selectors of hair cell polarity and form synapses accordingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>), diverse chemoattractant cues including Sema7A occur uniformly between hair cell polarities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). It seems likely that unbiased attractive signals bring sensory arbors toward hair cells, after which polarity-specific molecules on hair cell surfaces dictate the final association between axonal terminal and hair cells. Notch-delta signaling and its downstream effectors regulate hair cell polarity and the innervation pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). It would be interesting to determine whether Notch-mediated polarity signatures on the hair cell’s surface can refine the neuromast neural circuitry.</p>

<title>Measurement of Sema7A intensity</title>
<p>The average Sema7A fluorescence intensities of the hair cells from 1.5 dpf, 2 dpf, 3 dpf, and 4 dpf neuromasts were measured by determining the mean gray level within each hair cell labeled by actin-GFP expression. The intensity distribution of Sema7A protein along the apicobasal axis of the hair cell was measured using the line profile tool in ImageJ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Because hair cell lengths differed among samples, lines were drawn with 2 μm widths and varying lengths of 6-8 μm. For each hair cell, apicobasal length was scaled from 0 to 100 arbitrary units and the intensity values from 0 to 1 arbitrary units.</p>

Each section, as depicted with a distinct color shade, had an area of π μm<sup>2</sup>. Sensory arbor density was defined as Log<sub>10</sub>[(Area occupied by the arbors in each section)/ (Area of each section)]. The arbor density was then plotted as a histogram against distance from the center of the combined hair cell cluster. Each bin of the histogram represents an area of π µm<sup>2</sup>.

<title>Quantification of the sensory arborization network topology</title>
<p>We developed a custom Python script (snt_topology.py; available on GitHub) to convert the skeletonized sensory arborization networks to network graphs (NetworkX, v3.1). We first used a custom ImageJ macro to convert SNT skeletons to csv files, then generated the network graph from the individual arbor paths. As noted previously, we defined five topological attributes: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) nodes— junctions where arbors branch, converge, or cross; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) loops—minimal arbor cycles forming topological holes; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) bare terminals—arbors with free ends; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) node degree—the number of first-neighbor nodes incident to a node; and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>) arbor curvature—the total curvature of a bare terminal (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). To enumerate loops and quantify their lengths and node numbers, we computed the minimum cycle basis for each network graph. The relative organ height of each node in a graph was defined in 3D using <xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation (1)</xref>:

where u#⃗ is the vector from the arborization initiation point to a node and #v⃗ is the vector from the arborization initiation point to the hair cell cluster apex. The relative occurrence of nodes (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>) was normalized by both the number of hair cells per neuromast and the total number of neuromasts, for comparison across ages and genotypes. The relative number of bare terminals and loops (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">E</xref>) was normalized by the number of hair cells per neuromast and scaled between 0 and 1.

Lastly, we defined bare terminals as having either high or low curvature (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>; <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">D</xref>) if their absolute total signed curvature [<xref rid="eqn2" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation (2)</xref>] in three dimensions was either higher or lower than <italic>π</italic>/6, respectively:

where 𝑠 is the arc-length parameter of the bare terminal, 𝑇(𝑠) is the unit tangent vector at each point along the arbor, 𝑁(𝑠) is the unit normal vector at each point, and the integral is evaluated from the terminal’s branching node to the arbor’s tip. For a closed curve forming a full loop, this value will equal 2<italic>π</italic> . In practice, we first fit B-splines (scipy.interpolate.splprep; SciPy, v1.10.1) in 3D to the skeletons for each bare terminal before evaluating their derivatives (scipy.interpolate.splev) and integrating (scipy.integrate.simpson) over their lengths.</p>

<p>In this work, Dasguta et al. have dissected the role of Sema7a in fine tuning of a sensory microcircuit in the posterior lateral line organ of zebrafish. They attempt to also outline the different roles of a secreted verses membrane-bound form of Sema7a in this process. Using genetic perturbations and axonal network analysis, the authors show that loss of both Sema7a isoforms causes abnormal axon terminal structure with more bare terminals and fewer loops in contact with presynaptic sensory hair cells. Further, they show that loss of Sema7a causes decreased number and size of both the pre- and post-synapse. Finally, they show that overexpression of the secreted form of Sema7a specifically can elicit axon terminal outgrowth to an ectopic Sema7a expressing cell. Together, the analysis of Sema7a loss of function and overexpression on axon arbor structure is fairly thorough and revealed a novel role for Sema7a in axon terminal structure. However, the connection between different isoforms of Sema7a and the axon arborization needs to be substantiated. Furthermore, an autocrine role for Sema7a on the presynaptic cell is not ruled out as a contributing factor to the synaptic and axon structure phenotypes. Finally, critical controls are absent from the overexpression paradigm. These issues weaken the claims made by the authors including the statement that they have identified differential roles for the GPI-anchored verses secreted forms of Sema7a on synapse formation and as a chemoattractant for axon arborization respectively. The manuscript itself would benefit from the inclusion of details in the text to help the reader interpret the figures, tools, data, and analysis.</p>

<p>In this work, Dasgupta et al. investigates the role of Sema7a in the formation of peripheral sensory circuit in the lateral line system of zebrafish. They show that Sema7a protein is present during neuromast maturation and localized, in part, to the base of hair cells (HCs). This would be consistent with pre-synaptic Sema7a mediating formation and/or stabilization of the synapse. They use sema7a loss-of-function strain to show that lateral line sensory terminals display abnormal arborization. They provide highly quantitative analysis of the lateral line terminal arborization to show that a number of specific topological parameters are affected in mutants. Next, they ectopically express a secreted form of Sema7a to show that lateral line terminals can be ectopically attracted to the source. Finally, they also demonstrate that the synaptic assembly is impaired in the sema7a mutant. Overall, the data are of high quality and properly controlled. The availability of Sema7a antibody is a big plus, as it allows to address the endogenous protein localization as well to show the signal absence in the sema7a mutant. The quantification of the arbor topology should be useful to people in the field who are looking at the lateral line as well as other axonal terminals. I think some results are overinterpreted though. The authors state: &quot;Our findings demonstrate that Sema7A functions both as a juxtracrine and as a secreted cue to pattern neural circuitry during sensory organ development.&quot; However, they have not actually demonstrated which isoform functions in HCs (also see comments below). In addition, they have to be careful in interpreting their topology analysis, as they cannot separate individual axons. Thus, such analysis can generate artifacts. They can perform additional experiments to address these issues or adjust their interpretations.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study demonstrates that the axon guidance molecule Sema7a patterns the innervation of hair cells in the neuromasts of the zebrafish lateral line, as revealed by quantifying gain- and loss-of function effects on the three-dimensional topology of sensory axon arbors over developmental time. Alternative splicing can produce either a diffusible or membrane-bound form of Sema7a, which is increasingly localized to the basolateral pole of hair cells as they develop (Figure 1). In sema7a mutant zebrafish, sensory axon arbors still grow to the neuromast, but they do not form the same arborization patterns as in controls, with many arbors overextending, curving less, and forming fewer loops even as they lengthen (Figure 2,3). These phenotypes only become significant later in development, indicating that Sema7a functions to pattern local microcircuitry, not the gross wiring pattern. Further, upon ectopic expression of the diffusible form of Sema7a, sensory axons grow towards the Sema7a source (Figure 4). The data also show changes in the synapses that form when mutant terminals contact hair cells, evidenced by significantly smaller pre- and post-synaptic punctae (Figure 5). Finally, by replotting single cell RNA-sequencing data (Figure 6), the authors show that several other potential cues are also produced by hair cells and might explain why the sema7a phenotype does not reflect a change in growth towards the neuromast. In summary, the data strongly indicate that Sema7a plays a role in shaping connectivity within the neuromast.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The main strength of this study is the sophisticated analysis that was used to demonstrate fine-level effects on connectivity. Rather than asking &quot;did the axon reach its target?&quot;, the authors asked &quot;how does the axon behave within the target?&quot;. This type of deep analysis is much more powerful than what is typical for the field and should be done more often. The breadth of analysis is also impressive, in that axon arborization patterns and synaptic connectivity were examined at 3 stages of development and in three-dimensions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The main weakness is that the data do not cleanly distinguish between activities for the secreted and membrane-bound forms of Sema7a, which the authors speculate may influence axon growth and synapse formation respectively. The authors do not overstate the claims, but it would have been nice to see some additional experimentation along these lines, such as the effects of overexpressing the membrane-bound form, some analysis of the distance over which the &quot;diffusible&quot; form of Sema7a might act (many secreted ligands are not in fact all that diffusible), or some live-imaging of axons before they reach the target (predicted to be the same in control and mutants) and then within the target (predicted to be different). Clearly, although the gain-of-function studies show that Sema7a can act at a distance, other cues are sufficient. Although the lack of a phenotype could be due to compensation, it is also possible that Sema7a does not actually act in a diffusible manner within its natural context.</p>
<p>Overall, the data support the authors' carefully worded conclusions. While certain ideas are put forward as possibilities, the authors recognize that more work is needed. The main shortcoming is that the study does not actually distinguish between the effects of the two forms of Sema7a, which are predicted but not actually shown to be either diffusible or membrane linked (the membrane linkage can be cleaved). Although the study starts by presenting the splice forms, there is no description of when and where each splice form is transcribed. Additionally, since the mutants are predicted to disrupt both forms, it is a bit difficult to disentangle the synaptic phenotype from the earlier changes in circuit topology - perhaps the change at the level of the synapse is secondary to the change in topology. Further, the authors do not provide any data supporting the idea that the membrane bound form of Sema7a acts only locally. Without these kinds of data, the authors are unable to attribute activities to either form.</p>
<p>The main impact on the field will be the nature of the analysis. The field of axon guidance benefits from this kind of robust quantification of growing axon trajectories, versus their ability to actually reach a target. This study highlights the value of more careful analysis and as a result, makes the point that circuit assembly is not just a matter of painting out paths using chemoattractants and repellants, but is also about how axons respond to local cues. The study also points to the likely importance of alternative splice forms and to the complex functions that can be achieved using different forms of the same ligand.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The work by Dasgupta et al identifies Sema7a as a novel guidance molecule in hair cell sensory systems. The authors use the both genetic and imaging power of the zebrafish lateral-line system for their research. Based on expression data and immunohistochemistry experiments, the authors demonstrate that Sema7a is present in lateral line hair cells. The authors then examine a sema7a mutant. In this mutant, Sema7a proteins levels are nearly eliminated. Importantly, the authors show that when Sema7a is absent, afferent terminals show aberrant projections and fewer contacts with hair cells. Lastly the authors show that ectopic expression of the secreted form of Sema7a is sufficient to recruit aberrant terminals to non-hair cell targets. The sema7a innervation defects are well quantified. Overall, the paper is extremely well written and easy to follow.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
1. The axon guidance phenotypes in sema7a mutants are novel, striking and thoroughly quantified.</p>
<p>
2. By combining both loss of function sema7a mutants and ectopic expression of the secreted form of Sema7a the authors demonstrate the Sema7a is both necessary and sufficient to guide sensory axons</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
1. Control. There should be an uninjected heatshock control to ensure that heatshock itself does not cause sensory afferents to form aberrant arbors. This control would help support the hypothesis that exogenously expressed Sema7a (via a heatshock driven promoter) is sufficient to attract afferent arbors.</p>
<p>
2. Synapse labeling. The numbers obtained for postsynaptic labeling in controls do not match up with the published literature - they are quite low. Although there are clear differences in postsynaptic counts between sema7a mutants and controls, it is worrying that the numbers are so low in controls. In addition, the authors do not stain for complete synapses (pre- and post-synapses together). This staining is critical to understand how Sema7a impacts synapse formation.</p>
<p>
3. Hair cell counts. The authors need to provide quantification of hair cell counts per neuromast in mutant and control animals. If the counts are different, certain quantification may need to be normalized.</p>
<p>
4. Developmental delay. It is possible that loss of Sema7a simply delays development. The latest stage examined was 4 dpf, an age that is not quite mature in control animals. The authors could look at a later age, such as 6 dpf to see if the phenotypes persist or recover.</p>
