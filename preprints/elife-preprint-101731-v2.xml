<title>Abstract</title><p>Lung cancer is preceded by premalignant lesions, and what factors drive this transformation and the potential regulatory mode in the context of tumor initiation remain to be elucidated. In the course of precancerous lesions, we found a phasic shift in metabolic patterns. Macrophages are a heterogeneous cell population with high plasticity in the tumor microenvironment. Single-cell interaction and metabolic analyses highlighted a cellular state, S100a4<sup>+</sup> alveolar macrophages, which exhibited distinct fatty acid metabolic activity, such as palmitic acid metabolism, at the atypical adenomatous hyperplasia stage, accompanied by an angiogenic-promoting function in a pre-neoplastic setting. These findings were reproducible in human single-cell transcriptomes and had been confirmed by histopathological staining and in vitro cell coculture assays. Taken together, the results from this study demonstrated that the S100a4<sup>+</sup> alveolar macrophage subset contributes to tumorigenesis by altering its metabolic state, suggesting that metabolic interventions targeting this cell state in the early stage of disease may delay neoplastic transformation of the lung epithelium.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The ontology of lung cancer is a multi-gene-involved, multi-stage, long-term, and extremely complex pathological process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Greaves &amp; Maley, 2012</xref>). Emerging evidence indicates that multistep tumorigenesis develops through a series of progressive pathologic changes known as preneoplastic or precursor lesions, which present prior to the onset of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Pich et al., 2022</xref>). With the development of imaging technology and the application of molecular biomarkers for lung cancer screening in recent years, the detection rate of early lung cancer, especially precancerous lesions, has increased significantly. Some of the abnormalities in precancerous lesions are reversible; early diagnosis and guiding precancerous patients away from carcinogens or early intervention and blocking may reverse their further development to minimize the risk of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pennycuick et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Teixeira et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Yatabe, Borczuk, &amp; Powell, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>As the most common histologic subtype of lung cancer, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) predominantly arises from alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Zacharias et al., 2018</xref>). For the classification of LUAD and its precursors, atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) is considered to be the first step in a continuum of histomorphologic changes in malignant adenocarcinomas and is in continuity with preinvasive adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) in terms of morphological alterations, then microinvasive lesions termed minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), and eventually invasive adenocarcinoma (IA) (S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sivakumar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Travis et al., 2011</xref>). However, the scarcity and difficult accessibility of adequate samples limit the investigation of the cellular and molecular landscape of LUAD precursors. Alternatively, studies also found AAH-like lesions in mouse models, as well as adenomas and AIS, prior to the appearance of LUAD (Nemanja Despot <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Marjanovic et al., 2020</xref>; W. Weichert &amp; A. Warth, 2014). These models accurately mimic human lung precancerous lesions at the molecular and histopathological levels, providing well-suited materials for our study. Gradually shifting the target of lung cancer treatment from middle and advanced patients with clinical symptoms to asymptomatic patients with early or precancerous lesions is precisely the new concept of oncotherapy in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Reynolds et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Umar, Dunn, &amp; Greenwald, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The tumor microenvironment (TME) homeostasis is determined by close crosstalk within and across all cellular components, including malignant, immune, endothelial, and stromal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Vitale, Manic, Coussens, Kroemer, &amp; Galluzzi, 2019</xref>). Unveiling potential communications between malignant cells and TME underlying oncogenesis is critical for the future development of mechanism-informed, subset-targeted tumor immunotherapy strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Feng &amp; Gao, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Wen, Lambrecht, Ju, &amp; Tacke, 2021</xref>). Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are a cell population with plasticity and heterogeneity in the TME. As an important player in tumor pathobiology, on the one hand, macrophages may be educated by neoplastic cells to provide a favorable microenvironment, supporting the malignant transformation, disease progression, metastasis, and resistance to treatment; and on the other, they may play a role in anti-tumor immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Mantovani, Marchesi, Malesci, Laghi, &amp; Allavena, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ruffell, Affara, &amp; Coussens, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Sica &amp; Mantovani, 2012</xref>). Part of such heterogeneity may be attributed to the diversity of phenotypic characteristics, metabolic patterns, and functional profiles of TAMs in response to environmental perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cassetta &amp; Pollard, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Tumorigenesis relies on reprogramming of cellular metabolism, and metabolic mining of immune cells in the TME has expanded our understanding of tumor-associated metabolic alterations at different stages of tumor development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bian et al., 2020</xref>; W. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Metabolic changes of TAMs in TME have been reported to be accompanied by phenotypic and functional changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Vitale et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Xia et al., 2020</xref>). The metabolic landscape of TAMs in the context of tumor initiation and the interdependent relationship of development, metabolism, and functional plasticity in TAMs remain largely unraveled. Exploring the major metabolic circuits by which TAMs remodel the TME and digging metabolic clues that affect the functional polarization of TAMs will contribute to the proposal of immunometabolic strategies that utilize TAMs for tumor prevention and therapy.</p>
<p>In order to simulate the process of human lung adenocarcinogenesis, we established a spontaneous LUAD mouse model and used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to parse the metabolic changes of malignant epithelial cells and macrophages during the precancerous period, explore the metabolic heterogeneity and pro-tumor mechanism of alveolar macrophages, and probe the key links of metabolic pattern shifts whereby the alveolar macrophage subset conditions epithelial cell transformation. In-depth understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the acquisition of aberrant phenotypes at precancerous and further carcinogenesis stages may accelerate the identification of precancerous metabolic intervention targets. Therefore, the diagnosis and prevention of lung cancer can be advanced to the stage of precancerous lesions, and measures can be taken to prevent or reverse the further development of precancerous lesions.</p>

<title>Histopathology profiling and scRNA-seq of precancerous lesions in mice</title>
<p>A/J mice have the highest incidence of spontaneous lung tumors among various mouse strains, and this probability significantly increased with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Landau, Wang, Yang, Ding, &amp; Yang, 1998</xref>). To more comprehensively mirror the tumor initiation and progression process of human lung cancer, A/J mice were maintained for 12-16 months for spontaneous lesions, which resulted in three recognizable precancerous lesions in the lung. A total of 19 tissues were histologically categorized by two pathologists into four subtypes, including eight normal tissues, three AAHs, three adenomas, and five AISs, which were confirmed by Ki67 staining, spanning the cascade from normal to precancerosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). To characterize cell diversity along tumorigenesis, we conducted a time-ordered single-cell transcriptomic profiling starting with normal tissue and ending with AIS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). For each sample, we isolated single cells without prior selection for cell types and used the 10x Chromium platform to generate RNA-seq data. After removing low-quality cells, a total of 119,698 cells that passed quality control were retained for subsequent analysis, which yielded a median of 910 detected genes per cell. The cell count and genes expressed in each sample were provided in Figure S1A and S1B.</p>

<p>To identify distinct cell populations based on gene expression patterns, we performed dimensionality reduction and unsupervised cell clustering using methods implemented in Seurat, followed by removing batch effects among multiple samples. As shown using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), profiles along the cascade were derived, and a total of 13 main cell clusters were finally identified, which we defined as the single-cell transcriptome atlas of mouse lung in premalignant lesions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Based on the expression of canonical markers, we classified immune cells into T cells (Cd3e, Cd3d, Cd3g), B cells (Cd79a, Ms4a1, Igkc), neutrophils (Retnlg, S100a8, S100a9), macrophages (Mrc1, Cd68, C1qa), monocytes (F13a1, Ms4a6c), dendritic cells (H2-Eb1, H2-Aa, H2-Ab1), and mast cells (Csf1, Il6) and identified five clusters of non-immune cells, including epithelial cells (Sftpc, Scgb1a1, Sftpb), fibroblasts (Col1a1, Dcn, Gsn), endothelial cells (Cdh5, Ramp2, Cldn5), mesothelials (Gpm6a, Upk3b, Msln), and smooth muscle cells (Acta2, Tagln, Myh11). In addition, a cluster expressing proliferating markers (Top2a, Mki67) was identified, named cell cycle cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Each of these populations was captured from different pathological stages of different mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). The proportion of cell types across the four stages showed irregular changes, while transcriptional homogeneity was reduced with precancerous progression, illustrating the importance of heterogeneity in tumorigenesis and also proving the reliability of the sampling in this study (Figure S1C, S1D, and 1G).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Identification of initiation-associated epithelial marker and resolution of metabolic pattern in malignant epithelial cells</title>
<p>Tumorigenesis relies on reprogramming of cellular metabolism. To obtain comprehensive cell type-specific metabolic profiles, metabolism-related genes were extracted from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database, and metabolic clustering was performed on scRNA-seq data. The metabolic subsets and cell types corresponded well, indicating metabolic heterogeneity among cell types (Figure S2A and S2B). Through Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) against metabolic pathways, 16 subsets manifested distinct metabolic activities, with neutrophils, epithelial cells, and macrophages showing relatively higher metabolic activities (Figure S2C).</p>
<p>Generally, malignant transformation of epithelial cells is the starting point for the development of precancerous lesions. AT2 cells, ciliated cells, and AT1 cells were identified in our epithelial transcriptome (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). At the evolutionary stages of precancerous LUAD, despite possible sample heterogeneity and other interference, we observed increased interactions between epithelial cells and surrounding stromal and immune cells in the microenvironment, indicating gradually frequent cell-cell communication during this process (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). It was worth noting that the Spp1-Cd44 ligand-receptor complex showed more interactions in the AAH stage than in the AIS stage, between epithelial cells and other cell types, especially myeloid cells (macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils). The SPP1-CD44 axis was reported to be involved in tumor initiation and growth, and CD44 levels were found to be higher in AAH compared to AIS and IA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kerr et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pietras et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, the pattern of the App-Cd74 signaling suggested incremental communications between epithelial cells and immune cells during the occurrence of precancerous lesions, and it was reported to be implicated in tumor progression and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anderson et al., 2023</xref>). Then we sought to identify initiation-associated epithelial markers underlying LUAD precancerosis. Ldha was gradually enriched in the precancerous occurrence of lung cancer, and the increased expression trend along with the tumor initiation process was verified by immunofluorescent staining (Figure S2D and 2C). Moreover, analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database indicated that the initiation-associated marker LDHA was highly expressed in LUAD and showed an increasing trend in the early stages of the disease, and its high expression was correlated with poor prognosis of LUAD patients (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D-F</xref>). Thus, it deserves to be further evaluated as a potentially promising biomarker during lung tumorigenesis.</p>

<p>To distinguish malignant cells from non-malignant cells based on karyotypes, chromosomal copy number variations (CNVs) from each epithelial cellâs profile were inferred (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref> and S2E). There were some CNV variations in the normal group, which may be related to the nature of the algorithm, the sample collection operation, or the late processing of the cells; these cells were excluded from subsequent analyses. To explore the phasic metabolic changes in malignant epithelial cells, metabolic activity was quantified using the scMetabolism package. The results indicated that malignant epithelial cells in the adenoma stage were enriched in lipid metabolism-related pathways, while in the AIS stage, significant enrichment of glycometabolism-related pathways was observed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). The Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) enrichment analysis showed a concordant variation trend (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). These data suggested that epithelial cells manifest diverse metabolic patterns during malignant transition.</p>

<title>S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro exhibited active fatty acid metabolism in the AAH phase</title>
<p>With the development of tumor metabolism research, it has been found that the metabolism of other cell types in the microenvironment besides epithelial cells can also regulate tumorigenesis. Macrophage was the most prominent cell type that interacted with malignant epithelial cells, as shown by Cell Chat analysis (Figure S3A). Macrophages were composed of alveolar macrophages (Itgax and Siglecf) and interstitial macrophages (Itgam and Cx3cr1) in subclustering (Figure S3B and S3C). Further analysis revealed a higher correlation between alveolar macrophages and malignant epithelial cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and S3D). To resolve the metabolic pattern of alveolar macrophages at a higher resolution, we subclassified them into four subpopulations based on gene expression (Figure S3E and S3F). Enrichment analysis was performed for each of the four subpopulations, and scMetabolism analysis revealed that one of the alveolar macrophage subpopulations already showed a metabolically active state at the AAH stage, especially lipid metabolism, which we hereafter termed as S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B and C</xref>). As a representative, the overall abundance trends of glycerolipid metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids were displayed in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>. Next, we used the Compass algorithm to model the metabolic flux of cells for S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro, quantitatively analyzed the metabolic activity of cells, and then focused on metabolic enzymes and genes related to lipid metabolism for in-depth analysis. Fatty acid metabolism was found to be relatively more active in the AAH phase, which was represented by changes in palmitoyl-CoA desaturase, palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase, and carnitine palmitoyl-transferase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Consistently, the expression levels of related genes Cpt1a and Acot2 were also higher in precancerous lesions relative to normal circumstance (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). In our preliminary validation, the presence of F4/80<sup>+</sup>/CD11c<sup>+</sup>/S100A4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro was identified in the corresponding tissues by multiplexed immunohistochemistry staining, and their number and proportion were observed to be significantly greater in AAH samples than in normal samples (Figure S3G, S3H, and 3G). CPT1A is responsible for the fatty acid Î²-oxidation in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Nakamura, Yudell, &amp; Loor, 2014</xref>), and its positivity was found more frequently in the S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro of the AAH group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>), suggesting fatty acid metabolism in this subpopulation was activated at the AAH stage.</p>

<title>Pro-angiogenic function of S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro was associated with fatty acid metabolism</title>
<p>Metabolic profile is coupled with phenotype and functional program of macrophages. Among all pathological stages, although there was no significant difference in the cell proportion of S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro in macrophages, its proportion in alveolar macrophages was obviously the highest in the AAH stage (Figure S4A and 4A). To evaluate changes in the functional programs of this macrophage subpopulation in the context of precancerous lesions, we performed enrichment analysis of the well-known macrophage phenotypes. It was revealed that the capacities for angiogenesis, M2-like polarization, and immunosuppression were found to be stronger in AAH or other precancerous stages relative to the normal stage (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). The pro-angiogenic function predominated in the AAH stage, while M2-like and immunosuppressive functions were more prominent in the subsequent precancerous progression. Correlation analysis was used to measure the relationship between these functional programs and metabolic activity, where pro-angiogenic and M2-like phenotypes of S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro were proved to be positively correlated with lipid metabolism (Figure S4B). Further investigation showed that both of them were positively correlated with palmitic acid-related metabolic reactions (DESAT16_2_pos, C160CPT1_pos, and RE0577C_pos, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Next, we queried the angiogenesis-related gene signature in S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro, and the expression levels of Anxa2 and Ramp1 were detected to be higher in the AAH group than the normal group (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). ANXA2 supports angiogenesis in specific tumor-related settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Huang et al., 2022</xref>), and its expression level was positively correlated with that of Cpt1a in S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Whatâs more, the correlation between CPT1A and ANXA2 was verified in the immunostaining of AAH tissues, revealing more F4/80<sup>+</sup>/CD11c<sup>+</sup>/S100A4<sup>+</sup>/CPT1A<sup>+</sup>/ANXA2<sup>+</sup> alv-macro compared to normal tissues (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>).

<title>S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro displayed the potential to promote the early malignant transformation of lung epithelial cells in vitro</title>
<p>To further validate our findings from scRNA-seq and histological staining, S100a4-overexpressed (OE) alveolar macrophages were established by transfection of the mS100a4 vector into the murine MH-S cell line, and empty vector was transfected as negative control (NC) cells, which were verified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blotting (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>).

After culture with conditioned medium (CM) of S100a4-OE MH-S, the proliferation and migration ability of mouse lung epithelial MLE12 cells were significantly promoted, and the cell cycle was more arrested in the G2/M phase (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C-F</xref>). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced within cells can lead to genetic mutations that trigger malignant transformation of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">SantibÃ¡Ã±ez-Andrade et al., 2023</xref>), and we found markedly elevated ROS levels in OE-CM cocultured epithelial cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>).

In addition, we performed reverse verification with siRNA and demonstrated that the functional phenotype of epithelial cells did not change after S100a4-knockdown MH-S coculture (Figure S5).</p>

<p>During the in vitro carcinogenesis process, a battery of assays allows for the identification of the cells in the initiation, promotion, or aggressive stages of tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Barguilla et al., 2023</xref>). We found increased expression of DNA damage marker p-Î³H2AX and decreased expression of adhesion protein E-Cadherin, but no marked changes in N-Cadherin, Vimentin, and stem-like markers (CD44 and CD133) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>). The expression of tumorigenesis-associated proteins (c-MYC, p-ERK, SPA, VEGF, and HIF-1Î±) was elevated in OE-CM-cultured MLE12 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref>). Combined with the above observations and the absence of difference in invasion potential, we speculated that the coculture partially activated the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program, and the transformation of lung epithelial cells was still in the early or intermediate stage and had not yet reached the advanced stage, which validated our findings to a certain extent and might correspond to the AAH stage in histology. In addition, the expression of pro-tumor indicators in macrophages (VEGF, MMP9, TGF-Î², and HIF-1Î±) was also higher in S100a4-OE MH-S (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5K</xref>). Next, we detected tumor-inducing factors secreted by these unique macrophages using Cytokine Antibody Array. We noted the production of macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), tumor necrosis factor Î± (TNF-Î±), IL-1Î±, MMP9, and CD40, and these cytokine-related biological processes were mainly involved in the regulation of angiogenesis and immune response (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5L</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5M</xref>).

<title>S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro drove angiogenesis by promoting Cpt1a-mediated fatty acid metabolism</title>
<p>Next, we sought to identify the metabolic and functional changes found in the AAH phase mentioned above. It was demonstrated that the pro-tumor polarization of macrophages is dependent on the accumulation of intracellular lipid droplets as a stable source of fatty acid metabolism (H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). As expected, in S100a4-OE MH-S, we observed an increase in lipid droplet content, as well as enhanced function of mitochondria where fatty acid Î²-oxidation takes place (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). The pro-angiogenic effect of this subset was confirmed by tube formation assay of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Moreover, fatty acid metabolism-related CPT1A and angiogenesis-related ANXA2 were also up-regulated in S100a4-OE MH-S (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>). ANXA2 is considered to be a cellular receptor for plasminogen (PLG), often expressed on the surface of endothelial cells, macrophages, and tumor cells, which activates a cascade of pro-angiogenic factors by promoting the conversion of PLG to plasmin, thereby promoting angiogenesis and tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Semov et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Sharma, 2019</xref>). We found synergistic upregulation of ANXA2 and PLG expression in S100a4-OE MH-S and cocultured HUVEC and MLE12, which may help explain how ANXA2 induction was involved in angiogenesis and malignant transformation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>).</p>

<p>Then we aimed to figure out the contribution of CPT1A to angiogenesis and pro-tumor function in S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro. Following the addition of the CPT1A inhibitor etomoxir (ETO) to S100A4-OE MH-S, the cocultured MLE12 showed restoration of cell proliferation, migration, and ROS production, and the cocultured HUVEC also exhibited decreased tube-forming capacity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E-H</xref>). At the protein expression level, we also identified the recovery of angiogenesis-related proteins in MH-S and cocultured MLE12, as well as a regression in the levels of pro-tumorigenic and M2 markers in MH-S (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6J</xref>). It was also found that the effect of CPT1A may be dependent on the activation of PPAR-Î³ signaling.

<p>Finally, we were dedicated to corroborating the correspondence between the results analyzed in human samples and our observations in the mouse model. A total of 23 human tissues were included in our study to proceed with the aforementioned analysis, including nine normal lung tissues, three AAHs, four AISs, three MIAs, and four IAs, all of which have been pathologically confirmed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining and pathologist assessment (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). The annotation of scRNA-seq profiles yielded 15 cell types, in which macrophages and AT2 cells similarly exhibited significant enrichment of metabolic activities (Figure S6A-C). Malignant cells were extracted from epithelial cells by inferring chromosomal copy number alterations, and GSVA enrichment analysis of malignant epithelial cells was performed across the four pathological stages (Figure S6D and S6E). Along with scMetabolism analysis, the results collectively suggested that human malignant epithelial cells showed relatively active lipid metabolism during the AAH phase, as for the IA phase, glycometabolism and oxidative phosphorylation pathways were obviously enriched (Figure S6F). Besides, the enrichment of macrophage migration and chemotaxis indicated the vital role of macrophages throughout the whole malignant transformation process of LUAD.</p>

<p>In order to figure out whether phenotypically and functionally similar subset of alveolar macrophages also exist in human LUAD precancerous lesions, human alveolar macrophages were further subdivided into four cell subsets, which led us to find that the same was true for human S100A4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7C</xref>). In addition, the activities of palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase and carnitine palmitoyl-transferase were also verified to be elevated during the AAH phase, corresponding to metabolic reactions RE0577C_pos and C160CPT1_pos in the Compass analysis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). For the macrophage phenotype, several functional programs with higher abundance in the AAH phase in the mouse scRNA-seq followed a consistent trend in human data, including angiogenesis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). In terms of gene expression, the expression of fatty acid metabolism-related genes CPT1A and ACOT2 and angiogenesis-related gene ANXA2 in the AAH stage was also in line with expectations (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>). Furthermore, we also noticed greater amounts of S100A4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro in human AAH tissues and verified the correlation between CPT1A and ANXA2 in this subset (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, our scRNA<italic>-</italic>seq data provided a comprehensive resource to investigate cell state changes alongside tumor initiation in a mouse model of spontaneous tumors simulating the oncogenic transformation in clinical LUAD. We extensively mapped the transcriptional landscape of cell subpopulations and switching cell interactions, some of which were essential in reshaping the microenvironment favoring tumor evolution. In the course of precancerous lesions, the transcriptional heterogeneity was gradually enriched, indicating underlying progressive molecular and cellular changes during carcinogenesis. We identified an initiation-associated marker, LDHA; it was suggested that this glycolysis-related gene was significantly upregulated in LUAD and could serve as an independent prognostic indicator of unfavorable overall survival and recurrence-free survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Yu et al., 2018</xref>), illustrating the potentially vital role of metabolic alternations in tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>Based on the understanding that TME can affect the state of epithelial cells, metabolic fluctuations in this context are closely linked to cell phenotype and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Buck, Sowell, Kaech, &amp; Pearce, 2017</xref>; de Visser &amp; Joyce, 2023; J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Macrophages are no exception to this rule; their metabolic profile can be shaped by specific histological TME, and the cellular state is thus activated and exhibits remarkable plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kumar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mazzone, Menga, &amp; Castegna, 2018</xref>). Besides, it has been demonstrated that macrophages contribute to the induction of early lung cancer lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Casanova-Acebes et al., 2021</xref>), and purine metabolism has been confirmed to determine the pro-tumor phenotype of the macrophage population (S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Li et al., 2022</xref>). In our exploration of malignant epithelial cells in the initiation of LUAD, alveolar macrophages were identified as the cell population with which they interacted most strongly. The scRNA-seq approaches enable the resolution of macrophage heterogeneity, assisting us in understanding how these transcriptionally defined subsets connect to macrophage metabolic status and functional phenotypes. Individual macrophage subsets possess distinct metabolic profiles; our analysis highlighted a specific cell subset, which persisted throughout lung carcinogenesis and was observably defined by the expression of S100a4 that had previously not been implicated in tumor-associated alveolar macrophages. The most intriguing finding about this cellular state was that the fatty acid metabolism became active during the AAH phase, accompanied by angiogenetic-like properties. S100A4, which was regarded as an angiogenesis regulator, has been stated to enhance macrophage protumor phenotype by control of fatty acid oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kazakova et al., 2023</xref>; S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). What is more convincing is that S100A4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro with similar characteristics was extended to scRNA-seq profiles of human precancerous AAH lesions. CPT1A was thought to play a crucial role in this metabolic paradigm shift, and CPT1A-mediated fatty acid oxidation has been proved to be conducive to tumor metastasis, radiation resistance, and immune escape (Z. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Liu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tan et al., 2018</xref>; Y.-N. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). We demonstrated the regulation of fatty acid metabolism by CPT1A in S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro as well as the involvement of PPAR-Î³. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism that drives the acquisition of metabolic and functional switching properties specific to this cell state still requires further characterization in the context of precancerous lesions. It has been reported that CD36 is the main effector of the S100A4/PPAR-Î³ pathway, and its mediated fatty acid uptake plays an important role in the tumor-promoting function of macrophages (S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Liu et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>In terms of subset functional phenotype, S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro enriched for fatty acid metabolism held restricted M1-like and phagocytosis capacities at the AAH stage but exhibited M2-like, angiogenesis, and immunosuppressive features, creating a permissive environment for neoplasia. The pro-angiogenic function was dominant and confirmed by tube formation assay of HUVEC, and the regulation of CPT1A on angiogenesis was also revealed. The role of ANXA2 in angiogenesis has been widely recognized, and it may facilitate plasmin production by binding to S100A4 and then trigger angiogenesis and malignant cell transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Grindheim, Saraste, &amp; Vedeler, 2017</xref>; Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Liu, Myrvang, &amp; Dekker, 2015</xref>). Precancerous lesions of LUAD are angiogenic, and pro-angiogenic factors secreted by cells, including S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro, induce endothelial cell sprouting and chemotaxis, leaving the angiogenic switch activated, prompting the formation of new blood vessels on the basis of the original ones to supply oxygen and nutrients to sustain tumor initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kayser et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">van Hinsbergh &amp; Koolwijk, 2008</xref>). Under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1Î± activates numerous factors that contribute to the angiogenic process, including VEGF, which promotes vascular permeability, and MMP9, which breaks down the ECM, promotes endothelial cell migration, and recruits pericytes to provide structural support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Raza, Franklin, &amp; Dudek, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sakurai &amp; Kudo, 2011</xref>). Cytokines secreted into the microenvironment activate macrophages, which subsequently produce angiogenic factors, further promoting angiogenesis (Sica, Schioppa, Mantovani, &amp; Allavena, 2006). Furthermore, TGF-Î² and HGF activate vascular endothelial cells and promote proliferation and migration, as well as induce the expression of pro-angiogenic factors such as VEGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Vimalraj, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Watabe, Takahashi, Pietras, &amp; Yoshimatsu, 2023</xref>). Macrophage-derived TNF-Î± and IL-1Î± lead tumor cells to produce potent angiogenic factors IL-8 and VEGF, which affect angiogenesis and tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Torisu et al., 2000</xref>). MIP2 and CD40 were also identified as pro-tumor factors associated with angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kollmar, Scheuer, Menger, &amp; Schilling, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Murugaiyan, Martin, &amp; Saha, 2007</xref>). It is worth noting that our mining of S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro remains at the precancerous initiation stage, and further experimental designs are needed to verify its specific contribution at more aggressive stages. For example, FACS sorting of the subpopulation at different stages of disease progression, respectively, for precise functional characterization; continuous monitoring of the fluctuation of the above factors in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid at corresponding periods; and intratracheal instillation of primary S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro to observe the pathological progression of precancerous lesions.</p>
<p>Besides, as our previous in vitro results were obtained based on cell lines, we will optimize the experimental conditions to achieve coculture of primary macrophage subset and epithelial cells and establish transgenic mouse models for in vivo validation.</p>
<p>With the elaborate resolution of TME, macrophage-related therapy is considered to be promising. So far, macrophage-targeted therapy has demonstrated clinical efficacy in Gaucherâs disease and advanced hematological malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barton et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ossenkoppele et al., 2013</xref>). In lung cancer, an attempt to enhance anti-PD-1 therapy in NSCLC by depleting myeloid-derived suppressor cells with gemcitabine was prematurely terminated because of insufficient data collected; another clinical trial of TQB2928 monoclonal antibody promoting macrophage phagocytosis of tumor cells in combination with a third-generation EGFR TKI for advanced NSCLC is now recruiting. Moreover, preclinical studies on macrophage-targeted therapy combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors are being extensively conducted in NSCLC, and it was suggested that blockade of purine metabolism can reverse macrophage immunosuppression, and a synergetic effect can be achieved when combined with anti-PD-L1 therapy, which inspired the direction of our early intervention strategies (H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wang, Arulraj, Anbari, &amp; Popel, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Yang et al., 2025</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, our results provided the unique patterns of cellular components during the initiation process of LUAD and gave evidence that S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro enhances the function of pro-angiogenesis by promoting fatty acid metabolism, thereby accelerating the process of precancerous lesions. Early intervention in solid cancers at the precancer stage may effectively prevent their progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Prieto et al., 2023</xref>). In the cascade of tumor initiation, AAH is represented as a probable forerunner of LUAD, serving as a potential hub in carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mori, Rao, Popper, Cagle, &amp; Fraire, 2001</xref>). On the basis of the newly identified pro-tumor subpopulation and relevant metabolic and functional elements, the development of novel immunotherapies targeting the immunometabolism will provide alternative choices for interventions at the AAH stage, paving the way for potential benefits for patients.</p>

<title>Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis and identification of marker genes</title>
<p>Raw gene expression matrices were generated per sample using CellRanger (version 4.0.0). These matrices were then combined by R (version 4.0.5) and converted into a Seurat data object using the Seurat R package (version 4.3.0.1). We excluded cells based on any one of the following criteria: (1) more than 10,000 or fewer than 500 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs); (2) more than 5,000 or fewer than 300 expressed genes; (3) over 10% UMIs that were derived from the mitochondrial genome; (4) genes that were expressed in fewer than 10 cells. Subsequently, we carried out downstream analyses by the Seurat workflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hao et al., 2021</xref>) as described below: Firstly, we normalized the counts on the filtered matrix for each gene to the total library size by the âNormalizeDataâ function. Secondly, we employed the âFindVariableGenesâ function to identify the most highly variable genes for unsupervised clustering. Thirdly, these highly variable genes were centered to a mean of zero and were scaled by the standard deviation by the âScaleDataâ function of Seurat. Fourthly, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed by the function âRunPCAâ. The âRunHarmonyâ function was used to integrate samples and remove batch effects. The âFindClustersâ function was used to calculate the clusters of the cells. UMAP plots were used to visualize clusters of cells localized in the graph-based clusters by the âRunUMAPâ function. Markers for each cluster were identified by finding differentially expressed genes between cells from the individual cluster versus cells from all other clusters by the âFindAllMarkersâ function.</p>

Firstly, we selected 100 differentially expressed genes for each of the 13 cell type clusters and the top 100 genes for each of the top 20 components in harmony reduction. Next, we discretized expression per gene into 10 bins. Considering the differences in the number of cells across samples, we subsampled 100 cells from each stage 500 times and calculated the median NMI across each within-stage sampled pair. NMI was calculated between each pair of cells x and y by first calculating the mutual information (<xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. 1</xref>) and then normalizing it by the entropy of each cell (<xref rid="eqn2" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. 2</xref>).

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, the authors have leveraged Single-cell RNA sequencing of the various stages of evolution of lung adenocarcinoma to identify the population of macrophages that contribute to tumor progression. They show that S100a4+ alveolar macrophages, active in fatty acid metabolic activity, such as palmitic acid metabolism, seem to drive atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) stage. These macrophages also seem to induce angiogenesis promoting tumor growth. Similar types of macrophage infiltration were demonstrated in the progression of the human lung adenocarcinomas.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>The authors have satisfactorily addressed my main concerns.</p>
<p>The only weakness is that infusion of S100a4+ macrophages seem not to affect tumor growth when introduced to the intratracheal route. This negative result somewhat diminishes the significance of the study.</p>
<p>Overall, the revised manuscript is significantly improved.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, the authors have leveraged Single-cell RNA sequencing of the various stages of the evolution of lung adenocarcinoma to identify the population of macrophages that contribute to tumor progression. They show that S100a4+ alveolar macrophages, active in fatty acid metabolic activity, such as palmitic acid metabolism, seem to drive the atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) stage. These macrophages also seem to induce angiogenesis promoting tumor growth. Similar types of macrophage infiltration were demonstrated in the progression of the human lung adenocarcinomas.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Identification of the metabolic pathways that promote angiogenesis-dependent progression of lung adenocarcinomas from early atypical changes to aggressive invasive phenotype could lead to the development of strategies to abort tumor progression.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful for your constructive comments. These comments are very helpful for revising and improving our paper and have provided important guiding significance to our study. We have made revisions according to your comments and have provided point-by-point responses to your concerns.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Can the authors demonstrate what are the functional specialization of the S100a4+ alveolar macrophages that promote the progression of the AAH to the more aggressive phenotype? What are the factors produced by these unique macrophages that induce tumor progression and invasiveness?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments. To more comprehensively characterize the functional specialization of the S100a4<sup>+</sup> alveolar macrophages, we expanded the macrophage functional gene sets based on relevant literature and databases and performed enrichment analysis. The results showed that all stages of precancerous progression presented activated states of angiogenesis, M2-like and immunosuppressive functions relative to the normal stage (Figure 4B). As we have demonstrated, S100a4<sup>+</sup> alveolar macrophages predominantly exert pro-angiogenic functions during the AAH phase and may be more biased towards M2-like polarization and immunosuppression during further disease progression. Consistently, S100A4<sup>+</sup> subset population of macrophages has been proved to exhibit a M2-like phenotype with immunosuppressive properties in tumor progression [PMID: 34145030]. In addition, S100A4 has been reported to be associated with macrophage M2 polarization, angiogenesis, and tumorigenesis [PMID: 39664586, 36895491, 30221056, 32117590]. The functional status of human S100A4<sup>+</sup> alveolar macrophages is basically the same. The relevant description was added to the Results section as follows: âIt was revealed that the capacities for angiogenesis, M2-like polarization, and immunosuppression were found to be stronger in AAH or other precancerous stages relative to the normal stage (Figure 4B). The pro-angiogenic function predominated in the AAH stage, while M2-like and immunosuppressive functions were more prominent in the subsequent precancerous progression.â (page 11, line 262). Our study puts more attention on the functional phenotypic changes of S100a4<sup>+</sup> alveolar macrophages during the progression from normal to AAH to explain the role of this subpopulation in tumor initiation, and similarly, preliminary coculture experiments could only indicate its role in the early malignant transformation of epithelial cells. In further experimental validation, we will confirm the above functions of the S100a4<sup>+</sup> alveolar macrophages promoting the progression of AAH to the more aggressive phenotype by in vitro and in vivo experiments. We have extended the limitations and potential experimental designs to the Discussion section as follows: âIt is worth noting that our mining of S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro remains at the precancerous initiation stage, and further experimental designs are needed to verify its specific contribution at more aggressive stages. For example, FACS sorting of the subpopulation at different stages of disease progression, respectively, for precise functional characterization;â (page 19, line 468).</p>
<p>For the factors produced by these unique macrophages during induction of malignant transformation, we assayed culture supernatant of S100a4-OE alveolar macrophages for secreted functional cytokines. The results showed up-regulation of MIP-2, HGF, TNFÎ±, IL-1a, CD27, CT-1, MMP9, 4-1BB, and CD40, and GO enrichment showed angiogenesis and tumorigenesis-related processes (Figure 5L and 5M). We have added the detailed content to the Results section as follows: âNext, we detected tumor-inducing factors secreted by these unique macrophages using Cytokine Antibody Array. We noted the production of macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), tumor necrosis factor Î± (TNF-Î±), IL-1Î±, MMP9, and CD40, and these cytokine-related biological processes were mainly involved in the regulation of angiogenesis and immune response (Figure 5L and 5M).â (page 13, line 319). Furthermore, changes in these cytokines during subsequent invasive tumor progression will also be continuously monitored. The description in the Discussion section have been added as: âFurthermore, TGF-Î² and HGF activate vascular endothelial cells and promote proliferation and migration, as well as induce the expression of pro-angiogenic factors such as VEGF (Vimalraj, 2022; Watabe, Takahashi, Pietras, &amp; Yoshimatsu, 2023). Macrophage-derived TNF-Î± and IL-1Î± lead tumor cells to produce potent angiogenic factors IL-8 and VEGF, which affect angiogenesis and tumor growth (Torisu et al., 2000). MIP2 and CD40 were also identified as pro-tumor factors associated with angiogenesis (Kollmar, Scheuer, Menger, &amp; Schilling, 2006; Murugaiyan, Martin, &amp; Saha, 2007)â¦continuous monitoring of the fluctuation of the above factors in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid at corresponding periods;â (page 19, line 461).</p>

<p>(2) Angiogenic factors are not only produced by the S100a4+ cells but also by pericytes and potentially by the tumor cells themselves. Then, how do these factors aberrantly trigger tumor angiogenesis that drives tumor growth?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. In our study, we detected up-regulation of angiogenic factors HIF-1Î±, VEGF, MMP9, and TGF-Î² (Figure 5K), and elevation of secreted HGF, IL-1Î±, and TNF-Î± (Figure 5L). We provide a detailed description of how these factors are involved in angiogenesis-related tumorigenesis to varying degrees in the Discussion section: âPrecancerous lesions of LUAD are angiogenic, and pro-angiogenic factors secreted by cells, including S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro, induce endothelial cell sprouting and chemotaxis, leaving the angiogenic switch activated, prompting the formation of new blood vessels on the basis of the original ones to supply oxygen and nutrients to sustain tumor initiation (Chen et al., 2024; Kayser et al., 2003; van Hinsbergh &amp; Koolwijk, 2008). Under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1Î± activates numerous factors that contribute to the angiogenic process, including VEGF, which promotes vascular permeability, and MMP9, which breaks down the ECM, promotes endothelial cell migration, and recruits pericytes to provide structural support (Raza, Franklin, &amp; Dudek, 2010; Sakurai &amp; Kudo, 2011). Cytokines secreted into the microenvironment activate macrophages, which subsequently produce angiogenic factors, further promoting angiogenesis (Sica, Schioppa, Mantovani, &amp; Allavena, 2006). Furthermore, TGF-Î² and HGF activate vascular endothelial cells and promote proliferation and migration, as well as induce the expression of pro-angiogenic factors such as VEGF (Vimalraj, 2022; Watabe, Takahashi, Pietras, &amp; Yoshimatsu, 2023). Macrophage-derived TNF-Î± and IL-1Î± lead tumor cells to produce potent angiogenic factors IL-8 and VEGF, which affect angiogenesis and tumor growth (Torisu et al., 2000)â¦â (page 19, line 449).</p>

<p>(3) It is not clear how abnormal fatty acid uptake by the macrophages drives the progression of tumors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment, which coincides with our mechanistic exploration. The metabolic status of macrophages influences their pro-tumor properties, and lipid metabolism has been shown to determine the functional polarization of macrophages [PMID: 29111350]. In this study, we observed more accumulation of lipid droplets in S100a4-OE MH-S, demonstrating enhanced cellular fatty acid uptake (Figure 6A). The pro-angiogenic ability of S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro was confirmed by tube formation assay and cytokine assay (Figure 6B and 5M). Cpt1a was thought to play a crucial role in the metabolic paradigm shift of S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro, we therefore performed functional rescue experiments by inhibiting CPT1A expression in S100a4-OE MH-S by addition of etomoxir (ETO). After culture with conditioned medium of MH-S, the proliferation, migration, and ROS production of MLE12 cells were all restored to lower levels (Figure 6E-G). In addition, ETO treatment significantly reversed the angiogenesis, which supported the regulation of fatty acid metabolism on macrophage function (Figure 6H). Immunoblotting also revealed restoration of expression in related proteins (Figure 6I and 6J), these findings reinforced previous analyses of the association of fatty acid metabolism with pro-angiogenesis and M2-like function in S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro. The involvement of PPAR-Î³ in the regulation of metabolic state was also confirmed. Taken together, we suggest that S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro promotes fatty acid metabolism through the CPT1A-PPAR-Î³ axis, enhances its ability to promote angiogenesis, and thus drives tumor occurrence. The corresponding contents were added in the Results section S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro drove angiogenesis by promoting Cpt1a-mediated fatty acid metabolism (page 13, line 327) and Discussion section: âWe demonstrated the regulation of fatty acid metabolism by CPT1A in S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro as well as the involvement of PPAR-Î³. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism that drives the acquisition of metabolic and functional switching properties specific to this cell state still requires further characterization in the context of precancerous lesions. It has been reported that CD36 is the main effector of the S100A4/PPAR-Î³ pathway, and its mediated fatty acid uptake plays an important role in the tumor-promoting function of macrophages (S. Liu et al., 2021).â (page 18, line 433).</p>

<p>(4) Does infusion or introduction of S100a4+ polarized macrophages promote the progression of AAH to a more aggressive phenotype?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. We performed intratracheal instillation of lentivirus-infected S100a4-OE MH-S and culture supernatant in A/J and BALB/c mice, respectively, but no aggressive pathological phenotype was observed so far, possibly due to the lack of time required for lesions or the imperfection of experimental conditions. We will continue to explore the instillation dose and frequency for long-term monitoring and will simultaneously evaluate the availability of primary alveolar macrophages. We have discussed as follows: âIt is worth noting that our mining of S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro remains at the precancerous initiation stage, and further experimental designs are needed to verify its specific contribution at more aggressive stagesâ¦and intratracheal instillation of primary S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro to observe the pathological progression of precancerous lesions.â (page 19, line 468).</p>

<p>(5) How does Anxa and Ramp1 induction in inflammatory cells induce angiogenesis and tumor progression?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. ANXA2 is an important member of annexin family of proteins expressed on surface of endothelial cells, macrophages, and tumor cells [PMID: 30125343]. ANXA2 was reported to regulate neoangiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment and most likely due to overproduction of plasmin. As a well-established receptor for plasminogen (PLG) and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) on the cell surface, ANXA2 converts PLG into plasmin. Plasmin plays a critical role in the activation of cascade of inactive proteolytic enzymes such as metalloproteases (pro-MMPs) and latent growth factors (VEGF and bFGF) [PMID: 12963694, 11487021]. Activated forms of MMPs and VEGF then induce extracellular matrix remodeling facilitating angiogenesis and tumor development [PMID: 15788416]. Sharma et al. suggested administration of ANXA2-antibody inhibited tumor angiogenesis and growth concurrent with plasmin generation [PMID: 22044461], the role of ANXA2 in plasmin activation thus explains itâs importance in tumor-related angiogenesis. We verified the simultaneous upregulation of ANXA2 and PLG in S100a4-OE MH-S and cocultured HUVEC and MLE12 by immunoblotting (Figure 6D). The relevant description was added to the Results section as follows: âANXA2 is considered to be a cellular receptor for plasminogen (PLG), often expressed on the surface of endothelial cells, macrophages, and tumor cells, which activates a cascade of pro-angiogenic factors by promoting the conversion of PLG to plasmin, thereby promoting angiogenesis and tumor progression (Semov et al., 2005; Sharma, 2019). We found synergistic upregulation of ANXA2 and PLG expression in S100a4-OE MH-S and cocultured HUVEC and MLE12, which may help explain how ANXA2 induction was involved in angiogenesis and malignant transformation (Figure 6D).â (page 14, line 338).</p>
<p>Recent studies showed that S100A4 is associated with tumor angiogenesis and progression by the interaction with ANXA2. ANXA2 is the endothelial receptor for S100A4 and that their interaction triggers the functional activity directly related to pathological properties of S100A4, including angiogenesis [PMID: 18608216]. It has been proved that S100A4 induces angiogenesis through interaction with ANXA2 and accelerated plasmin formation [PMID: 15788416, 25303710]. In addition, it is generally believed that ANXA2 participates in malignant cell transformation [PMID: 28867585]. Therefore, we speculate that ANXA2 may promote plasmin production by binding to S100A4, thus promoting angiogenesis and tumor initiation, and we have discussed accordingly: âThe role of ANXA2 in angiogenesis has been widely recognized, and it may facilitate plasmin production by binding to S100A4 and then trigger angiogenesis and malignant cell transformation (Grindheim, Saraste, &amp; Vedeler, 2017; Y. Liu, Myrvang, &amp; Dekker, 2015).â (page 18, line 446).</p>
<p>In our study, the primary target of our validation was ANXA2 rather than RAMP1, even though its relationship with angiogenesis had been established [PMID: 20596610], so we weakened the relevant description in the manuscript.</p>

<p>(6) For the in vitro studies the authors might consider using primary tumor cells and not cell lines.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion, which was in our initial experimental plan. However, since S100A4 is not expressed on the cell surface, FACS sorting of primary subset of alveolar macrophages presents technical limitations. We have also attempted overexpression in primary macrophages, but the current overexpression efficiency and cell status are not sufficient to support a subsequent series of experiments. For all these reasons, the alveolar macrophage cell line MH-S and the lung epithelial cell line MLE12 were selected to ensure the consistency and stability of the coculture system.</p>
<p>In addition, we are optimizing the experimental conditions to achieve coculture of primary macrophages and epithelial cells, and will also establish transgenic mouse models for simultaneous validation. The Discussion has been added as: âBesides, as our previous in vitro results were obtained based on cell lines, we will optimize the experimental conditions to achieve coculture of primary macrophage subset and epithelial cells and establish transgenic mouse models for in vivo validation.â (page 19, line 475).</p>

<p>This work provides an important contribution to our further understanding of the role of macrophages in lung precancer/lung cancer evolution. I have several comments regarding how the manuscript could be improved:</p>
<p>Introduction:</p>
<p>The authors may consider citing the following work to enhance their work:</p>
<p>(1) At line 78, where they talk about precancerous lesions being reversible, they should cite recent work on this in lung cancer: Teixeria et al 2019 PMID: 30664780, and Pennycuik et al 2020 PMID: 32690541.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) At line 96, where they talk about developing medicines for precancerous lesions, the authors should cite comprehensive review articles where this concept has been discussed in depth, for example: Reynolds et al 2023 PMID: 37067191, and Asad et al 2012 PMID: 23151603.</p>

<p>Results:</p>
<p>(1) Line 142, the authors say &quot;mice were feed for 12-16 months&quot; - do they mean the mice were maintained for 12-16 months?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. To best mimic the process of human lung cancer development, A/J mice with the highest incidence of spontaneous lung tumors, which increases substantially with age, were selected. The corresponding description has been modified as: âA/J mice have the highest incidence of spontaneous lung tumors among various mouse strains, and this probability significantly increased with age (Landau, Wang, Yang, Ding, &amp; Yang, 1998). To more comprehensively mirror the tumor initiation and progression process of human lung cancer, A/J mice were maintained for 12-16 months for spontaneous lesions, which resulted in three recognizable precancerous lesions in the lung.â (page 7, line 138).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Line 143, the authors claim to have seen &quot;three recognizable precancerous and cancerous lesions in the lung&quot; but then, they only go on to describe AAH, adenoma, and AIS, lesions which are all commonly recognized as precancers. What was the cancerous (i.e. invasive) lesion they identified?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. We apologize for this misstatement and will include cancerous lesions from mice for simultaneous analysis in subsequent study. The corresponding description has been revised as: âTo more comprehensively mirror the tumor initiation and progression process of human lung cancer, A/J mice were maintained for 12-16 months for spontaneous lesions, which resulted in three recognizable precancerous lesions in the lung.â (page 7, line 140).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Line 172, the authors say that the &quot;proportion of cell types across the four stages showed a dynamic trend&quot; ... what does this mean? A trend towards what exactly?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. Our intention was to highlight heterogeneous changes, and the description has been corrected: âThe proportion of cell types across the four stages showed irregular changes, while transcriptional homogeneity was reduced with precancerous progression, illustrating the importance of heterogeneity in tumorigenesis and also proving the reliability of the sampling in this study.â (page 8, line 169).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Line 193, the authors say cell communication &quot;showed a tendency to malignant transformation.&quot; What does this statement mean? If they mean more cell communication occurred in the malignant lesions than the precancerous, then there is a flaw in the logic because AAH, adenoma, and AIS are all precancerous lesions. What is the sequence of evolution to malignancy the authors are assuming? Do they mean AIS is a more advanced stage of precancerous malignancy than adenoma, and adenoma is more advanced than AAH (albeit they are all precancerous lesions).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments. The malignant transformation process involves multiple stages, and histological AAH is regarded as the beginning of this process. Precancerous lesions of LUAD in mice are believed to develop stepwise from AAH, adenoma, to AIS, even if the process is not necessarily completely consistent [PMID: 11235908, 32707077]. What we meant to describe was a gradual increase in the frequency of cell communication during this process. The corresponding description has been modified as: âAt the evolutionary stages of precancerous LUAD, despite possible sample heterogeneity and other interference, we observed increased interactions between epithelial cells and surrounding stromal and immune cells in the microenvironment, indicating gradually frequent cell-cell communication during this processâ (page 8, line 187).</p>

<p>(6) Line 284 when referencing the cell line here, the author should make it clear in the text that cells were transfected with a construct expressing S100A4. If possible, would be good to understand if the level of S100A4 expression achieved is less, similar, or greater than that seen in these cells in vivo.</p>

<p>Thank you for your suggestion. We have amended the text to make it clear: âS100a4-overexpressed (OE) alveolar macrophages were established by transfection of the mS100a4 vector into the murine MH-S cell line, and empty vector was transfected as negative control (NC) cellsâ (page 12, line 284), and it will be clarified in the following exploration whether the level of S100a4 expression achieved is less, similar, or greater than that seen in these cells in vivo.</p>

<p>(8) Line 324 - the authors claim they have demonstrated that the macrophages promote angiogenesis through upregulation of fatty acid metabolism. Whilst they may have demonstrated changes in fatty acid metabolism, no experiments assessing the effect of the macrophages in angiogenesis assays are included in the paper, so the authors should modify this statement.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments. The relevant experiments have been added based on your suggestions. Firstly, we demonstrated in vitro the up-regulation of fatty acid metabolism in S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro and uncovered the contribution of CPT1A to angiogenesis and cell transformation through rescue experiments; Then, HUVEC tube formation assay and cytokine assay confirmed the pro-angiogenic effect of S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro. We have added the Results section S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro drove angiogenesis by promoting Cpt1a-mediated fatty acid metabolism (page 13, line 327) and added the Discussion as: âWe demonstrated the regulation of fatty acid metabolism by CPT1A in S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro as well as the involvement of PPAR-Î³. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism that drives the acquisition of metabolic and functional switching properties specific to this cell state still requires further characterization in the context of precancerous lesions. It has been reported that CD36 is the main effector of the S100A4/PPAR-Î³ pathway, and its mediated fatty acid uptake plays an important role in the tumor-promoting function of macrophages (S. Liu et al., 2021).â (page 18, line 433).</p>

<p>(9) Regarding angiogenesis in precancerous lesions and the role of macrophages in this process: is there even any evidence that precancerous LUAD lesions are angiogenic? Don't these lesions typically have a lepidic pattern, wherein the cancer cells merely co-opt pre-existing alveolar capillaries without the need to generate new vessels?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments. As you mentioned, pathologically, precancerous LUAD lesions mainly show a lepidic growth pattern, characterized by the growth of type II alveolar epithelial cells along pre-existing alveolar walls [PMID: 29690599], but this does not mean that this process does not require the formation of new blood vessels. There are multiple patterns of tumor angiogenesis. Some studies have shown that increased angiogenesis can be observed in certain precancerous lesions, which suggests that angiogenesis may play an important role in the early stages of lung cancer development. Microvessel density (MVD) was increased in AAH and AIS compared to normal lung tissue, indicating that new blood vessels are forming to provide essential nutrients and oxygen to tumor cells to support their growth. The expression level of pro-angiogenic factors such as VEGF is usually upregulated, which promotes the formation of new blood vessels by stimulating endothelial cell proliferation and migration. [PMID: 39570802, 14568684] In addition, the infiltration of macrophages into precancerous areas in response to cytokines has been shown to trigger a tumor angiogenic switch and maintain tumor-associated continuous angiogenesis [PMID: 35022204]. Our in vitro tube formation assay and cytokine assay also demonstrated angiogenesis induced by S100a4<sup>+</sup> alv-macro. We have discussed the relevant content (page 19, line 449) and will provide more sufficient evidence in future work.</p>

<p>Discussion:</p>
<p>Perhaps the authors can cite any literature pertaining to the current wave of anti-macrophage therapies currently being tested in the clinic. Moreover, have these therapies been tested in lung cancer, and if so, what were the results?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. At present, the clinical trials of anti-macrophage therapies mainly involve Gaucher's disease and hematological malignancies, and the two tests related to lung cancer have no valid data posted. Nevertheless, there are some preclinical studies worth learning from. We have cited the relevant literature and discussed in detail: âWith the elaborate resolution of TME, macrophage-related therapy is considered to be promising. So far, macrophage-targeted therapy has demonstrated clinical efficacy in Gaucher's disease and advanced hematological malignancies (Barton et al., 1991; Ossenkoppele et al., 2013). In lung cancer, an attempt to enhance anti-PD-1 therapy in NSCLC by depleting myeloid-derived suppressor cells with gemcitabine was prematurely terminated because of insufficient data collected; another clinical trial of TQB2928 monoclonal antibody promoting macrophage phagocytosis of tumor cells in combination with a third-generation EGFR TKI for advanced NSCLC is now recruiting. Moreover, preclinical studies on macrophage-targeted therapy combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors are being extensively conducted in NSCLC, and it was suggested that blockade of purine metabolism can reverse macrophage immunosuppression, and a synergetic effect can be achieved when combined with anti-PD-L1 therapy, which inspired the direction of our early intervention strategies (H. Wang, Arulraj, Anbari, &amp; Popel, 2024; Yang et al., 2025).â (page 20, line 479).</p>

<p>Further description of how lesions were classified as precancerous (AAH, adenoma, AIS) or cancerous by the pathologist should be defined (or cite appropriate reference where this is described).</p>
