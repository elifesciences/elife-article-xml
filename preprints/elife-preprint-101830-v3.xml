<title>Abstract</title><p>Chronic inflammation via dysregulation of T cell immune responses is critically involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Improving the balance between proinflammatory T cells and anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells (Tregs) may be an attractive approach for treating atherosclerosis. Although C-C chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) has been shown to mediate the recruitment of T cells to inflamed tissues, its role in atherosclerosis is unclear. Here, we show that genetic deletion of CCR4 in hypercholesterolemic mice accelerates the development of early atherosclerotic lesions characterized by an inflammatory plaque phenotype. This was associated with the augmentation of proinflammatory T helper type 1 (Th1) cell responses in peripheral lymphoid tissues, para-aortic lymph nodes, and atherosclerotic aorta. Mechanistically, CCR4 deficiency in Tregs impaired their suppressive function and tended to inhibit their migration to the atherosclerotic aorta, and subsequently augmented Th1 cell-mediated immune responses through defective regulation of dendritic cell function, which accelerated aortic inflammation and atherosclerotic lesion development. Thus, we revealed a previously unrecognized role for CCR4 in controlling the early stage of atherosclerosis via Treg-dependent regulation of proinflammatory T cell responses. Our data suggest that CCR4 is an important negative regulator of atherosclerosis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Severe cardiovascular diseases, including ischemic heart disease and stroke, occur in patients with atherosclerosis and are major causes of mortality worldwide. Despite state-of-the-art intensive treatment, patients at high risk of atherosclerotic diseases have considerable residual risk, which could be partly related to vascular inflammatory responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> Notably, recent clinical trials have provided evidence that anti-inflammatory therapies could be potentially novel approaches for preventing cardiovascular diseases in patients with the past disease history, although overall mortality has not improved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Chronic aortic inflammation via T cell-mediated immune dysregulation has been shown to be critically involved in the development of atherosclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> Single-cell proteomic and transcriptomic approaches have revealed that activated and differentiated T cells are the major immune cells infiltrating human carotid artery plaques,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> indicating the involvement of T cell-mediated immunoinflammatory responses in atherosclerotic plaque development in humans. A recent clinical trial provided evidence for the increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events in cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> confirming the critical role of effector T cell (Teff) immune responses in the development of human atherosclerotic disease. Teffs including T helper type 1 (Th1) cells play a proatherogenic role by producing proinflammatory cytokines including interferon (IFN)-Î³.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> A recent translational study demonstrated that anti-CXC-motif-chemokine receptor 3 autoantibodies, which reflect Th1 cell-mediated responses, can be a novel biomarker and an inflammatory risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality beyond traditional risk factors, indicating the possible proatherogenic role of Th1 cells in humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> On the other hand, several subsets of regulatory T cells (Tregs) including forkhead box P3 (Foxp3)-expressing Tregs play an anti-atherogenic role by suppressing Teff-mediated immunoinflammatory responses or reducing plasma atherogenic lipoprotein levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> A number of approaches to dampening proatherogenic Th1 cell responses or augmenting atheroprotective Treg responses have been reported to be effective for the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis in experimental mouse models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> Despite accumulating evidence for the critical role of the Th1 cell/Treg balance in atherosclerosis, how the balance of these T cell populations is regulated in lymphoid tissues and atherosclerotic lesions to control atherosclerosis is unclear.</p>
<p>Various immune cells including T cells and monocytes migrate to the aorta via interactions between chemokines and their specific chemokine receptors and are critically involved in the process of atherosclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> However, few reports have identified a chemokine system that prevents atherosclerosis by improving the Th1 cell/Treg balance in lymphoid tissues and atherosclerotic lesions. C-C chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) is expressed on several T cell subsets, including T helper type 2 (Th2) cells, T helper type 17 (Th17) cells, skin-homing T cells, and Tregs, but not on proatherogenic Th1 cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> CCR4 is a highly specific receptor for two CC chemokine ligands CCL17 (thymus- and activation-regulated chemokine) and CCL22 (macrophage-derived chemokine)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> which were shown to be expressed in mesenteric lymph nodes (LNs) in a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> and lung tissues affected by allergic airway inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> These chemokines play a role in guiding CCR4<sup>+</sup> T cells to the inflammatory sites with abundant expression of these chemokines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> Previous experimental studies have suggested that the CCL17/CCL22â CCR4 axes protect against inflammatory autoimmune diseases partly by promoting Treg accumulation in target tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> The expression of CCL17 and CCL22 was also observed in human and mouse atherosclerotic lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> Although the disruption of the CCL17/CCL22âCCR4 axes did not affect the development of advanced atherosclerotic lesions or the proportion of Tregs in peripheral lymphoid tissues in atherosclerosis-prone mice fed a high-cholesterol diet,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> its effect on the early stage of atherosclerosis and Treg responses has not been investigated.</p>
<p>Here, we investigated the role of CCR4 in the development of early atherosclerotic lesions and the underlying mechanisms in CCR4-deficient (<italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) mice on an apolipoprotein E-deficient (<italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) background fed a standard chow diet, with a particular focus on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell immune responses.</p>

<title>CCR4 is predominantly expressed on CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs, and the ligands CCL17 and CCL22 are expressed in peripheral LNs and atherosclerotic lesions</title>
<p>To evaluate the expression levels of CCR4 on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells under normocholesterolemic or hypercholesterolemic conditions, we performed flow cytometric analysis of peripheral LNs, spleen, and para-aortic LNs from wild-type, <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, and <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Notably, CCR4 expression was expressed on approximately 15-25% of CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs from wild-type or <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1A through 1C</xref>), while CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup> non-Tregs from these mice expressed CCR4 at markedly lower levels, suggesting that CCR4 is predominantly expressed on CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs and that hypercholesterolemia does not affect CCR4 expression. We also examined CCR4 expression on CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs in the atherosclerotic aorta of <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, and consistently found that CCR4 expression in CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs was much higher than that in CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup> non-Tregs (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>As CCL17 and CCL22, known as specific ligands for CCR4, are highly expressed by dendritic cells (DCs) in LNs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> we examined their expression in the peripheral LNs of wild-type, <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, and <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice by immunohistochemistry. As expected, clear expression of these chemokines was observed in the peripheral LNs of wild-type, <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, and <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). We also examined the expression of CCL17 and CCL22 in the aorta of these mice by immunohistochemistry. CCL17 expression was detected in the atherosclerotic lesions of <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, and some lesional MOMA-2<sup>+</sup> macrophages expressed this chemokine (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>). However, CCL17 expression was not detected in the aorta of wild-type mice without atherosclerotic plaques (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>). Another ligand CCL22 was modestly expressed in atherosclerotic lesions and partially colocalized with lesional MOMA-2<sup>+</sup> macrophages in <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> or <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, while its expression was not detected in the aorta of wild-type mice (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, these findings suggest that Tregs may migrate to peripheral LNs and atherosclerotic lesions partly via the CCL17/CCL22âCCR4 axes under hypercholesterolemia.</p>

<title>CCR4 deficiency accelerates the development of early atherosclerotic lesions characterized by an inflammatory plaque phenotype</title>

<p>To determine the effect of CCR4 deficiency on plaque components, we performed immunohistochemical studies of atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic sinus. Notably, compared with those of <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, the atherosclerotic lesions of <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice showed a 20% increase in macrophage accumulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) and a marked 42% increase in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). In addition, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs in atherosclerotic lesions using an anti-Foxp3 antibody. However, few Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs were found within the plaques of <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> or <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (data not shown). The proportion of collagen in the aortic sinus plaques of <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice was significantly lower than that in the aortic sinus plaques of <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). These findings on atherosclerotic plaque size and components collectively suggest that CCR4 plays a role in preventing the development of early atherosclerotic lesions and inducing a less inflammatory plaque phenotype. To further evaluate aortic immunoinflammatory responses, we analyzed the mRNA expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and transcription factors specific for Tregs or helper T cell subsets in atherosclerotic aorta by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. The mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines (<italic>Il1b</italic> and <italic>Il6</italic>), Th1-related <italic>Tbx21</italic>, and Th17-related <italic>Rorc</italic> was markedly upregulated in the aorta of <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, indicating augmented proatherogenic immune responses in the atherosclerotic aorta (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). The mRNA expression of the Treg-specific transcription factor <italic>Foxp3</italic> was undetectable.</p>
<p>Collectively, these data suggest that CCR4 deficiency promotes the accumulation of inflammatory cells and proinflammatory immune responses in the aorta, leading to augmented development of early atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic root.</p>

<p>Similar results were obtained for normocholesterolemic wild-type mice (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 4A and 4B</xref>), suggesting that the expansion of Tregs and effector memory T cells in <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice is independent of hypercholesterolemia. We evaluated the proliferative capacity of CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs and CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup> non-Tregs by analyzing Ki-67 expression using flow cytometry and found that the proportions of Ki-67-positive Tregs and non-Tregs were markedly higher in the peripheral LNs and spleen of <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice than in those of <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>).

These data indicate that the increased numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs and CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup> non-Tregs in peripheral LNs are due to their enhanced proliferative capacity but not to their promoted development in the thymus. We also analyzed other immune cells in the spleen of <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice by flow cytometry and found no major differences in the proportions or activation-associated molecule expression between the 2 groups, except for CD86 expression on DCs which was upregulated in <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine the activation and function of CCR4-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs, we investigated the expression of their activation- and function-associated molecules in the peripheral LNs of 8- or 18-week-old <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> or <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice by flow cytometry.

<p>In contrast to the results on CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs, the expression of activation marker CTLA-4 in peripheral LN CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup> non-Tregs was higher in <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice than in <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, although the expression of another activation marker CD103 was not altered by CCR4 deficiency (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). We analyzed the mRNA expression of <italic>Ccr4</italic>, activation-associated molecules (<italic>Ctla4</italic>, <italic>Cd44</italic>, <italic>Cd69</italic>, and <italic>Cd103</italic>), and representative chemokine receptors (<italic>Ccr1</italic>, <italic>Ccr5</italic>, <italic>Ccr6</italic>, <italic>Ccr7</italic>, <italic>Ccr8</italic>, <italic>Cxcr3</italic>, and <italic>Cx3cr1</italic>) in splenic non-Tregs by quantitative reverse transcription PCR.

We found a marked increase in the mRNA expression of activation-associated molecules (<italic>Ctla4</italic>, <italic>Cd44</italic>, and <italic>Cd103</italic>) in splenic non-Tregs from <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). We also observed upregulated mRNA expression of various chemokine receptors including Th1-related <italic>Ccr1</italic>, <italic>Cxcr3</italic>, and <italic>Cx3cr1</italic>, Th2-related <italic>Ccr8</italic>, and Th17-related <italic>Ccr6</italic> in splenic non-Tregs from <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 7B</xref>), indicating that CCR4 deficiency may promote the activation and expansion of helper T cells and facilitate their migration to atherosclerotic lesions.

<p>Considering the accelerated early atherosclerosis observed in <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, these results indicate that augmented Teff immune responses may affect atherosclerosis more strongly than the increase in Tregs in peripheral lymphoid tissues.</p>

Flow cytometric analysis of helper T cell subsets in para-aortic LNs revealed that the fractions of IFN-Î³-producing Th1 cells, IL-4-producing Th2 cells, and IL-17-producing Th17 cells were significantly higher in <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice than in <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, suggesting augmented proinflammatory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell immune responses by CCR4 deficiency (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>).</p>
<p>We explored the infiltration of T-box expressed in T cells (T-bet)-expressing Th1 cells, GATA3-expressing Th2 cells, and retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gamma t (RORÎ³t)-expressing Th17 cells in atherosclerotic aorta by flow cytometry. Strikingly, the frequency of aortic T-bet-expressing Th1 cells was markedly higher in <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice than in <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, while the proportions of Th2 and Th17 subsets did not differ between the 2 groups (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref> through 4H).

<p>Collectively, these results suggest that CCR4 deficiency promotes the selective accumulation of proatherogenic Th1 cells in atherosclerotic aorta and the accumulation of various helper T cell subsets including Th1 cells in para-aortic LNs and shifts the Th1 cell/Treg balance toward Th1 cell responses in atherosclerotic aorta, leading to exacerbated aortic inflammation and early atherosclerosis.</p>

To determine whether CCR4 deficiency affects the suppressive function of Tregs in hypercholesterolemia, we performed an <italic>in vitro</italic> suppression assay. Interestingly, CCR4 deficiency significantly impaired the suppressive function of Tregs isolated from hypercholesterolemic mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), indicating that CCR4 expression on Tregs may be important for the regulation of proinflammatory immune responses and the development of early atherosclerosis.</p>

<p>Interaction with DCs is well-known as one of the core suppressive mechanisms by which Tregs control excessive immune responses. A previous report demonstrated that the cellâcell contacts between Tregs and CCL22-deficient DCs are impaired.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> Tregs limit the CD80/CD86âCD28-dependent activation of T cells through CTLA-4-dependent downregulation of CD80 and CD86 expression on DCs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> which may contribute to the reduction in atherosclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> Therefore, we examined the interactions between CCR4-intact or CCR4-deficient Tregs and DCs by a coculture experiment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). As expected, the upregulation of CD80 and CD86 expression on DCs mediated by conventional T cells was markedly suppressed by coculture with Tregs from <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> or <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Notably, the suppressive effect of CCR4-deficient Tregs was significantly attenuated compared with that of CCR4-intact Tregs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). To assess the involvement of CCR4 expression on Tregs in regulating the production of proatherogenic IFN-Î³ by conventional T cells, we stimulated conventional T cells with an anti-CD3 antibody and DCs in the presence or absence of CCR4-intact or CCR4-deficient Tregs and analyzed IFN-Î³ production by ELISA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). IFN-Î³ production by conventional T cells was markedly suppressed by coculture with CCR4-intact Tregs, while it was not significantly affected by coculture with CCR4-deficient Tregs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Importantly, there was a marked difference in the ability to suppress the production of IFN-Î³ from conventional T cells between CCR4-intact Tregs and CCR4-deficient Tregs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). These results suggest that the augmented Th1 cell responses in the peripheral lymphoid tissues of <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice are partly due to impaired Treg-dependent regulation of DC function.</p>
<p>As described above, CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg accumulation in the atherosclerotic aorta of <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice was not altered despite the marked expansion of CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs in peripheral lymphoid tissues. Based on these findings and previous reports showing the impaired migratory capacity of CCR4-deficient Tregs to inflammatory tissues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> we hypothesized that CCR4-deficient Tregs might have less capacity to migrate to atherosclerotic lesions. To address this issue, we performed a Treg transfer experiment using <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> or <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice on a Kaede-Tg background<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> which provided us with the opportunity to faithfully track transferred Tregs by monitoring the fluorescent Kaede protein (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). There was no difference in the migratory capacity of CCR4-intact or CCR4-deficient Kaede-expressing Tregs to the peripheral LNs, spleen, or para-aortic LNs of recipient <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref> through 5H). To promote the accumulation of T cells in atherosclerotic aorta, we fed recipient <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice with a high-cholesterol diet and analyzed the migration of transferred Tregs in the aorta. Interestingly, we found a trend toward reduction in the proportion of CCR4-deficient Kaede-expressing Tregs in the aorta of recipient <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>), suggesting that CCR4-deficient Tregs may have a reduced ability to migrate to the atherosclerotic aorta, but not to the peripheral lymphoid tissues, under hypercholesterolemia.</p>
<p>Taken together, these data demonstrate that CCR4 expression on Tregs plays a critical role in regulating Th1 cell responses in lymphoid tissues and may mediate Treg migration to the atherosclerotic aorta under hypercholesterolemia, which may cooperatively contribute to the reduction in early atherosclerosis by efficiently mitigating aortic inflammatory immune responses.</p>

<title>CCR4 expression on Tregs is critical for limiting aortic inflammation and the development of atherosclerosis</title>
<p>To provide direct evidence for the critical role of CCR4 expression in Tregs in reducing early atherosclerosis, we injected <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice with saline or Tregs from <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> or <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice and analyzed the aortic root atherosclerotic lesions of recipient <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>).

There were no significant differences in body weight or plasma lipid profile among the 3 groups (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we demonstrated that genetic deletion of CCR4 in hypercholesterolemic <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice accelerates the development of early atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic root which exhibit an inflammatory phenotype, associated with the augmentation of proatherogenic Th1 cell responses in the peripheral lymphoid tissues, para-aortic LNs, and atherosclerotic aorta. Furthermore, T cell-DC coculture and Treg transfer experiments revealed that CCR4 expression on Tregs regulates the development of early atherosclerosis by suppressing Th1 cell responses in lymphoid tissues and possibly by mediating Treg migration to the atherosclerotic aorta. Thus, we identified a novel role for the CCL17/CCL22âCCR4 axes in controlling early atherosclerosis via favorable modulation of the Th1 cell/Treg balance.</p>
<p>Emerging experimental and clinical data obtained by single-cell RNA sequencing and mass cytometry have clearly shown that CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are the dominant populations in human<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> and mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> atherosclerotic plaques. Recent experimental and clinical evidence has demonstrated that dysregulation of the balance of proatherogenic Th1 cells and anti-atherogenic Tregs has adverse effects on atherosclerotic disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> In the present study, we found that the formation of early atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic root was markedly accelerated by CCR4 deficiency, which was associated with the upregulation of various helper T cell immune responses in peripheral lymphoid tissues and augmented Th1 and Th17 cell-mediated responses in the atherosclerotic aorta. Given the proatherogenic nature of Th1 cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> our data indicate that augmented Th1 cell responses in peripheral lymphoid tissues, especially in atherosclerotic lesions, substantially contributed to atherosclerotic lesion formation in <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that augmented immune responses of other helper T cell subsets might also contribute to accelerated atherosclerosis in <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice.</p>
<p>As Th2 cells and some Th17 cells, but not Th1 cells, are known to express CCR4,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> the augmented Th1 cell responses observed in <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice do not seem to be direct effects of CCR4 deficiency and may involve other mechanisms. Given our recent report showing the augmented immune responses related to Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells in CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg-depleted atherosclerosis-prone mice,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> augmentation of these helper T cell responses may be caused by dysregulated CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg responses in our <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. In line with experimental studies in mouse models of inflammatory diseases showing a pivotal role for CCR4 in mediating Treg migration to inflammatory tissues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> we found that CCR4 expression on Tregs may be critical for their migration to the atherosclerotic aorta, providing a possible mechanism for CCR4-dependent regulation of atherosclerosis. Another interesting finding is that CCR4 deficiency markedly upregulated Th1 cell responses in peripheral lymphoid tissues as well as in atherosclerotic lesions under hypercholesterolemia. This observation may not depend on the activation status of Tregs because there were no major differences in the expression of their activation- and function-associated molecules between <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Despite the lower expression of CD103 in the peripheral LN Tregs of 8-week-old <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, there was no significant difference in its expression levels between 18-week-old <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, indicating that reduced CD103 expression in <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice may not be a noteworthy change. T cell-DC coculture experiments clearly demonstrated that CCR4 expression on Tregs is critical for attenuating DC-dependent stimulation of Th1 cell responses by maintaining interactions between Tregs and DCs and Treg suppressive function, which is supported by the findings of a previous report showing a crucial role of the CCL22âCCR4 axis in the contact of Tregs with DCs and regulation of inflammatory responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> In line with the results of <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, we found the upregulation of CD86 expression on DCs in <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, which may be derived from impaired ability of CCR4-deficient Tregs to downregulate CD80 and CD86 expression on DCs. Based on these findings, we propose that CCR4 deficiency in Tregs interrupts their contact with DCs in lymphoid tissues and impairs their suppressive function, leading to augmented Th1 cell responses and accelerated atherosclerosis. We speculate that the increased frequency of Tregs in the peripheral lymphoid tissues of <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice may be a compensatory effect in response to augmented Th1 cell-mediated proinflammatory responses due to dysfunctional Tregs.</p>
<p>T cell costimulatory signals such as the CD28âCD80/CD86<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> and CD27âCD70<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> pathways protect against atherosclerosis by systemically shifting the Th1 cell/Treg balance toward Treg responses. Several approaches involving treatment with cytokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, an active form of vitamin D<sub>3</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, or ultraviolet B irradiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> have been reported to mitigate atherosclerosis via modulation of the Th1 cell/Treg balance in the peripheral lymphoid tissues and atherosclerotic lesions of atherosclerosis-prone mice. Despite these reports, the mechanisms that regulate the T cell balance in lymphoid tissues, particularly in atherosclerotic lesions, have not been fully elucidated. The chemokine system plays an important role in the differentiation and migration of various subsets of T cells including Tregs and has been shown to be involved in the process of atherosclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> We revealed that CCR4 protects against early atherosclerosis by mitigating Th1 cell responses in lymphoid tissues and atherosclerotic lesions and possibly by mediating Treg migration to the aorta. This indicates a previously unrecognized role of the chemokine system in regulating the Th1 cell/Treg balance to limit atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>We observed the accelerated development of early atherosclerotic lesions in <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice fed a standard chow diet. However, previous studies showed that neither hematopoietic nor systemic CCR4 deficiency affected the development of advanced atherosclerotic lesions or Treg frequency in severely hypercholesterolemic mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> These findings suggest that the role of CCR4 may vary depending on the stages of atherosclerosis. Given that Treg responses affected by CCR4 deficiency in mice with early atherosclerotic lesions may be different from those in mice with advanced atherosclerotic lesions, we speculate that the difference in Treg responses may be responsible for the inconsistent findings on the role of CCR4 deficiency in atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>Our data show that interactions between CCR4 and CCL17/CCL22 may promote Treg-skewed responses in lymphoid tissues and atherosclerotic lesions. However, studies in hypercholesterolemic mice demonstrated that genetic deficiency of CCL17 ameliorated atherosclerotic lesion development by promoting Treg accumulation in lymphoid tissues and atherosclerotic lesions independently of the CCL17âCCR4 axis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> This suggests that CCL17 restrains Treg homeostasis and accelerates atherosclerosis, although the role of the CCL17âCCR4 axis in the regulation of Treg homeostasis and atherosclerosis remains elusive. A study in mouse models of myocardial injury showed that CCL17 deficiency increased Treg recruitment to the heart and attenuated myocardial inflammation and injury, which may be attributed to the cancelation of competitive inhibition of CCL22-mediated Treg chemotaxis by CCL17,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> suggesting that CCL17 may impair Treg homeostasis via the inhibition of the CCL22âCCR4 axis. Given the crucial role of the CCL22âCCR4 axis in meditating the Treg suppressive function described above,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> we propose that the CCL22âCCR4 axis plays a dominant role in the prevention of atherosclerosis by promoting Treg function, which may be inhibited by stimulating the CCL17âCCR4 axis. However, the specific roles of the CCL17âCCR4 and CCL22âCCR4 axes in the various stages of atherosclerosis have not been fully elucidated and further studies are needed.</p>
<p>This study has several limitations. In flow cytometric analysis, we did not exclude dead cells or doublets. This procedure could have increased the reliability of our data. Although Treg transfer experiments revealed a critical role for CCR4 in Tregs in protecting against early atherosclerosis, the use of conditional knockout mice would provide additional definitive evidence. Our data were obtained from animal experiments, and investigations using human samples will be needed to translate our findings to clinical settings.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that CCR4 protects against early atherosclerosis by favorably modulating the balance between proatherogenic Th1 cell responses and atheroprotective Treg responses. We showed that CCR4 expression on Tregs is critical for suppressing Th1 cell responses and may play an important role in mediating Treg migration to the atherosclerotic aorta. Our data suggest that CCR4 is an important negative regulator of atherosclerosis.</p>

<p>Immunofluorescence staining of CCL17 and CCL22 in lymphoid tissues and atherosclerotic lesions was performed on 4% paraformaldehyde-fixed cryosections of mouse aortic roots using rabbit anti-CCL17 (1:200; abcam) or goat anti-CCL22 (1:200; R&amp;D Systems) antibodies, followed by detection with fluorescent secondary antibodies. For costaining of macrophages in the above cryosections, anti-MOMA-2 (1:400; BMA Biomedicals) and fluorescent secondary antibodies were also used. Stained sections were digitally captured using a fluorescence microscope (BZ-X810; KEYENCE, Osaka, Japan).</p>
<p>For the detection of macrophages or CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, immunohistochemistry was performed on 4% paraformaldehyde-fixed cryosections of mouse aortic roots using anti-MOMA-2 or anti-CD4 (1:100; BD Biosciences) antibodies, followed by detection with biotinylated secondary antibodies and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. Staining with Massonâs trichrome (Muto Pure Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan) was used to delineate the fibrous area. Stained sections were digitally captured using a microscope (BZ-X810; KEYENCE), and the percentage of the stained area (the stained area per total atherosclerotic lesion area) was calculated as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were quantified as described previously by counting the number of positively stained cells, which was divided by the total plaque area.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> The primary and secondary antibodies used are listed in <xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 4</xref>.</p>

<title>Flow cytometry</title>
<p>For flow cytometric analysis of lymphoid tissues, peripheral LN cells and splenocytes were isolated and stained in PBS containing 2% fetal calf serum. For analysis of immune cells within the aorta, mice were anesthetized, and the aorta was perfused with cold saline. The aorta was dissected and the adventitial tissue was carefully removed. The aorta was digested with Liberase TM (Roche Diagnostics) in plane RPMI medium at 37â for 45 min with vortexing. For the detection of CCR4 on aortic T cells, Collagenase D (Sigma-Aldrich) was used instead of Liberase TM. A cell suspension obtained by mashing the aorta through a 70-Î¼m strainer was stained with antibodies specific for CD3, CD4, CD45, CCR4, Foxp3, T-bet, RORÎ³t, and GATA3. The Foxp3 staining buffer set (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for intracellular staining of Foxp3. In all staining procedures, Fc receptors were blocked by anti-CD16/CD32 (BD Biosciences). Flow cytometric analysis was performed with FACSAria III (BD Biosciences) using FlowJo software version 10.8.1 (Tree Star). The antibodies used were listed in <xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 5</xref>.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Tanaka et al. investigated the role of CCR4 in early atherosclerosis, focusing on the immune modulation elicited by this chemokine receptor under hypercholesterolemia. The study found that Ccr4 deficiency led to qualitative changes in atherosclerotic plaques, characterized by an increased inflammatory phenotype. The authors further analyzed the CD4 T cell immune response in para-aortic lymph nodes and atherosclerotic aorta, showing an increase mainly in Th1 cells and the Th1/Treg ratio in Ccr4-/-Apoe-/- mice compared to Apoe-/- mice. They then focused on Tregs, demonstrating that Ccr4 deficiency impaired their immunosuppressive function in in vitro assays. Authors also states that Ccr4-deficient Tregs had, as expected, impaired migration to the atherosclerotic aorta. Adoptive cell transfer of Ccr4-/- Tregs to Apoe-/- mice mimicked early atherosclerosis development in Ccr4-/-Apoe-/- mice. Therefore, this work shows that CCR4 plays an important role in early atherosclerosis but not in advanced stages.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Several in vivo and in vitro approaches were used to address the role of CCR4 in early atherosclerosis. Particularly, through the adoptive cell transfer of CCR4+ or CCR4- Tregs, the authors aimed to demonstrate the role of CCR4 in Tregs' protection against early atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Flow cytometry experiments are not well controlled. Dead cells and doublets were not excluded from analysis.</p>
<p>Clinical relevance is unclear.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>I thank the authors for addressing my suggestions.</p>
<p>
I understand that excluding dead cells would require repeating the entire experiment. However, the authors can at least exclude doublets from the existing flow cytometry data.</p>
<p>
I also agree with the more cautious claim regarding the role of CCR4 in Treg migration.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>Tanaka and colleagues addressed the role of the C-C chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) in early atherosclerotic plaque development using ApoE-deficient mice on a standard chow diet as a model. Because several CD4+ T cell subsets express CCR4, they examined whether CCR4-deficiency alters the immune response mediated by CD4+ T cells. By histological analysis of aortic lesions, they demonstrated that the absence of CCR4 promoted the development of early atherosclerosis, with heightened inflammation linked to increased macrophages and pro-inflammatory CD4+ T cells, along with reduced collagen content. Flow cytometry and mRNA expression analysis for identifying CD4+ T cell subsets showed that CCR4 deficiency promoted higher proliferation of pro-inflammatory effector CD4+ T cells in peripheral lymphoid tissues and accumulation of Th1 cells in the atherosclerotic lesions. Interestingly, the increased pro-inflammatory CD4+ T cell response occurred despite the expansion of T CD4+ Foxp3+ regulatory cells (Tregs), found in higher numbers in lymphoid tissues of CCR4-deficient mice, suggesting that CCR4 deficiency interfered with Treg's regulatory actions. The findings contrast with earlier studies in a murine model of advanced atherosclerosis, where CCR4 deficiency did not alter the development of the aortic lesions. The authors included a thoughtful discussion about hypothetical mechanisms explaining these contrasting results, including putative differences in the role played by the CCL17/CCL22-CCR4 axis along the stages of atherosclerosis development in this murine model.</p>
<p>Major strengths</p>
<p>â¢ Demonstration of CCR4 deficiency's impact on early atherosclerosis. CCR4 deficiency effects on the early atherosclerosis development in the Apoe-/-mice model were demonstrated by a quantitative analysis of the lesion area, inflammatory cell content and the expression profile of several pro- and anti-inflammatory markers.</p>
<p>
â¢ Analysis of the T CD4+ response in various lymphoid tissues (peripheral and para-aortic lymph nodes and spleen) and the atherosclerotic aorta during the early phase of atherosclerosis in the Apoe-/-mice model. This analysis, combining flow cytometry and mRNA expression, showed that CCR4 deficiency enhanced T CD4+ cell activation, favouring the amplification of the typical biased Th1-mediated inflammatory response observed in the lymphoid tissues of hypercholesterolemic mice.</p>
<p>
â¢ Treg transference experiments. Transference of Treg from Apoe-/- or Ccr4-/- Apoe-/- mice to Apoe-/- mice under a standard chow diet was useful for addressing the relevance of CCR4 expression on Tregs for the atheroprotective effect of this regulatory T cell subset during early atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>Major weaknesses</p>
<p>â¢ Methodological Limitations: The controls used in the flow cytometry analysis were suboptimal, as neither cell viability nor doublets were assessed. This may have introduced artifacts, particularly when measuring less-represented cell populations within complex samples, such as in assays evaluating Treg migration to the aorta in atherosclerotic mice.</p>
<p>
â¢ Incomplete understanding of CCR4-Mediated Mechanisms: The mechanisms by which CCR4 regulates early inflammation and the development of atherosclerosis were not fully clarified.</p>
<p>I have previously addressed the study limitations and their global impact in my earlier reviews.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the previous reviews</p>
<p><bold>Response to the reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>We greatly appreciate the reviewerâs high evaluation of our paper and helpful comments and suggestions.</p>
<p>Regarding <italic>in vivo</italic> Treg homing assay, we did not exclude doublets and dead cells from the analysis of Kaede-expressing Tregs migrated to the aorta, which may affect the results. We described this issue as the limitation of this study in the revised manuscript. Nonetheless, we believe the reliability of our findings because we repeated this experiment three times and obtained similar results.</p>
<p>There is no evidence to support the clinical relevance of our findings. Future clinical research on this topic is highly desired.</p>
<p><bold>Response to the reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>We greatly appreciate the reviewerâs high evaluation of our paper and helpful comments and suggestions.</p>
<p>Despite the controversial role of Th17 cells in atherosclerosis, we understand the possible involvement of Th17 cells and the Th1 cell/Th17 cell balance in lymphoid tissues and aortic lesions in accelerated inflammation and atherosclerosis in <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Although we could not completely evaluate the changes in these immune responses in detail, future study may elucidate interesting mechanisms mediated by Th17 cell responses.</p>
<p>As the reviewer suggested, we understand that it is necessary to provide in vivo evidence for the Treg suppressive effects on DC activation. Based on the results of in vitro experiments, we described the discussion on the in vivo evidence in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>We understand methodological limitations for flow cytometric analysis of immune cells in the aorta and <italic>in vivo</italic> Treg homing assay. We described this issue as the limitation of this study in the revised manuscript. Regarding <italic>in vivo</italic> Treg homing assay, we statistically re-analyzed the combined data from multiple experiments and observed a tendency toward reduction in the proportion of CCR4-deficient Kaede-expressing Tregs in the aorta of recipient <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, though there was no statistically significant difference in the migratory capacity of CCR4-intact or CCR4-deficient Kaede-expressing Tregs. Accordingly, we toned down our claim that CCR4 expression on Tregs plays a critical role in mediating Treg migration to the atherosclerotic aorta under hypercholesterolemia.</p>
<p>The reviewer requested us to evaluate aortic inflammation in <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice injected with CCR4-intact or CCR4-deficient Tregs. However, we think that this experiment will provide marginal information because Treg transfer experiments in <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice have already shown the protective role of CCR4 in Tregs against aortic inflammation and early atherosclerosis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) #1 and #2: CD103 and CD86 expression should be discussed on the text and not only in the response to reviewer.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In accordance with the reviewerâs suggestion, we added a discussion on the downregulated CD103 expression in peripheral LN Tregs and upregulated CD86 expression on DCs in <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice in the discussion section in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) #5: Authors response is not satisfactory. No gate percentage is shown. As it currently is, the difference in the number of cells shown in the figure could be due to differences in events recorded. Furthermore, the gate strategy is not thorough. Considering the very low frequency of Kaede + cells detected, it is crucial to properly exclude doublets and dead cells.</p>
<p>Authors reported a dramatic difference in Kaede + Tregs cells in the aorta across experiments. This could be addressed by normalization followed by appropriate statistical analysis (One sample t-test).</p>
<p>The data shown is not strong enough to conclude that there is a reduced migration to the aorta.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand the importance of reviewerâs suggestion. We described the percentage of Kaede+ Tregs in the aorta of <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice receiving transfer of Kaede-expressing CCR4-intact or CCR4-deficient Tregs in Figure 5I.</p>
<p>As the reviewer pointed out, we understand that it would be important to properly exclude doublets and dead cells in <italic>in vivo</italic> Treg homing assay. However, it is difficult for us to resolve this issue because we need to perform the same experiments again which will require a great number of additional mice and substantial amount of time. We deeply regret that these important experimental procedures were not performed. We described this issue as the limitation of this study.</p>
<p>In accordance with the reviewerâs suggestion, we re-analyzed the combined data from multiple experiments using one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test. We observed a tendency toward reduction in the proportion of CCR4-deficient Kaede-expressing Tregs in the aorta of recipient <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, though there was no statistically significant difference in the migratory capacity of CCR4-intact or CCR4-deficient Kaede-expressing Tregs. By modifying the corresponding descriptions in the manuscript, we toned down our claim that CCR4 expression on Tregs plays a critical role in mediating Treg migration to the atherosclerotic aorta under hypercholesterolemia.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) #8: There are still several not shown data</p>

<p>In accordance with the reviewerâs suggestion, we showed the data on the responses of Tregs and effector memory T cells in 8-week-old wild-type or <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice and <italic>Ccr4</italic> mRNA expression in Tregs and non-Tregs from <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> or <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice in Supplementary Figures 4 and 7.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>

<p>(1) Issue 1. For future studies, I recommend not omitting viability controls during cell staining. Removal of dead cells and doublets should always be included during the gating strategy to avoid undesirable artefacts, especially when analysing less-represented cell populations. According to your previous report (ref #40), I agree that isotype controls were unnecessary using the same staining protocol. FMO controls should always be included in flow cytometry analysis (not mentioned in the methodology description and ref#40).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As the reviewer suggested, we understand that it would be important to properly exclude dead cells and doublets and to prepare FMO controls in flow cytometric analysis. We deeply regret that these important experimental procedures were not performed. We described this issue as the limitation of this study.</p>

<p>(2) Issue 3. Although Th17's role in atherosclerosis remains controversial, the data obtained in this work could provide valuable insights if discussed appropriately. As noted in my public review, I found it noteworthy that ROR Î³ <italic>t</italic>+ cells represented around 13% of effector TCD45+CD3+CD4+ lymphocytes in the aorta of <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice while Th1 less than 5% (Fig 4H and F, respectively). I recognise that differences in cell staining sensibility and robustness for different transcription factors may influence these percentages. However, analysing how CCR4 deficiency influences the Th1/TI h17 balance would yield interesting data, similar to what was done for the Th1/Treg ratio.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Considering the higher proportion of Th17 cells than Th1 or Th2 cells in atherosclerotic aorta, we understand the importance of reviewerâs suggestion. However, we could not evaluate the effect of CCR4 deficiency on the Th1/Th17 balance in aorta because we did not perform flow cytometric analysis of aortic Th1 and Th17 cells in the same mice. Meanwhile, we could examine the Th1/Th17 balance in peripheral lymphoid tissues by flow cytometry. We found a significant increase in the Th1/Th17 ratio in the peripheral LNs of <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, while there were no changes in its ratio in the spleen or para-aortic LNs of these mice, which limits the contribution of the Th1/Th17 balance to exacerbated atherosclerosis. We showed these data below.</p>

<p>(3) Issue 4. I appreciate the authors for sharing data on the flow cytometry analysis of Tregs in para-aortic LNs of <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, which would have been included as a Supplementary figure. These results reinforce the notion that Treg dysfunction in CCR4-deficient mice may not be due to the downregulation of regulatory cell surface receptors.</p>

<p>We showed the data on the expression of CTLA-4, CD103, and PD1 in Tregs in the para-aortic LNs of <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice in Supplementary Figure 8.</p>

<p>(4) Issue 5. I agree that CD4+ T cell responses are substantially regulated by DCs. While CD80 and CD86 on DC primarily serve as costimulatory signals for T-cell activation, cytokines secreted by DCs are primordial signals for determining the differentiation phenotype of effector Th cells. Since the analysis of DC phenotype in lymphoid tissues of <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice could not be addressed in this study, it is not possible to differentiate which processes may be mainly affected by CCR4-deficiency during CD4+ T cell activation. In this scenario, and considering in vitro studies, the results suggest a possible role of CCR4 in controlling the extent of activation of CD4+T cells rather than shifting the CD4+T cell differentiation profile in peripheral lymphoid tissues, where a predominant Th1 profile was already established in <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Therefore, I advise caution when concluding about shifts in CD4+ T cell responses.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for providing us thoughtful comments. As the reviewer pointed out, we understand that we should carefully interpret the mechanisms for the shift of CD4+ T cell responses by CCR4 deficiency.</p>

<p>(5) Regarding migration studies in the revised manuscript. I fully understand that Treg transference assays are challenging. The results do not suggest that CCR4 was critical for Treg migration to lymphoid tissues in the conditions assayed. Concerning migration to the aorta, I found the results inconclusive since the authors mention that: i) there was a dramatic difference in the absolute numbers of Kaede-expressing Tregs that migrated to the aorta impairing statistical analysis; ii) the number of Kaede-expressing Tregs that migrated to the aorta was extremely low; iii) dead cells and doublets were not removed in the flow cytometry analysis. In this context, I do not agree with the following statements and recommend revising them:</p>
<p>- &quot;CCR4 deficiency in Tregs impaired their migration to the atherosclerotic aorta&quot; (lines 36-7),</p>
<p>- &quot;â¦we found a significant reduction in the proportion of CCR4 deficient Kaede-expressing Tregs in the aorta of recipient <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice&quot; (lines 356-7),</p>
<p>- &quot;CCR4 expression on Tregs regulates the development of early atherosclerosis by....... mediating Treg migration to the atherosclerotic aorta&quot; (lines 409-411),</p>
<p>- &quot;â¦we found that CCR4 expression on Tregs is critical for regulating atherosclerosis by mediating their migration to the atherosclerotic aorta&quot; (lines 437-438),</p>
<p>- &quot;CCR4 protects against early atherosclerosis by mediating Treg migration to the aorta.... (lines 464-465),</p>
<p>- &quot;We showed that CCR4 expression on Tregs is critical for ...... mediating Treg migration to the atherosclerotic aorta&quot; (503-505).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand the importance of the reviewerâs suggestion. We described this issue as the limitation of this study. In accordance with the reviewerâs suggestion, we modified the above descriptions and toned down our claim that CCR4 expression on Tregs plays a critical role in mediating Treg migration to the atherosclerotic aorta under hypercholesterolemia.</p>

<p>(6) Line 206: Mention the increased expression of CD86 by DCs</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We mentioned this result in the revised manuscript. We also added a discussion on the upregulated CD86 expression on DCs in <italic>Ccr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice in the discussion section in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(7) Lines 304-305. According to Fig 4F-H, a selective accumulation of Th1 cells seems to have occurred only in the aorta, coinciding with a higher Th1/Treg ratio. No selective accumulation of Th1 cells was observed in para-aortic lymph nodes. These results could be clarified.</p>
