<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Mammalian sperm delve into the female reproductive tract to fertilize the female gamete. The available information about how sperm regulate their motility during the final journey to the fertilization site is extremely limited. In this work, we investigated the structural and functional changes in the sperm flagellum after acrosomal exocytosis and during the interaction with the eggs. The evidence demonstrates that the double helix actin network surrounding the mitochondrial sheath of the midpiece undergoes structural changes prior to the motility cessation. This structural modification is accompanied by a decrease in diameter of the midpiece and is driven by intracellular calcium changes that occur concomitant with a reorganization of the actin helicoidal cortex. Although midpiece contraction may occur in a subset of cells that undergo acrosomal exocytosis, live-cell imaging during in vitro fertilization showed that the midpiece contraction is required for motility cessation after fusion is initiated. These findings provide the first evidence of the F-actin network’s role in regulating sperm motility, adapting its function to meet specific cellular requirements during fertilization, and highlighting the broader significance of understanding sperm motility.</p>

<title>Significant statement</title>
<p>In this work, we demonstrate that the helical structure of polymerized actin in the flagellum undergoes a rearrangement at the time of sperm-egg fusion. This process is driven by intracellular calcium and promotes a decrease in the sperm midpiece diameter as well as the arrest in motility, which is observed after the fusion process is initiated.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sperm motility is required for arrival at the site of fertilization and to penetrate the different layers surrounding the egg. The temporal regulation of sperm motility involves the concerted action of multiple cell structures to enable fertilization. The initial motility of ejaculated sperm is characterized by a linear progressive movement as the cells traverse a long distance within the female reproductive tract. However, at one point, before reaching the oocyte, this initial progressive motion must be changed to a vigorous non-progressive mode of motility called hyperactivation (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></italic>). During that migration, mouse sperm undergo acrosomal exocytosis, which takes place in the upper segments of the oviduct, before the sperm directly interact with the egg or its surrounding layers (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></italic>). This exocytic event is critical because proteins involved in this process are rearranged in preparation for fusion (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></italic>). A second dramatic change in motility is subsequently required for efficient sperm-egg fusion. During this event, which has not been studied in detail so far, sperm completely stop moving (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></italic>). The cease in sperm motility is considered as an indicative marker of an effective fusion between gametes, given that it is necessary to complete the attachment and fusion between sperm and eggs. Fusion itself is a complex event mediated by several proteins identified using loss of function strategies (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></italic>). Nevertheless, the available information about how sperm regulate their motility during the final journey to the fertilization site and during the interaction with the female gamete is extremely limited. In this final journey, most sperm cells migrate to the ovulated eggs after acrosomal exocytosis, and very little is known about the motility state of those sperm and about the molecular mechanism in charge of the motility arrest.</p>
<p>The regulation of sperm motility is achieved through by balancing force transduction and the mechanical properties of the flagellum. Both effects are governed by the flagellum cytoskeleton, which consists of two major components: a microtubule-based axoneme, located at the flagellum axis, and actin filaments around it (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></italic>). The midpiece and the principal piece also contain the outer dense fibers and the fibrous sheath that have traditionally been referred to as part of the sperm cytoskeleton. Recently it was found that the three-dimensional organization of polymerized actin in the flagellum midpiece of murine sperm forms a unique double helix arrangement accompanying mitochondria (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></italic>). This spatial distribution does not extend into the principal piece, where actin is uniformly distributed between the axoneme and the plasma membrane. Across all investigated cells, this double helix consisted of exactly 87 gyres with a pitch of 244±1 nm, yielding a total midpiece length in mice of 21.2±0.3 μm (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></italic>). Such accurate control of sizes is not typical in live cells given that reactions are prone to stochastic effects and entropy leads to large cell-to-cell fluctuations. Thus, the precise control of the actin helix comes at a substantial regulatory cost for sperm cells. Nevertheless, the function of this specialized structure of actin filaments is largely unknown.</p>
<p>In this work, we find definite evidence for the role of the helical actin structure in the final stage of motility regulation, when sperm dramatically shift from being hyperactivated to a practically immotile stage. We have investigated the structural changes in the actin cytoskeleton of the sperm flagellum after acrosomal exocytosis and during the interaction with the eggs. By using a combination of single-cell imaging and super-resolution microscopy methods, our results demonstrate that the helical structure of polymerized actin undergoes a radical structural change at the time of sperm-egg fusion. Further, we uncover that this process is triggered by a substantial calcium ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) influx. This actin-dependent signaling pathway promotes a decrease of the sperm midpiece diameter and motility arrest, both of which are found to be required to complete the fusion process during fertilization.</p>

<title>Acrosomal exocytosis promotes a cessation of motility in a subset of sperm cells</title>
<p>After acrosomal exocytosis, sperm need to accomplish migration to the ampulla, reach unfertilized eggs, penetrate the cumulus matrix and the zona pellucida and finally, undergo fusion with the oocyte (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></italic>). All these processes share the need to modulate sperm motility. Little is known about the regulation of motility after the occurrence of acrosomal exocytosis or prior to the fusion with the oocyte.</p>
<p>To simultaneously monitor the acrosomal status and sperm motility in live cells, transgenic mice whose sperm express enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in the acrosome and red fluorescent protein (DsRed2) in the mitochondria were used (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, Supplementary movie S1). EGFP-DsRed2 sperm were immobilized at the head on laminin-coated coverslips, while still allowing free flagellar movement (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, Supplementary movie S2). While the presence of the acrosome is monitored using the EGFP fluorescence signal, motility was assessed through the movement of the midpiece (DsRed2 fluorescence), which was beating in and out of the imaging plane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

C) Quantification of motile and immotile acrosome-reacted sperm (EGFP-). A total of 235 cells were counted across at least three independent experiments. D) Representative time series of transgenic EGFP-DsRed2 sperm stained with 10 μM FM4-64 and attached to concanavalin A-coated coverslips, with AE induced by 100 μM progesterone. White squares indicate cells exhibiting patterns I, II, or III after progesterone induction. A schematic representation of AE in this transgenic model stained with FM4-64 is shown on the right side of the panel. E-G) Representative images of capacitated transgenic EGFP-DsRed2 sperm stained with 10 μM FM4-64. Panel E) displays an acrosome-intact, motile sperm (Pattern I), F) shows an acrosome-reacted sperm with motility and low FM4-64 midpiece fluorescence (Pattern II), and G) presents an acrosome-reacted sperm with no motility and high FM4-64 midpiece fluorescence (Pattern III). In all three cases, cells were induced with 100 μM progesterone. Enlarged images of each pattern are shown on the right panel. Representative images from at least five independent experiments are displayed.</p></caption>

<p>The majority of acrosome-intact sperm were able to move. Interestingly, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref> show the coexistence of two populations of sperm that underwent acrosomal exocytosis (cells lacking EGFP signal) induced upon addition of progesterone, a physiological trigger of acrosomal exocytosis. Some of the acrosome reacted sperm moved normally (34.1±3.7 %, n = 235), whereas the majority of them remained immotile (65.9 ± 6.2 %, n = 2350) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>, upper and lower panel, respectively, Supplementary movie S2).</p>
<p>The flagellar beat cycle encompasses a self-regulatory mechanism that receives feedback from molecular and mechanical signals (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></italic>). The complete abortion of flagellar beat cycle observed in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref> might be indicative of a stimulus provided by or occurring concomitant with acrosomal exocytosis. To comprehend the connection between acrosomal exocytosis and motility, we hypothesized the existence of a mechanical change in the flagella as a result of the acrosomal exocytosis. For this reason, acrosomal exocytosis was studied in the presence of FM4-64 fluorescent dye (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></italic>) to visualize structural changes at the plasma membrane, which can occur at macroscopic scales observed as an alteration in the shape of the flagellum, or at mesoscopic scales, monitored by local changes in FM4-64 fluorescence occurring at the vicinity or within the plasma membrane. EGFP-DsRed2 sperm were stimulated with progesterone and their ‘motility’ behavior was recorded for 5 min in the presence of FM4-64. The loss of EGFP fluorescence in the acrosome of transgenic mice correlated with a noticeable increase of FM4-64 fluorescence in the head, as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> (see panels 0′ and 3′, Supplementary movie S3). In addition, we noticed that sperm that underwent acrosomal exocytosis, later showed an increase in the FM4-64 fluorescence intensity in the flagellum as well (see panel 14′of <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, Supplementary movie S3).</p>
<p>A more detailed analysis of individual cells demonstrated changes in FM4-64 fluorescence according to their motility (Supplementary movie S4). <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> shows a motile acrosome-intact sperm, (a control case), where the fluorescence levels of EGFP and FM4-64 remained constant during the entire experiment (Pattern I). Interestingly, sperm that lost their acrosome (no EGFP and high FM4-64 fluorescence in the sperm head) and continued moving, presented low levels of FM4-64 fluorescence in the midpiece (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>, Pattern II). On the other hand, acrosome-reacted sperm that remained immotile showed a significant rise in the FM4-64 midpiece fluorescence (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>, Pattern III). Noteworthy, both subsets of cells (with and without motility) displayed the expected increase in FM4-64 fluorescence in the sperm head.</p>
<p>To deepen our understanding on how sperm lose motility during acrosomal exocytosis, we designed a sperm tracking system that can also monitor changes in fluorescence in moving cells (Figure S1B and S1C). Three parameters were then assessed in real time, namely, the beat frequency of the flagellum (by tracking it on bright field images, or the DsRed2 channel, Figure S1A), the status of the acrosome (EGFP signal), and changes occurring at or within the membrane in the midpiece (FM4-64 signal). Figure S1B shows that sperm that did not undergo acrosomal exocytosis remained motile with a stable beat frequency and low FM4-64 fluorescence over the recording time. In stark contrast, after acrosomal exocytosis, cells gradually diminished the beating frequency and increased FM4-64 fluorescence in the midpiece (Figure S1C).</p>
<p>Altogether, these experiments demonstrate that acrosomal exocytosis promotes a cease of motility in a subset of sperm cells, which coincides with an increase in FM4-64 fluorescence in the midpiece.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Acrosomal exocytosis is followed by a decrease in the midpiece diameter</title>
<p>Live-cell super-resolution microscopy was used to understand the structural changes occurring in the midpiece. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> shows a wide-field image of a sperm midpiece stained with FM4-64 (left) and analyzed using super-resolution radial fluctuations (SRRF, right) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></italic>). Acrosomal exocytosis dynamics was monitored by FM4-64 fluorescence in the head (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, upper right insets). A decrease in the midpiece diameter over time was observed following acrosomal exocytosis either being spontaneous, induced by a physiological agonist (progesterone), or induced by a non-physiological surge of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (ionomycin) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref> and Supplementary movie S5). In the negative control (no acrosomal exocytosis), the diameter remained unchanged. This phenomenon was also observed using mean shift super-resolution (MSSR) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></italic>). To further support this observation, other plasma membrane probes of different molecular structure, such as Memglow 700 (Figure S2A), Bodipy-GM1 (Figure S2B), and FM1-43 (Figure S2C), were used. In all three cases, a decrease in the midpiece diameter was observed after acrosomal exocytosis.</p>

<p>The FM4-64 fluorescence intensity in the head and in the midpiece (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>) were also assessed. As expected, the increase in FM4-64 fluorescence in the head occurs after acrosomal exocytosis. Furthermore, in agreement to what was observed in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, fluorescence intensity in the midpiece also increased over time in sperm that underwent acrosomal exocytosis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>).</p>

<title>The contraction of the midpiece initiates in the proximal part of the flagellum</title>
<p>To investigate whether the contraction of the midpiece is triggered at a random location or in a particular region of the flagellum, kymographs were used. A kymograph allows visualization of dynamical aspects of a given phenomenon in a single figure, where the temporal dimension is expressed as an axis of the image through a spatial-temporal transformation of the dataset. Two types of kymographs were used (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). First, super-resolution microscopy kymographs were built to monitor dynamic changes in the diameter of the flagellum along the midpiece. Second, to investigate the number of contraction sites, fluorescence kymographs were made from diffraction-limited images to observe changes in FM4-64 fluorescence over time and across the entire midpiece. Interestingly, Figure S2D shows a significant negative correlation between the midpiece diameter and the FM4-64 fluorescence, unveiling a tool to obtain an approximate value of the midpiece diameter without the need of super-resolution microscopy.</p>

<p>A) Schematic diagram illustrating the generation of super-resolution kymographs from SRRF-processed images. Crosslines are drawn every 2.5 μm through the sperm midpiece, and the Image-J Kymograph builder plug-in is used to create kymographs. The x-axis represents time, and the y-axis shows diameter changes. For wide-field images, a line along the midpiece is drawn to create fluorescence kymographs, with the y-axis representing midpiece length. Three sections of the midpiece are defined: proximal [0-7 μm], central [7-14 μm], and distal [14-21 μm]. B) Relative frequency graph displaying the distribution of the initiation sites for midpiece contractions in sperm with no AE (no reac), spontaneous exocytosis (spont), progesterone-induced (prog, 100 μM) exocytosis, and ionomycin-induced (iono, 10 μM) exocytosis, respectively. The x-axis indicates the midpiece section where the contraction begins: proximal (P), central (C), or distal (D). A chi<sup>2</sup> test was performed using the R language environment. C-D) Representative contraction kymographs and diameter measurements for progesterone-induced (100 μM) AE with one or two contraction initiation sites, respectively. In contraction kymographs, yellow lines demarcate midpiece sections, and colored spots indicate where super-resolution kymographs were created.

<p>Three experimental subsets that underwent acrosomal exocytosis were assessed: spontaneous, induced by progesterone, and induced by ionomycin. To scrutinize randomness of focus-driven contraction, the midpiece was segmented in three regions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>): proximal (near the neck), central, and distal (near the annulus). In these groups, it was then evaluated whether cells presented one or more foci of contraction.</p>
<p><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> shows a cumulative study, which indicates that contraction is preferentially initiated at the proximal part of the midpiece, regardless of being progesterone-induced or spontaneous acrosomal exocytosis. When ionomycin was used as an agonist of acrosomal exocytosis, the contraction began randomly in any segment of the midpiece. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref> show two examples of flagellar dynamics for progesterone-induced sperm, which either presented one or two foci of contraction. In both cases, the diameter decreased along the whole midpiece, seen as a transition from dark to bright red colors in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>. Noteworthy, focal points of contraction were consistently observed: i.e., a case with a single focus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), or a case with two foci of contraction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Figures S2E and S2F show ionomycin-induced sperm that present one or more foci. It is observed in the normalized diameter kymograph that the flagellum presents a single focus between the measurements of 7.5 µm and 10 µm (Figure S2E, left panel). This is reflected in the right panel in the light blue and orange dots, which are the actual diameter measurements that decreased first and most (Figure S2E). A representative behavior within this experimental group is represented in Figure S2F, where the entire midpiece contracted (all its sections simultaneously). This is observed in the color scale of the normalized diameter kymograph and coincides with the real measurements of the diameter in the right panel, which decreased their value. Lastly, Figures S2G and S2H show examples of spontaneous acrosomal exocytosis with one or two foci of contraction, respectively. In particular, in Figure S2H, it a first focus of contraction between 0 and 5 µm that coincided with the diameter measurements of the right panel that decreased their value first and to a greater extent (black, pink and green dots). Although the entire midpiece contracted, a second focus of contraction appeared around the measurements of 10 to 15 µm and coincidentally, these are the points with the strongest decrease in the diameter (orange, purple and red points).</p>

<title>The reduction of the midpiece diameter occurs concomitantly with a [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase in the flagellum</title>
<p>It is widely accepted that an increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> precedes acrosomal exocytosis (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></italic>). It has been shown that acrosomal exocytosis initiation occurs after an increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in the sperm head that is later propagated towards the midpiece (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></italic>). To comprehend the connection between acrosomal exocytosis and the concomitant contraction of the midpiece, we hypothesized the existence of a signal, i.e., Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which propagates from the head to the flagellum and modulate the architecture of the sperm flagellum.</p>
<p>To investigate if the increase in the concentration of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in the midpiece is correlated with the midpiece contraction, sperm were incubated with FM4-64 and Fluo4, a Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluorescent sensor (Supplementary movie S6). <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> shows a live-cell imaging experiment of sperm cells that did not undergo acrosomal exocytosis (control case), nor a significant rise in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. Noteworthy, upon induction with progesterone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, Supplementary movie S6), there was an increase in the midpiece [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> followed by an increase in FM4-64 fluorescence, which is indicative of a contraction of the flagellum (see Figure S2D). These single cell experiments illustrate a reduction of the midpiece diameter that occurs concomitantly with an increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> within the flagellum. A large population of sperm was analyzed using low magnification (10X). <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref> show a collection of single cell kymographs, where each row represents the fluorescence of Fluo4 (green) and FM4-64 (red) of the midpiece over time. Unstimulated cells are displayed on <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref> and sperm that were exposed to progesterone are shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>. Most of the cells display a transient [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase followed by an increase in FM4-64 fluorescence. This pattern was also observed in ionomycin-induced cells (Figures S3A and S3B and Supplementary movie S6) with the exception that, as expected, in this case the rise in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>I</sub> was faster and sustained. These findings indicate that an [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> transient increase, happening in the midpiece, precedes the contraction of the flagellum.</p>

<p>The relationship between the observed [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> rise and the flagellar contraction was then assessed using live-cell super-resolution imaging. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref> shows there is a [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase in the midpiece that coincides in space and time with a contraction of the midpiece.

Overall, a rise in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> occurred along the whole midpiece, which coincided with a generalized contraction of the midpiece (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Remarkably, a transient focal increase of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> was observed at the base of the flagellum, which correlates in space and time with a focal reduction of the diameter (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>).

<title>The actin cytoskeleton approaches the plasma membrane during the contraction of the midpiece</title>
<p>The midpiece is shaped by two major structural elements: the axoneme, which consists of tubulin and its accessory components, including the outer dense fibers (ODFs); and a recently described network of filamentous actin (F-actin) arranged in a helicoidal conformation along the midpiece (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></italic>). We investigated whether the actin network plays a role in regulating the midpiece contraction associated with acrosomal exocytosis. We considered three possible scenarios: (i) an unknown mechanical force, mediated by a rigid matrix such as F-actin, brings the plasma membrane closer to the center of the flagellum; (ii) a dynamic relationship exists between the plasma membrane and the actin cytoskeleton of the midpiece, facilitating contraction; and (iii) the midpiece contraction is driven by an uncharacterized signaling mechanism that acts independently of the actin cytoskeleton.</p>
<p>The role of the actin cytoskeleton in the midpiece contraction was investigated through live-cell super-resolution using SiR-actin, a fluorescent probe that binds to F-actin (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></italic>). We used FM4-64 to visualize the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>) and transgenic sperm expressing DsRed2 to observe the mitochondrial network (Figure S4). Two stimulated sperm, one that experienced acrosomal exocytosis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>) and another that did not (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>) are shown. In both cases, a network of F-actin was observed beneath the plasma membrane of the midpiece (cortical actin), enveloping the mitochondrial network (Figure S4A). As expected, in the absence of acrosomal exocytosis, the midpiece diameter (observed through FM4-64) remained unchanged (see also <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, and Figure S4). Interestingly, in this case, both the diameter of the F-actin network and its proximity to either the plasma membrane or the mitochondrial network remained static (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), suggesting a structural role for the F-actin network within the midpiece (scenario - (i)), such as supporting the organization of the mitochondrial network (Figure S4). Remarkably, acrosome-reacted sperm (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>) experienced an abrupt structural reorganization of the midpiece, characterized by a decrease in the distance between the plasma membrane and both the F-actin and mitochondrial networks (Figures S4 and S5). This observation suggests that the remodeling of the midpiece structure is driven by a mechanical (or molecular) interaction occurring at the boundaries of the plasma membrane (supporting scenario - (ii)).</p>

<p>To assess the potential interaction between the F-actin network and the plasma membrane (or its associated components), we examined their colocalization through live-cell super-resolution imaging. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> presents two Manders’ colocalization coefficients (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></italic>). M1 represents the proportion of F-actin (in pixels) that colocalizes with the plasma membrane, while M2 measures the proportion of plasma membrane pixels colocalizing with the F-actin network. A Manderś value of 1 indicates full colocalization, while a value of 0 implies no colocalization.</p>
<p><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> reveals that acrosome-intact sperm displayed low Manders’ coefficients (M1= 0.32 ± 0.03; M2= 0.28 ± 0.04). In contrast, sperm undergoing midpiece contraction exhibited a significant increase in colocalization between the F-actin network and the plasma membrane, as evidenced by the rise in M1 and M2 coefficients (M1= 0.65 ± 0.03; M2 = 0.69 ± 0.03). This increased colocalization occurred simultaneously with midpiece contraction.</p>
<p>Overall, these results confirm that (i) the contraction of the midpiece is linked to the remodeling of the plasma membrane and potentially the F-actin cytoskeleton, and that (ii) both structures interact with each other, directly or indirectly, at the nanoscales. We then seek to understand whether the driving force for the contraction of the midpiece emanates from the F-actin network. The following scenarios were envisaged: (a) the plasma membrane moves towards the actin cytoskeleton, (b) the actin cytoskeleton moves towards the plasma membrane, or (c) both structures come closer to the center of the flagellum. To investigate the occurrence of any of these scenarios, the positions of fluorescence peaks of FM4-64 and SiR-actin in super-resolution kymographs were tracked, as proxy of either membrane or actin cytoskeleton localization, respectively (Figures S5A and S5B). Figure S5C shows representative histograms of SiR-actin and FM4-64 over time. Both FM4-64 and SiR-actin fluorescence peaks came closer to each other. This effect can be also seen in Figure S5F, where acrosome-intact cells display a distance of 0.180 ± 0.007 μm between the plasma membrane and the actin cytoskeleton. In acrosome-reacted cells, the distance was as small as 0.074 ± 0.006 μm after midpiece contraction.</p>
<p>In Figure S5D, a section of the midpiece of an ionomycin-induced acrosomal exocytosis sperm is shown. In this case, the plasma membrane and the actin cytoskeleton approach move closer toward the center of the cell. (set to 0). The slope calculated from the linear fit denotes the velocity of this change. In this example, the plasma membrane is contracting at a rate of 14 μm/min, whereas the actin cytoskeleton is contracting at a rate of 3 μm/min (Figure S5E). In both cases, the signal presents a negative slope in sperm that underwent acrosomal exocytosis, consistent with a decrease in midpiece diameter. Since the results of the analysis of SiR-actin slopes were not conclusive, we studied the actin cytoskeleton structure in more detail.</p>

<p>In the midpiece, polymerized actin forms a double helix that accompanies mitochondria (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></italic>). To investigate if the contraction of the midpiece is associated with structural modifications of the actin double-helix, 3D-STORM was used. Cells were exposed to progesterone, fixed, and co-stained with PNA and phalloidin to visualize the acrosomal status and the actin structure, respectively.</p>
<p><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5D</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5F</xref> show representative images of both dyes for acrosome-intact and acrosome-reacted sperm (left panels). Different parameters were calculated: 1) Helical pitch (<italic>l</italic>), which is the distance between turns of the helix; 2) Frequency (<italic>f</italic><sub>0</sub> = 1/<italic>l</italic>), obtained from the Fourier transform of the image and represented the number of turns that the helix makes per unit length; and 3) Radial distribution (<italic>R</italic>), to infer the distance between the center of the midpiece and the maximum of fluorescence (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></italic>). The frequency increased substantially in the acrosome-reacted sperm compared to intact sperm (6.29 vs 4.04 μm<sup>-1</sup>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5E</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5G</xref>, red arrows in left panels). In addition, the helical pitch diminished its magnitude in acrosome-reacted sperm (159 nm vs 248 nm) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5E</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5G</xref>, left panels). The radial distribution of F-actin in cells that underwent acrosomal exocytosis indicated a smaller radius compared to acrosome-intact sperm (252 vs 300 nm, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5E</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5G</xref>, right panel). Altogether, these results confirm that the actin double-helix undergoes structural changes during the contraction of the midpiece</p>
<p>To further investigate the structural rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton during acrosomal exocytosis, a fluorescent molecule number and brightness analysis was performed (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></italic>). The number measure indicates the abundance or concentration of SiR-Actin molecules bound to F-actin fibers, while the brightness analysis helps reveal dynamic changes in molecular aggregation processes. This analysis is based on the idea that higher-order fluorescent complexes, which are mobile within the sample, will cause an increase in signal variability over time. An increase in brightness suggests the formation or movement of supramolecular structures, such as bundles of actin fibers bearing SiR-Actin. Acrosomal exocytosis induction with progesterone and ionomycin resulted in a significant increase in actin number and brightness compared to the control (non-reacted) group (Figure S6A). Spontaneously reacted sperm also exhibited this behavior, albeit in a more moderate fashion (Figure S6A).</p>
<p>The observed increase in SiR-Actin number after AE induction suggests major actin monomer recruitment to the polymerizing fibers (Figure S6A and S6B), which produces an apparent increase in local fluorophore concentration (Figure S6B). This effect positively correlated with a similar increase in SiR-actin fluorescence (Figure S6A), which is known to indicate actin polymerization due to its high affinity for F-actin.</p>
<p>Actin cytoskeleton polymerization in the midpiece results in a signal variation of increased magnitude (an increase in SiR-Actin brightness) as it undergoes structural rearrangements (Figures S6A and S6B), which are compatible with other observations reported in this work. Both assembly and transport of actin complexes into higher oligomeric states (F-actin) across the cellular milieu led to an apparent increase in the registered SiR-Actin brightness (Figure S6B). Additionally, actin filament displacement along the mitochondrial sheath during acrosomal exocytosis provides a SiR-Actin brightness measure with high dispersion, indicating a redistribution of this cellular structure. These results suggest that actin filaments are locally redistributed and remodeled during acrosomal exocytosis (Figure S6B).</p>

<title>Midpiece contraction takes place following sperm-egg fusion</title>
<p>Motile acrosome-reacted sperm, initially lacking midpiece contraction, can penetrate the zona pellucida. However, they eventually stop moving and exhibit an increase in FM4-64 fluorescence. This suggests that the cessation of motility plays a crucial role in fertilization events occurring after zona pellucida binding and penetration, and that a similar change in midpiece architecture is necessary for successful sperm-egg fusion. To explore this hypothesis, we designed a live imaging experiment using zona-free eggs. Denuded oocytes were loaded with Hoechst 33342, a nuclear dye, to visualize the exact moment of sperm-egg fusion (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></italic>).

The acrosome-reacted sperm (EGFP negative) initially did not display Hoechst fluorescence (Supplementary movie S7), indicating a lack of fusion.

The midpiece diameter remained unchanged during initial sperm-egg fusion indicated by the low FM4-64 fluorescence. Following gamete fusion initiation, FM4-64 fluorescence increased (38 to 44 min), causing sperm motility to cease. In some instances, the midpiece folded and extended again (Figure S7B).

<p>A) Representative time series of sperm-oocyte fusion assay experiments using wild-type sperm loaded with 1 μM Fluo-4. Oocytes were stained with 1 μg/ml Hoechst and 10 μM FM4-64. DIC, Hoechst, Fluo-4, and FM4-64 images are shown over time. The color code below each frame in the Hoechst (shown in blue), Fluo-4 (shown in green), and FM4-64 (shown in red) images indicates the normalized intensity of the fluorescence signal (scale bar on the right of the panel). B-F) Quantification of sperm showing midpiece contraction (B, indicated by increased FM4-64 fluorescence), midpiece folding (C), midpiece unfolding (D), Fluo-4 fluorescence dynamics in the head (E), and different patterns in the midpiece (F) during fusion. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM of the percentage of sperm counted for each experiment. Representative images and data from at least 3 independent experiments are shown. A total of 74 oocytes and 136 sperm were analyzed. Note that midpiece contraction occurs in sperm-egg fusion after a decrease in Fluo-4 fluorescence.</p></caption>

<p>Unexpectedly, sperm binding to the egg plasma membrane displayed high levels of [Ca<bold><sup>2+</sup></bold>]<sub>i</sub> in the head and midpiece (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>, time 1 min, and Supplementary movie S8). A few minutes after fusion began (indicated by an increase in Hoechst signal in the sperm), a decrease in [Ca<bold><sup>2+</sup></bold>]<sub>i</sub> in the head and midpiece was observed (21 min to 51 min). This decrease in [Ca<bold><sup>2+</sup></bold>+]<sub>i</sub> was followed by midpiece contraction, as evidenced by the increase in FM4-64 fluorescence (56 min). In several cells, the midpiece folded back before contracting. The gametes that underwent this change in the flagellum typically remained folded, but occasionally the tail unfolded again. <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8B-F</xref> quantify the key events described above during sperm-egg fusion.</p>
<p>In summary, 76 ± 12% of the sperm exhibited midpiece contraction upon fusion. In 62 ± 12% of cases, the midpiece folded on itself, and afterward, only 32 ± 7% unfolded and stretched out again. All sperm bound to the plasma membrane before fusion presented high [Ca<bold><sup>2+</sup></bold>]i in the head, and the majority displayed a decrease in head [Ca<bold><sup>2+</sup></bold>]<sub>i</sub> before midpiece contraction (75 ± 3%). Concerning the midpiece, three patterns were observed during fusion: in the majority of cases (70± 11%), the midpiece experienced a decrease in [Ca<bold><sup>2+</sup></bold>]<sub>i</sub>. Additionally, 10 ± 10% of sperm showed a transient increase in [Ca<bold><sup>2+</sup></bold>]<sub>i</sub>, while the remaining 20 ± 9% displayed no changes.</p>
<p>Collectively, these results indicate that a decrease in [Ca<bold><sup>2+</sup></bold>]<sub>i</sub> in the midpiece after fusion precedes midpiece contraction and the cessation of sperm motility that precedes sperm-egg fusion.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this article, we demonstrate the existence of a fundamental structural change that occurs in the sperm flagellum at the time of fusion with the egg. Using a plethora of advanced microscopy methods and single cell imaging, we provide insight about cellular and molecular events that occur in acrosome-reacted sperm, which, undoubtedly, are the ones capable of fertilizing an oocyte (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></italic>). At this precise moment of the fertilization process, sperm need to stop moving to complete the fusion between the two gametes. The cease of movement is caused by two concomitant processes that take place in the flagellar midpiece region: a change in the F-actin helical structure and a decrease in the midpiece diameter. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a structural modification of the sperm flagellum related to a specific cellular necessity, i.e., gamete fusion, is described.</p>
<p>To arrive at the site of fertilization within the female reproductive tract, sperm motility is required. It is also fundamental to penetrate the different layers surrounding the egg. In this journey, sperm sense the environment and adapt their movement to the different physiological scenarios. In addition, recent evidence also demonstrated that after being released from their site of storage in the oviductal isthmus, mouse sperm undergo acrosomal exocytosis (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></italic>). This process occurs in the upper segments of the oviduct before any interaction with the eggs or their surrounding layers. This observation opened a new scenario about the motility of sperm in their last transit to the site of fertilization. Little is known about sperm in that region and how sperm move after acrosomal exocytosis. In this regard, most of the information about mammalian sperm comes from studies conducted <italic>in vitro</italic>, using a mixture of acrosome-intact and acrosome-reacted sperm. Even if their motility is analyzed in a subjective manner or using cell tracking systems, virtually all the experiments are conducted without discerning the acrosomal status of the cells. Another possible source of artifacts in this analysis is related with the fact that most of the experiments are also performed using epididymal sperm (not ejaculated) in aqueous solutions that support sperm capacitation but do not represent the natural viscous environment present in the female tract.</p>
<p>By performing in vitro experiments, we detected a strong association between the decrease in the midpiece diameter and the cease of sperm motility. This is observed in a subset of sperm after the occurrence of acrosomal exocytosis. This may suggest that only sperm that undergo acrosomal exocytosis in the oviduct and do not experience this midpiece contraction are capable of migrating to the ampulla and penetrate the cumulus and the zona pellucida. Those sperm that undergo this phenomenon earlier in the tract may not be suitable to continue their journey suggesting that this also may select the gametes during their transit to the ampulla. Previous observations tracking sperm within the female tract have shown the existence of acrosome-reacted sperm within the tract that remain non-motile (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>Acrosome-reacted sperm that bind and penetrate the zona pellucida are ready to fuse with the egg. During sperm-egg fusion, several authors have reported in different species that sperm stop moving (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></italic>). However, the mechanism behind this behavior is not established. One possible explanation is that fusion promotes ion transport changes in sperm, which significantly alter flagellar movement. In this sense, it was previously demonstrated that certain ions such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> may diffuse from the oocyte to the sperm (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></italic>). However, a clear technical limitation in our experimental approach is that the probes that monitor ion dynamics may be exchanged between both gametes. If the concentration of a given probe does not remain stable, it is impossible to determine the accurate change that occurs during fusion. Future experiments may take advantage of transgenic models that incorporate a particular sensor to study this process in vivo, such as the one used by Cohen and collaborators (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>Regardless of the precise nature of ion exchange between sperm and eggs, the diameter of the sperm flagellum in the midpiece is reduced. This midpiece diameter reduction is strongly associated with cessation of sperm motility and is apparently needed to complete the fusion process. Our observation clearly supports this notion. Importantly, the sperm flagellum folds back during fusion coincident with the decrease in the midpiece diameter. Interestingly, this was previously observed in mammals as well as in sea urchin sperm (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>Like other cylindrical biological structures, the sperm flagellum relies on the cytoskeleton for its structural organization and specialized mechanical properties. In addition to the change in midpiece diameter, a significant rearrangement of the F-actin cytoskeleton also occurs. In the midpiece, the polymerized actin is organized in a double helix accompanying the mitochondria (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></italic>). As in many other organisms, the actin cytoskeleton possesses important structural functions, and dynamic changes of F-actin allow the cells to conduct important cellular tasks such as exocytosis. However, less is known about the structural changes undergone by the actin cytoskeletons in cilia and flagella. Remarkably, it has been reported that actin forms helix-like structures in the flagellum of the parasite <italic>Giardia intestinalis</italic> (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></italic>). These findings open the question of whether, to some extent, flagellar helical structures are conserved among diverse species. Our observations demonstrate that the F-actin double helix undergoes a change in the helical pitch as well as in the radial distance to the axoneme. This is concomitant with the decrease in midpiece diameter. Our single-cell experiments using super-resolution microscopy also revealed that the plasma membrane approached the F-actin network during this change. It is well established that various proteins can function as linkers between the plasma membrane and the actin cytoskeleton (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></italic>), but their roles in this specific process remain to be studied. Regardless of how these structures are connected, it is evident that both are associated. However, our experimental data cannot determine whether the plasma membrane is causing the change of the actin network or if the actin network influences the plasma membrane.</p>
<p>Another observation emerging from our study is that a change in [Ca<bold><sup>2+</sup></bold>]<sub>i</sub> occurs prior to the midpiece contraction. It is well known that Ca<bold><sup>2+</sup></bold> is important for acrosomal exocytosis, and a specific transient rise in [Ca<bold><sup>2+</sup></bold>]<sub>i</sub> originating in the head can trigger exocytosis (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></italic>). Previous observations have demonstrated that the sperm head and tail are not isolated compartments, and that ions and other molecules can move between them (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></italic>). In our single-cell experiments, we observed that the rise in FM4-64 fluorescence in the midpiece occurs after the increase in [Ca<bold><sup>2+</sup></bold>]<sub>i</sub> in that region, suggesting a potential association between these events. This could involve diffusion or active transport processes; further investigation is required to determine the precise mechanism. The same phenomenon was studied in sperm bound to the egg plasma membrane to evaluate if the rise in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> also occurs at the time of fusion. Remarkably, we noticed that most of the bound sperm that ended up fusing with the eggs displayed high levels of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in both the head and the flagellum. The midpiece contraction and the immobilization occurred when the levels of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> went down in the midpiece suggesting a possible connection between both events. However, our experimental approach limits the interpretation of this result. One possible explanation is that as soon as sperm bind to the plasma membrane of the oocyte, there is a rapid increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in the sperm. On the other hand, a massive transport of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the egg to the sperm could also occur. These hypotheses, however, are hindered by the technical limitations mentioned above. As the oocyte is not loaded with Fluo4, we cannot rule out that the apparent [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> decrease seen in these experiments is due to dye diffusion into the oocyte. Either way, it is clear that the transport of this ion into or out of the sperm is key to cease motility at this fundamental step of fertilization. Additionally, these results demonstrate that only sperm with elevated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> are capable of binding to the eggs. All these possible scenarios need to be determined in future experiments. Thus, regardless of the mechanism, a clear change in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> dynamics is observed at the time of midpiece contraction. Future studies will aid to indicate if certain Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent proteins that can modify the actin cytoskeleton are responsible for this change.</p>
<p>In cilia, apart from the findings presented in this paper, nothing is known about the regulation of motility by actin. Actin has been found to participate in ciliogenesis, but its involvement in active motility regulation has not been reported. This highlights a potentially unique role for the actin cytoskeleton in regulating sperm function during fertilization. Our discovery of actin’s dynamic reorganization in sperm suggests it could have a more active role in regulating motility and other functions. Given the conservation of cilia and flagella across various organisms, our discovery could prompt further research on the role of the actin network in these structures.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we demonstrate that sperm undergo a structural reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton during key events of fertilization, as summarized in the working model shown in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>. Our findings introduce a new aspect of study in reproductive biology. Previous research has mainly focused on identifying proteins essential for sperm-egg fusion. Our results reveal a previously unexplored biological mechanism in mammalian fertilization, opening new avenues for contraceptive method development.</p>

<p>The double helix actin network surrounding the mitochondrial sheath of the midpiece undergoes structural changes prior to the motility cessation. This structural modification is accompanied by a decrease in diameter of the midpiece and is driven by intracellular calcium changes that occur concomitant with a reorganization of the actin helicoidal cortex. Although midpiece contraction may occur in a subset of cells that undergo acrosomal exocytosis (A and B), the midpiece contraction occurs prior to motility cessation observed after sperm-egg fusion (C and D).</p></caption>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This important work advances our understanding of sperm motility regulation during fertilization by uncovering the midpiece/mitochondria contraction associated with motility cessation and structural changes in the midpiece actin network as its mode of action. The evidence supporting the conclusion is solid, with rigorous live cell imaging using state-of-the-art microscopy, although more functional analysis of the midpiece/mitochondria contraction would have further strengthened the study. The work will be of broad interest to cell biologists working on the cytoskeleton, mitochondria, cell fusion, and fertilization.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate that structural changes in the flagellar midpiece F-actin network are concomitant to midpiece/mitochondrial contraction and motility arrest during sperm-egg fusion by rigorous live cell imaging using state-of-art microscopy.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Many interesting observations are listed as correlated or in time series but do not necessarily demonstrate the causality and it remains to be further tested whether the sperm undergoing midpiece contraction are those that fertilize or those that are not selected. Further elaboration of the function of the midpiece contraction associated with motility cessation (a major key discovery of the manuscript) would benefit from a more mechanistic study.</p>

<p>The authors used various microscopy techniques, including super-resolution microscopy, to observe the changes that occur in the midpiece of mouse sperm flagella. Previously, it was shown that actin filaments form a double helix in the midpiece. This study reveals that the structure of these actin filaments changes after the acrosome reaction and before sperm-egg fusion, resulting in a thinner midpiece. Furthermore, by combining midpiece structure observation with calcium imaging, the authors show that changes in intracellular calcium concentrations precede structural changes in the midpiece. The cessation of sperm motility by these changes may be important for fusion with the egg. Elucidation of the structural changes in the midpiece could lead to a better understanding of fertilization and the etiology of male infertility. The conclusions of this manuscript are largely supported by the data, but there are several areas for improvement in data analysis and interpretation. Please see the major points below.</p>
<p>1. It is unclear whether an increased FM4-64 signal in the midpiece precedes the arrest of sperm motility. This needs to be clarified in order to argue that structural changes in the midpiece cause sperm motility arrest. The authors should analyze changes in both motility and FM4-64 signal over time for individual sperm.</p>
<p>2. It is possible that sperm stop moving because they die. Figure 1G shows that the FM4-64 signal is increased in the midpiece of immotile sperm, but it is necessary to show that the FM4-64 signal is increased in sperm that are not dead and retain plasma membrane integrity by checking sperm viability with propidium iodide or other means.</p>
<p>3. It is unclear how the structural change in the midpiece causes the entire sperm flagellum, including the principal piece, to stop moving. It will be easier for readers to understand if the authors discuss possible mechanisms.</p>
<p>4. The mitochondrial sheath and cell membrane are very close together when observed by transmission electron microscopy. The image in Figure 9A with the large space between the plasma membrane and mitochondria is misleading and should be corrected. The authors state that the distance between the plasma membrane and mitochondria approaches about 100 nm after the acrosome reaction (Line 330 - Line 333), but this is a very long distance and large structural changes may occur in the midpiece. Was there any change in the mitochondria themselves when they were observed with the DsRed2 signal?</p>
<p>5. In the TG sperm used, the green fluorescence of the acrosome disappears when sperm die. Figure 1C should be analyzed only with live sperm by checking viability with propidium iodide or other means.</p>

<p>While progressive and also hyperactivated motility are required for sperm to reach the site of fertilization and to penetrate the oocyte's outer vestments, during fusion with the oocyte's plasma membrane it has been observed that sperm motility ceases. Identifying the underlying molecular mechanisms would provide novel insights into a crucial but mostly overlooked physiological change during the sperm's life cycle. In this publication, the authors aim to provide evidence that the helical actin structure surrounding the sperm mitochondria in the midpiece plays a role in regulating sperm motility, specifically the motility arrest during sperm fusion but also during earlier cessation of motility in a subpopulation of sperm post acrosomal exocytosis.</p>
<p>The main observation the authors make is that in a subpopulation of sperm undergoing acrosomal exocytosis and sperm that fuse with the plasma membrane of the oocyte display a decrease in midpiece parameter due to a 200 nm shift of the plasma membrane towards the actin helix. The authors show the decrease in midpiece diameter via various microscopy techniques all based on membrane dyes, bright-field images and other orthogonal approaches like electron microscopy would confirm those observations if true but are missing. The lack of additional experimental evidence and the fact that the authors simultaneously observe an increase in membrane dye fluorescence suggests that the membrane dyes instead might be internalized and are now staining intracellular membranes, creating a false-positive result. The authors also propose that the midpiece diameter decrease is driven by changes in sperm intracellular Ca2+ and structural changes of the actin helix network. Important controls and additional experiments are needed to prove that the events observed by the authors are causally dependent and not simply a result of sperm cells dying.</p>
