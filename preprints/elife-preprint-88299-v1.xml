<title>Abstract</title><p>Six transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate (STEAP) is a family of four members, and all have a transmembrane domain with a conserved heme binding site. STEAP2 – 4, but not STEAP1, have an intracellular domain that binds to NADPH and FAD. STEAP2 – 4 show metal ion reductase activities, which led to the notion that STEAPs mediate electron transfer starting from NADPH on the intracellular side, through FAD and heme, and finally to a metal ion substrate on the extracellular side. However, the electron transfer chain has not been reconstructed with purified proteins for rigorous investigation. It is also unclear whether STEAP1 has metal ion reductase activity and if so, how electrons are transferred. We expressed and purified mammalian STEAP1 and 2, re-constructed the electron transfer chain <italic>in vitro</italic> and examined individual electron transfer steps. We find that the heme in both STEAP1 and 2 can transfer electrons to a metal ion substrate and that STEAP1 reduces the metal ion significantly faster than STEAP2. We determined the structure of STEAP2 by cryo-electron microscopy and find that its substrate binding site is less well ordered compared to the structures of STEAP1 and 4, which may explain its lower reductase activity. We also demonstrate that the FAD on STEAP2 becomes diffusible after reduction by NADPH. We show that STEAP1 can form an electron transfer chain with cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> reductase. These results establish a solid foundation for understanding the functions of STEAP1 and 2 in cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Six transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate (STEAP) is a family of four membrane-embedded hemeproteins, STEAP1 – 4. Functions of STEAP2 – 4 have been examined in cell-based assays that demonstrated their ability to reduce extracellular ferric and cupric ions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> and implicated their involvement in the endosomal transferrin cycle, and trafficking and availability of iron and copper <italic>in vivo</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> STEAP2 – 4 are also found overexpressed in many types of cancer cells, suggesting their possible participation in cancer initiation, promotion, and progression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> However, cellular function of STEAP1, whose abnormally high level of expression in prostate and prostate cancer cells led to the discovery and namesake of the family, remains unresolved.</p>
<p>STEAP proteins belong to a large superfamily of membrane-embedded reductases which include mammalian NADPH oxidases (NOX) and dual oxidases (DUOX), and bacterial and yeast ferric reductases (FRE).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> This superfamily of proteins all have a transmembrane domain (TMD) composed of six transmembrane helices (TM). The structures of NOX and DUOX show that their TMD binds two heme prosthetic groups, each ligated to a pair of conserved histidine residues from TMs 3 and 5; one heme is close to the intracellular side and the other close to the extracellular side of the membrane.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> An intracellular redox domain (RED) in NOX or DUOX binds to both NADPH and FAD to fulfill the electron transfer function. Structures of STEAP1 and STEAP4 were reported previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> Interestingly, STEAPs have only a single pair of conserved histidine residues from TMs 3 and 5 that ligate to one heme near the extracellular side of the membrane. STEAP4 has a homotrimeric structure and the FAD binds in an extended conformation straddling the TMD and RED domains from different protomers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> The isoalloxazine ring of a FAD occupies a position equivalent to the heme on the intracellular side of NOX and DUOX.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> However, this conformation of FAD places its isoalloxazine ring ∼19 Å from the closest NADP(H) in the RED, which raises the question of how NADPH transfers hydride to FAD. A “FAD-shuttling” mechanism was proposed in which the bound FAD switches between the extended conformation observed in the structure and a “folded” conformation with the isoalloxazine ring aligned in close proximity to the NADPH nicotinamide ring.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> However, there has been no experimental evidence supporting the shuttling of FAD isoalloxazine moiety. In addition, STEAP1, which lacks a RED that mediates electron transfer between NADPH and FAD, remains enigmatic for its definitive redox function. We have shown previously that chemically reduced heme in STEAP1 can efficiently reduce ferric/cupric substrates, and that STEAP1 could form a heterotrimer with STEAP2,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> but it is unclear whether STEAP1 can form a competent electron transfer chain from NADPH.</p>
<p>In this study, we established fully functional electron transfer chains in both STEAP1 and STEAP2 and determined the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of STEAP2 that may explain its low activity towards metal ion substrates. We also found that the FAD on STEAP2 becomes diffusible, which supports the “FAD-shuttling” hypothesis proposed in STEAP4 by Oosterheert et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Spectroscopy of STEAP2</title>
<p>Purified STEAP2 elutes as a single peak from a size-exclusion chromatography column and the elution volume corresponds to a molecular weight between ∼100 – 150 kD (Fig. S1A), suggesting that STEAP2 forms a homotrimer. A prominent heme absorption peak is present in the purified STEAP2, and the heme content typically ranges from 70 – 90 %. FAD is also detected in the purified STEAP2; however, its level varies and is less than 20 % based on the fluorescence of FAD released from denatured STEAP2. No NADP(H) can be detected in the purified STEAP2, suggesting that its association with STEAP2 is more transient than either heme or FAD.</p>
<p>The ferric heme in STEAP2 shows a Soret band at 413 nm and broad unresolved α/β bands centered around 550 nm (Fig. S1B). Upon dithionite reduction, the Soret band shifts to 427 nm and the α and β bands are well resolved at 560 and 532 nm, respectively (Fig. S1B). These UV-Vis spectral features are consistent with a bis-imidazole ligated <italic>b</italic>-type cytochrome. We further characterized the heme using magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy. The MCD spectrum of ferric STEAP2 (STEAP2(Fe(III))) shows strong Soret signals between 404 nm to 419 nm and no high-spin charge-transfer signal at wavelength above 600 nm (Fig. S1C). On the other hand, the MCD spectrum of ferrous STEAP2 (STEAP2(Fe(II))) has a much weaker Soret band but a very strong α band from 554 nm to 562 nm (Fig. S1C), consistent with the intense A-term Faraday effect of a typical low-spin <italic>b</italic>-type heme. Combined, both UV-Vis and MCD data indicate that the heme is in the low-spin state in both STEAP2(Fe(III)) and STEAP2(Fe(II)). The rigid low-spin heme in STEAP2 is consistent with its role of mediating electron transfer.</p>

<title>Metal ion reduction by heme</title>
<p>A previous study shows that membrane fractions from cell expressing STEAP2 has metal ion reductase activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> Here we measure the rate constant of electron transfer from STEAP2 heme to an iron substrate Fe<sup>3+</sup>-NTA.

The rate constants do not show dependence on [Fe<sup>3+</sup>-NTA]. We also measured the rate constants of STEAP1(Fe(II)) with Fe<sup>3+</sup>-NTA. STEAP1(Fe(II)) is readily oxidized in biphasic kinetics (Fig. S2A) and the rate constants <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub> show linear dependence on [Fe<sup>3+</sup>-NTA] (Fig. S2B). The rate of STEAP1(Fe(II)) oxidation by Fe<sup>3+</sup>-NTA is similar to those by Fe<sup>3+</sup>-EDTA or Fe<sup>3+</sup>-citrate,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> but the rates are significantly faster than STEAP2(Fe(II)) re-oxidation by Fe<sup>3+</sup>-NTA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>

<title>Electron transfer chain in STEAP1 and STEAP2</title>
<p>We proceed to assemble the complete electron transfer chain in STEAP2 with NADPH and FAD. We first pre-incubated STEAP2 with stoichiometric amount of FAD and then reacted it anaerobically with NADPH (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The Soret peak of ferric heme (A<sub>413</sub>) shifts to that of ferrous heme (A<sub>427</sub>) while the α and β bands are well resolved at 560 nm and 532 nm, respectively, indicating reduction of the heme (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The spectra of the resolved spectral species correspond to those of STEAP2(Fe(III)) plus FAD and STEAP2(Fe(II)) with reduced FAD, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, inset). The rate constant of the transition between the two resolved spectral species is 1.2 (± 0.2) × 10<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, inset). These results also suggest that the FAD reduction by NADPH and the heme reduction by reduced FAD are concomitant in STEAP2.</p>

<p>Since the residues interacting with the FAD isoalloxazine ring in STEAP2 (see below) and STEAP4 are largely conserved in STEAP1, we were curious whether the isoalloxazine ring of reduced FAD can bind STEAP1 TMD and reduce the heme. We prepared reduced FAD by titrating FAD with dithionite anaerobically. We found that the reduced FAD readily reduces STEAP1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>) and the time courses show biphasic kinetics (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). The rate constants of both phases exhibit dependence on [FAD] and K<sub>M</sub> is estimated to be 2.7 and 4.7 μM, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, inset). This result suggests that an electron transfer chain can be established in STEAP1 from reduced FAD to metal ion substrates.</p>

<title>STEAP1 reduction by b<sub>5</sub>R</title>
<p>We proceed to examine whether STEAP1 can obtain electrons from cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> reductase (<italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub>R), which utilizes NADH to reduce FAD and is known to partner with cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub> to reduce many other hemeproteins and nonheme iron centers. We purified <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub>R and prepared an anaerobic mixture STEAP1 and <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub>R and then added NADH to initiate electron transfer. In the rapid-scan reaction of the STEAP1/<italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub>R mixture with NADH, the Soret absorbance of STEAP1(Fe(III)) (A<sub>413</sub>) shifts to that of the ferrous heme (A<sub>427</sub>) with well split α and β bands at 560 nm and 530 nm, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), demonstrating the reduction of the STEAP1 heme. Three spectral species, <italic>A</italic> – <italic>C</italic>, are resolved with the rate constants of 177.9 (± 35.3) s<sup>-1</sup> (<italic>A</italic> to <italic>B</italic>) and 0.13 (± 0.006) s<sup>-1</sup> (<italic>B</italic> to <italic>C</italic>), respectively. The spectral species <italic>A</italic> corresponds to STEAP1(Fe(III)) plus <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub>R and species <italic>C</italic> is STEAP1(Fe(II)) with reduced <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub>R, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, inset). On the other hand, the spectral intermediate <italic>B</italic> has decreased absorbance in 420 – 500 nm range compared to <italic>A</italic> but with little change in the Soret range (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, inset) indicating that <italic>B</italic> contains reduced FAD and ferric heme. The resolution of <italic>B</italic> is due to the fast <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub>R reduction by NADH without significant electron transfer from the reduced FAD to STEAP1. The <italic>B</italic> to <italic>C</italic> conversion reflects the electron transfer from <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub>R to STEAP1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). It is interesting to notice that <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub>R reduces the heme in STEAP1 significantly faster than reduction of heme in STEAP2 by its own RED (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Cryo-EM structure of STEAP2</title>
<p>We determined the structure of STEAP2 using cryo-EM to an overall resolution of 3.2 Å. The quality of density map was sufficient to build all the major structural elements of STEAP2 <italic>de novo</italic> (Figs. S4&amp;5). The N-terminal residues 1 – 27, C-terminal residues 470 – 490, and residues 332 – 353 (loop between TM3 and 4) are not resolved in our EM map, likely due to high degree of flexibility (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Like STEAP4, STEAP2 has a domain-swapped homotrimer structure, where the RED of one protomer interacts with the TMD of a neighboring protomer (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref> &amp; b).

The distance of the isoalloxazine ring of FAD to the nearest nicotinamide ring of NADP<sup>+</sup> is ∼19 Å (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>), which is too long for direct hydride transfer. We also found densities that likely correspond to a phospholipid and cholesterol.

<title>STEAP1 reduction by STEAP2</title>
<p>To test whether the FAD in STEAP2 undergoes significant conformational change during the electron transfer (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Scheme 1</xref>), we examined whether FAD from STEAP2 can be utilized by STEAP1. We prepared a mixture of STEAP2 (plus stoichiometric FAD) and STEAP1 and reacted the STEAP mixture with NADPH (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). In this reaction, the Soret absorbance shifts from 413 nm to 427 nm and finally a narrow peak is observed at 427 nm with no shoulder at 413 nm (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>), indicating that heme in both STEAP2 and STEAP1 is fully reduced. In the same reaction mixture minus STEAP2, only minor auto-reduction of STEAP1 is observed (Fig. S6), which is likely due to the slow reduction of FAD by NADPH. Only two spectral species are resolved from the reaction of STEAP1/STEAP2 mixture with NADPH, corresponding to STEAP(Fe(III)) plus FAD and STEAP(Fe(II)) plus reduced FAD, with a rate constant of 5.5 × 10<sup>-4</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, inset).

<title>The role of bulky Leu230 in electron transfer in STEAP1</title>
<p>The efficient electron transfer from <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub>R to STEAP1 provided us a tool to test the hypothesis that the electron transfer in STEAPs is mediated by the bulky residue located halfway between the FAD and heme.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> Such a bulky sidechain is relatively conserved in STEAPs, Leu230 in STEAP1, Leu371 in both STEAP2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) and STEAP3, and Phe359 in STEAP4.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> We mutated Leu230 in STEAP1 to glycine which does not have a sidechain and examined the electron transfer rate in L230G STEAP1 with <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub>R. The L230G STEAP1 has identical UV-Vis spectra to these of the wild-type (WT), suggesting that the mutation does not perturb the heme binding (Fig. S7). L230G STEAP1 is reduced by <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub>R with three spectral species, <italic>A</italic> – <italic>C</italic>, and the rate constants are 78.8 (± 22.6) s<sup>-1</sup> (<italic>A</italic> to <italic>B</italic>) and 0.02 (± 0.01) s<sup>-1</sup> (<italic>B</italic> to <italic>C</italic>) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, inset). Species <italic>A</italic> corresponds to L230G STEAP1(Fe(III)) and <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub>R while species <italic>C</italic> represents L230G STEAP1(Fe(II)) and reduced <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub>R (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, inset). As in WT STEAP1, fast reduction of <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub>R by NADH leads to the resolution of spectral intermediate <italic>B</italic>, which has decreased absorbance in 420 – 500 nm region but nearly unchanged Soret absorbance compared to <italic>A</italic>. On the other hand, the <italic>B</italic> to <italic>C</italic> conversion rate constant is much slower in L230G STEAP1 than in WT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), indicating that the heme reduction by <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub>R decreases significantly in L230G STEAP1.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we constructed the electron transfer chains using purified STEAP1 and STEAP2 and determined the structure of STEAP2. Although STEAP isozymes are known to reduce metal ions in cell-based assays,<italic><sup>2</sup></italic>direct monitoring of the redox state changes in the cofactors or heme has not been reported and our study paves the way for rigorous interrogation of individual electron transfer steps for better understanding of both the mechanism and cellular functions of STEAPs.</p>
<p>We demonstrate that STEAP1 is capable of metal ion reduction and that STEAP1 can be reduced by an FAD-dependent reductase <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub>R. These results define a potential cellular function of STEAP1 and raise an interesting perspective that other flavin-dependent reductases such as P450 reductase, methionine synthase reductase, and NADPH-dependent diflavin oxidoreductase 1 may also supply reduced FAD to STEAP1. These flavin-dependent reductases are ubiquitously expressed in cells and may be relevant to cancer progression and tumorigenicity; for example, high expression of <italic>b</italic><sub>5</sub>R isozyme 3 promotes colonization and metastasis in estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> Compared to STEAP2 – 4, the lack of a RED domain in STEAP1 may allow it to partner with a larger pool of flavin-dependent reductases. Alternatively, STEAP1 could assemble with STEAP2 to form a heterotrimer, as we have shown in a previous study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> to acquire FAD from the RED of a neighboring STEAP2 protomer.</p>
<p>The structure of STEAP2 suggests that its substrate binding site is less defined than other STEAP isozymes, indicated by the unresolved residues 332 – 353 between TM3 and 4. In the structures of STEAP1 and STEAP4, the corresponding residues form an extracellular loop by the substrate binding site,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> and presumably help substrate binding. The slow Fe<sup>3+</sup>-NTA reduction by STEAP2 is likely due to poor substrate binding. These structural differences that lead to substantially decreased reduction of metal ion substrates may imply the difference of native substrates between STEAP2 and other isozymes. The structure of STEAP2 shows that FAD assumes an extended conformation, like in STEAP4, that cannot receive hydride from NADPH, which is 19 Å away. The assembly of an intracellular RED with a membrane-embedded TMD observed in NOX, DUOX, and STEAPs naturally led to the notion that NADPH, FAD, and heme form an uninterrupted rigid electron-transfer chain that shuttles electron from the intracellular cellular NADPH to the extracellular substrates. While this may be true for NOX and DUOX, in which rapid supply of electrons to their extracellular substrates are essential to their biological functions, it may not apply similarly to STEAPs since it has only one heme in the TMD, and their electron transfer relies on shuttling of FAD. Our observations that FAD from STEAP2 can be utilized by STEAP1 is consistent with such relatively flexible structures.</p>

<p>This important study reveals the structure of human STEAP2 for the first time and suggests the electron transport pathway, but some questions remain regarding the interpretation of the in vitro electron transport experiments, the lack of available redox couples, and potential alternative hypotheses that would if addressed, strengthen the claims in the manuscript.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>One of the clear strengths of the manuscript that stands out is the determination of the structure of human STEAP2. The structures of some other homologs are known, but STEAP2's structure was not, and STEAP2 seems to have an unusually low activity towards certain metal chelates. The approach of producing the human STEAP2 in insect cells with the supplementation of cofactor biogenesis components nicely results in cofactor-replete protein. The structure of STEAP2 reveals a domain-swapped trimer, with the NADPH-binding domain of the neighboring protomer within electron-transport distance of the FAD-heme axis. The FAD has an interesting and somewhat unusual extended conformation and abuts a Leu residue that may regulate electron transport. Another strength of the manuscript is the demonstration that STEAP1, which does not have the internal NADPH binding domain, can interact modestly and shuttle electrons to the heme in STEAP1 through FAD. These experiments nicely expand information on the function of STEAP1 and provide a structural basis for electron transport in STEAP2.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>A major weakness in the manuscript lies with the kinetics data and how the data, as presented, are unclear to the reader regarding their impact and their connection to the purported electron transport scheme. While multiple sets of data are reported, the analysis in all cases is simply the reduction of a hexacoordinate heme and its related spectra and kinetic parameters. In most cases, it's unclear to the reader which part of the electron pathway is being tested in which experiment. Simple diagrams would be helpful in each case. However, it's also unclear if all of the potential order of addition experiments were actually performed; i.e., flavin but no NADPH; NADPH but no flavin; flavin before NADPH; flavin after NADPH, etc. As there are multiple permutations that should be tested to demonstrate the electron transport pathway, presenting the data in a way that makes it clear to the reader is challenging. Particularly missing are the determined redox potentials of the hemes in both STEAP1 and STEAP2. Could differences in these heme redox potentials be drivers of the difference in metal reduction rates? Also, the text indicates that STEAP2 does not show a reduction rate dependence on the [Fe3+-NTA], but Figure 1A shows a difference in rates dependent on [Fe3+-NTA], and the shape of the reduction curve also changes based on [Fe3+-NTA]. This discrepancy should be rectified.</p>
<p>A second major weakness is the lack of any verification of the relevance of the STEAP2 oligomerization to its in vivo function. Is the same domain-swapped trimer known to exist in vivo? If the protein were prepared in other detergents, is the oligomerization preserved? It is alluded to in the text that another STEAP protein is also a trimer. Was this oligomerization verified in vivo? Could this oligomerization be disrupted to impede or abrogate electron transport to underscore the oligomerization relevance? This point is germane, as it would further suggest that the domain-swapped trimer observed in the STEAP2 cryo-EM structure is physiologically relevant, especially given how far the distance between the NADPH and the FAD would otherwise be to support electron transport.</p>
<p>Beyond these two areas in which the manuscript could be improved there are a couple of minor considerations. First, the modest resolution of the STEAP2 structure prevents assigning the states of NADP+/NADPH and FAD/FADH2 with confidence. An orthogonal measure would be useful for modeling the accurate states in the structure. Finally, the BLI b5R/STEAP1 binding/unbinding fits seem somewhat poor, especially at high concentrations of b5R in the dissociation regime, which likely influences the derived value of Kd. A different fitting equilibrium might yield better agreement between the experimental and theoretical results. Moreover, whether this binding strength is influenced by the reduction state of the NADPH would be helpful in understanding and contextualizing the weak binding affinity.</p>

<p>The manuscript provides new insight into a family of human enzymes. It demonstrates that STEAP2 can reduce iron and STEAP1 can be promiscuous regarding the source of electron donors that it can use. The quality of the kinetics experiment and the structural analysis is excellent. I am less enthusiastic about the interpretation of data and the take-home message that the manuscript intends to deliver. Above all, the work combines data on STEAP2 and STEAP1 and it remains unclear which questions are ultimately addressed. A second critical point is about the interpretation of the experiment demonstrating that STEAP1 can be reduced by cytochrome b5 reductase. The abstract states that &quot;We show that STEAP1 can form an electron transfer chain with cytochrome b5 reductase&quot; whereas the main text discusses the data by suggesting that &quot;we speculate that FAD on b5R may partially dissociate to straddle between the two proteins&quot;. The two statements seem to be partly contradictory. Cytochrome b5 reductases do not easily release FAD but rather directly donate electrons to heme-protein acceptors (PMID: 36441026). According to the methods section, no FAD was added to the reaction mix used for the cytochrome b5 reductase experiment. Overall, the data seem to indicate that the reductase might reduce the heme of STEAP1 directly. Would it be possible to check whether FAD addition affects the kinetics of the process? And to perform a control experiment to check that NAD(P)H does not directly reduce the heme of STEAP1 (though unlikely)? A final point concerns the &quot;slow Fe3+-NTA reduction by STEAP2&quot;. The reaction is not that slow as the initial phase is 2 per second. The reaction does not show dependence on the substrate concentration suggesting &quot;poor substrate binding&quot;. I am not convinced by this interpretation. Poor substrate binding would give rise to substrate dependency as saturation would not be achieved. A possible interpretation could be that substrate binding is instead tight and the enzyme is saturated by the substrate. Can it be that the reaction is limited by non-productive substrate-binding and/or by interconversions between active and non-active conformations?</p>

<p>The six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate (STEAP) family comprises four members in metazoans. STEAP1 was identified as integral membrane protein highly upregulated on the plasma membrane of prostate cancer cells (PMID: 10588738), and it later became evident that other STEAP proteins are also over expressed in cancers, making STEAPs potential therapeutic targets (PMID: 22804687). Functionally, STEAP2-4 are ferric and cupric reductases that are important for maintaining cellular metal uptake (PMIDs: 16227996, 16609065). The cellular function of STEAP1 remains unknown, as it cannot function as an independent metalloreductase. In the last years, structural and functional data have revealed that STEAPs form trimeric assemblies and that they transport electrons from intracellular NADPH, through membrane bound FAD and heme cofactors, to extracellular metal ions (PMIDs: 23733181, 26205815, 30337524). In addition, numerous studies (including a previous study from the senior authors) have provided strong implications for a potential metalloreductase function of STEAP1 (PMIDs: 27792302, 32409586).</p>
<p>This new study by Chen et al. aims to further characterize the previously established electron transport chain in STEAPs in high molecular detail through a variety of assays. This is a well-performed, highly specialized study that provides some useful extra insights into the established mechanism of electron transport in STEAP proteins. The authors first perform a detailed spectroscopic analysis of Fe3+-NTA reduction by STEAP2 and STEAP1, confirming that both purified proteins are capable of reducing metal ions. A cryo-EM structure of STEAP2 is also presented. It is then established that STEAP1 can receive electrons from cytochrome b5 reductase, and the authors provide experimental evidence that the flavin in STEAP proteins becomes diffusible.</p>
<p>The specific aims of the study are clear, but it is not always obvious why certain experiments are performed only on STEAP2, on STEAP1, or on both isoforms. A better justification of the performed experiments through connecting paragraphs and proper referencing of the literature would improve readability of the manuscript. Experimentally, the conclusions are appropriate and mostly consistent with the experimental data, although one important finding can benefit from further clarification. Namely, the observation that STEAP1 can form an electron transfer chain with cytochrome b5 reductase in vitro is an exciting finding, but its physiological relevance remains to be validated. The metalloreductase activity of STEAP1 in vitro has been described previously by the authors and by others (PMIDs: 27792302, 32409586). However, when over expressed in HEK cells, STEAP1 by itself does not display metal ion reductase activity (PMID: 16609065), and it was also found that STEAP1 over expression does not impact iron uptake and reduction in Ewing's sarcoma (cancer) cells (PMID: 22080479). Therefore, the physiological relevance of metal ion reduction by STEAP1 remains controversial. The current work establishes an electron transfer chain between STEAP1 and cytochrome b5 reductase in vitro with purified proteins. However, the conformation of this metalloreductase activity of the STEAP1-cytochrome b5 complex will be required in a cell line to prove that the two proteins indeed form a physiological relevant complex and that the results are not just an in vitro artefact from using high concentrations of purified proteins.</p>
<p>The work will be interesting for scientists working within the STEAP field. However, some of the presented data are redundant with previous findings, moderating the study's impact. For instance, the new structural insights into STEAP2 are limited because the structure is virtually identical to the published structures of STEAP4 and STEAP1 (PMIDs: 30337524, 32409586), which is not surprising because of the high sequence similarity between the STEAP isoforms. Moreover, the authors provide experimental evidence to prove the previous hypothesis (PMID: 30337524) that the flavin in STEAP proteins becomes diffusible, but the molecular arrangement of a STEAP protein, in which the flavin interacts with NADPH, remains unknown. Based on the manuscript title, I would also expect the in-depth characterization of STEAP1/STEAP2 hetero trimers (first identified by the authors), but this is only briefly mentioned. When taken together, this study by Chen et al. strengthens and supports previously published biochemical and structural data on STEAP proteins, without revealing many prominent conceptual advances.</p>
