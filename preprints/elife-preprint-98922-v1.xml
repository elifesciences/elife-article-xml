<title>Abstract</title><p>Motivation depends on dopamine, but might be modulated by acetylcholine which influences dopamine release in the striatum, and amplifies motivation in animal studies. A corresponding effect in humans would be important clinically, since anticholinergic drugs are frequently used in Parkinson’s disease, a condition that can also disrupt motivation. Reward and dopamine make us more ready to respond, as indexed by reaction times (RT), and move faster, sometimes termed vigour. These effects may be controlled by preparatory processes that can be tracked using EEG. We measured vigour in a placebo-controlled, double-blinded study of trihexyphenidyl (THP), a muscarinic antagonist, with an incentivised eye movement task and EEG. Participants responded faster and with greater vigour when incentives were high, but THP blunted these motivation effects, suggesting that muscarinic receptors facilitate invigoration by reward. Preparatory EEG build-up (contingent negative variation; CNV) was strengthened by high incentives and by muscarinic blockade, although THP reduced the incentive-effect. The amplitude of preparatory activity predicted both vigour and RT, although over distinct scalp regions; frontal activity predicted vigour, whereas a larger, earlier, central component predicted RT. The incentivisation of RT was partly mediated by the CNV, though vigour was not. Moreover, the CNV mediated the drug’s effect on dampening incentives, suggesting that muscarinic receptors underlie the motivational influence on this preparatory activity. Taken together, these findings show that a muscarinic blocker impairs motivated action in healthy people, and that medial frontal preparatory neural activity mediates this for RT.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Motivation is our ability to exert effort to obtain reward, and can be dramatically impacted in psychiatric and neurological disorders. One simple index of motivation is response vigour: an increase in movement speed with reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dudman &amp; Krakauer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Shadmehr et al., 2010</xref>). Motivation and the lack of motivation (apathy) have been linked to dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">McGuigan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Walton &amp; Bouret, 2019</xref>), and accordingly, vigour is reduced in Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Beierholm et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Da Silva et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mazzoni et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Zénon et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Striatal dopamine levels ramp up before potentially rewarding actions. Animal work demonstrates that acetylcholine controls these dopaminergic effects, both via firing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Forster &amp; Blaha, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Mark et al., 2011</xref>), as well as local release in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cachope &amp; Cheer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Shen et al., 2007</xref>). These provide two mechanisms for acetylcholine to affect motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Collins et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hoebel et al., 2007</xref>), with muscarinic receptors in nucleus accumbens playing an important role in facilitating reward-related vigour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Collins et al., 2016</xref>), possibly by potentiating dopamine release and affecting the frequency-sensitivity of striatal dopaminergic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Collins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Threlfell et al., 2010</xref>). However, the ultimate effect of systemic muscarinic drugs on motivation is complex. Muscarinic antagonism has impaired motivation in some animal studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Collins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Ostlund et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Pratt &amp; Kelley, 2004</xref>), while improving it in others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hailwood et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Nunes et al., 2013</xref>), and even less is known of how they affect humans. Pro-cholinergic drugs may ameliorate clinical apathy, a disabling symptom seen in around 50% of patients with Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Devos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fahed &amp; Steffens, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Pagonabarraga et al., 2015</xref>), yet cholinergic <italic>blockers</italic> are commonly used to treat the motor symptoms. This frequently puts clinicians in a dilemma when treating patients with both tremor, which responds well to anti-cholinergic drugs such as trihexyphenidyl, but also apathy and cognitive impairment, which both respond to pro-cholinergic drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bohnen et al., 2022</xref>). Distinguishing the mechanisms by which acetylcholine receptors contribute to movement and motivation will be critical for selecting appropriate treatments in these patients. A first step would be to test whether the effects of muscarinic blockade on motivation, observed in animals, generalise to humans.</p>
<p>Motivation influences action selection and movement invigoration based on the motivational state that is set up before the action. One potential mechanism of this may be preparatory activation of frontal premotor areas, which may be indexed on EEG by the contingent negative variation (CNV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Walter, Cooper, Aldridge, McCallum, &amp; Winter, 1964</xref>), a slow negative potential that appears between a warning stimulus and a prompt to act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brunia et al., 2012</xref>). Early models of the CNV proposed that it reflected cholinergic activity, modulated by dopamine, noradrenaline and GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Timsit-Berthier, 1991</xref>). Supporting this, muscarinic antagonists were found to disrupt the CNV in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ebenezer, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Papart, Ansseau, &amp; Timsit-Berthier, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Pirch, Corbus, Rigdon, &amp; Lyness, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Papart et al., 1997</xref>). This anticipatory signal reflects preparatory activation of supplementary motor area and anterior cingulate, that can be amplified by reward signals from ventral striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nagai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Plichta et al., 2013</xref>). As a marker of motivation, the CNV is of great clinical interest, being decreased by depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ansseau et al., 1985</xref>) and Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Ikeda et al., 1997</xref>), and conversely, increased by dopaminergic medications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Linssen et al., 2011</xref>). Accordingly, the CNV is strengthened by monetary incentives dependent on performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Berchio, Rodrigues, Strasser, Michel, &amp; Sandi, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Novak, Novak, Lynam, &amp; Foti, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Novak &amp; Foti, 2015</xref>) and reward contingency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Frömer et al., 2021</xref>). Changes in the CNV could therefore provide a mechanistic handle on the effect of drugs on motivation.</p>
<p>Here we ask whether blocking muscarinic receptors would reduce motivation and increase distractibility in humans, and further, whether this is mediated by preparatory activity in medial frontal areas. To test this, we measured the CNV in healthy adults after administration of an M1r antimuscarinic acetylcholine antagonist (Trihexyphenidyl; THP) or placebo (double-blinded), while they performed an incentivised eye movement task. We used a task that independently measured action selection and energisation, which may involve different neural mechanisms.</p>

<sec id="s2">
<title>Results</title>
<p>After fixating on one of three circles, participants heard an incentive cue stating the maximum reward available for the trial (50p or 0p), and 1500ms after a preparation cue they made a saccade towards the circle that dimmed, and received a proportion of the maximum reward depending on their speed. On half of the trials, the non-target circle lit up, presenting a high-salience distractor. Participants completed this task once after receiving Trihexyphenidyl (THP; M1r antimuscarinic acetylcholine antagonist) and once after placebo (double-blinded), and we measured saccade initiation times, velocity and the pull of the distractor on the saccade trajectory, along with EEG.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Acetylcholine modulates invigoration by incentives</title>
<p>We measured vigour as the residual peak velocity of saccades within each drug session (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref> &amp; Methods/Eye-tracking), which is each trial’s deviation of velocity from the main sequence. This removes any overall effects of the drug on saccade velocity, while still allowing incentives and distractors to have different effects within each drug condition. As expected, residual peak velocity was increased by incentives (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>; β = 0.1266, p &lt; .0001), while distractors slightly slowed residual velocity (single-trial linear mixed effects regression: β = -0.0158, p = .0294; see <xref rid="figs1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – Figure supplement 1</xref> for full behavioural statistics). THP decreased the effect of incentives on velocity (incentive * THP: β = -0.0216, p = .0030), indicating that muscarinic blockade diminished motivation by incentives. Separate two-way analyses indicated this was driven mainly by trials when the distractor was absent (incentive*THP when distractors were: absent β=-.0268, p = .0071; present β=-.0164, p = .1224); although effects were in the same direction, and the three-way interaction was not significant (p &gt; .05), suggesting that the distractor-present trials had the same effect but weaker (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>).</p>

<p>a) Trial structure for a high-incentive trial with a salient distractor. After fixation on the pink starting circle, the incentive cue plays, and after a short fixation wait the preparation cue is given which is the fixation cross turning white. 1500ms later, one circle dims, which is the target, and on 50% of trials the other circle brightens (salient distractor). Feedback is given when participants saccade to the target, based on their speed. Timings are given below each screen. b) Eye position as a function of time for a selection of saccades. Saccade reaction time (RT) is the time at which the saccade begins, peak velocity is the maximal speed during the movement (steepest slope here), and amplitude is the distance to the saccade endpoint. c) Plotting peak velocity against amplitude (sample data) shows the main sequence effect (dashed lines) where larger saccades have higher velocity. We regressed velocity on amplitude separately within each drug session (to control for potential drug-effects on amplitude, velocity or the main sequence), giving residual peak velocity as our measure of vigour (solid vertical lines). d) Mean peak residual velocity for each condition. Incentives increased velocity, distractors decreased it, and THP reduced the invigoration by incentives. This interaction was significant only for the no-distractor trials. Crosses show individual participant means for each condition. E) Mean saccadic RT for each condition (log RT was analysed, raw values plotted here). High incentives decreased RT, distractors slowed RT, and THP reduced the effect of incentive on RT – which was driven by trials with distractors present. Crosses show individual participant means for each condition. The following figure supplements are available:</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>Saccadic RT (time to initiation of saccade) was slower when participants were given THP (β = 0.0244, p = &lt; .0001), faster with incentives (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e</xref>; β = -0.0767, p &lt; .0001), and slowed by distractors (β = 0.0358, p &lt; .0001). Again, THP reduced the effects of incentives (incentive*THP: β = 0.0218, p = .0002). Separate two-way analyses showed that this was driven by trials where the distractor was present (incentive*THP β=.0293, p = .0006), while this was not significant when distractors were absent (β=.0143, p = .0819) – although as the three-way interaction was not significant and the direction of effects was the same in the two, it suggests that distractors may simply have weakened this effect slightly. Additionally, the THP*Incentive interactions were correlated between saccadic RT and residual velocity at the participant level (<xref rid="figs1-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – Figure supplement 2</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Cholinergic blockade increases distractibility</title>
<p>We measured distractibility as the angular deviation of the eye position away from the target’s orientation towards the distractor’s location, at the start of the saccade, (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>), which indicates the pull of the distractor. The distribution of distractor pull is bimodal, with saccades directed towards either the target or distractor locations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>). When the distractor did not light up, the mean distractor angle was negative (i.e. away from the distractor angle), indicating repulsion away from the angle of the distractor, whereas when the distractor lit up and was salient the mean angle was biased towards the distractor (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>; β = 0.2446, p &lt; .0001; see <xref rid="figs1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – Figure supplement 1</xref><bold> for full statistics</bold>). THP increased the pull (main effect of drug, β = 0.0283, p &lt; .0001), but only when the distractor was salient (THP*distractor, β = 0.0226, p = .0012, pairwise drug effect: distractor absent: p &gt; .3; present: β=.0511, p &lt; .0001). Unlike in previous work, we found no effect of incentives on distraction (β=.0023, p = .7444), although speed-accuracy trade-off curves (<xref rid="figs2-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – Figure supplement 1</xref>) showed that incentives sped up responses in such a way that distraction was reduced for a given RT.</p>
<fig id="fig2" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure">
<label>Figure 2.</label>
<caption><title>Muscarinic blockade increases the pull from salient distractors.</title>
<p>A) Sample saccades showing fixation at the bottom left circle, the target on the right, and the distractor on the top. Distractor pull is the angle of the eye when it leaves the fixation circle, relative to a straight line from the fixation to target circle (positive values reflect angles towards the distractor, zero is flat, negative reflects repulsion). B) Mean distractor pulls for low and high incentives when the salient distractor is and is not present (crosses show individual participant means per condition). Distractor pull was negative (i.e., below the horizontal line in panel a) reflecting repulsion from the distractor when it did not light up. However, when the distractor did light up, distractor pull was positive, reflecting a bias towards it, and this bias was greater on THP than placebo (statistics are given in table in <xref rid="figs1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – Figure supplement 1</xref>). C) Mean kernel-smoothed density of distractor pulls for all trials with a distractor (averaged across all other conditions) with shading showing the within-subject standard errors. There is a smaller peak centred on the distractor’s orientation (grey dashed line and circle). Negative distractor pulls show the repulsive bias away from the distractor location. D) Mean kernel-smoothed densities showing the effects of incentive (i.e., 50p – 0p) and THP (i.e., THP – incentive) for all ‘with distractor’ trials. Cluster-based permutation testing showed that THP reduced the number of trials biased around -30°, indicating reduced repulsive bias when muscarinic receptors are antagonised. The following figure supplements are available:</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="454154v2_fig2.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>The drug-related increase in distraction could be due to either greater pull or reduced repulsion. To distinguish these possibilities, we plotted the distribution of distractor pull across trials where the distractor was present (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>). THP reduced the probability of repulsion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>) around -30°, indicating that THP reduced the repulsion away from the distractor’s location. This suggests weaker attentional suppression of the distractor. Incentives had little effect on the distribution (yellow line) in keeping with the averages in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>.</p>
<p>Therefore, acetylcholine antagonism reduced the invigoration of saccades by incentives, and increased the pull of salient distractors. We next asked whether these effects were coupled with changes in preparatory neural activity.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Preparatory neural activity is modulated by incentive and acetylcholine</title>
<p>We examined EEG activity in the delay period between the preparation cue and the target (and distractor) onset, first using three time-windows of interest, then a cluster-based permutation approach. There was an early fronto-central positive ERP with a peak around 220ms, consistent with the P3a (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>), which was then followed by a growing negative potential centrally, consistent with the CNV. From the grand-average ERP over all conditions, we chose 200-280ms at Cz for the early ERP, and 1200-1500ms at Cz for the CNV. Note that both these periods began &gt; 1.5 seconds after the incentive was presented.</p>

<p>A) Grand-average ERPs in electrode Cz split for the four conditions (low &amp; high incentive, placebo &amp; THP). The three time-windows are highlighted in different colours, and correspond to the columns of panels below. The ‘incentive’ window is a non-contiguous window of 900-1100ms after the incentive cue, just before the preparation-cue appears, which contains the late negative potential after the incentive cue. B-d) The mean voltages within each time-window for the different incentive and drug conditions (individual participants’ data are shown in Figure Supplement 1). B) Late ERP to the incentive cue (900:1100ms at Cz) was more negative when on THP than placebo, but it was not affected by incentive (p &gt; .05). c) Mean P3a (200:280ms after the preparation cue) is decreased by high incentives but unaffected by THP. D) The CNV (1200:1500ms after the preparation cue) is strengthened (more negative) by incentives and THP, with a weak interaction (p = .0213) as THP slightly reduces the incentive effect (flatter slope for the orange line; and THP lines are closer than Placebo lines in panel a). e-g) The β coefficients from regressing each component against each behavioural variable, with stars representing significant (p &lt; .0056; Bonferroni-corrected for 9 comparisons) associations (error bars are 95% CI).

<p>Prior to the preparation cue (900 to 1100ms after incentive cue, baselining at the incentive cue; green shaded area in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>), THP strengthened negativity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>, β= -.0597, p &lt; .0001), but incentives had no effect or interaction (p &gt; .05). After the preparation cue, the early ERP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>) was significantly smaller for high incentive trials (β= -0.01868, p = .0142; see <xref rid="figs3-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – Figure supplement 2</xref> for full ERP statistics). The subsequent CNV was strengthened (i.e. more negative; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>) by incentive (β = -.0928, p &lt; .0001) and THP (β = -0.0502, p &lt; .0001), with an interaction whereby <italic>THP decreased the incentive effect</italic> (β= 0.0172, p = .0213).</p>
<p>This suggests that while incentives strengthened the incentive-cue response and the CNV, muscarinic antagonism strengthened the P3a and the CNV, and the incentive*THP interaction was only seen on the CNV in the same direction as that seen with the vigour and RT – THP reduced the incentive-effect. Thus, although the drug and reward both increased the CNV buildup, the drug reduced the reward effect.</p>

<title>Neural preparation predicts RT and distraction</title>
<p>We regressed the mean amplitude of the pre-preparation activity, P3a and CNV against velocity, RT and distractor pull (including incentive, distractor and drug conditions as covariates), and Bonferroni-corrected the p-values for 9 multiple comparisons. Pre-preparation voltage and P3a did not predict any behavioural variable (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e-f</xref>), while CNV predicted RT and distractor pull (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3g</xref>, p &lt; .0001; see <xref rid="figs3-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – Figure supplement 3</xref><bold> for statistics</bold>) but not vigour.</p>
<p>As vigour was not associated with our <italic>a priori</italic> ERPs, we ran a window-free analysis to find spatial or temporal regions of the EEG activity that was associated with vigour, as well as RT and distractor-pull. This is an exploratory analysis, and given the small sample size should be interpreted with caution. We regressed each electrode and time-point against the three behavioural variables separately, while controlling for effects of incentive, distractor, THP, the interactions of those factors, and a random effect of participant. This analysis therefore asks whether trial-to-trial neural variability predicts behavioural variability. To assess significance, we used cluster-based permutation tests (DMGroppe Mass Univariate toolbox; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Groppe, Urbach, &amp; Kutas, 2011</xref>), shuffling the trials within each condition and person, and repeating it 2500 times (FWER=0.05). Velocity, RT and distraction were predicted by preparatory EEG voltages before the onset of the target, each with distinct patterns (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Residual velocity was significantly predicted by frontal electrodes from about 280ms after the preparation cue, which was strongest on electrode AF8. This did not encompass electrode Cz. RT was strongly predicted by EEG voltage over a very large scalp area, centred on Cz from about 250ms onwards. Distractor pull was predicted by frontal electrodes from about 120ms after preparation cue, and this spread posteriorly to reach central and posterior electrodes by about 650ms.</p>

<p>To check that these associations were not confounded by correlations between the saccadic measures themselves (e.g., RT is negatively correlated with residual velocity; r = -.0681, p &lt; .0001), we re-ran this analysis while controlling for the other two saccadic measures. This did not materially change the results, indicating that preparatory EEG predicts these aspects of performance independently (<xref rid="figs4-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – Figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Preparatory activity explains incentive effects on RT but not movement speed</title>
<p>We have found that neural preparatory activity can predict residual velocity and RT, and is also affected by incentives and THP. Finally we ask whether the neural activity can <italic>explain</italic> the effects of incentives and THP, through mediation analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Muller et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>As distractor pull was not affected by incentive, we only examined residual velocity and RT, and used linear mixed effects modelling to test the mediation. We used the electrodes with the strongest associations for each measure (AF8 for residual velocity and Cz for RT), and averaged them over 1200 to 1500ms. As <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> shows, Cz partially mediated the incentive effect on RT but not residual velocity. AF8 activity did not mediate either residual velocity or RT. This suggests preparatory negativity is a marker for invigoration of RT by incentives, but not movement energisation.</p>

<p>We also investigated whether either electrode could explain the cholinergic reduction in motivation (THP*incentive interaction) on RT – i.e., whether CNV mediated the THP moderation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref>). CNV mediated this moderation for RT, with both the influence of incentive on CNV, and CNV on RT being moderated by THP. This indicates cholinergic blockade changes how incentives affect preparatory negativity, and how this negativity reflects RT, which can explain some of the reduced invigoration of RT. However, this was not observed for saccade velocity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>When incentivised, participants initiated movements faster, and with faster velocity, but these motivational effects were reduced by blocking muscarinic acetylcholine receptors with THP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d-e</xref>). THP also reduced repulsion away from a salient distractor (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). The CNV, a fronto-central signal believed to reflect premotor preparatory activation, was stronger when incentives were present, and with THP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>), and crucially, THP reduced the incentive benefit on CNV, mirroring the behavioural effects. Neural preparation predicted RT and distractibility (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3g</xref>), with distinct scalp distributions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a-c</xref>). The CNV partially mediated the incentivisation of RT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>), and could explain the drug-induced reduction in incentivisation of RT via a mediated moderation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref>). No such associations were seen in the window before the preparation cue onset, suggesting these effects relate specifically to preparing motivated action, rather than simply an incentive effect (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">e</xref>). These results demonstrate a role of acetylcholine, and specifically muscarinic M1 receptors (M1rs), in motivation in humans.</p>
<p>Our behavioural measure of vigour was residual peak saccadic velocity, calculated separately within the drug and placebo sessions, and thus accounting for any overall drug effects on saccadic velocity or amplitude (or the linear relationship between the two, i.e., the main sequence). Previous studies have found this measure highly sensitive to incentivisation and motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Grogan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Manohar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Muhammed et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">2018</xref>), with higher peak velocities than expected for a saccade of that amplitude, the same pattern seen here and that was reduced when M1rs were antagonised. As antagonising M1rs reduced the incentivisation of residual peak velocity and saccadic RT, we can assume that M1rs normally play a facilitating role. This mirrors some studies using antimuscarinics in animal striatum to impair motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Collins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Ostlund et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Pratt &amp; Kelley, 2004</xref>), although those studies used scopolamine which antagonises M1-like and M2-like receptors, so effects may have been due to M2r antagonism. This complements previous work demonstrating that nicotine increases reward responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) by enhancing striatal anticipatory activity. Basal ganglia outputs, along with cholinergic activity from the pedunculopontine nucleus, project to the superior colliculus to disinhibit saccade initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kobayashi &amp; Isa, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Naicker et al., 2017</xref>) and also modulate ongoing instantaneous firing that controls velocity during saccades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Smalianchuk et al., 2018</xref>). This offers potential mechanisms for muscarinic receptors to influence movement vigour, together with other neurotransmitters such as dopamine, implicated in incentivisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Manohar et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>The three different ERPs used here reported differing effects; the incentive-cue response was affected by the drug but not by the incentive itself; the P3a was decreased by higher-incentives but not affected by the drug; the CNV was the only one affected by both incentives and the drug, and showing an interaction of the two. The specificity to the CNV suggests that M1r antagonism is reducing incentivisation during the action-preparation process, and not affecting overall sensitivity to the incentive. The CNV in the lead up to the target appearing was strengthened by the incentives, replicating previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Frömer et al., 2021</xref>; B. K. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Novak et al., 2016</xref>; K. D. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Novak &amp; Foti, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Schevernels et al., 2014</xref>). M1r antagonism reduced the effect of incentives on CNV, mirroring the reduced incentivisation on RT and residual velocity. This suggests that cholinergic transmission is needed at an early stage of motivational preparation. CNV amplitude predicted RT, along with distractor pull, and frontal activity in this same time-window predicted residual velocity, aligning with recent studies linking CNV to RT and accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Frömer et al., 2021</xref>), and to incentivisation of effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Berchio et al., 2019</xref>). Our associations held up even when controlling for the other behavioural variables, suggesting they were not due to factors such as the negative correlation of RT and velocity. Together these findings suggest that incentives determine a baseline level of motivation, dependent on acetylcholine, that is integrated while we decide to act, thus influencing the speed of action initiation.</p>
<p>The CNV has been linked to activity in the supplementary motor area and cingulate cortex, dependent on inputs from ventral striatum and thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nagai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Plichta et al., 2013</xref>), and on a range of neurotransmitters including dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Linssen et al., 2011</xref>) which also modulates motivational effects on vigour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Grogan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Manohar &amp; Husain, 2015</xref>). Therefore a potential mechanism for our observed effects is that M1r activation in the striatum modulates the excitability of striatal pathways, and increases dopamine release as seen in animal work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">de Klippel et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Galarraga et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Shen et al., 2005</xref>). Striatal muscarinic receptors could signal the pre-action, pre-decision level of motivation in humans.</p>
<p>No cognitive or computational model currently exists of how cholinergic modulation of dopamine affects aspects of motivation and motor control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Grahek et al., 2020</xref>). Previous studies have proposed that dopamine signals reward expectation which allows more cognitive and motor costs to be paid, in the form of both vigour and cognitive precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ott &amp; Nieder, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Westbrook et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast, acetylcholine has often been framed as increasing signal-to-noise ratio or amplifying attention in cortical processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bauer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cragg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Laube et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sarter et al., 2006</xref>). While a unified quantitative model will need considerable work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cools &amp; Arnsten, 2022</xref>), our data contribute by demonstrating that more than one locus of effect is likely.</p>
<p>The mediation analysis showed the incentivisation of RT could be partially explained by stronger CNV amplitudes, as could the antimuscarinic reduction in incentivisation. This mediated moderation was due to both reduced incentivisation of the CNV and reduced influence of the CNV on RT. These effects were rather small, which suggests the presence of an additional direct way for drug to affect incentivisation, perhaps via subcortical routes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Faure et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Mark et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Mena-Segovia et al., 2008</xref>) which could not be indexed by the ERPs in our study. There were no such mediations to explain the incentivisation of residual velocity, suggesting the CNV is not associated with the motivational preparation of <italic>motor</italic> speed of saccades. Animal studies link saccadic velocity to the instantaneous firing rate in the superior colliculus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Smalianchuk et al., 2018</xref>), which is inaccessible to EEG recordings, although the motivational modulation of this activity presumably arises from cortex or basal ganglia. Future investigations of other aspects of the EEG signals may illuminate us.</p>
<p>One potentially confusing finding is that although stronger CNV benefits RT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Frömer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Novak &amp; Foti, 2015</xref>) M1r antagonism strengthened the CNV while <italic>slowing</italic> RT. The mediated moderation we found indicates that THP changes how CNV predicts RT, which suggests that THP has two effects: one upstream of the CNV strengthening anticipation, and one downstream, decreasing the coupling to RT. The former could be associated with ventral striatal drive to the CNV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Plichta et al., 2013</xref>), while the latter could reflect drug-induced changes in non-motivational cholinergic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Gritton et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>While we have interpreted these effects as due to incentivisation, other closely related factors cannot be ruled out. When incentivised on this task, people expend more effort and also have a higher expectation of reward, which is linked to the effort they expend. Therefore it is possible that the CNV is measuring the greater expected reward induced by motivation, which is linked to faster saccades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Haith et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Shadmehr et al., 2019</xref>). The fact that no associations were seen between behaviour and neural activity in the time-window before the preparation cue might suggest that factors such as expected reward or arousal are less likely to explain our results. However, these explanations cannot be fully disentangled in this paradigm. We found that M1r antagonism led to a greater bias of distractor pull angles towards a salient distractor, which was unaffected by incentives. This fits with previous studies finding cholinergic involvement in attention and distraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fallon et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Gritton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Laube et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Sarter et al., 2016</xref>). However, we did <italic>not</italic> observe clear motivational improvements in distractibility, which have been seen previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hickey &amp; Van Zoest, 2012</xref>). This may be less surprising considering that the speed-accuracy trade-off dictates worse accuracy for faster saccades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Reppert et al., 2018</xref>) which is sensitive to the rewards available for responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hickey &amp; Van Zoest, 2012</xref>). Any motivational distraction effects might be weak in this study because the incentive schedule strongly favoured faster responses, and distractors were only present on half the trials, reducing the value of greater cognitive control. The repulsive bias away from the distractor was weakened by THP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>), which may be a behavioural manifestation of reduced reactive top-down control reported with muscarinic antagonism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Laube et al., 2017</xref>). But in our data, the distractor pull could be predicted by preparatory activity over 1 second before the target onset, and this was also affected by muscarinic blockade. The frontal signature of distractor pull was distinct to the pattern predicting RT, suggesting that cholinergic effects on proactive control and speed are dissociable.</p>
<p>Care should be taken when interpreting a lack of effects in this study, given the reduced power due to a smaller than expected sample size. This may be more applicable to the whole-brain regressions and the mediation analysis, so future replications would be useful to verify these results.</p>
<p>Additionally, as this study only tested young men, it is not known how generalisable the findings are to older adults, who may have age-induced changes in their cholinergic function, or indeed to patients with Parkinson’s disease, who have additional dopaminergic deficits. Recent work showed that cholinesterase inhibitor withdrawal in patients with Parkinson’s disease impaired a range of attentional and memory functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fallon et al., 2023</xref>), and investigating motivational impairments would be useful too. The effects of acetylcholine on motivation are of crucial importance in Parkinson’s disease, where the balance between dopamine and acetylcholine is disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Pisani et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Schulz et al., 2018</xref>), leading to apathy or impulsivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Devos et al., 2014</xref>). As trihexyphenidyl is often used to treat tremor in Parkinson’s disease, the finding that it impairs motivation suggests that it may worsen motivational symptoms in a population already troubled by apathy.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Muscarinic M1r antagonism reduced the incentivisation of saccadic peak velocity and RT, suggesting that normally M1r activity is important for motivation. The incentives strengthened the CNV, a preparatory EEG component, and this mediated the incentivisation of RT and the reduction of this incentivisation by the drug, implicating the CNV as a potential marker of muscarinic invigoration.</p>

<title>Design</title>
<p>We used a randomised, counterbalanced, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of Trihexyphenidyl (THP). Participants were tested twice (minimum one-week separation), once on placebo, and once on THP, making this a within-subject study. Ethical approval was granted by the University of Oxford MSIDREC (R45265/RE001).</p>

<sec id="s5b">
<title>Drugs</title>
<p>Participants were administered 2mg THP or 200mg lactose pills, both encapsulated in a digestible shell, and labelled A and B by a colleague not involved in the study. Participants were randomised to receive either tablet A or B on their first session, and B or A on their second. The experimenters did not know whether A or B contained the drug until all data were collected and pre-processed. On arrival, we checked participants felt well, and administered the dose. Testing began 1.5-2 hours later.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5c">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Our sample size calculations suggested 27 participants would detect a 0.5 effect size with .05 sensitivity and .8 power. We recruited 27 male participants, but due to the pandemic, we had to halt the study part-way, with 20 completed participants and 5 participants who had completed one session only. We only analysed the 20 completed participants, which achieved a post-hoc power of 0.7. The mean age was 28.15 years (SD = 8.03 years).</p>
<p>Participants read the information sheet, and gave written informed consent. Participants were screened for contraindications (e.g., cardiovascular disease, hypo/hypertension, cardiac arrhythmia, stroke, kidney/liver disease, psychiatric conditions, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, glaucoma, epilepsy, lactose hypersensitivity, porphyria) for the drug and placebo, and 1-lead ECG was taken to check for prolonged QTc interval of over 480ms. A medical doctor checked all this information before the participant was admitted to the study.</p>

<title>Task</title>
<p>To measure invigoration of saccades by incentives, we adapted an incentivised saccade task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Manohar &amp; Husain, 2015</xref>), where participants had to make speeded saccades to a low-salience target in exchange for money, while avoiding a high-salience distractor. The task was run in Matlab R2018b and Psychtoolbox-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kleiner et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Participants saw three grey circles each with a black fixation-cross (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>) on a black screen (11° apart), and had to fixate on the one that turned pink after 500ms (+0-100ms jitter) for 300ms. An audio <italic>incentive cue</italic> was played 200ms after fixation, 1100ms duration, of a voice saying ‘50p maximum’ or ‘0p maximum’ to indicate the maximum money available on this trial. Fixation was checked again after this to ensure fixation (300ms + 100ms wait), and then the black fixation-cross turned white. This was the <italic>preparation cue</italic>, which occurred 1500ms before the target onset. Then, one of the other two circles dimmed, indicating it was the target, and on 50% of trials the other circle simultaneously brightened, as a salient distractor. Participants were rewarded a proportion of the incentive based on how quickly they looked at the target circle, with an adaptive reward rule that had an exponential fall-off depending on the average reaction time in the previous up to 20 trials. This kept the rewards received roughly constant over the task. If participants looked at the distractor, they would need to make a corrective eye movement to the target, which would slow the time to reach the target, and result in less reward. Once gaze reached the target, a feedback sound was played if a medium (10-30p) or large (&gt;30p) reward was obtained, while the value of reward earned flashed in the centre of the target circle for 800ms. A 1100ms (+0-100ms jitter) rest period followed each trial, where participants were allowed to blink. The target on one trial became the fixation location for the next trial.</p>
<p>There were thus four trial types, with two maximum incentive levels (50p or 0p) and the presence or absence of a distractor. There were six of each trial in a block, giving 24 trials, and 20 blocks (480 trials in total; 120 per condition). Participants could pause as long as they liked between blocks, with a minimum 4-second break. The first trial of each block also had an extra 4-second rest period before the trial began to ensure participants were settled and ready.</p>
<p>Participants were given 24 practice trials during the screening visit and before the main task on each main visit. These included an extra fixation check during the 1500ms delay between the preparation cue and target onset, and if they moved their eye more than 1° during this time, the trial was flagged for repetition and the experimenter asked them to maintain fixation better. This training improved fixation during piloting.</p>
<p>In addition to this task, two other tasks were performed that are not reported in this paper, including a working memory task and a reversal learning task. We asked participants to rate how they felt on a visual analogue scale before and after the tasks, and participants also performed a pro- and anti-saccade task, and measurement of the pupillary light reflex.</p>

<sec id="s5e">
<title>Eye-tracking</title>
<p>We tracked participants’ eyes with an EyeLink 2000 (SR Research) at 1000Hz. Participants were seated 75cm from the screen, with their head on a chin-rest and forehead-rest. Nine-point calibration was performed at the start of the task, and one-point validation was done at the start of each block, with re-calibrations if necessary. Stimuli were shown on an ASUS VG248Qe3D screen (53×30cm, 1920×1080 pixels, 60Hz).</p>
<p>Saccades were parsed with standard criteria (velocity &gt; 30°s<sup>-1</sup>, acceleration &gt; 8000°s<sup>-2</sup>). We took the first saccade over 1° in amplitude within 100-900ms after the target onset, and calculated velocity with a sliding window of 4ms, excluding segments faster than 3000°s<sup>-1</sup> or where eye-tracking was lost. Saccades with peak velocities outside 50-1600°s<sup>-1</sup> were excluded.</p>
<p>Saccadic velocity is correlated with the amplitude of the saccade, an effect known as the main sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bahill et al., 1975</xref>), and saccade amplitude can also be affected by reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Grogan et al., 2020</xref>). To remove the effect of amplitude on velocity, we regressed peak velocity against amplitude within each participant and drug-session, combing across incentive-level and distractor-level, and took the residual peak velocity for each individual trial as our main measure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). This reflects the difference between the velocity measured and the velocity predicted by the main sequence, with positive values meaning faster than expected velocity. By calculating velocity residuals for each drug condition separately, this method removes any overall effects of the drug on velocity or amplitude, and instead measures individual trial variations within that drug condition. Velocity residuals have previously been shown to be most sensitive to reward manipulations of vigour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blundell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Grogan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Manohar, Finzi, Drew, &amp; Husain, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Manohar, Muhammed, Fallon, &amp; Husain, 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Saccadic reaction time (RT) was taken as the time between target onset and the start of the saccade (as detected by EyeLink velocity and acceleration criteria; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>) in ms; we used log RT for the analyses but plot raw RT. Distractor pull was measured as the angular deviation of the eye from a straight line linking the fixation and target circles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>) when it left the fixation circle; positive values reflected a bias towards the distractor, while negative values reflected a bias away from the distractor.</p>

<title>EEG acquisition and pre-processing</title>
<p>We recorded EEG with a Refa72 amplifier (TMSi, B.v Netherlands) at 1024Hz and using OpenVibe software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Renard et al., 2010</xref>). We used a 64-channel cap (TMSi). The ground was placed on the left clavicle, and we recorded horizontal EOG with bipolar electrodes placed either side of the eyes. Due to the cap, we could not place an EOG electrode above the eye, so one was placed 1cm under the left eye, and this was converted into a bipolar EOG signal as the difference from electrode FP1, which was the closest cap electrode to the left eye. Impedances were kept below 10KΩ as it was a high-impedance system.</p>
<p>Data were processed with custom Matlab scripts, and EEGLab and ERPLab toolboxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Delorme &amp; Makeig, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lopez-Calderon &amp; Luck, 2014</xref>). Channels were referenced to the average of the two mastoid electrodes A1 + A2, and synchronised with the eye-tracking traces using the EYE-EEG toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dimigen et al., 2011</xref>). Data were band-pass filtered at 0.1-80Hz with an IIR Butterworth filter, notch filtered at 50Hz with a stop-band Parks-McClellan filter, and down-sampled to 256Hz.</p>
<p>Epochs were from -200:1500ms around the preparation cue onset, and were baselined to the 100ms before the preparation cue appeared. We rejected trials where participants blinked or made saccades (according to EyeLink criteria above) during the epoch, or where EEG voltage was outside - 200:200μV (muscle activity). On average 104/120 trials per condition per person were included (SD = 21). A repeated-measures ANOVA found there were no significant differences in number of trials excluded for any condition (p &gt; .2).</p>
<p>We took the late CNV period (1200:1500ms) at electrode Cz as our <italic>a priori</italic> region of interest, along with the cue-P3 (200-280ms). In order to see whether our results were specific to preparatory activity, we looked at activity before the preparation cue began, and looked at the late ERP to the incentive cue. We epoched the data from -200:1100ms around the incentive cue onset (which was the duration of the incentive cue), and used the same artefact rejection criteria as above.</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>We used single-trial linear-mixed effects models to analyse our data, including participant as a random effect of intercept, with the formula ‘∼1 + incentive*distractor*THP + (1 | participant)’. We z-scored all factors to give standardised beta coefficients. For the difference-wave cluster-based permutation tests (<xref rid="figs3-4" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – Figure supplement 4</xref>), we used the DMGroppe Mass Univariate toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Groppe et al., 2011</xref>), with 2500 permutations, to control the family-wise error rate at 0.05. This was used for looking at difference waves to test the effects of incentive, THP, and the incentive*THP interaction (using difference of difference-waves). We adapted this toolbox to also run cluster-based permutation regressions to examine the relationship between the behavioural variables and the voltages at each electrode at each time point. On each iteration we shuffled the voltages across trials within each condition and person, and regressed it against the behavioural variable, with the model ‘∼1 + voltage + incentive*distractorPresent*THP + (1 | participant)’. This was repeated 2500 times, and the clustering used to control the family-wise error rate at .05. Given the relatively small sample size here, these whole-brain analyses should not be taken as definitive.</p>
<p>For the mediation analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Muller et al., 2005</xref>), we first checked that the behavioural variable (outcome) and ERP (mediator) were both significantly associated with incentive (treatment; behaviour ∼ 1 + incentive + (1 | participant)), and that the ERP was significantly associated with the behaviour when controlling for incentive (behaviour ∼ 1 + ERP + incentive + (1 | participant)). The mediation was measured by the reduction in the standardised beta coefficient between incentive and behaviour when the ERP mediator was included. Mediated moderation was used to see whether the effect of the drug on behaviour is mediated by the ERP. Moderation was first assessed by the significance of the interaction terms in predicting the behaviour and the ERP (behaviour ∼ 1 + incentive + drug + incentive*THP + (1 | participant), and was measured by the reduction in the beta coefficient for incentive between the previous model and the moderation model (behaviour ∼ 1 + incentive + drug + incentive*drug + ERP + ERP*THP + (1 | participant)). This measures how much of the association between incentive and behaviour was explained by allowing the ERP (mediator) to interact with the drug (moderator), i.e., mediated moderation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors used a motivated saccade task with distractors to measure response vigor and reaction time (RT) in healthy human males under placebo or muscarinic antagonism. They also simultaneously recorded neural activity using EEG with event-related potential (ERP) focused analyses. This study provides evidence that the muscarinic antagonist Trihexyphenidyl (THP) modulates the motivational effects of reward on both saccade velocity and RT, and also increases the distractibility of participants. The study also examined the correlational relationships between reaction time and vigor and manipulations (THP, incentives) with components of the EEG-derived ERPs. While an interesting correlation structure emerged from the analyses relating the ERP biomarkers to behavior, it is unclear how these potentially epiphenomenal biomarkers relate to relevant underlying neurophysiology.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study is a logical translational extension from preclinical findings of cholinergic modulation of motivation and vigor and the CNV biomarker to a normative human population, utilizing a placebo-controlled, double-blind approach.</p>
<p>While framed in the context of Parkinson's disease where cholinergic medications can be used, the authors do a good job in the discussion describing the limitations in generalizing their findings obtained in a normative and non-age-matched cohort to an aged PD patient population.</p>
<p>The exploratory analyses suggest alternative brain targets and/or ERP components that relate to the behavior and manipulations tested. These will need to be further validated in an adequately powered study. Once validated, the most relevant biomarkers could be assessed in a more clinically relevant population.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The relatively weak correlations between the main experimental outcomes provide unclear insight into the neural mechanisms by which the manipulations lead to behavioral manifestations outside the context of the ERP. It would have been interesting to evaluate how other quantifications of the EEG signal through time-frequency analyses relate to the behavioral outcomes and manipulations.</p>
<p>The ERP correlations to relevant behavioral outcomes were not consistent across manipulations demonstrating they are not reliable biomarkers to behavior but do suggest that multiple underlying mechanisms can give rise to the same changes in the ERP-based biomarkers and lead to different behavioral outcomes.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work by Grogan and colleagues aimed to translate animal studies showing that acetylcholine plays a role in motivation by modulating the effects of dopamine on motivation. They tested this hypothesis with a placebo-controlled pharmacological study administering a muscarinic antagonist (trihexyphenidyl; THP) to a sample of 20 adult men performing an incentivized saccade task while undergoing electroengephalography (EEG). They found that reward increased vigor and reduced reaction times (RTs) and, importantly, these reward effects were attenuated by trihexyphenidyl. High incentives increased preparatory EEG activity (contingent negative variation), and though THP also increased preparatory activity, it also reduced this reward effect on RTs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The researchers address a timely and potentially clinically relevant question with a within-subject pharmacological intervention and a strong task design. The results highlight the importance of the interplay between dopamine and other neurotransmitter systems in reward sensitivity and even though no Parkinson's patients were included in this study, the results could have consequences for patients with motivational deficits and apathy if validated in the future.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The main weakness of the study is the small sample size (N=20) that unfortunately is limited to men only. The generalizability and replicability of the conclusions remain to be assessed in future research with a larger and more diverse sample size and potentially a clinically relevant population. The EEG results do not shape a concrete mechanism of action of the drug on reward sensitivity.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Grogan et al examine a role for muscarinic receptor activation in action vigor in a saccadic system. This work is motivated by a strong literature linking dopamine to vigor, and some animal studies suggesting that ACH might modulate these effects, and is important because patient populations with symptoms related to reduced vigor are prescribed muscarinic antagonists. The authors use a motivated saccade task with distractors to measure the speed and vigor of actions in humans under placebo or muscarinic antagonism. They show that muscarinic antagonism blunts the motivational effects of reward on both saccade velocity and RT, and also modulates the distractibility of participants, in particular by increasing the repulsion of saccades away from distractors. They show that preparatory EEG signals reflect both motivation and drug condition, and make a case that these EEG signals mediate the effects of the drug on behavior.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This manuscript addresses an interesting and timely question and does so using an impressive within-subject pharmacological design and a task well-designed to measure constructs of interest. The authors show clear causal evidence that ACH affects different metrics of saccade generation related to effort expenditure and their modulation by incentive manipulations. The authors link these behavioral effects to motor preparatory signatures, indexed with EEG, that relate to behavioral measures of interest and in at least one case statistically mediate the behavioral effects of ACH antagonism.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In full disclosure, I have previously reviewed this manuscript in another journal and the authors have done a considerable amount of work to address my previous concerns. However, I have a few remaining concerns that affect my interpretation of the current manuscript.</p>
<p>Some of the EEG signals (figures 4A&amp;C) have profiles that look like they could have ocular, rather than central nervous, origins. Given that this is an eye movement task, it would be useful if the authors could provide some evidence that these signals are truly related to brain activity and not driven by ocular muscles, either in response to explicit motor effects (ie. Blinks) or in preparation for an upcoming saccade. For other EEG signals, in particular, the ones reported in Figure 3, it would be nice to see what the spatial profiles actually look like - does the scalp topography match that expected for the signal of interest?</p>
<p>A primary weakness of this paper is the sample size - since only 20 participants completed the study. The authors address the sample size in several places and I completely understand the reason for the reduced sample size (study halt due to COVID). That said, they only report the sample size in one place in the methods rather than through degrees of freedom in their statistical tests conducted throughout the results. In part because of this, I am not totally clear on whether the sample size for each analysis is the same - or whether participants were removed for specific analyses (ie. due to poor EEG recordings, for example). Beyond this point, but still related to the sample size, in some cases I worry that results are driven by a single subject. In particular, the interaction effect observed in Figure 1e seems like it would be highly sensitive to the single subject who shows a reverse incentive effect in the drug condition.</p>
<p>There are not sufficient details on the cluster-based permutation testing to understand what the authors did or whether it is reasonable. What channels were included? What metric was computed per cluster? How was null distribution generated?</p>
<p>The authors report that &quot;muscarinic antagonism strengthened the P3a&quot; - but I was unable to see this in the data plots. Perhaps it is because the variability related to individual differences obscures the conditional differences in the plots. In this case, event-related difference signals could be helpful to clarify the results.</p>
<p>For mediation analyses, it would be useful in the results section to have a much more detailed description of the regression results, rather than just reporting things in a binary did/did not mediate sort of way. Furthermore, the methods should also describe how mediation was tested statistically (ie. What is the null distribution that the difference in coefficients with/without moderator is tested against?).</p>
