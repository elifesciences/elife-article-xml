<title>Abstract</title><p>The evolutionarily conserved Hippo (Hpo) pathway has been shown to impact early development and tumorigenesis by governing cell proliferation and apoptosis. However, its post-developmental roles are relatively unexplored. Here, we demonstrate its roles in post-mitotic cells by showing that defective Hpo signaling accelerates age-associated structural and functional decline of neurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Loss of <italic>wts-1</italic>/LATS resulted in premature deformation of touch neurons and impaired touch responses in a <italic>yap-1/</italic>YAP-dependent manner. Decreased movement as well as microtubule destabilization by treatment with colchicine or disruption of microtubule stabilizing genes alleviated the neuronal deformation of <italic>wts-1</italic> mutants. Colchicine exerted neuroprotective effects even during normal aging. In addition, the deficiency of a microtubule-severing enzyme <italic>spas-1</italic> also led to precocious structural deformation. These results consistently suggest that hyper-stabilized microtubules in both <italic>wts-1</italic>-deficient neurons and normally aged neurons are detrimental to the maintenance of neuronal structural integrity. In summary, Hpo pathway governs the structural and functional maintenance of differentiated neurons by modulating microtubule stability, raising the possibility that the microtubule stability of fully developed neurons could be a promising target to delay neuronal aging. Our study provides potential therapeutic approaches to combat age- or disease-related neurodegeneration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neurons perceive extracellular signals and transmit the information to other cells, often over long distances. For this to happen, neuronal cells extend their axons and dendrites from 1 μm to more than 1 m and must maintain an intact morphology throughout their lifetime. The long, elaborate neuronal structures are vulnerable to degeneration associated with organismal aging or pathological conditions. Structural abnormalities and the consequent functional decline are hallmarks of aged neurons or pathological neurons affected by neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yankner et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bishop et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fjell and Walhovd 2010</xref>). Several studies have shown that the aged brain exhibits structural abnormalities such as synaptic loss, neuronal sprouting and restructuring, rather than neuronal cell death (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yankner et al. 2008</xref>)).</p>
<p>Microtubules form essential cytoskeletal structures for most eukaryotic cells. In neurons, they serve as structural struts that allow the neuron to develop and maintain a specific shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Barnes and Polleux 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Marin et al. 2010</xref>). They also act as railroads for motor proteins that deliver cellular cargo from cell bodies to distal axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hirokawa et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Maday et al. 2014</xref>), as well as seeds for microtubule polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Job et al. 2003</xref>). Microtubules of varying lengths are observed in neurons, and they can be both stable and dynamic. Numerous studies have suggested that both hyper- or un-stable microtubules are harmful for maintaining neuronal morphology as the imbalance in microtubule dynamics contributes to neurological diseases (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dubey et al. 2015</xref>)). Thus, microtubule regulators have been implicated in a number of human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dubey et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Matamoros and Baas 2016</xref>) and signaling pathways including Notch pathway have been proposed as pharmaceutical targets for cytoskeletal protection of postnatal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bonini et al. 2013</xref>). Microtubule dynamics in normal neuronal aging, on the other hand, are poorly understood at the organismal level.</p>
<p>The neurons of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> provide a valuable model system because they share fundamental characteristics with mammalian neurons in terms of their molecular basis and functions. Major genetic pathways governing early neuronal development such as neuronal cell migration or polarization were initially identified from numerous studies on <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hedgecock et al. 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wadsworth et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Culotti and Merz 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ikegami et al. 2004</xref>). Additionally, <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons could be utilized to understand the molecular mechanism of neuronal aging as they demonstrate age-associated structural and functional deterioration. In particular, touch receptor neurons (TRNs), comprising 2 ALM, AVM, 2 PLM, and PVM, show the most prominent decline in structure and function with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Pan et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Tank et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Toth et al. 2012</xref>). In aged animals, TRNs have highly wavy or ectopically branched processes, misshaped cell bodies with abnormal morphology or outgrown processes. Moreover, <italic>C. elegans</italic> exhibits gradual decreases in touch responses as they age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Tank et al. 2011</xref>). DAF-2/IGF pathway, JNK/MAPK pathway and membrane activity of TRNs have been identified to influence the speed of touch neuronal aging by modulating whole organismal senescence or cell-autonomous functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Pan et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Tank et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Toth et al. 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The Hippo (Hpo) kinase signaling pathway, which is evolutionarily conserved across animal species, plays a pivotal role in the regulation of tissue size homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Harvey et al. 2013</xref>). It regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis during early development and tumorigenesis. When the Hpo pathway is active, LATS, the core kinase of the pathway, phosphorylates and inhibits the nuclear localization of YAP, a transcriptional co-activator. In the nucleus, YAP regulates target gene expression through interaction with the TEAD transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Zhao et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Zhao et al. 2008</xref>). The dysregulation of this pathway promotes uncontrolled cell proliferation, leading to tumorigenesis and developmental problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Huang et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Zhao et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Harvey et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Zheng and Pan 2019</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, core components and their genetic interaction of the Hpo pathway are conserved. Inhibition of YAP-1/YAP by upstream WTS-1/LATS is needed for the maintenance of apicobasal membrane polarity of the developing intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kang et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lee et al. 2019</xref>). The functions of the Hpo pathway in growth control are extensively established; however, its post-developmental functions are relatively unknown.</p>
<p>Here, we establish a novel genetic animal model that reveals the postnatal roles of the Hpo pathway in the differentiated neurons. Loss of <italic>wts-1</italic> leads to premature decline of TRNs both in structure and function and downstream effectors, <italic>yap-1</italic> and <italic>egl-44,</italic> are required in this phenomena. We employ genetic and chemical approaches to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which <italic>wts-1</italic>-deficient TRNs lead to a premature deformation. Our results demonstrate that hyper-stabilized microtubules of the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant or aged organism are responsible for neuronal deformation. The fact that loss of <italic>spas-1</italic>, a putative microtubule-severing enzyme, accelerates onset of age-associated neuronal deformation also supports the contribution of hyper-stabilized microtubules in neuronal failures. Our study unveils the post-developmental functions of the Hpo pathway in the maintenance of neuronal integrity and highlights the importance of neuronal microtubule status in cellular aging and clinical approaches.</p>

<title><italic>wts-1</italic> mutant showed impaired structure of touch receptor neurons</title>
<p>A previous study demonstrated that the intestinal Hpo pathway is essential for the proper development of the intestinal lumen and loss of <italic>wts-1</italic>, the core kinase of the pathway, leads to early larval death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lee et al. 2019</xref>). To define the non-intestinal roles of the Hpo pathway in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we used the mosaic <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant system of which larval lethality was overcame with the intestine-specific expression of WTS-1. Since <italic>wts-1</italic> activity in all tissues except the intestine is absent in this system, hereafter we will refer to it as the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant shortly.</p>
<p>We observed that the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutants showed extremely distinctive abnormalities in the morphology of touch receptor neurons (TRNs). In the wild-type, ALM and its posterior homolog PLM extended their neuronal processes along the anterior-posterior axis and maintained structural integrity during adolescence (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A, B</xref>). However, the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant-ALM and PLM exhibited ectopic swelling/waviness and branching (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A, B</xref>), and other various deformations, including extended or shortened distal processes or outgrowth of processes from the cell body (somatic outgrowth) (Supplemental Fig. S1A, B). Atypical structures of other TRNs, AVM and PVM, were also found in the mutants (Supplemental Fig. S1C, D), indicating that <italic>wts-1</italic> is essential in mechanosensory neurons. As ALM and PLM defects were much more severe, frequent and easier to observe, we focused on these neurons for further study.</p>

<p>TRNs of <italic>C. elegans</italic> develop rapidly in their early life and govern escape behaviors in response to aversive stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chalfie et al. 1985</xref>). ALM and PLM complete their development during embryogenesis, whereas AVM and PVM develop until the first larval stage (L1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chalfie et al. 1985</xref>). To determine whether <italic>wts-1</italic> is required for the development or maintenance of TRNs, neuronal morphology of early larva was analyzed. The <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant had intact, unaltered neuronal processes of ALM and PLM at the very early L1 stage and the frequency of abnormal neurons gradually increased as the worms grew (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C, D</xref>). At the fourth larval (L4) stage, 98.89% of ALM and 84.44% of PLM, respectively, showed at least one morphological abnormality in the mutant whereas they maintain intact structures in the wild-type (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Among the abnormalities, ectopic swelling and branching on the processes were the most common (Supplemental Fig. S1E, F), followed by extension of the distal process and somatic outgrowth of the cell body (Supplemental Fig. S1G, H). All these structural deformations were gradually increased. Ectopic swelling or branching occurred multiple places in a single process and the number of swelling/branching also increased as the worms grew (Supplemental Fig. S1I).</p>
<p>To determine whether <italic>wts-1</italic> acts in the structural maintenance of neurons generally or TRNs specifically, we analyzed the morphologies of other neurons in the mutants. Dopaminergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic neurons were found to maintain structures comparable with those of the wild-type at the same age (Supplemental Fig. S1J, K). It is noteworthy that ALN, a cholinergic neuron that extends its process in association with ALM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">White et al. 1986</xref>), preserved their structural integrity in the mutants (Supplemental Fig. S1J). Thus, we concluded that the loss of <italic>wts-1</italic> leads to wide range of structural deformities specifically in TRNs and that this deformity is a matter of maintenance, rather than development of the structures.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title><italic>wts-1</italic> deficiency causes TRNs to deteriorate its structure and function</title>
<p>TRNs govern the aversive movements of worms in response to gentle body touches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chalfie et al. 1985</xref>). To determine whether structurally deformed TRNs of <italic>wts-1</italic> affect neuronal functions, we measured gentle touch responses of the mutant. At the L4 stage, control worms responded to almost every gentle touch (9.40 responses/10 touches), whereas <italic>wts-1</italic> mutants responded to 60% of stimuli (6.31/10) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). On the first day of adulthood (1DA), control worms showed slightly decreased touch responses compared with the L4 stage (8.25/10), whereas <italic>wts-1</italic> mutants displayed more impaired responses (5.57/10) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>The structural and functional decline in the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutants is very similar with phenotypes of normally aged animals. Morphological alteration and consequent functional decline are typically observed in the aged nervous system across the animal kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yankner et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bishop et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fjell and Walhovd 2010</xref>). Aging of human brain in the absence of disease is often accompanied by structural deformation, such as dendritic restructuring, neuronal sprouting and synaptic losses, rather than severe neuronal degeneration or cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yankner et al. 2008</xref>). Consistently, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system exhibits age-associated structural deformation. Among several neurons, TRNs exhibited the most robust decline in the structure and function during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Pan et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Tank et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Toth et al. 2012</xref>). Structural abnormalities of ALM or PLM appear from the 4<sup>th</sup> day of adulthood and occur in almost every individual after the 15<sup>th</sup> day of adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Toth et al. 2012</xref>). According to our observations, the degree of morphological deformation of the L4 stage <italic>wts-1</italic> was similar to that of the aged wild-type worms on the 15<sup>th</sup> day of adulthood. These results suggest that loss of <italic>wts-1</italic> leads to structural and functional impairment of TRNs precociously.</p>

<title><italic>yap-1</italic> and <italic>egl-44</italic> suppress premature deformation of <italic>wts-1</italic> TRNs</title>
<p>To determine whether <italic>yap-1</italic> acts downstream of <italic>wts-1</italic> in this phenomenon, we assessed genetic interaction of <italic>yap-1</italic> and <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant. In contrast to the <italic>wts-1</italic> mosaic mutant, the <italic>wts-1; yap-1</italic> mutant could survive without intestinal WTS-1 expression as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lee et al. 2019</xref>) and displayed intact neuronal processes without any swelling or branching (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Introduction of a mutation in <italic>egl-44</italic>, which is the worm homolog of TEAD and functions downstream of <italic>wts-1</italic> along with <italic>yap-1</italic> in the developing intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lee et al. 2019</xref>), was also sufficient to suppress the structural abnormalities of <italic>wts-1</italic> TRNs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). To better understand the basic features of structural dis-integrity in the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant and mitigating effects of the <italic>yap-1</italic> mutation, we examined TRNs from each genetic background using electron microscopy. In wild-type TRNs, multiple microtubules with characteristic spherical shapes were observed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). The number of microtubules present in cross sections of control ALM was comparable to the previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chalfie and Thomson 1979</xref>) (n = 39, 48, 55, respectively (Supplemental Fig. S2B)). In contrast, in the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant ALM, the number of microtubules significantly decreased (n = 16, 4, 18, respectively (Supplemental Fig. S2C)) and the morphology was also irregular and non-spherical (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Consistent with our finding using a fluorescence marker, the abnormalities in the number and shape of microtubules of TRNs were restored in the <italic>wts-1; yap-1</italic> mutant (n = 24, 30, 44, respectively (Supplemental Fig. S2D)) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). The loss of <italic>yap-1</italic> also restored the impaired touch responses of the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant. In comparison with the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant, touch responses of the <italic>wts-1; yap-1</italic> double mutant were significantly rescued (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D, E</xref>).</p>

<p>Furthermore, to rule out the possibility that the ameliorating effect of <italic>yap-1</italic> mutation on neuronal aging was an indirect result of the delayed organismal aging, we measured the lifespan of each mutant. The <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant had a shorter lifespan than the wild-type, suggesting that prematurely deformed neurons of the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant were probably due to accelerated organismal aging (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). However, given that the <italic>wts-1; yap-1</italic> mutant with restored neurons had a slightly shorter lifespan than the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>) and only TRNs were affected in the mutant, premature deformation of the <italic>wts-1</italic> neurons appeared to be a touch neuron-specific event, rather than being associated with whole body.</p>

<title>The Hpo pathway acts in a cell autonomous manner to maintain TRNs integrity</title>
<p>To ascertain whether these function of WTS-1 is cell-autonomous or not, we knock-downed WTS-1 selectively in TRNs by injecting tissue-specific-RNAi constructs into wild-type animals as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Esposito et al. 2007</xref>). <italic>S</italic>ense and <italic>a</italic>nti<italic>s</italic>ense constructs corresponding to a region containing kinase domain (sas1) or many exons (sas2) of the <italic>wts-1</italic> gene were expressed under <italic>mec-4</italic> promoter which is specifically active in all six TRNs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>).

<p>Regarding the action mechanism of the Hpo pathway in the cells, YAP-1 likely acts in the same cell with WTS-1. To clarify this, we rescued YAP-1 activity specifically in TRNs of <italic>wts-1; yap-1</italic> mutants. Touch neuronal expression of YAP-1 using a <italic>mec-4</italic> promoter was sufficient to re-emerge ectopic neuronal swelling in the <italic>wts-1; yap-1</italic> mutants. Approximately 40% of transgenic worms exhibited ectopic swelling and branching on ALM or PLM. In contrast, siblings containing no transgene preserved intact neuronal processes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E, F</xref>).</p>
<p>Overexpression of YAP is commonly observed in many human cancers and is associated with poor prognosis of the diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Liu et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yuan et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Guo et al. 2019</xref>). Inducible overexpression of YAP is sufficient to increase liver size in mice through transcriptional regulation of downstream genes that activate cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dong et al. 2007</xref>). To see if TRNs-specific overexpression of YAP-1 is sufficient to induce neuronal abnormalities, we overexpressed P<italic>mec-4</italic>::YAP-1 in a wild-type and found that overexpressing YAP-1 causes multiple neuronal defects in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G–J</xref>). Lower expression of YAP-1 (1 ng/μl, final concentration in the injection mixture) rarely affects neuronal structure of ALM or PLM (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I, J</xref>). Transgenic worms injected P<italic>mec-4</italic>::YAP-1 at 10 ng/μl final concentration slightly, but not significantly, elevated neuronal defects of TRNs. However, higher expression of YAP-1 in TRNs (50 or 100 ng/μl) resulted neuronal defects similar to TRNs-specific <italic>wts-1</italic> knockdown (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G–J</xref>). It seems that endogenous WTS-1 could inhibits overexpressed YAP-1 at lower concentration along with endogenous YAP-1, however, fails to inhibit overexpressed YAP-1 at higher levels. These results demonstrated that <italic>wts-1</italic> and <italic>yap-1</italic> act in a cell-autonomous manner to induce structural disintegration of TRNs; thus, proper regulation of YAP-1 activity by WTS-1 is important to maintain neuronal structural integrity.</p>

<title>Reduced movement alleviates the structural abnormalities of <italic>wts-1</italic></title>
<p>Neuronal processes contain bundles of microtubules, which are essential structural foundations that protect neurons from mechanical strain-induced damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Tang-Schomer et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Krieg et al. 2017</xref>). We hypothesized that the absence of <italic>wts-1</italic> would affect the microtubule stability in some way; thus, physical stresses generated by movement could induce spontaneous degeneration of neurons. To test this hypothesis, we slowed the movement of <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant via the knockdown of muscle machinery genes using RNAi and observed neuronal morphology. As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">MacLeod et al. 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Neumann and Hilliard 2014</xref>), the knockdown of muscle machinery genes, including a myosin heavy chain gene (<italic>unc-54</italic>), severely impaired organismal movement. Compared with the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutants who were fed with an empty vector (L4440), worms fed with <italic>unc-54</italic> RNAi exhibited uncoordinated movement and some of them were even immobilized (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Impaired movement resulting from <italic>unc-54</italic> knockdown were also appeared as reduced swimming of animals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). Consistent with our hypothesis, <italic>unc-54</italic> RNAi resulted in a significant reduction in neuronal swelling/branching events in ALM as well as PLM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B–D</xref>). The control ALM showed 7.67 lesions on average, whereas ALM treated with <italic>unc-54</italic> RNAi had 4.851 lesions at the L4 stage. For PLM, the events of swelling/branching occurred 6.59 times on average in the controls, whereas 2.96 in the <italic>unc-54</italic> RNAi fed neurons at the same stage (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Additionally, <italic>unc-54</italic> RNAi significantly increased the proportion of intact PLM without any swelling or branching (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). The knockdown of <italic>unc-15</italic> or <italic>unc-95,</italic> which encodes paramyosin (a structural component of thick filaments) and muscle LIM domain protein, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kagawa et al. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Broday et al. 2004</xref>), showed movement defects as well and exhibited ameliorative effects on neuronal structures (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E, F</xref>). In contrast, <italic>unc-89</italic> and <italic>deb-1</italic> RNAi failed to induce distinguishable movement defects in our experiments (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). As expected, <italic>unc-89</italic> RNAi did not mitigate neuronal swelling in the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutants and <italic>deb-1</italic> RNAi only had limited effects on ALM, and no effect on PLM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). These observations indicate that the severity of movement defects is inversely correlated with the severity of neuronal deformation and it strongly supports the hypothesis that <italic>wts-1</italic> neurons are vulnerable to physical stresses generated by organismal movements.</p>

<title>Treatment with colchicine, a microtubule-destabilizing agent, reduced ectopic lesions in <italic>wts-1</italic> neurons</title>
<p>For further understanding of the status of microtubules in the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant neurons, we evaluated the effects of drugs regulating microtubule stability in the mutant neurons. We transferred the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutants to the drug-containing plates at the L4 stage and scored the number of lesions including ectopic swelling and branching along the processes of their L4 stage-offspring. Interestingly, colchicine, a microtubule-destabilizing agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Vandecandelaere et al. 1997</xref>), greatly reduced the morphological abnormalities of the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). The drug-untreated ALM showed 5.88 swelling/branching events on a process, whereas the colchicine-treated ALM only had 2.95 swelling/branching. In the case of PLM, colchicine treatment reduced neuronal lesions from 4.41 to 0.89 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>). Structurally intact neurons were significantly increased by colchicine-treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I</xref>) and the beneficial effect of colchicine on neuronal structures was consistently observed in TRNs of 1DA offspring (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J, K</xref>). Furthermore, treatment with colchicine significantly improved touch responses of the mutants at L4 stage (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4L</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, treatment with paclitaxel, a microtubule-stabilizing agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Schiff et al. 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Vandecandelaere et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Yvon et al. 1999</xref>), failed to mitigate neuronal abnormalities of the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutants (Supplemental Fig. S4A–C). Because of the poor cuticle permeability of paclitaxel, we introduced a mutation in the <italic>bus-17</italic> gene that encodes galactosyltransferase to damage the cuticle of the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant, as performed in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bounoutas et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Neumann and Hilliard 2014</xref>). The number of neuronal lesions was comparable between the paclitaxel-treated <italic>wts-1</italic> neurons and untreated controls (Supplemental Fig. S4B). These results show that treatment with colchicine, not paclitaxel, lessened the morphological and functional alteration of <italic>wts-1</italic> neurons, suggesting that hyper-stabilized microtubules are responsible for the structural and subsequent functional decline of the mutant neurons.</p>

<title>Hyper-stabilized microtubules are responsible for age-associated neurodegeneration</title>
<p>Next, we questioned whether colchicine could protect neurons from age-associated morphological alteration in wild-type worms. As colchicine treatment had a detrimental effect on the neurodevelopment of wild-type unlike in case of the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant (Supplemental Fig. 5A), fully developed worms were transferred to colchicine-containing plates at the first day of adulthood (1DA), and neuronal morphologies were monitored in the same generation to assess age-associated morphological abnormalities. Among morphological alterations of TRNs, bead-like structures on the PLM did not accrue in the aged worms. Beaded PLM was most frequently observed in the young adults (2DA) and gradually decreased as the worms grew older (Supplemental Fig. 5I). This observation was consistent with the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Toth et al. 2012</xref>); thus, we excluded beaded PLM from defective neurons in further analyses.</p>
<p>Notably, both ALM and PLM of colchicine-treated worms maintained intact structures even after 20 days of adulthood (20DA) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A–D</xref>). While untreated 20DA had approximately 73.1% and 57.5% defective ALM and PLM, respectively, colchicine-treated worms showed only 23.6% and 7.2% defective ALM and PLM, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C, D</xref>). Colchicine treatment significantly reduced multiple structural abnormalities of TRNs, including somatic outgrowth of ALM and ectopic swelling or branching of PLM (Supplemental Fig. 5B–E). However, it failed to mitigate other morphological abnormalities such as beaded process of ALM and somatic outgrowth of PLM (Supplemental Fig. 5F–J). More importantly, colchicine treatment also improved touch responses of aged animals. Whereas there was no difference between touch responses of colchicine-treated and untreated 2DA animals, drug-treated 10DA animals showed significantly higher touch responses compared to the untreated controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). However, touch responses of drug-treated 10DA were still lower than those of drug-treated 2DA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). It seems plausible, given that TRNs of colchicine-treated 10DA were more structurally defective than that of colchicine-treated 2DA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C, D</xref>). Considering that the same method of colchicine treatment did not affect worm lifespan (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>), the protective effects of colchicine on the structural and functional integrity of TRNs are unlikely to be derived from the prolonged lifespan of worms.</p>

Paclitaxel induced beaded processes, somatic outgrowth and cell body abnormalities of ALM, as well as bipolar growth which is reported to be induced by paclitaxel.

<title>Loss of <italic>spas-1</italic>, a putative microtubule-severing enzyme, accelerates structural decline of touch receptor neurons</title>
<p>Spastin, an ATP-dependent microtubule-severing enzyme, is known to cause a human neurodegenerative disease, hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hazan et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Svenson et al. 2001</xref>).

We investigated whether hyper-stabilization of microtubules via genetic perturbation of <italic>spas-1</italic> could cause premature structural defects of TRNs as observed in <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant. We found that the <italic>spas-1</italic> mutants exhibit premature deformation of TRNs. From the 2<sup>nd</sup> day of adulthood (2DA), the mutant ALM displayed an accelerated onset of neuronal deformity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A, C</xref>). Although the frequency of defective PLM was not significantly increased in the mutants except in <italic>spas-1(tm683)</italic> at 6DA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>), both the deletion mutants <italic>tm683</italic> and <italic>ok1608</italic> exhibited more various and severe structural deformation of PLM than controls on the 2DA and 6DA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, Supplemental Fig. 6A). Ours and others’ observation showing touch neuronal expression of SPAS-1 suggest cell-autonomous function of SPAS-1 (Supplemental Fig. 6B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brown and El Bejjani 2017</xref>).

<p>In human spastin, K388R mutation completely abrogates the ATP binding in the ATPase region and microtubule-severing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Evans et al. 2005</xref>).

A <italic>wts-1; eri-1</italic> mutant were generated by genetic mating to enhance the efficiency of neuronal RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kennedy et al. 2004</xref>) and we evaluated lesions in the TRNs of worms fed with the RNAi vector of target genes. RNAi against microtubule-stabilizing genes, except for <italic>atat-2</italic> and <italic>mec-17</italic>, could reduce the structural deformation of <italic>wts-1; eri-1</italic> mutant neurons (Supplemental Fig. 7B). <italic>atat-2</italic> RNAi slightly alleviated ectopic lesions in ALM and PLM. <italic>mec-17</italic> RNAi failed to reduce PLM lesions but increased ALM lesions. In contrast, none of the microtubule-destabilizing genes reduced ectopic lesions of the mutant neurons. Among the candidate genes, <italic>rho-1</italic> RNAi resulted in early larval arrest, making it infeasible to test; thus, RNAi experiments were performed for only four genes, which failed to reduce the structural deformation of <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant neurons (Supplemental Fig. 7A).</p>
<p>To address the genetic interaction of microtubule-stabilizing genes and <italic>wts-1</italic> in detail, we constructed double mutants with <italic>wts-1</italic> and <italic>dlk-1</italic>, <italic>ptl-1</italic>, and <italic>ptrn-1</italic>. Both <italic>wts-1; dlk-1</italic> and <italic>wts-1; ptl-1</italic> displayed improved TRNs structures. The total number of ectopic lesions was significantly reduced and the proportion of intact neurons without any deformed structures was also highly increased (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A–C</xref>). In the case of <italic>ptrn-1</italic>, neuroprotective effects of the gene knockdown were not reproduced in the double mutant (Supplemental Fig. 7C, D). The fact that the loss of microtubule-stabilizing genes mitigates the structural deformation of the <italic>wts-1</italic> also supports the finding that the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutants have highly stabilized microtubules which are responsible for the structural deformation.</p>

<p><italic>ptl-1</italic> encodes the sole <italic>C. elegans</italic> homolog of the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">McDermott et al. 1996</xref>). In mammals, tau is predominantly localized to the neuronal axons and promotes microtubule assembly and stability; moreover, mutations in the MAPT locus are highly associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, such as FTD-17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Goedert and Spillantini 2000</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the loss of <italic>ptl-1</italic> itself results in premature structural disintegration of TRNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chew et al. 2013</xref>). Given these observations with the <italic>wts-1; ptl-1</italic> mutants and the revealed functions of MAPT, the structural decline seen in the <italic>ptl-1</italic> mutants is probably due to the microtubule destabilization, unlike those observed in the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutants. Consistent with this assumption, the loss of <italic>yap-1</italic> did not lessen structural deformation of <italic>ptl-1</italic>, even increased the structural abnormalities of <italic>ptl-1</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D, E</xref>). On the 5<sup>th</sup> day of adulthood, <italic>ptl-1</italic> mutant exhibited 41% defective ALM and 6% of defective PLM. In the <italic>ptl-1; yap-1</italic> mutant, cells with irregular shape, ectopic branching or somatic outgrowth were highly increased; thus, 76% ALM and 25% PLM showed structural abnormalities (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D, E</xref>). Loss of <italic>yap-1</italic> could probably lead to microtubule destabilization and it has a redundant effect on microtubule stability with microtubule destabilization due to <italic>ptl-1</italic> loss.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we showed that the loss of <italic>wts-1</italic>, the core kinase of the Hpo pathway, results in postnatal deformation of TRNs. Although <italic>wts-1</italic> mutants had intact neurons at the beginning, they gradually exhibited structurally and functionally declined TRNs. The detailed observation of morphological alteration in <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant suggests that the features of defective TRNs in the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant closely resemble those of aged TRNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Toth et al. 2012</xref>). We also defined that both <italic>yap-1</italic> and <italic>egl-44</italic> act as downstream of <italic>wts-1</italic> and that TRNs-specific rescue of YAP-1 was sufficient to re-induce the neuronal deformation of <italic>wts-1; yap-1</italic> double mutant. Neuronal defects induced by knockdown of <italic>wts-1</italic> or overexpression of YAP-1 selectively in TRNs of wild-type animals also proved a cell-autonomous function of the Hpo pathway in TRNs. Given that <italic>daf-2</italic>/IGF signaling modulates whole organismal aging, premature decline of the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutants is more local and restricted in TRNs. These observations say that the Hpo pathway of <italic>C. elegans</italic> has a neuroprotective effect in differentiated neurons in a cell-autonomous manner, restricting YAP-1 from triggering premature neuronal decline.</p>
<p>In addition to its extensively studied roles in early development and tumorigenesis, dysregulation of the Hpo pathway has been implicated in aging and pathologies of the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sahu and Mondal 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gogia et al. 2021</xref>). Hyper-activation of the pathway components such as MST1 and the consequent inhibition of YAP have been noted in several neurodegenerative disease models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Matsumoto et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Yamanishi et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mueller et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Tanaka et al. 2020</xref>). In these models, the inactivation of the pathway or the activation of YAP ameliorates neuronal cell death; thus, the manipulation of the Hpo pathway has been regarded to prevent pathologies associated with neuronal cell death. Our results showing that the proper inhibition of YAP-1 by an upstream WTS-1 is required to maintain neuronal integrity appear to contradict these previous observations. However, alterations that occur in the aged brain or the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutants are structural alterations or failures in structural maintenance, which are different from neuronal cell death that occurs in neurodegenerative diseases. This could explain the conflicting function of YAP-1 in terms of neuroprotection. Moreover, some examples present the detrimental effects of uncontrolled YAP. Dysregulation of the pathway and ectopic activation of YAP have been observed in patients with Alexander disease, which is a rare neurodegenerative disease that results in progressive neuronal degeneration based on the loss of myelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Wang et al. 2018</xref>). Further, the activation of YAP also occurred in Müller cells during retinal degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hamon et al. 2017</xref>). The present study shows that proper regulation of YAP is essential to maintain neuronal integrity and adds important information to the research on anti-aging roles of the Hpo pathway after development.</p>
<p>Genetic and pharmacological approaches suggest that defective, hyper-stabilized microtubules in the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant were responsible for premature deformation of neurons, possibly in a ‘wear- to-tear fashion’ because of the mechanical strains generated by organismal movements. Reduced movement or treatment with colchicine had significant ameliorating effects on neuronal deformation of the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant. Colchicine binds irreversibly to tubulin dimers and prevents the addition of tubulin dimers to the fast growing ends of microtubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ravelli et al. 2004</xref>). It has been widely used to cure acute gouty arthritis and familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dinarello et al. 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Zemer et al. 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zemer et al. 1986</xref>). Our study demonstrated that colchicine reduced the severity of neuronal lesions and even improved neuronal function in the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant TRNs. Moreover, colchicine treatment on fully developed animals largely reduced age-related failures in neuronal structures and functions during normal aging. This supports the idea that neuronal deformation seen in the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutants is similar to that in aged organism and more importantly, hyper-stabilization of neuronal microtubules would be a promising target to cure age-associated neuronal deformation.</p>
<p>These observations are unexpected because microtubule-destabilizing agents mimic several neuronal degenerative disease phenotypes, and microtubule stabilizing agents such as paclitaxel and epothilone D exhibit neuroprotective effects in the pathological contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Zhang et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Shemesh and Spira 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Zhang et al. 2012</xref>). Some reports have shown that colchicine has detrimental effects on cognitive function in animal disease models specifically leading to cholinergic neuronal loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Goldschmidt and Steward 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Veerendra Kumar and Gupta 2002</xref>). In contrast, a study in older patients with FMF showed that long-term colchicine treatment could protect against cognitive decline in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Leibovitz et al. 2006</xref>) and the neuroprotective functions of colchicine also have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Pratt et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Salama et al. 2012</xref>). In the case of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) and paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy, hyper-stabilization of microtubule could be a cause of neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cavaletti et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hazan et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Trotta et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Evans et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lee and Swain 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Scripture et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gornstein and Schwarz 2014</xref>). Mutated spastin is the most common cause of HSP, a hereditary, neurodegenerative disease that affects the upper motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hazan et al. 1999</xref>). Similar to the neuroprotective effects of colchicine in the <italic>wts-1</italic> or aged neurons, vinblastine, a microtubule-destabilizing agent, rescue axonal swellings in the HSP models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fassier et al. 2013</xref>). Further, the fact that impaired spastin activity in several animal models results in sparser microtubule array at axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Sherwood et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wood et al. 2006</xref>) provides a possible link between hyper-stabilization and the sparseness of microtubules we observed. These shared properties among <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant neurons, aged neurons and HSP models strongly support that the hyper-stabilized microtubules are responsible for the structural and functional failures of neurons in both senescent and pathological conditions. It will be needed to determine that colchicine has more general neuroprotective effects on age- or diseases-associated decline in other animal models and other microtubule destabilizing agents show similar beneficial effects.</p>
<p>Mutations in several tubulin proteins, microtubule-binding proteins such as tau, and failures in nerve attachment to the epidermis have been reported to induce similar deformities in TRNs, as seen in the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant. In several mutants of <italic>mec-1</italic>, which encodes an ECM protein, TRNs fail to separate from body-wall muscles and they are prematurely degenerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Pan et al. 2011</xref>). In contrast to the <italic>mec-1</italic> mutant neurons, TRNs of the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant appeared to normally dissociate from the muscles and innervate the epidermal layer (Supplemental Fig. S2A). Uncontrolled <italic>yap-1</italic> may affect the vesicular transport of membrane proteins by altering plasma membrane polarity in the same way it acts in the intestine. The detailed mechanism of how the activated YAP-1 triggers microtubule hyper-stabilization in TRNs cell-autonomously remains to be explored. Despite these limitations, the timing of the phenotype of the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant is noted to be much earlier, and the phenotypic penetrance is much higher in the mutant than in any known mutant. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is the one of the first reports to show the impact of the signaling pathway on the specific neuronal aging. As we have shown in this study, defective TRNs of the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant could provide a neuronal model to investigate the potential therapeutic targets for improving neuronal aging that occurs either prematurely or normally.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors investigate the role of microtubule dynamics and its effects on neuronal aging. Using C. elegans as a model, the authors investigate the role of evolutionarily conserved Hippo pathway in microtubule dynamics of touch receptor neurons (TRNs) in an age-dependent manner. Using genetic, molecular, behavioral, and pharmacological approaches, the authors show that age-dependent loss of microtubule dynamics might underlie structural and functional aging of TRNs. Further, the authors show that the Hippo pathway specifically functions in these neurons to regulate microtubule dynamics. Specifically, authors show that hyperactivation of YAP-1, a downstream component of the Hippo pathway that is usually inhibited by the kinase activity of the upstream components of the pathway, results in microtubule stabilization and that might underlie the structural and functional decline of TRNs with age. However, how the Hippo pathway regulates microtubule dynamics and neuronal aging was not investigated by the authors.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a well-conducted and well-controlled study, and the authors have used multiple approaches to address different questions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are no major weaknesses identified, except that the effect of the Hippo pathway seems to be specific to only a subset of neurons. I would like the authors to address the specificity of the effect of the Hippo pathway in TRNs, in their resubmission.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study examines a novel role of the Hpo signaling pathway, specifically of wts-1/LATS and the downstream regulator of gene expression, yap, in age-related neurodegeneration in C. elegans touch-responsive mechanosensory neurons, ALM and PLM. The study shows that knockdown or deletion of wts-1/LATS causes age-associated morphological abnormalities of these neurons, accompanied by functional loss of touch responsiveness. This is further associated with enhanced, abnormal, microtubule stabilization in these neurons.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study examines a novel role of the Hpo signaling pathway, specifically of wts-1/LATS and the downstream regulator of gene expression, yap, in age-related neurodegeneration in C. elegans touch-responsive mechanosensory neurons, ALM and PLM. The study shows that knockdown or deletion of wts-1/LATS causes age-associated morphological abnormalities of these neurons, accompanied by functional loss of touch responsiveness. This is further associated with enhanced, abnormal, microtubule stabilization in these neurons. Strong pharmacological and especially genetic manipulations of MT-stabilizing or severing proteins show a strong genetic link between yap and regulation of MTs stability. The study is strong and uses robust approaches, especially strong genetics. The demonstrations on the aging-related roles of the Hpo signaling pathway, and the link to MTs, are novel and compelling. Nevertheless, the study also has mechanistic weaknesses (see below).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Specific comments:</p>
<p>(1) The study demonstrates age-specific roles of the Hpo pathway, specifically of wts-1/LATS and yap, specifically in TRN mechanosensory neurons, without observing developmental defects in these neurons, or effects in other neurons. This is a strong demonstration. Nevertheless, the study does not address whether there is a correlation of Hpo signaling pathway activity decline specifically in these neurons, and not other neurons, and at the observed L4 stage and onwards (including the first day of adulthood, 1DA stage). Such demonstrations of spatio-temporal regulation of the Hpo signaling pathway and its activation seem important for linking the Hpo pathway with the observed age-related neurodegeneration. Can this age-related response be correlated to indeed a decline in Hpo signaling during adulthood? Especially at L4 and onwards? It will be informative to measure this by examining the decline in wts1 as well as yap levels and yap nuclear localization.</p>
<p>(2) The Hpo pathway eventually activates gene expression via yap. Although the study uses robust genetic manipulations of yap and wts-1/LATS, it is not clear whether the observed effects are attributed to yap-mediated regulation of gene expression (see 3).</p>
<p>(3) The observations on the abnormal MT stabilization, and the subsequent genetic examinations of MT-stability/severing genes, are a significant strength of the study. Nevertheless, despite the strong genetic links to yap and wts-1/LATS, it is not clear whether MT-regulatory genes are regulated by transcription downstream of the Hpo pathway, thus not enabling a strong causal link between MT regulation and Hpo-mediated gene expression, making this strong part of the study mechanistically circumstantial. Specifically, it will be good to examine whether the genes addressed herein, for example, Spastin, are transcriptionally regulated downstream of the Hpo pathway. This comment is augmented by the finding that in the wts-1/ yap-1 double mutants, MT abnormality, and subsequent neuronal morphology and touch responses are restored, clearly indicating that there is an associated transcriptional regulation</p>
<p>Other comments:</p>
<p>(1) The TRN-specific knockdown of wts-1 and yap-1 is a clear strength. Nevertheless, these do not necessarily show cell-autonomous effects, as the yap transcription factor may regulate the expression of external cues, secreted or otherwise, thus generating non-cell autonomous effects. For example, it is known that yap regulates TGF-beat expression and signaling.</p>
<p>(2) Continuing from comment (3) above, it seems that many of the MT-regulators chosen here for genetic examinations were chosen based on demonstrated roles in neurodegeneration in other studies. It would be good to show whether these MT-associated genes are directly regulated by transcription by the Hpo pathway.</p>
<p>(3) The impairment of the touch response may not be robust: it is only a 30-40% reduction at L4, and even less reduction at 1DA. It would be good to offer possible explanations for this finding.</p>
