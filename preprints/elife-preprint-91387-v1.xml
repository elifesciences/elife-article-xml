<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Dopaminergic neurons (DANs) carry out multiple tasks in the brain, including the transmission of information related to rewards and punishments across various animal species. They are responsible for evaluating sensory input, storing resultant associations as memory, and continuously updating them based on their relevance and reliability. Accurate comprehension of the dopaminergic system’s operation necessitates an understanding of the specific functions mediated by individual DANs. To this end, our research employs <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae, which possess approximately 12,000 neurons in their brains, of which only around 1% (approximately 120) are DANs.</p>
<p>The presynaptic projections to the mushroom body (MB) - a brain region pivotal for associative olfactory learning in insects - are limited to only eight larval dopaminergic neurons. These DANs are further subdivided into two clusters: the primary protocerebral anterior medial cluster (pPAM) comprises four cells, and the dorsolateral 1 cluster (DL1) comprises the remaining four cells. Our findings confirm previous research that demonstrates that the pPAM DANs innervating the MB’s medial lobe encode for a gustatory sugar reward signal. Furthermore, we have identified four DANs in the DL1 cluster - DAN-c1, DAN-d1, DAN-f1, and DAN-g1 - each of which innervates distinct compartments of the MB peduncle, lateral appendix, and vertical lobe. Optogenetic activation of DAN-f1 and DAN-g1 alone suffices to substitute for salt punishment. Furthermore, optogenetic inhibition, calcium imaging results and electron microscopy-based reconstruction of all sensory input circuits to the four DL1 DANs demonstrate that each DAN encodes a different aspect of salt punishment, with DAN-g1 being of central importance.</p>
<p>To summarize, our investigation has revealed the existence of a cellular division of labor among larval DANs concerning the transmission of dopaminergic reward (pPAM cluster) and punishment signals (DL1 cluster). Individual DANs in each cluster encode for distinct but partially overlapping aspects of the teaching signal. The striking resemblance in the organizing principle of larval DANs with that of its adult counterpart and the mammalian basal ganglion suggests that there may be a limited number of efficient neural circuit solutions available to address more complex cognitive challenges in nature.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>To cope with a constantly changing environment, animals derive benefit from learning behavioral rules that need constant adaptation and updating. To test this ability, researchers often use Pavlovian or classical conditioning experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Pavlov 1927</xref>), which examine an organism’s capacity to form associations between sensory cues, called conditioned stimuli (CS), and rewards or punishments, referred to as aversive and appetitive unconditioned stimuli (US) or teaching signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Gerber et al 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Glanzman 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Heisenberg 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Menzel 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Waddell 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Weber et al 2023b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Widmann et al 2018</xref>). Dopaminergic neurons (DANs) and other modulatory neurons mediate teaching signals that allow animals to classify a given CS into positive or negative valence based on past experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cognigni et al 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Menzel 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Schultz 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Thum &amp; Gerber 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Watabe-Uchida et al 2017</xref>). For example, when a CS is paired with simultaneous activation of a specific set of DANs in the PAM cluster, larval or adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> subsequently perceive the odor as attractive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Burke et al 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Eschbach et al 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Liu et al 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Rohwedder et al 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Schroll et al 2006</xref>) – a similar effect was seen after optogenetic activation of DANs located in the ventral tegmental area of the mouse brain to induce conditioned place preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Tsai et al 2009</xref>). In contrast, activation of larval DL1 DANs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Eschbach et al 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Schroll et al 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Weiglein et al 2021</xref>), adult PPL1 DANs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Aso et al 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Aso &amp; Rubin 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Aso et al 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Claridge-Chang et al 2009</xref>), or DANs in the posterior tail of the stratum of mice were shown to reinforce avoidance learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Menegas et al 2018</xref>). These examples illustrate that the dopaminergic system provides a highly conserved and fundamental neural principle of the brain, which has been retained throughout the process of evolution and executes comparable functions across diverse animal species, including even humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Frick et al 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Our research focuses on the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva, an organism endowed with a relatively simple central nervous system, composing approximately 12,000 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dumstrei et al 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Winding et al 2023</xref>). Classical conditioning in larvae can be analyzed by stable behavioral assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Almeida-Carvalho et al 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Apostolopoulou et al 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Scherer et al 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Weber et al 2023a</xref>), in conjunction with a wealth of genetic methods for targeting single molecules and neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dietzl et al 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Li et al 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Perkins et al 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Port et al 2020</xref>). In addition, the connectome of the brain was recently reconstructed, which enables the extraction and analysis of related wiring motifs, as well as entire learning and memory circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Winding et al 2023</xref>). Based on these advances, it was possible to establish a more fundamental cellular and synaptic understanding of the larval memory circuit, the mushroom body (MB) network. The MB is a higher-order parallel fiber system present in numerous invertebrate brains, including hemimetabolous as well as holometabolous insects and their larval stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Strausfeld et al 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Strausfeld et al 2020</xref>). Analogous to the vertebrate cerebrum, the MB in insects is responsible for forming and maintaining associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Heisenberg 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Menzel 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Menzel 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Thum &amp; Gerber 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Tomer et al 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Waddell 2013</xref>). In the first developmental stage (L1), the larval MB comprises approximately 110 intrinsic Kenyon cells (KC) per hemisphere, which sparsely encode for conditioned stimulus (CS) information, and is dominated by olfactory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Eichler et al 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Masuda-Nakagawa et al 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The transmission of olfactory information from the peripheral sensory organ is achieved via only 21 olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) per body side, which in turn send signals across 35 uni- and multiglomerular projection neurons, ultimately reaching the MB KCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Berck et al 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Fishilevich et al 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Kreher et al 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Masuda-Nakagawa et al 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Ramaekers et al 2005</xref>). KCs receive modulatory input from 17 neurons, consisting of eight dopaminergic neurons, four octopaminergic neurons, and five neurons with unknown signaling molecule identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Eichler et al 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Rohwedder et al 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Saumweber et al 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Selcho et al 2009</xref>). The DANs are divided into two clusters based on the location of their soma and related neuronal lineage, namely the the primary protocerebral anterior medial cluster (pPAM) and the dorsolateral 1 cluster (DL1) clusters. Each DAN innervates a specific and non-overlapping site in the MB, which, together with one to three output neurons, defines a distinct compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Eichler et al 2017</xref>). The larval MB comprises a total of 11 compartments, eight of which are defined by DAN input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Eichler et al 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Saumweber et al 2018</xref>). The four DANs of the pPAM cluster (DAN-h1, DAN-i1, DAN-j1, and DAN-k1) innervate the four related compartments (h, i, j, and k) of the medial lobe and provide teaching signals for sugar rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Eichler et al 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Rohwedder et al 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Schleyer et al 2020</xref>). The four DANs of the DL1 cluster (DAN-c1, DAN-d1, DAN-f1, and DAN-g1) innervate the lower peduncle (c), the lateral appendix (d), the intermediate (f), and the lower vertical lobe (g) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Eichler et al 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Saumweber et al 2018</xref>). Previous studies have shown that the DL1 cluster is capable of mediating aversive teaching signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Eschbach et al 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Schroll et al 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Selcho et al 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Weiglein et al 2021</xref>). Moreover, larvae can use a variety of natural stimuli as aversive teaching signals such as heat, electric shock, vibration, bitter substances (like quinine or caffeine), and high salt concentrations (low salt concentrations, however, are rewarding) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aceves-Pina &amp; Quinn 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Apostolopoulou et al 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Apostolopoulou et al 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Eschbach et al 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Gerber &amp; Hendel 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Khurana et al 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Khurana et al 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Niewalda et al 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Pauls et al 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">von Essen et al 2011</xref>). However, it is currently unknown if and how these natural stimuli are represented by the DL1 cluster and to what extent individual DL1 DANs are involved.</p>
<p>We only know that optogenetic stimulation of nociceptive sensory neurons and their downstream basin neurons has been observed to activate three out of the four DL1 DANs, namely DAN-d1, DAN-f1, and DAN-g1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Eschbach et al 2020</xref>). Furthermore, the simultaneous presentation of odor with optogenetic activation of these three DANs has been found to elicit aversion in larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Eschbach et al 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Weiglein et al 2021</xref>). These findings suggest that the activation of DL1 DANs may induce a punishing effect during training, based on somatosensory perception. But can these four individual DANs also process other sensory modalities? Utilizing electron microscopy-based reconstruction, all first and second order input neurons of the MB, consisting of a complete set of 102 neuron pairs, were examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Eschbach et al 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Winding et al 2023</xref>). The analysis identified numerous afferent sensory inputs via 20 pairs of feedforward neurons (FFNs), which can now be integrated with the published wiring diagram of all chemosensory input neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Miroschnikow et al 2018</xref>). This enables a more comprehensive understanding of the distinct modes of action of the four DL1 DANs in relation to the processing of different sensory modalities.</p>

<title>The larval dopaminergic system is functionally bipartite to convey positive and negative teaching signals</title>
<p>There are eight DANs in the larval brain that innervate the mushroom body that can be anatomically subdivided in four pPAM cluster and four DL1 cluster neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, supplemental Figure 1A). Three of the four pPAM cluster DANs can be labeled with the driver line R58E02-Gal4 (supplemental Figure 1A-D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Rohwedder et al 2016</xref>). Pairing an odor presentation with simultaneous optogenetic blue light activation of R58E02 positive DANs using a mutant microbial-type rhodopsin ChR2<sup>XXL</sup>, which depolarizes neurons artificially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dawydow et al 2014</xref>), establishes an appetitive olfactory memory (supplemental Figure 1E and F) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Rohwedder et al 2016</xref>). In line with this finding, it was shown that ablation or inhibition of R58E02 positive DANs strongly reduces appetitive olfactory memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Rohwedder et al 2016</xref>) but has no functional significance for aversive olfactory memory (supplemental Figure 1G and H) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Rohwedder et al 2016</xref>). Therefore, it can be concluded that pPAM cluster DANs are not involved in the encoding of aversive teaching signals. How are aversive teaching signals encoded?</p>

<caption><title>The larval dopaminergic system is subdivided in two functionally distinct clusters.</title>
<p><bold>(A)</bold> The larval dopaminergic neurons (DANs) can be anatomically subdivided into the primary protocerebral anterior medial (pPAM) and dorsolateral 1 (DL1) cluster based on their cell body position. <bold>(B)</bold> The DL1 cluster (cell bodies in green and purple) consists of four DANs providing input to the c, d, g, and f compartment of the vertical lobe, peduncle and lateral appendix of the MB (in grey). <bold>(C, D)</bold> Four DL1 DANs (DAN-c1, DAN-d1, DAN-g1, and DAN-f1) are included in the expression pattern of the TH-GAL4 driver line. However, expression of a UAS-mCD8::GFP reporter via TH-GAL4 labels many more neurons (in green, anti-GFP) throughout the entire CNS (in red and blue, anti-N-cadherin and anti-discs large), in total about 100 neurons. <bold>(E)</bold> To test whether optogenetic activation of the DL1 DANs is sufficient to substitute for a punishment, we used the TH-GAL4 driver in combination with UAS-ChR<sup>XXL</sup>. Experimental and control larvae were trained by simultaneously presenting and odor and blue light and thus artificial activation of DL1 DANs, whereas a second odor was presented in darkness. Only larvae of the experimental genotype (p &gt; 0.05), but not of the two genetic controls (both p &lt; 0.05), retrieve an aversive associative olfactory memory. The same result was seen after one or three training trials (<bold>E</bold> and <bold>F</bold>, respectively). <bold>(G, H)</bold> To test for the acute function of the DL1 DANs in aversive associative olfactory memory, we expressed GtACR2 via the TH-GAL4 driver. Acute optogenetic inhibition of synaptic output from DL1 and other DANs reduced odor high salt memory. Experimental larvae raised on supplemented food (0.5 mM all-<italic>trans</italic>-retinal, ATR) and trained in blue light performed on a lower level than control animals kept on standard food (p &lt; 0.05). A memory impairment was seen after one and three training trials (<bold>G</bold> and <bold>H</bold>, respectively). All behavioral data is shown as box-plots.

<p>The driver line TH-Gal4 can be used to label the four DANs of the DL1 cluster (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A and B</xref>), as well as most other DANs, except for a small subset of DANs, such as pPAM DANs and neurons in the subesophageal zone (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C and D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Selcho et al 2009</xref>). By coupling odor presentation with simultaneous optogenetic activation of TH-Gal4 positive DANs through ChR2<sup>XXL</sup>, an aversive olfactory memory can be established, which was observed after both one (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>) and three (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>) odor-DAN activation pairings. Consistent with these findings, aversive associative memory formed after one or three training cycles of odor high salt pairings were significantly reduced when DANs activity was inhibited optogenetically via GtACR2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G and H</xref>), a light-gated channel from the algae <italic>Guillardia theta</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Mohammad et al 2017</xref>). Please note that in these experiments salt has to be added during the test to initiate the recall of the aversive memory (indicated as red test plates, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Gerber &amp; Hendel 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Schleyer et al 2015</xref>). Previous studies have shown that the larva only recalls aversive odor-high salt memory when tested in the presence of the teaching signal. The prevailing explanation suggests that the larva engages in memory-based search during the test, but only if the memory content can be used in a beneficial way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Schleyer et al 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>From our results, we infer a division of labor at the level of DANs toward the MB. On the one hand, pPAM neurons mediate a dopaminergic appetitive teaching signal, and on the other hand, DL1 neurons convey a dopaminergic aversive teaching signal. Nevertheless, the findings related to DL1 DANs necessitate additional validation as the TH-Gal4 driver line used in the experiment labels approximately 120 cells, thus limiting the ability to draw cell-specific conclusions.</p>

<title>Physiological single-cell analysis of DL1 DANs</title>
<p>In order to investigate how high salt teaching signals are represented at the level of individual DL1 DANs, we conducted calcium imaging experiments using a microfluidic chip on intact and immobilized larvae, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Si et al 2019</xref>). We expressed GCaMP6m under the control of four different split-Gal4 lines specific to DL1 DANs (SS02160 (DAN-c1), MB328B (DAN-d1), SS02180 (DAN-f1), and SS01716 (DAN-g1)), as well as the pPAM specific R58E02-Gal4, and exposed the larvae to solutions containing 100 mM salt, 1 M salt, and also to 500 mM fructose. Our results showed that while none of the cells were activated by 100 mM salt, DAN-c1, DAN-d1, and DAN-g1 responded to 1 M salt (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, B, and D). Conversely, pPAM DANs showed a reduced signal in response to 100mM and 1 M salt (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Both DAN-c1 and pPAM DANs showed a calcium increase in response to 500 mM fructose (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A and E</xref>). Although DAN-f1 did not respond to either salt concentration, a reduction in the calcium signal was seen for 500 mM fructose (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Overall, these results provide support for the functional division of the larval dopaminergic system at the physiological level, where most DL1 neurons are activated by high salt concentrations, with one exception inhibited by fructose. In contrast, pPAM cluster neurons display the opposite response, being inhibited by high salt concentrations and strongly activated by fructose.</p>

<title>Behavioral single-cell analysis of DL1 DANs</title>
<p>We employed split-Gal4 lines SS02160 (DAN-c1), MB328B (DAN-d1), SS02180 (DAN-f1), and SS01716 (DAN-g1) to express the apoptosis proteins Hid and Reaper, resulting in the ablation of the respective individual DL1 DANs. The ablated animals were subjected to the aversive odor-high salt memory assay, using one (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-D</xref>) and three training cycles (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E-H</xref>). We utilized two different training protocols to differentiate between the effects on short-term memory (STM) and anesthesia-resistant memory (ARM), as previous studies have demonstrated that larvae exhibit both after one training cycle, whereas only ARM is present after three training cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Widmann et al 2016</xref>). However, to our surprise, we found that the ablation of individual DL1 DANs had no effect on aversive olfactory memories in any of the eight experiments conducted (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-H</xref>). For DAN-d1 and DAN-f1 we verified these results by using the additional split-Gal4 lines MB143B and MB145B (supplemental Figure 2). In addition, ablation of DAN-d1, DAN-f1 and DAN-g1 individually did not have any impact on odor-quinine and odor-fructose memories established after one cycle training (supplemental Figures 3 and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Moreover, MB input neurons that are not dopaminergic (OAN-a1, a2, MBIN-b1, b2, and OAN-e1) were also found to have no relevant effect (supplemental Figure 5). These results suggest that although DL1 DANs respond to high salt concentrations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), they are not individually necessary for mediating the aversive teaching signal. It appears that the aversive teaching signal is distributed among multiple cells, indicating the presence of some redundancy. Alternatively, it is possible that there are developmental compensatory effects for DL1 cluster DANs, allowing the remaining three neurons (or other cells) to take over the function of the ablated one.</p>

<title>The combination of DAN-f1 and DAN-g1 is required to establish aversive odor-high salt memories</title>
<p>In order to investigate a possible redundancy among DANs, we proceeded by using split-Gal4 lines MB054B (DAN-f1/DAN-g1), MB065B (DAN-c1/DAN-f1), and SS01702 (DAN-c1/MBIN-e1) to express apoptosis proteins Hid and Reaper. This approach selectively ablated either two DL1 DANs or one DL1 DAN and another MB input neuron with unknown neurotransmitter identity. It should be noted that no additional split-Gal4 lines are presently available for further DL1 DAN combinations or the complete DL1 cluster. We then subjected the larvae to the aversive odor-high salt memory assay, using one (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-C</xref>) and three (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D-F</xref>) training cycles. Only larvae with ablated DAN-f1/DAN-g1 exhibited significantly reduced aversive olfactory memory after one cycle training (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). No memory reduction was observed when ablating DAN-c1/DAN-f1 or DAN-c1/MBIN-e1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B and C</xref>). Ablation of all three sets of neurons, including MB054B, had no effect on aversive olfactory memory after three training cycles (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D-F</xref>). To ascertain the independence of the DAN-f1/DAN-g1 neuron-mediated impairment of aversive olfactory memory after one cycle training from the specific odors used, hexyl acetate and benzaldehyde were employed instead of amyl acetate and benzaldehyde. The results of these experiments confirmed the previous findings, as ablation of DAN-f1/DAN-g1 neurons significantly reduced aversive odor-high salt memory after one cycle training (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>), but not after three cycles (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref>).

<p>Subsequently, we investigated the selectivity of DAN-f1/DAN-g1 neurons concerning the nature of the aversive teaching stimulus. To this end, we utilized quinine as an aversive teaching signal, a stimulus that has been demonstrated to be learnable by the larva, as evidenced by previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Apostolopoulou et al 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">El-Keredy et al 2012</xref>). Removal of the DAN-f1/DAN-g1 neurons using the split-Gal4 line MB054B had no effect on aversive odor-quinine memory independent of the number of training cycles (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H and K</xref>). Furthermore, ablation of DAN-f1/DAN-g1 did not alter appetitive odor-fructose memories after one or three training cycles (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I and L</xref>). Therefore, the DL1 DAN-f1/DAN-g1 combination seems to be specifically required for aversive odor-high salt memory.</p>

<p>Simultaneously activating DAN-f1/DAN-g1 positive DANs via ChR2<sup>XXL</sup> during an odor presentation establishes an aversive olfactory memory (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E and F</xref>).

Furthermore, single-cell analysis indicates that individual activation of DAN-f1 and DAN-g1, but not of DAN-d1 and DAN-c1 (please note that experimental animals are different from zero and significantly different to one control), can induce an aversive odor-high salt memory (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-D</xref>).

<sec id="s2g">
<title>Individual DL1 DANs are acutely necessary to establish aversive odor-high salt memories</title>
<p>Next, we examined the extent to which the individual DL1 DANs are acutely required for the transmission of a functional aversive teaching signal. We have already shown that the combination of DAN-f1/DAN-g1 is required for aversive odor-high salt memory (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A and G</xref>). However, in these experiments DANs were removed during the entire development, which may have led to compensatory mechanisms or side effects.</p>
<p>To overcome this limitation, we left the individual DL1 DANs intact during embryonic and larval development and used GtACR2 to selectively inhibit DAN activity only during training, thus isolating the teaching signals from other DAN functions. Optogenetic inhibition of DAN-f1/DAN-g1 resulted in a reduced aversive odor-high salt memory. This was the case after one training cycle (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>) and three training cycles (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>). Thus, the learning deficit in this experiment was more pronounced than after ablation of these two DL1 DANs throughout development (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Optogenetic inhibition of individual DL1 DANs showed no effect on aversive odor-high salt memories (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A-C</xref>), except for DAN-g1 that led to a small but significant reduction (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>).</p>

<p>Given the apparent cellular division of labor of DANs for reward and punishment teaching signals through the pPAM and DL1 cluster (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and supplement Figure 1) and even qualitative differences between individual DL1 DANs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), since not all DANs code equally for the punishment teaching signal, the question arises as to how this may result from the respective cellular and synaptic connectivity. Therefore, we compared the input wiring diagrams of the pPAM and DL1 clusters and their individual DANs by mapping the synaptic connections from sensory neurons - to interneurons - to individual DANs, using the full larval brain EM volume (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>, supplemental Figure 7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Eschbach et al 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Miroschnikow et al 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Winding et al 2023</xref>). We found that DAN-c1, DAN-d1, DAN-f1, and DAN-g1 (black circle) get input from 1, 6, 6 or 11 sensory-to-DAN interneurons (orange circle), respectively (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). The number of sensory neurons (numbers in colored circuits below) varies between 3, 42, 35 and 9. There is no direct input from sensory neurons onto DL1 DANs. DAN-c1 receives only very weak internal and gustatory input, while DAN-d1 and DAN-g1 have an overall stronger and additional input from somatosensory neurons. In addition, DAN-d1, as well as DAN-f1, receive information from olfactory and thermosensory neurons (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>). DAN-f1 and DAN-g1 get 17% and 11% of their entire input from these sensory-to-DAN interneurons. For DAN-d1 and DAN-c1 these number were lower (5% and 1%, respectively). In general, DL1 DANs get additional input from other upstream neurons (US) that are not directly linked to sensory neurons (grey circles; between 17% and 37%), as well as MB KCs (purple circles; between 36% and 49%) as well as a bit of MBON feedback (dark-red circle; between 1% and 2%). Please note that we restricted our analysis on direct sensory-to-DANs interneurons (single hop analysis) and did not expand the analysis onto two hop or three hop connections to keep the evaluation restricted to the shortest paths from sensory neurons to DANs. For the pPAM DANs we found the same general connectivity principles as for DL1 DANs regarding input from MBONs, KCs, and non-sensory upstream neurons. Please note that the DAN-h1 neuron is not present at the early L1 EM brain volume and thus cannot be included in this evaluation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). In contrast, however, it is striking that pPAM DANs seem to get input from more interneurons connected to the sensory system (up to 101 for DAN-j1) signaling additional internal somatosensory and CO<sub>2</sub> information. A closer inspection of the sensory-to-DAN interneurons showed that 27 of the 35 neurons are specifically innervating only DL1 or pPAM DANs (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>). Only 8 out of 35 interneurons connect to both clusters. Based on a calculated hub score sensory-to-DAN interneurons pair 1 (FB2IN-12) and pair 5 (FFN-21) were likely most significant for instructing DL1 DANs with sensory information. Whereas pairs 10 (FFN-17) and 11 (FFN-12) were – based on connectivity – most important in instructing DL1 and pPAM DANs. For the three pPAM DANs sensory-to-DAN interneuron pairs 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 resulted in the highest hub scores (FFN-37, FFN-4, FFN-5, FFN-18 and FB-4). The difference in cellular connectivity of DL1 and pPAM DANs is also reflected in different local input brain hubs: axo-dendritic synapses of sensory-to-DAN interneurons with DL1 DANs formed a characteristic hook-shape in the superior protocerebrum; in contrast, pPAM DANs get synaptic input from sensory-to-DAN interneurons in the anterior inferior protocerebrum (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8F</xref>).</p>

<title>A functional assignment for individual DANs of the DL1 cluster in their ability to encode a salt punishment teaching signal</title>
<p>The discovery of DL1 neurons as aversive teaching signal mediators in larval <italic>Drosophila</italic> complements previous findings that demonstrate the sufficiency of four DANs from the pPAM cluster as an appetitive reinforcement signal in these animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Rohwedder et al 2016</xref>). This dichotomy demonstrates an organizational principle shared by adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> and larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Aso et al 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Aso &amp; Rubin 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Aso et al 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Burke et al 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Claridge-Chang et al 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Das et al 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Huetteroth et al 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Liu et al 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Schleyer et al 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Schroll et al 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Selcho et al 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Weiglein et al 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Yamagata et al 2015</xref>), despite a significant reduction in cell numbers. The principle appears to apply to mammals as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Groessl et al 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Lammel et al 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Menegas et al 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Schultz 2015</xref>). But how do individual neurons contribute to the teaching signal of the complete cluster? Is the signal evenly distributed across multiple cells, supporting the mass action hypothesis, or do individual DANs specifically encode for the salt stimulus, as posited by the labeled line hypothesis? Our results show that the four DL1 DANs perform this function in a mixture of both forms. There is no unique labeled line because both ablation of each individual DAN (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) and the acute optogenetic inhibition (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>) do not abolish the odor-high salt memory. The teaching signal is combinatorically encoded within the DL1 cluster, yet its distribution among the four DANs is non-uniform and relies heavily on the functionalities of DAN-g1 and DAN-f1, (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>-<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Each DAN possesses a distinct identity, which is defined by its specific, albeit partially overlapping, neuronal input circuitry and physiological response to salt (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>We speculate that DAN-c1 activity does not encode a taste-specific teaching signal. It rather transmits preprocessed information from the higher brain to build a more integrated aversive memory, such as a general alert memory or a state-dependent memory as this particular cell is only weakly connected to three sensory neurons via a single sensor-to-DAN interneuron and is activated by both positive and negative tastes. DAN-d1 activity appears to have a negligible impact on the formation of odor-high salt memories in the paradigms we tested. Even though the neuron responds to high salt concentrations and receives input from 42 sensory neurons via six sensor-to-DAN interneurons, its activity did not induce an aversive memory and was not found to be essential for odor-high salt memory. Nonetheless, it is possible that DAN-d1 could instruct other salt-dependent memory types, established after non-associative training, second-order conditioning, or reversal learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Kacsoh et al 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Konig et al 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Mancini et al 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Paranjpe et al 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Tabone &amp; de Belle 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Yamada et al 2023</xref>). Indeed, other studies involving optogenetic training using CsChrimson and one-odor training suggest that DAN-d1 activation can even instruct aversive olfactory memory in larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Eschbach et al 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Weiglein et al 2021</xref>). In combination, DAN-f1 activity and DAN-g1 seem to have a crucial function in high salt punishment. DAN-f1 is inhibited by sugar and obtains input from 35 sensory neurons through six sensor-to-DAN interneurons. Despite persistent and current suppression of activity having no impact on the retention of a memory related to a high salt stimulus, DAN-f1 activity can instruct the formation of such a memory. This discovery is consistent with previous research, although their experimental designs differ from our own in the test situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Eschbach et al 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Weiglein et al 2021</xref>). Consequently, it is plausible that DAN-f1 activity encodes for a teaching signal that carries additional information beyond high salt. It is evident that DAN-g1 exerts the most potent effect. Following exposure to high salt, this cell becomes active, is crucial for the formation of an odor-high salt memory and can even establish it. Additionally, it receives extensive sensory input from nine neurons through 11 distinct interneurons. Therefore, DAN-g1 is the only cell of the DL1 cluster that satisfies all prerequisites to independently encode the high salt teaching signal. In summary, the DL1 cluster appears to be arranged in a judicious functional configuration. The instructive signal is encoded by a mere four cells, with the requisite redundancy to preclude loss of function in the event of single-cell failure. Nevertheless, the cells manifest variation, thereby covering different and cumulative characteristics of stimulation.</p>

<title>The functioning of the DL1 cluster DANs as a multimodal node for punishment</title>
<p>Larvae, of course, perceive not only high salt concentrations as punishing, but also other sensory stimuli such as bitter substances (quinines and caffeine), electric shock, temperature, mechanosensory input (vibration), and light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aceves-Pina &amp; Quinn 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Apostolopoulou et al 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Apostolopoulou et al 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Eschbach et al 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Gerber &amp; Hendel 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Khurana et al 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Pauls et al 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">von Essen et al 2011</xref>). However, the extent to which the DL1 cluster is involved in coding for most of these aversive teaching signals remains unclear. Currently, comparisons at the level of DANs can only be made for sensory inputs that are dependent on high salt or mechanosensation. Interestingly, similar to high salt concentrations, somatosensory information can also result in the establishment of aversive olfactory memory in larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Eschbach et al 2020</xref>). The transmission of these somatosensory teaching signals is orchestrated by mechanosensory neurons from the chordotonal organs, class IV multidendritic nociceptive neurons distributed along the body, and multisensory basin neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Hwang et al 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Jovanic et al 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Ohyama et al 2015</xref>, Tracey et al 2003). The connectome revealed that these mechanosensory neurons also link to the DL1 cluster through three to four interneurons and elicit the activation of DAN-d1, DAN-f1, and DAN-g1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Eschbach et al 2020</xref>). Upon comparing the interneurons that relay high salt and mechanosensory information to the DL1 cluster, six pairs of interneurons are of critical significance, respectively. These pairs include FFN-20, FB2N-12, FB2N-19, FFN-23, FFN-29, and FB2N-15 for mechanosensory information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Eschbach et al 2020</xref>), and FB2N-12, FB2N-18, FB2IN-11, FB2IN-6, FFN-21, and FFN-24 for high salt concentrations (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>; supplemental Figure 7, rightmost column). Interestingly, only one pair of interneurons - FB2N12 - is shared between the two types of information and the other five types are specific to the sensory modality. The wiring patterns of DAN input neurons exhibit a notable consistency, with a limited number of neurons dedicated to a specific sensory modality, and single neurons shared across different modalities. This results in a unique combination of cellular codes that are partly redundant and partly specific for the four DL1 DANs. While certain DANs may hold greater significance for a particular information, such as DAN-d1 for somatosensory information, the DAN-g1 cell appears to play a general central role for encoding an aversive teaching signal. DAN-g1 responds to all aversive stimuli tested thus far and its activity has proven informative for all aversive memories analyzed to date. In order to gain a deeper comprehension of the processing of diverse sensory modalities in the larval brain, it is crucial to broaden the analytical framework presented in our work to encompass visual stimuli, various bitter substances, and temperature stimuli.</p>
<p>However, the overall depiction presented above of the information flow and processing of DL1 DANs is an oversimplification. Indeed, DL1 and pPAM DANs are among the most complex and highly recurrent neurons in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Winding et al 2023</xref>). This exceptional level of recurrent connectivity enables DANs to provide high-dimensional feedback, which enables them to encode a diverse range of features and engage in parallel computations. Such computations can guide a working memory, contain feedback from neurons that integrate both learned and innate values, and receive long-range feedback from descending neurons that encode motor commands; all in addition to polysynaptic feedforward inputs from the entire set of sensory modalities.</p>

<title>A cellular comparison of DAN function across <italic>Drosophila</italic> metamorphosis</title>
<p>A recent study conducted by Truman and colleagues explored the integration, or lack thereof, of individual input and output neurons from the larval MB into the adult network following metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Truman et al 2023</xref>). The study demonstrated that while all four DANs of the pPAM cluster perished, three out of the four cells from the DL1 cluster persisted as part of the adult MB circuitry. Only DAN-f1 altered its innervation in the adult brain, relocating from the larval MB to the adult superior medial protocerebrum. In contrast, DAN-c1, DAN-d1, and DAN-g1 maintained their function as MB DANs in the adult system, identified as PPL1-γ1pedc, PPL1-γ2α’1, and PPL1-γ1, respectively.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of appropriate genetic tools, data on the function of PPL1-γ1 is scarce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Aso et al 2014</xref>). Therefore, a functional comparison between larval and adult DANs is only possible for the DAN-c1/PPL1-γ1pedc and DAN-d1/PPL1-γ2α’1 combination. Intriguingly, the adult PPL1 cluster has a bipartite functional organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Schnitzer et al 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Vrontou et al 2021</xref>). Embryonic-born DAN-c1/PPL1-γ1pedc, DAN-d1/PPL1-γ2α’1, and DAN-g1/PPL1-γ1 exhibit sustained activity and respond to various sensory stimuli, including electric shock, temperature, or bitter taste, that can instruct short lasting aversive memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Aso et al 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Aso &amp; Rubin 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Aso et al 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Claridge-Chang et al 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Das et al 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Galili et al 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kirkhart &amp; Scott 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Schnitzer et al 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Tomchik 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Villar et al 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Vrontou et al 2021</xref>). Conversely, rewarding stimuli such as sugar water inhibit the spiking of these DANs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Schnitzer et al 2023</xref>), possibly with involvement of NPF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Krashes et al 2009</xref>). The remaining three PPL1-DANs (PPL1-α′3, PPL1-α′2α2, PPL1-α3), which do not have a larval history, exhibit more sporadic firing and do not respond as strongly to environmental stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Vrontou et al 2021</xref>). With repeated conditioning cycles, these slower-acting PPL1-DANs become less inhibited by feedback from the short-term learning units DAN-c1/PPL1-γ1pedc and DAN-d1/PPL1-γ2α’1, enabling them to respond more strongly to sensory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Schnitzer et al 2023</xref>). Thus, the MB circuit in adult flies features a feedback loop involving embryonic-born DAN-c1/PPL1-γ1pedc and DAN-d1/PPL1-γ2α’1, which connect to output neurons that in turn communicate with later-born PPL1-α′3, PPL1-α′2α2, and PPL1-α3 DANs. This loop serves to facilitate short-term memory formation and regulate the induction of long-term memory traces, ensuring that only repeated and reliable associations are retained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Schnitzer et al 2023</xref>). Despite the massive reorganization of the mushroom body, the basic function of DAN-c1/PPL1-γ1pedc and DAN-d1/PPL1-γ2α’1, mediating punishment teaching signals that instruct short-term memories, remains the same. Evidence indicates that the underlying molecular signaling pathways maintain their identity and kinetics throughout development, with larval and adult interstimulus interval curves for DAN-d1/PPL1-γ2α’1 being almost identical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Aso &amp; Rubin 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Schnitzer et al 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Weiglein et al 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>During adulthood, PPL1-DANs are responsible for numerous other functions, including innate olfactory responses, suppression of appetite memory in response to nutritional status, pre-exposure learning, memory reconsolidation, and forgetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Berry et al 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Berry et al 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Felsenberg et al 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Jacob et al 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Krashes et al 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">McCurdy et al 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Placais et al 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Siju et al 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Tian et al 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Vrontou et al 2021</xref>). Additionally, they are involved in various behaviors like locomotion and sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Berry et al 2015</xref>). An open question is whether larval DL1 DANs encode these same functions to a similar extent. Our study establishes a fundamental framework that can be leveraged to investigate this issue. Considering the numerical simplicity of the larval nervous system, the available genetic tools, and the complete connectome, it may be possible to attain an understanding of the larval dopaminergic system at the level of single cells and single synapses. It is plausible that nature has a limited number of effective neural circuit solutions for complex cognitive and behavioral problems, such as the remarkable ability of brains to learn from a small number of examples. Therefore, comprehending the larval dopaminergic system may provide insight into the shared circuit motifs that exist across the animal kingdom.</p>

After that, larval brains were again washed eight times with PBT and mounted on poly-L-lysin-coated coverslips (Janelia FlyLight DPX mounting receipt: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.janelia.org/project-team/flylight/protocols">https://www.janelia.org/project-team/flylight/protocols</ext-link>), dehydrated through a series of increasing concentrations of ethanol and cleared three times for 5 minutes in xylene (Sigma Aldrich, cat. no. 247642). At the end, larval brains were mounted in DPX mounting medium (dibutyl phthalate in xylene, Sigma Aldrich, cat. no. 06522) and left to rest in the dark for at least 24 hours before imaging. Primary antibodies were: rat anti-N-Cadherin (1:50; Hybridoma, cat. no. DN-Ex #8-s), rabbit anti-GFP (1:1000; Life Technologies, cat. no.

<title>Native fluorescence</title>
<p>For native fluorescence, we used a previously described protocol for adult flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Pitman et al 2011</xref>) and adapted it to larvae. All split-Gal4 lines were crossed to UAS-mCD8::GFP;mb247-LexA,lexAop-mRFP/TM3,Sb, while split-Gal4 line MB054B was additionally crossed to UAS-mCD8::GFP;nSyb-LexA,lexAop-mRFP/TM6B and raised at 25°C for seven days. Third instar larvae (wandering stage) were put on ice and dissected in PBS. Brains were fixed under vacuum in 4% formaldehyde solution (in PBS) for 25 minutes at room temperature. After five washes in PBT (PBS with 3% Triton X-100), larval brains were rinsed twice directly and once for 10 minutes under vacuum in PBS at room temperature. Samples were mounted on poly-L-lysin-coated coverslips and embedded in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, cat. no. H-1000-10). Slides were stored in the dark and cold for at least 24 hours before imaging.</p>

<title>Functional Imaging and microfluidics</title>
<p>For larval imaging experiments, adult flies were transferred to larvae collection cages (Genesee Scientific) containing grape juice agar plates and 180 mg of fresh yeast paste per cage. Flies were allowed to lay eggs on the agar plate for 1–2 days before the plate was removed for collection of larvae. Calcium imaging experiments were performed in L1 larvae (2 days AEL). We used a previously described method for microfluidic delivery of chemicals in aqueous form with simultaneous imaging of calcium activity in intact larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Si et al 2019</xref>). All experiments used an 8-channel microfluidic chip equipped with a vacuum port to stabilize the animal’s head. The same tastants were used as in the behavioral experiments (NaCl: VWR Chemicals, cat. no. 27810.364; D-Fructose: Sigma Aldrich cat. no. 47740). Stimuli consisted of 5-10 s pulses interleaved with 15 s water washout periods. An L1 larva was washed with deionized water and loaded into the microfluidic device using a 1 mL syringe filled with Triton X-100 (0.1% [v/v]) solution. The animal was pushed to the end of the loading channel with its dorsal side facing the objective. GCaMP6m signal was recorded using an inverted Nikon Ti-E spinning disk confocal microscope and a 60X water immersion objective (NA 1.2). A CCD microscope camera (Andor iXon EMCCD) captured frames at 30 Hz. Recordings from at least 5–7 larvae were collected for each condition. For each larva the average response over 5s around the peak value during stimulus presentation was compared to chance level analyzed via normal t-test. Responses during stimulation were normalized based on the baseline response 10s before the stimulation. P-values for each experiment are given in the respective figure panel. Each graph shows the mean calcium signal plotted as the relative response strength ΔF/F and the related standard error of the mean on the y axis. The time in seconds is given below each graph on the x axis. The grey box indicates the duration of the stimulus application.

<title>Associative olfactory learning</title>
<p>Standard experiments were done as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Apostolopoulou et al 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Gerber et al 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hendel et al 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Michels et al 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Widmann et al 2018</xref>). Learning experiments were conducted on assay plates (85 mm diameter, Sarstedt, cat. no. 82.1472) filled with a thin layer of either 2.5% (w/v) pure agarose solution (Sigma Aldrich, cat. no. A9539) or 2.5% (w/v) agarose plus either 1.5 M sodium chloride solution (VWR Chemicals, cat. no. 27810.364), 2 M D-Fructose solution (Sigma Aldrich cat. no. 47740) or 10 mM quinine solution (quinine hemisulfate; Sigma Aldrich cat. no. Q1250). Before closing and labeling the lids, solutions were let to cool down at room temperature to avoid condensation. Plates were stored at 18°C and used within five days. As olfactory stimuli, we used two different odor combinations: either amyl acetate (AM, Sigma Aldrich, cat. no. 46022) diluted 1:250 in paraffin oil (Sigma Aldrich, cat. no. 76235) and undiluted benzaldehyde (BA, Sigma Aldrich, cat. no. 12010) or benzaldehyde and hexyl acetate (HA, Sigma Aldrich, cat. no. 108154) both diluted 1:100 in paraffin oil. For both odor combinations, 10 µL odor were loaded into custom-made Teflon containers (4.5 mm diameter) with perforated lids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Scherer et al 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>A minimum of 30 early third instar larvae were collected and exposed to a first odor (amyl acetate or hexyl acetate) while crawling on pure agarose for five minutes, followed by five minutes exposition to a second odor (benzaldehyde) on agarose medium with either 1.5 M sodium chloride, 10 mM quinine as negative reinforcer or 2 M D-Fructose as positive reinforcer (Odor1/Odor2+). For three cycle training, two more repetitions of training trials were performed. A second group of larvae received reciprocal training (Odor1+/Odor2). After one or three training cycles, larvae were transferred onto test plates containing either pure agarose (reward learning) or agarose plus salt or quinine (punishment learning) on which odor 1 and odor 2 were represented on opposite sides. After five minutes, larvae were counted on each side of the test plate (#Odor1, #Odor2) or in a 10 mm neutral zone in the middle of the plate (#Neutral). A Preference index (PREF) for each group of larvae was calculated as follows:
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="550661v1_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
To measure specifically the effect of associative learning, we then calculated the associative performance index (PI) as the difference in preference between the reciprocally trained larvae:
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="550661v1_ueqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
Negative Performance Indices represent aversive associated learning, whereas positive values represent appetitive learning. Division by 2 ensures scores are bound within (-1; 1).</p>

<title>Odor preference test</title>
<p>Pure agarose (2.5% w/v) plates were cast as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Apostolopoulou et al 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Gerber et al 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Michels et al 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Scherer et al 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Widmann et al 2018</xref>). Furthermore, the odors were prepared according to the dilutions used in the learning experiments. An odor container (either AM 1:250, BA undiluted, HA 1:100, or BA 1:100) was placed on one side of the agarose plate. An empty container was placed on the opposite side to exclude visual or other side effects. Approximately 30 third instar feeding stage larvae were collected and placed on the plate for 5 min. After this time, larvae were counted, subdivided into larvae on the odor side (#Odor), larvae on the empty container side (#Empty) and larvae in a 10 mm neutral zone in the middle of the plate, as well as larvae that were on the lid of the Petri dish (#Neutral). Preferences were calculated as follows:
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="550661v1_ueqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
Positive values indicate a preference for the respective odor, while negative values indicate odor avoidance. The preference tests were performed in different orientations (odor container on plate up/down/left/right) to exclude directional bias.</p>

<title>Gustatory preference test</title>
<p>High salt-dependent choice behavior experiments were performed using standard methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hendel et al 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Huser et al 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Huser et al 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Niewalda et al 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Selcho et al 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Widmann et al 2016</xref>). A 2.5% (w/v) agarose solution was boiled as previously described and a thick layer was poured into Petri dishes. After cooling, half of the agarose in the Petri dish was removed and filled by 2.5% (w/v) agarose solution with 1.5 M sodium chloride. For the choice experiment, about 30 third instar feeding stage larvae were put in the middle of the Petri dish and let them crawl for five minutes. Larvae were then counted as being located on the sodium chloride side (#NaCl), pure agarose side (#Agarose), or a neutral area of about 10 mm width in the middle of the plate (#Neutral), as well as larvae that were on the lid of the Petri dish (#Neutral). The gustatory preference indices for sodium chloride were calculated as follows:
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="550661v1_ueqn4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>

The second odor BA (undiluted) was presented in darkness for five minutes on a pure agarose plate. As described for odor-high salt learning, training was performed reciprocally and the sequence of training trials was alternated across repetitions of the experiment. Data were then scored as above. Please note, tests were done in the presence of 1.5 M sodium chloride to test for the specific quality of the memory.</p>

<title>Evaluation of DAN input wiring diagrams</title>
<p>Pie charts of sensory profiles were calculated using the percentage of total synaptic input of interneurons as fraction (thereby ignoring other inputs to show distribution of sensory origins). Percentages then give the percentage of total sensory synaptic input to interneurons. The calculation of the hub score was done in the following way: Fraction of total synaptic input from all sensory neurons to defined interneurons (see IDs) was multiplied by the total fraction of input of the DANs from this interneuron. For anatomical reconstructions and visualizations included here, we made use of earlier published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Eichler et al 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Eschbach et al 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Miroschnikow et al 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Winding et al 2023</xref>).</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Behavioral results were analyzed in GraphPad Prism 8.4.3. To test for normal distribution, Shapiro-Wilk test was applied. Groups that did not violate the assumption of normal distribution, were analyzed with an unpaired t-test (comparison of two groups) or a one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey’s post hoc test (comparisons between groups larger than two). For nonparametric statistics, Mann-Whitney test (comparison between two groups) or Kruskal-Wallis followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons tests were applied. Furthermore, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were performed to compare medians against chance level. Results are visualized in box-plots, indicating the median as middle line, 25%/75% quantiles as box boundaries and minimum/maximum performance indices as whiskers. Each data point is represented as black dot and sample sizes are noted within graphics. Asterisks and ‘‘n.s.’’ indicate p &lt; 0.05 and p &gt; 0.05, respectively.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this paper, Weber et al. investigate the role of 4 dopaminergic neurons of the Drosophila larva in mediating the association between an aversive high-salt stimulus and a neutral odor. The 4 DANs belong to the DL1 cluster and innervate non-overlapping compartments of the mushroom body, distinct from those involved in appetitive associative learning. Using specific driver lines, they show that activation of the DAN-g1 is sufficient to mimic an aversive memory and it is also necessary to form a high-salt memory of full strength, although optogenetic silencing of this neuron only partially affects the performance index. The authors use calcium imaging to show that the DAN-g1 is not the only one that responds to salt. DAN-c1 and d1 also respond to salt, but they seem to play no role in the assays tested. DAN-f1, which does not respond to salt, is able to lead to the formation of memory (if optogenetically activated), but it is not necessary for the salt-odor memory formation in normal conditions. However, silencing of DAN-f1 together with DAN-g1, enhances the memory deficit of DAN-g1.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The paper therefore reveals that also in the Drosophila larva as in the adult, rewards and punishments are processed by exclusive sets of DANs and that a complex interaction between a subset of DANs mediates salt-odor association.</p>
<p>
Overall, the manuscript contributes valuable results that are useful for understanding the organization and function of the dopaminergic system. The behavioral role of the specific DANs is accessed using specific driver lines which allow for testing of their function individually and in pairs. Moreover, the authors perform calcium imaging to test whether DANs are activated by salt, a prerequisite for inducing a negative association with it. Proper genetic controls are carried across the manuscript.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The authors use two different approaches to silence dopaminergic neurons: optogenetics and induction of apoptosis. The results are not always consistent, and the authors could improve the presentation and interpretation of the data. Specifically, optogenetics seems a better approach than apoptosis, which can affect the overall development of the system, but apoptosis experiments are used to set the grounds of the paper.</p>
<p>The physiological data would suggest the role of a certain subset of DANs in salt-odor association, but a different partially overlapping set seems to be necessary. This should be better discussed and integrated into the author's conclusion. The EM data analysis reveals a non-trivial organization of sensory inputs into DANs and it is hard to extrapolate a link to the functional data presented in the paper.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this work, the authors show that dopaminergic neurons (DANs) from the DL1 cluster in Drosophila larvae are required for the formation of aversive memories. DL1 DANs complement pPAM cluster neurons which are required for the formation of attractive memories. This shows the compartmentalized network organization of how an insect learning center (the mushroom body) encodes memory by integrating olfactory stimuli with aversive or attractive teaching signals. Interestingly, the authors found that the 4 main dopaminergic DL1 neurons act redundantly, and that single-cell ablation did not result in aversive memory defects. However, ablation or silencing of a specific DL1 subset (DAN-f1,g1) resulted in reduced salt aversion learning, which was specific to salt but no other aversive teaching stimuli were tested. Importantly, activation of these DANs using an optogenetic approach was also sufficient to induce aversive learning in the presence of high salt. Together with the functional imaging of salt and fructose responses of the individual DANs and the implemented connectome analysis of sensory (and other) inputs to DL1/pPAM DANs, this represents a very comprehensive study linking the structural, functional, and behavioral role of DL1 DANs. This provides fundamental insight into the function of a simple yet efficiently organized learning center which displays highly conserved features of integrating teaching signals with other sensory cues via dopaminergic signaling.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This is a very careful, precise, and meticulous study identifying the main larval DANs involved in aversive learning using high salt as a teaching signal. This is highly interesting because it allows us to define the cellular substrates and pathways of aversive learning down to the single-cell level in a system without much redundancy. It therefore sets the basis to conduct even more sophisticated experiments and together with the neat connectome analysis opens the possibility of unraveling different sensory processing pathways within the DL1 cluster and integration with the higher-order circuit elements (Kenyon cells and MBONs). The authors' claims are well substantiated by the data and clearly discussed in the appropriate context. The authors also implement neat pathway analyses using the larval connectome data to its full advantage, thus providing network pathways that contribute towards explaining the obtained results.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
While there is certainly room for further analysis in the future, the study is very complete as it stands. Suggestions for clarification are minor in nature.</p>

<p>The study of Weber et al. provides a thorough investigation of the roles of four individual dopamine neurons for aversive associative learning in the Drosophila larva. They focus on the neurons of the DL-1 cluster which already have been shown to signal aversive teaching signals. However, the authors go far beyond the previous publications and test whether each of these dopamine neurons responds to salt or sugar, is necessary for learning about salt, bitter, or sugar, and is sufficient to induce a memory when optogenetically activated. In addition, previously published connectomic data is used to analyze the synaptic input to each of these dopamine neurons. The authors conclude that the aversive teaching signal induced by salt is distributed across the four DL-1 dopamine neurons, with two of them, DAN-f1 and DAN-g1, being particularly important. Overall, the experiments are well designed and performed, support the authors' conclusions, and deepen our understanding of the dopaminergic punishment system.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
1. This study provides, at least to my knowledge, the first in vivo imaging of larval dopamine neurons in response to tastants. Although the selection of tastants is limited, the results close an important gap in our understanding of the function of these neurons.</p>
<p>2. The authors performed a large number of experiments to probe for the necessity of each individual dopamine neuron, as well as combinations of neurons, for associative learning. This includes two different training regimens (1 or 3 trials), three different tastants (salt, quinine, and fructose) and two different effectors, one ablating the neuron, the other one acutely silencing it. This thorough work is highly commendable, and the results prove that it was worth it. The authors find that only one neuron, DAN-g1, is partially necessary for salt learning when acutely silenced, whereas a combination of two neurons, DAN-f1 and DAN-g1, are necessary for salt learning when either being ablated or silenced.</p>
<p>3. In addition, the authors probe whether any of the DL-1 neurons is sufficient for inducing an aversive memory. They found this to be the case for three of the neurons, largely confirming previous results obtained by a different learning paradigm, parameters, and effector.</p>
<p>4. This study also takes into account connectomic data to analyze the sensory input that each of the dopamine neurons receives. This analysis provides a welcome addition to previous studies and helps to gain a more complete understanding. The authors find large differences in inputs that each neuron receives, and little overlap in input that the dopamine neurons of the &quot;aversive&quot; DL-1 cluster and the &quot;appetitive&quot; pPAM cluster seem to receive.</p>
<p>5. Finally, the authors try to link all the gathered information in order to describe an updated working model of how aversive teaching signals are carried by dopamine neurons to the larva's memory center. This includes important comparisons both between two different aversive stimuli (salt and nociception) and between the larval and adult stages.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
1. The authors repeatedly claim that they found/proved salt-specific memories. I think this is problematic to some extent.</p>
<p>1a. With respect to the necessity of the DL-1 neurons for aversive memories, the authors' notion of salt-specificity relies on a significant reduction in salt memory after ablating DAN-f1 and g1, and the lack of such a reduction in quinine memory. However, Fig. 5K shows a quite suspicious trend of an impaired quinine memory which might have been significant with a higher sample size. I therefore think it is not fully clear yet whether DAN-f1 and DAN-g1 are really specifically necessary for salt learning, and the conclusions should be phrased carefully.</p>
<p>1b. With respect to the results of the optogenetic activation of DL-1 neurons, the authors conclude that specific salt memories were established because the aversive memories were observed in the presence of salt. However, this does not prove that the established memory is specific to salt - it could be an unspecific aversive memory that potentially could be observed in the presence of any other aversive stimuli. In the case of DAN-f1, the authors show that the neuron does not even get activated by salt, but is inhibited by sugar. Why should activation of such a neuron establish a specific salt memory? At the current state, the authors clearly showed that optogenetic activation of the neurons does induce aversive memories - the &quot;content&quot; of those memories, however, remains unknown.</p>
<p>2. In many figures (e.g. figures 4, 5, 6, supplementary figures S2, S3, S5), the same behavioural data of the effector control is plotted in several sub-figures. Were these experiments done in parallel? If not, the data should not be presented together with results not gathered in parallel. If yes, this should be clearly stated in the figure legends.</p>
