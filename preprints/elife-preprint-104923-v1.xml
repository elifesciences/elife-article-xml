<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Chromosomal inversions are an important class of genetic variation that link multiple alleles together into a single inherited block that can have important effects on fitness. To study the role of large inversions in the massive evolutionary radiation of Lake Malawi cichlids, we used long-read technologies to identify four single and two tandem inversions that span half of each respective chromosome, and which together encompass over 10% of the genome. Each inversion is fixed in one of the two states within the seven major ecogroups, suggesting they played a role in the separation of the major lake lineages into specific lake habitats. One exception is within the benthic sub-radiation, where both inverted and non-inverted alleles continue to segregate within the group. The evolutionary histories of three of the six inversions suggest they transferred from the pelagic Diplotaxodon group into benthic ancestors at the time the benthic sub-radiation was seeded. The remaining three inversions are found in a subset of benthic species living in deep waters. We show that some of these inversions are used as XY sex-determination systems but are also likely limited to a subset of total lake species. Our work suggests that inversions have been under both sexual and natural selection in Lake Malawi cichlids and that they will be important to understanding how this adaptive radiation evolved.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Large genomic inversions are a particularly interesting type of genetic variation in the evolutionary process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. These rearrangements of DNA sequence strongly suppress recombination between inverted and non-inverted alleles, enabling the capture and accumulation of small genetic variants that are linked together on each inversion haplotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. These alternative haplotypes largely follow independent evolutionary paths within a species, accumulating new mutations that can affect phenotypes under natural and sexual selection. Structural rearrangements can be large, spanning multiple megabases of DNA containing hundreds of genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. They have been shown to play a role in adaptive divergence within a variety of species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, in creating alternative reproductive strategies and mating types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, in evolution of sex chromosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, and in the formation of pre- and post-zygotic barriers between incipient species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>When comparing the genomes of extant species, chromosomal inversions are often found as fixed differences, suggesting they might have an important role in speciation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. However, the forces responsible for establishing inversions remain obscure. Do they play a role in adaptation to new ecological niches exploited by incipient species? Do they carry genetic variants that create prezygotic barriers that drive speciation? Can they resolve sexual conflict, linking sex-specific alleles to sex determining loci to create sexually dimorphic species? Perhaps most likely, they play roles in many or all these processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Few vertebrates offer as much potential for investigating evolution and speciation as the <italic>Cichlidae</italic> family of fish, one of the most species-rich and diverse families of vertebrates, with an estimated 2,000-3,000 species across the globe <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Evolutionary radiations have occurred at least three times in the African Great Lakes (Lake Malawi, Lake Tanganyika, and Lake Victoria). In Lake Malawi, more than 800 species of cichlids evolved in the past 1.2 million years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Speciation in cichlid fishes involved extremely high levels of phenotypic divergence, including changes in body shape, jaw structures, and feeding behaviors related to prey in their ecological niches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Additionally, traits that create prezygotic barriers between species are also extremely diverse. Color patterns are quite dramatic and diverse among species and include both differences in color and species-specific patterns including bars, stripes, and blotches that are thought to reinforce barriers between species in sympatry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. In some species, mating is seasonal, with gatherings on ‘leks’ where males build bowers by scooping and spitting out sand over the course of a week or more<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Females choose mates based upon features of these bowers including shape and size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Most of the Lake Malawi species can be induced to interbreed in the lab, providing the opportunity to use genetic approaches to study causality of associated changes. Despite the presence of these prezygotic barriers, substantial gene flow has occurred multiple times within the lake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> and hybridization has been proposed to seed radiations within the African Great Lakes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Our current understanding of how the Lake Malawi radiation created &gt;800 species is a set of three serial diversifications, starting from a single riverine-like ancestor lineage, that created seven major ecogroups separated primarily by habitat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. A pelagic lineage separated first, further diversifying into a deep-water ecogroup (<italic>Diplotaxodon</italic>) and a mid-water ecogroup (<italic>Rhamphochromis</italic>). A muddy/sandy benthic lineage evolved from the ancestral riverine lineage next, which split into three ecogroups (collectively referred to as <italic>benthics</italic>) living either in the water column (<italic>utaka</italic>), over shallow sandy/muddy shores (<italic>shallow benthics</italic>), or in deep-water habitats (<italic>deep benthics</italic>). Finally, an ecogroup living over rocky habitats evolved (<italic>mbuna</italic>). The riverine generalist <italic>Astatotilapia calliptera (AC)</italic> living in the border regions of the lake and surrounding rivers, is the seventh ecogroup, and is thought to represent the ancestral lineage that seeded the three primary Lake Malawi lineages. Subsequent radiations within these ecogroups based on trophic specializations and sexual selection further diversified the species flock<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Here, we investigate the role large inversions played in the Lake Malawi radiation using new large molecule technologies. We identify four single large inversions and two double inversions, ranging from 9.9Mb to 20.6Mb in size. A fifth single inversion, composed of just one of the two tandem inversions on chromosome 20, was also identified, indicating a serial set of rearrangements created this structural variant. These inversions primarily segregate by ecogroup, with no inversions found in the <italic>mbuna</italic> and <italic>AC</italic> samples, one inversion fixed in <italic>Rhamphochromis</italic>, three inversions fixed in <italic>Diplotaxodon</italic>, and all six segregating within the <italic>benthic</italic> sub-radiation. The evolutionary histories of these inversions are inconsistent with the species phylogeny and suggest that the three <italic>Diplotaxodon</italic> inversions spread into the <italic>benthics</italic> via hybridization around the time the benthic lineage diverged from the ancestral riverine species. The three additional inversions are found primarily in <italic>benthic</italic> species living in deep water habitats. We provide evidence that three of the inversions are involved in sex determination in a subset of <italic>benthic</italic> species. Our work provides a framework for understanding the role of inversions in the adaptive radiation of Lake Malawi cichlids, and suggests multiple roles in the establishment of ecogroups, adaptation to deep water habitats, and in controlling traits under sexual selection.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Improvement of the Metriaclima zebra reference</title>
<p>The <italic>mbuna, Metriaclima zebra</italic>, was the first species sequenced as a reference genome for Lake Malawi cichlids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. The current version of its genome, called M_zebra_UMD2a, has been created by assembling PacBio reads into contigs which were anchored to 22 chromosomes using recombinant maps generated using crosses between different Lake Malawi species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. While the overall quality of this reference is high compared to other non-model organisms, a total of 20.5% of the DNA was not anchored to a chromosome. Additionally, the orientation of contigs can be ambiguous given how contigs were anchored to linkage groups using recombinant maps. These imperfections could complicate inversion discovery, so we first sought to improve the reference sequence.</p>
<p>The Bionano Saphyr system generates large (50 kb - 1 Mb) DNA molecules and labels a specific motif (CTTAAG) with a fluorescent probe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. While these molecules do not provide sequencing information, the distance between observed fluorescent loci can be used to assemble multiple molecules into large maps, with lengths spanning up to an entire chromosome. Comparison of these maps with an <italic>in-silico</italic> digest of the reference sequence identifies large structural changes in the observed sample or errors in the reference genome. We processed DNA collected from the blood of three <italic>Metriaclima zebra</italic> individuals using the Bionano pipeline and assembled DNA molecules into optical maps. We identified many discrepancies between the observed optical maps and the M_zebra_UMD2a assembly (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). These differences fall into two primary categories: 1) contigs that were incorrectly ordered or oriented and 2) unplaced contigs that Bionano anchored to specific chromosomes. The first category is consistent with errors in the assembly caused by ambiguity in placing contigs into a linkage group using recombination maps. Our results indicate that 178 of the contigs are incorrectly oriented and 133 of the unanchored contigs could be placed onto specific chromosomes.</p>

<p>To further improve the reference, we used PacBio HiFi reads generated from an additional male <italic>Metriaclima zebra</italic> individual to create a new genome assembly, taking advantage of the low overall error rate (&lt; 0.1%) of HiFi reads compared to previous generation PacBio technologies. Contigs generated from these data were combined with Bionano maps to generate a new hybrid genome assembly, which we refer to as the M_zebra_GT3a assembly. The overall quality of the assembly was excellent, with 933Mb of 962 Mb of DNA assigned to the 22 linkage groups, (<xref rid="d1e1259" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>) reducing the amount of unplaced contigs from 196 Mb to 28 Mb. The N50 length was 32.542Mb, with many of the scaffolds containing entire chromosomes.</p>

<title>Identification of six large inversions from 11 species of Lake Malawi cichlids</title>
<p>Armed with the improved reference, we used the Bionano system to test eight different species of Lake Malawi cichlids that were currently used for experimental studies in the Streelman or McGrath laboratories (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="d1e1259" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). We tested four <italic>mbuna</italic> species (<italic>Pseudotropheus demasoni, Cynotilapia zebroides, Labeotropheus fuelleborni, and Labeotropheus trewavasae)</italic>, two <italic>shallow benthic</italic> species (<italic>Mchenga conophoros</italic> and <italic>Nyassachromis prostoma</italic> “Orange Cap”), a single <italic>deep benthic</italic> species (<italic>Aulonocara sp. ‘chitande type north’ Nkhata Bay</italic>), and a single <italic>utaka</italic> species (<italic>Copidachromis virginalis)</italic>. To expand our coverage of the Lake Malawi radiation, we also obtained samples for a single species of the <italic>Diplotaxodon</italic> ecogroup, <italic>Diplotaxodon limnothrissa</italic>, and a single species of the <italic>Rhamphochromis</italic> ecogroup, <italic>Rhamphochromis longiceps</italic>. Finally, we also tested a single male <italic>Protomelas taeniolatus shallow benthic</italic> individual based on its position in principal component analysis of SNVs described below. In total, we were able to obtain samples from 6 of the 7 ecogroups, excluding <italic>Astatotilapia calliptera</italic>.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>From these 31 individuals, we identified six new inversions ranging from 9.9 - 22.9 Mb in size (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>): a single inversion on chromosomes 2, 10, 11, and 13, and a double inversion on chromosomes 11 and 20. Interestingly, regarding the double inversion on chromosome 20, we also identified four <italic>Rhamphochromis</italic> individuals that carried only the first inversion, lacking the 4.1 Mb long second part of this rearrangement (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). This indicates that the tandem inversions on 20 were formed by at least a two-part process, most parsimoniously with the left arm of the inversion (20a) forming first followed by the right inversion (20b) occurring in that genetic background.</p>

</fig>
<p>The distribution within these species is summarized in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The most common structural rearrangements were the single inversion on chromosome 9, the double inversion on chromosome 11, and the double inversion on chromosome 20. These were found in a combination of <italic>benthic</italic> and <italic>Diplotaxodon</italic> individuals. The position of these three inversions were qualitatively consistent with regions of low recombination rate previously identified in an intercross between a <italic>mbuna</italic> and <italic>benthic</italic> individual, as expected, since inversions suppress recombination between inverted and non-inverted haplotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. The remaining three inversions (2, 10, and 13) were only found in the <italic>Aulonocara sp. ‘chitande type north’ Nkhata Bay</italic> individuals. While for the majority of samples the inversion genotype was homozygous, for five samples optical maps supported both inverted and non-inverted haplotypes, indicating the inversions were heterozygous in those individuals (<xref rid="d1e1259" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
<p>To provide further support for these structural rearrangements, we generated <italic>de novo</italic> hybrid genome assemblies of three <italic>Aulonocara sp. ‘chitande type north’ Nkhata Bay</italic> individuals, which carry all six of the identified inversions, and two additional <italic>Metriaclima zebra</italic> individuals using a combination of PacBio HiFi reads and Bionano maps. The overall quality of these assemblies is high, with large N50 values and a small number of individual contigs (<xref rid="d1e1259" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S3</xref>). We performed whole genome alignments between the five new assemblies and the GT3a reference genome (<xref rid="d1e1259" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2-S7</xref>). These alignments show that the new assemblies support the presence of all six inversions in the <italic>Aulonocara sp. ‘chitande type north’ Nkhata Bay</italic> individuals. For most inversions, a single scaffold covered the entire inversion with breakpoints in locations consistent with the Bionano maps. The two new control assemblies were consistent with the M_zebra_GT3a reference and did not show any evidence of inversions in those regions. In other regions of the genome, however, there were differences in alignment of the M_zebra_GT3a assembly and the <italic>Metriaclima zebra</italic> genomes, most prominently in the left arm of chromosome 2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) and in the highly repetitive chromosome 3, which likely indicate some errors in the M_zebra_GT3a assembly.</p>
<p>We refined the location of the breakpoints for each inversion using the genomic alignments. However, the presence of a large amount of repetitive DNA in regions near the breakpoints prevented us from defining the inversion boundaries at single base pair resolution.</p>
<p>We also took advantage of a genome assembly for a <italic>Rhamphochromis sp ‘chilingali’</italic> individual (fRhaChi2.1) created by the Darwin Tree of Life Project produced using PacBio data and Arima2 Hi-C data (Accession PRJEB72870). The genome alignment between the fRhaChi2.1 assembly and the GT3a assembly confirmed a single inversion on chromosome 20, consistent with the Bionano data (<xref rid="d1e1259" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2-S7</xref>).</p>
<p>For each inversion, we determined the ancestral haplotype using two species as outgroups, <italic>Oreochromis niloticus</italic> and <italic>Pundamilia nyererei. Oreochromis niloticus</italic>, or Nile tilapia, is an important food fish that’s estimated to have diverged from Lake Malawi cichlids 14.1 to 30 million years ago while <italic>Pundamilia nyererei</italic> is a more closely related haplochromine found in Lake Victoria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. For this analysis we used a published whole genome assembly for <italic>Oreochromis niloticus</italic> (UMD_NMBU)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> and generated a hybrid genome assembly for <italic>Pundamilia nyererei</italic> using a previously published whole genome assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> combined with Bionano maps we produced from a single individual (<xref rid="d1e1259" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S8</xref>). For all six inversions, the reference haplotype found in the GT3a assembly represents the ancestral state.</p>

<title>Inference of the segregation of these inversions in Lake Malawi using short-read sequencing</title>
<p>The distribution of these inversions within the lake can provide important information to their function. Genotyping inversions using short read sequencing is possible because each haplotype is on an independent evolutionary trajectory due to the suppression of recombination. Population genetics approaches take advantage of the fact that inversions create patterns of inheritance between SNVs that are readily detected by approaches such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We analyzed short read sequencing data from the 31 samples with Bionano data along with 297 wild individuals published by the Durbin lab<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, 15 wild individuals published by the Streelman lab <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, and 22 wild individuals sequenced for this paper, aligning reads and calling small variants against our new M_zebra_GT3a reference genome. PCA analysis was used to analyze the major axes of variation across the whole genome and within the six inversions. We separately analyzed the left and right inversions on 11 and 20 (the two inversions on 11 were identical in their distribution). For the whole genome, the distribution of ecogroups within the first two principal components matched the previously reported results of Malinsky et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Individuals from four of the ecogroups - <italic>Rhamphochromis, Diplotaxodon, Astatotilapia callipter</italic>a, and <italic>mbuna</italic> - formed four distinct clusters (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref rid="d1e1259" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S9</xref>). A fifth, more diffuse cluster, composed of <italic>shallow benthics, deep benthics</italic>, and <italic>utakas</italic>, was also present. The broader distribution of the <italic>benthic</italic> ecogroups in PC space is consistent with both their recent separation as well as large amounts of gene flow thought to have occurred between these different species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>The PCA plots using the SNVs within the six inversions often violated the pattern of the whole genome PCA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref rid="d1e1259" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S10-S17</xref>). Using samples that were sequenced with both Illumina and Bionano technologies, we assigned each cluster to specific inversion genotypes (<xref rid="d1e1259" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). We did not have Bionano data for two clusters (one on 9 and one on 11 – see <xref rid="d1e1259" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S11, S13, and S14</xref>), so we supplemented our dataset by adding Bionano data from an additional <italic>shallow benthic</italic> individual (<italic>Protomelas taeniolatus</italic>) that fell into both clusters. The PCA clusters varied in their complexities for each inversion depending largely on their distribution within the <italic>benthic</italic> ecogroup (more on this below) and included both homozygous genotypes and heterozygous genotypes. We summarize the overall distribution of the inversions within each of the ecogroups in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>.</p>
<p>All specimens of the <italic>mbuna</italic> and <italic>AC</italic> ecogroup were fixed for the homozygous non-inverted alleles for all six inversions. In <italic>Rhamphochromis</italic>, all the inversions were homozygous non-inverted except for the left arm of 20 which was fixed for the single inversion state. The <italic>Diplotaxodon</italic> individuals all carried the non-inverted alleles for the inversions on 2, 10 and 13 and were fixed for the inversions on 9, 11, and 20.</p>
<p>The distribution of these inversions was the most complicated within the benthics. The inversions on 2, 10, and 13, which were identified in <italic>Aulonocara</italic> sp. ‘chitande type north’ Nkhata Bay, were mostly found together in other <italic>deep benthics</italic>, including the <italic>Alticorpus</italic> (<italic>geoffreyi, macrocleithrum, peterdaviesi</italic>), <italic>Aulonocara</italic> (<italic>blue chilumba, gold</italic> and <italic>minutus)</italic>, and <italic>Lethrinops</italic> (<italic>gossei, longimanus ‘redhead’, and sp. olivera</italic>) genera. The inversions on 2 and 13 were also found in the shallow benthic species <italic>Placidochromis longimanus</italic>. However, not all the <italic>deep benthics</italic> carried the three inversions, including five Aulonocara species (<italic>baenschi, getrudae, steveni, stuartgranti</italic>, and <italic>stuartgranti</italic> Maisoni<italic>)</italic> and a single Lethrinops species (<italic>longipinnis</italic>). The distribution of these three inversions in <italic>benthic</italic> species known to inhabit the deepest habitats are suggestive for a role in depth adaptation.</p>
<p>The double inversion on 20 was homozygous inverted in all benthic individuals. For the single inversion on 9, many <italic>benthics</italic> were homozygous for the inverted haplotype. However, an additional PC cluster was present, composed of 64 <italic>shallow benthic</italic> and <italic>utaka</italic> individuals heterozygous for the non-inverted haplotype (<xref rid="d1e1259" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>). Interestingly, no <italic>benthic</italic> individuals were identified as homozygous for the non-inverted state.</p>
<p>Finally, the distribution of the chromosome 11 double inversion was also determined. Individuals of all three genotypes (homozygous non-inverted, homozygous inverted, and heterozygous) were observed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>).</p>

Prominently, we found the three inversions on 9, 11, and 20 showed key differences in the relationship between the <italic>Diplotaxodon</italic> and <italic>benthic</italic> ecogroups. While <italic>Diplotaxodon</italic> is a sister group to <italic>Rhamphochromis</italic> at the species level, for these three inversions, the <italic>Diplotaxodon</italic> individuals formed a clade with the <italic>benthics</italic> that also carried the inversion.

<title>A role for large inversions in sex determination within the benthic ecogroup</title>
<p>The evolution of sex determination is often associated with the presence of inversions to repress recombination between the sex chromosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. We tested whether these inversions could play a role in sex determination in <italic>benthic</italic> species, as we identified individuals that were heterozygous for some of these inversions (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We started with the inversion on 10, as our Bionano data identified three male <italic>Aulonocara sp. ‘chitande type north’ Nkhata Bay</italic> individuals that were heterozygous and a single female that was homozygous for the inverted haplotype. To test whether this inversion acted as an XY system in this species, we tested two separate broods (Brood 1; 2 parents, 24 offspring and Brood 2: 2 parents, 24 offspring) currently growing in the laboratory, sequencing 12 males and 12 females from each brood with Illumina paired-end sequencing. We used PCA to genotype each of the 52 animals (4 parents and 48 offspring) for the chromosome 10 inversion genotype. The association in the offspring between the inversion 10 genotype and sex was almost perfect: 24 females and 1 male were homozygous for the inversion, while 23 males were heterozygous for the inversion (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="620687v1_fig5.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>We also used binned Weir Cockerham F<sup>st</sup> analysis, grouping male and female individuals to scan the genome for regions that were associated with sex (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). The inversion on 10 was the region of the genome that was in strongest linkage disequilibrium with sex. Males also had a much higher heterozygosity in this region than females (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Altogether, these results indicate that the inversion on 10 acts as an XY sex determiner in the <italic>Aulonocara sp. ‘chitande type north’ Nkhata Bay</italic> species.</p>
<p>We also tested eight laboratory <italic>Nyassachromis prostoma</italic> “Orange Cap” individuals, as our Bionano data identified a male that was heterozygous for the inversion on 11 and a female that was homozygous for the inversion. We performed short-read sequencing on three males and five females growing in the lab, genotyping the inversion using PCA analysis. All three males were heterozygous for the inversion while the five females were homozygous, a significant association between genotype and sex (Fisher exact test p-value = 0.0179). This suggests a separate XY system segregates in <italic>Nyassachromis prostoma</italic> “Orange Cap” using the inversion on chromosome 11.</p>
<p>Finally, for the inversion on nine, there was a cluster of heterozygous individuals that included 7 individuals that we had sex information for. All 7 of these individuals were male (<xref rid="d1e1259" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). While this association is not significant, it is also suggestive that the inversion on 9 could play a role in sex determination as well.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we characterize the presence of large inversions found in the Lake Malawi cichlid flock, identifying four single inversions and two double inversions, providing a framework to address the role structural variants played in this lake’s adaptive radiation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Inversions can have multiple roles in the evolutionary process: 1) they can capture beneficial alleles responsible for adaptation to local habitats, 2) they can capture alleles that create pre- and post-zygotic barriers that prevent gene flow during speciation, and 3) they can capture alleles that influence sex-specific phenotypes that are linked to sex-determination systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Future work is now possible to determine how these inversions contribute to the evolution of Lake Malawi cichlids through these mechanisms.</p>

</fig>
<p>The overall size of these inversions is large, together capturing &gt;10% of the genome (∼112 Mb). Apart from the <italic>benthics</italic>, the inversions are fixed in each ecogroup in the inverted or non-inverted state. Such a distribution would be expected in the local adaptation hypothesis if they were involved in the adaptation of these ecogroups to their respective lake habitats. In this scenario, the inversions would be under selection prior to speciation, and would play roles in: 1) the split of the pelagic group from the ancestral riverine lineage (the left arm of the inversion on 20), 2) the diversification of the <italic>Rhamphochromis</italic> and <italic>Diplotaxodon</italic> groups (the inversions on 9, 11, and right arm of 20), and 3) the adaptation of <italic>benthics</italic> to deeper water habitats (the inversions on 2, 10, and 13). The role of inversions in local adaptation between spatially separated populations has been well characterized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. If two populations are undergoing adaptive divergence in the presence of migration and gene flow, theory indicates that inversions will be selected for when they capture and link adaptive alleles together<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Given gene flow was likely common during the formation of the ecogroups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, we expect inversions that captured adaptive alleles that increase fitness in a habitat-specific context to feature prominently in ecogroup inception. This hypothesis predicts that adaptive alleles for each ecogroup are enriched within the inversions, which can be tested in Lake Malawi cichlids, as different species can interbreed to test whether the inversions are associated with differences in phenotypes.</p>
<p>While the role of the inversions in most of the ecogroups could potentially be explained by local adaptation, their role in the benthic sub-radiation appears to be more complicated. Inverted and non-inverted haplotypes for five of the six inversions are segregating within this group. Additionally, the presence of the 9, 11, and 20 inversions within <italic>benthics</italic> violates the whole species phylogeny and is consistent with its spread from the <italic>Diplotaxodon</italic> to a very early <italic>benthic</italic> ancestor via introgression between ancestors of these two groups. Hybridization has been proposed to fuel adaptive radiations of cichlids in all three great African lakes (Malawi, Tanganyika, and Victoria) and our work suggests that an ancient hybridization event between early <italic>benthic</italic> and <italic>Diplotaxodon</italic> ancestors occurred prior to the benthic radiation resulting in the 3 inversions (as well as other regions of the genome) spreading into what ultimately became the <italic>benthic</italic> ecogroup<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. It will be interesting to study the role of these three inversions in <italic>benthic</italic> species. <italic>Diplotaxodon</italic> are pelagic, deep-water dwellers that feed on plankton or small fish while <italic>benthics</italic> live near the shore over sandy and muddy habitats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. It is not obvious how the traits of the <italic>Diplotaxodon</italic> would benefit <italic>benthic</italic> animals that live in such dissimilar environments. However, the initial habitats that the <italic>benthic</italic> ancestors utilized is not known and potentially their initial habitat was in deeper waters than the <italic>AC</italic> ancestors. Whether or not these inversions were involved in the benthic radiations, they are not strictly required for large radiations as the <italic>mbuna</italic> group, with an estimated &gt;300 species, carries zero large inversions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. This could reflect the relative importance of allopatric vs. sympatric speciation in the two radiations, as the rocky habitats the <italic>mbuna</italic> inhabit are often spatially separated throughout the lake.</p>
<p>The inversions we identified also play a role in sex determination in the <italic>benthics</italic>, with at least three of the inversions (9, 10, and 11) acting as XY systems to control sex determination. Despite the importance of the maintenance of distinct, reproductively compatible sexes, sex determination systems can be evolutionarily labile, and Lake Malawi cichlids show exceptional variability, with at least 5 different genetic sex determination systems described to date<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. While we implicated multiple inversions in sex determination, our work also underscores how dynamic sex determination is within the <italic>benthics</italic>. While many benthic <italic>species</italic> carry the different inversions, their genotypic distribution in most species is inconsistent with a role for sex determination. Effectively, the genetic determination of sex determination largely must be determined in a species by species way, and individual species may be segregating multiple sex determination systems. Additionally, these inversions could have played a role in sex determination in the ancestors of pelagic ecogroups, which could have contributed to their spread before sex chromosome turnover ended balancing selection on the inverted/non-inverted haplotypes and subsequent fixation of these inversions. Identification of the causal alleles for sex determination on these inversions will allow us to resolve this question.</p>
<p>The presence of non-inverted haplotypes in the <italic>benthics</italic> could have been retained from the time the lineage initially formed, with both haplotypes under balancing selection if they were used for sex determination. A recent preprint, however, which identified 5 of the 6 inversions presented here via short-read sequencing of 1375 individuals sampled from Lake Malawi, presented an alternative model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. They proposed the non-inverted haplotypes of the 9 and 10 inversions were introgressed back into the <italic>benthics</italic> from riverine species within and outside of the lake. Similarly, the non-inverted haplotypes on chromosomes 2, 10, and 13 in the <italic>deep benthics</italic> were introgressed from <italic>shallow benthics</italic>. In this model, it is unclear what evolutionary forces drove these back introgressions of the non-inverted alleles and when they developed a role in sex determination.</p>
<p>The selective forces on sex chromosomes are strong, including balancing selection for sex ratio and sexually antagonistic selection on sexually dimorphic phenotypes. Lake Malawi cichlids show amazing sex differences, characterized by diversification in numerous phenotypes, including pigmentation, behavior, and morphology thought to contribute to species barriers. The use of inversions in sex-determination allows for the accumulation of alleles in linkage with the sex-determiner gene which will have sex-specific effects in the male individuals that carry the Y chromosomes. Interestingly in all three cases, the non-inverted haplotype acts as the Y, suggesting that different haplotypes could play independent roles in evolution. For example, the inversion X haplotype on 10 could carry alleles responsible for adaptation to deep water habits, which would be carried by both sexes, while the non-inverted Y haplotype carries alleles under sexual selection.</p>
<p>This report provides an initial framework for understanding the role of inversions in the adaptive radiation of Lake Malawi cichlids. Future work identifying and characterizing causal alleles captured within these inversions will enable us to discern the specific mechanisms by which they contribute to speciation using this remarkable evolutionary system as a model for the evolution of all animals.</p>

<p>A scaffold-level genome was identically generated for Mzebra_GT3a. These scaffolds were further aligned to the corrected UMD2a genome (see below) and anchored to linkage groups using D-GENIES<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> with the Minimap2 v2.28 aligner and “Many repeats” options. An anchored genome was output using the Query assembled as reference export option.</p>
<p>Note that the mitochondrial DNA sequence in Mzebra_GT3a is the same as the mitochondria assembled in UMD2a. This Whole Genome Shotgun project has been deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the accession JBEVYI000000000. The version described in this paper is version JBEVYI010000000.</p>

<title>Correcting errors in M_zebra_UMD2a</title>
<p>We generated Bionano molecules for 3 male and 1 female <italic>Metriaclima zebra</italic> subjects, assembled Bionano maps, and aligned them to the UMD2a reference genome. We reordered or reoriented contigs that were revealed as misassemblies or inversions, respectively, in all four Bionano maps and also corresponded to breakpoints between contigs in UMD2a. By filtering interchromosomal translocation calls in the Bionano Access software, we were able to insert unmapped contigs into the established linkage groups.</p>

<p>Using several hundreds of samples and cutting-edge genomic methods, including BioNano, PacBio HiFi, and advanced bioinformatic pipelines, the authors identify six large chromosomal inversions segregating in over 100 species of Lake Malawi cichlids. This <bold>important</bold> study provides <bold>compelling</bold> evidence for the presence of these six inversions, their differential distribution among populations, and the association of chromosome 10 inversion with a sex-determination locus. This work also provides a starting point for further investigating the role of these inversions with respect to local adaptation, speciation, sex determination, hybridization, and <bold>incomplete</bold> lineage sorting in cichlids, which represent ~5% of the extant vertebrate species and are one of the most prominent examples of adaptive radiations.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Using high-quality genomic data (long-reads, optical maps, short-reads) and advanced bioinformatic analysis, the authors aimed to document chromosomal rearrangements across a recent radiation (Lake Malawi Cichlids). Working on 11 species, they achieved a high-resolution inversion detection and then investigated how inversions are distributed within populations (using a complementary dataset of short-reads), associated with sex, and shared or fixed among lineages. The history and ancestry of the inversions is also explored.</p>
<p>On one hand, I am very enthusiastic about the global finding (many inversions well-characterized in a highly diverse group!) and impressed by the amount of work put into this study. On the other hand, I have struggled so much to read the manuscript that I am unsure about how much the data supports some claims. I'm afraid most readers may feel the same and really need a deep reorganisation of the text, figures, and tables. I reckon this is difficult given the complexity brought by different inversions/different species/different datasets but it is highly needed to make this study accessible.</p>
<p>The methods of comparing optical maps, and looking at inversions at macro-evolutionary scales can be useful for the community. For cichlids, it is a first assessment that will allow further tests about the role of inversions in speciation and ecological specialisation. However, the current version of the manuscript is hardly accessible to non-specialists and the methods are not fully reproducible.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Evidence for the presence of inversion is well-supported by optical mapping (very nice analysis and figure!).</p>
<p>(2) The link between sex determination and inversion in chr 10 in one species is very clearly demonstrated by the proportion in each sex and additional crosses. This section is also the easiest to read in the manuscript and I recommend trying to rewrite other result sections in the same way.</p>
<p>(3) A new high-quality reference genome is provided for Metriaclima zebra (and possibly other assemblies? - unclear).</p>
<p>(4) The sample size is great (31 individuals with optical maps if I understand well?).</p>
<p>(5) Ancestry at those inversions is explored with outgroups.</p>
<p>(6) Polymorphism for all inversions is quantified using a complementary dataset.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Lack of clarity in the paper: As it currently reads, it is very hard to follow the different species, ecotypes, samples, inversions, etc. It would be useful to provide a phylogeny explicitly positioning the samples used for assembly and the habitat preference. Then the text would benefit from being organised either by variant or by subgroups rather than by successive steps of analysis.</p>
<p>(2) Lack of information for reproducibility: I couldn't find clearly the filters and parameters used for the different genomic analyses for example. This is just one example and I think the methods need to be re-worked to be reproducible. Including the codes inside the methods makes it hard to follow, so why not put the scripts in an indexed repository?</p>
<p>(3) Further confirmation of inversions and their breakpoints would be valuable. I don't understand why the long-reads (that were available and used for genome assembly) were not also used for SV detection and breakpoint refinement.</p>
<p>(4) Lack of statistical testing for the hypothesis of introgression: Although cichlids are known for high levels of hybridization, inversions can also remain balanced for a long time. what could allow us to differentiate introgression from incomplete lineage sorting?</p>
<p>(5) The sample size is unclear: possibly 31 for Bionano, 297 for short-reads, how many for long-reads or assemblies? How is this sample size split across species? This would deserve a table.</p>
<p>(6) Short read combines several datasets but batch effect is not tested.</p>
<p>(7) It is unclear how ancestry is determined because the synteny with outgroups is not shown.</p>
<p>(8) The level of polymorphism for the different inversions is difficult to interpret because it is unclear whether replicated are different species within an eco-group or different individuals from the same species. How could it be that homozygous references are so spread across the PCA? I guess the species-specific polymorphism is stronger than the ancestral order but in such a case, wouldn't it be worth re-doing the PCa on a subset?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Chromosomal inversions have been predicted to play a role in adaptive evolution and speciation because of their ability to &quot;lock&quot; together adaptive alleles in genomic regions of low recombination. In this study, the authors use a combination of cutting-edge genomic methods, including BioNano and PacBio HiFi sequencing, to identify six large chromosomal inversions segregating in over 100 species of Lake Malawi cichlids, a classic example of adaptive radiation and rapid speciation. By examining the frequencies of these inversions present in species from six different linages, the authors show that there is an association between the presence of specific inversions with specific lineages/habitats. Using a combination of phylogenetic analyses and sequencing data, they demonstrate that three of the inversions have been introduced to one lineage via hybridization. Finally, genotyping of wild individuals as well as laboratory crosses suggests that three inversions are associated with XY sex determination systems in a subset of species. The data add to a growing number of systems in which inversions have been associated with adaptation to divergent environments. However, like most of the other recent studies in the field, this study does not go beyond describing the presence of the inversions to demonstrate that the inversions are under sexual or natural selection or that they contribute to adaptation or speciation in this system.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>All analyses are very well done, and the conclusions about the presence of the six inversions in Lake Malawi cichlids, the frequencies of the inversions in different species, and the presence of three inversions in the benthic lineages due to hybridization are well-supported. Genotyping of 48 individuals resulting from laboratory crosses provides strong support that the chromosome 10 inversion is associated with a sex-determination locus.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The evidence supporting a role for the chromosome 11 inversion and the chromosome 9 inversion in sex determination is based on relatively few individuals and therefore remains suggestive. The authors are mostly cautious in their interpretations of the data. However, there are a few places where they state that the inversions are favored by selection, but they provide no evidence that this is the case and there is no consideration of alternative hypotheses (i.e. that the inversions might have been fixed via drift).</p>

<p>This is a very interesting paper bringing truly fascinating insight into the genomic processes underlying the famous adaptive radiation seen in cichlid fishes from Lake Malawi. The authors use structural and sequence information from species belonging to distinct ecotypic categories, representing subclades of the radiation, to document structural variation across the evolutionary tree, infer introgression of inversions among branches of the clade, and even suggest that certain rearrangements constitute new sex-determining loci. The insight is intriguing and is likely to make a substantial contribution to the field and to seed new hypotheses about the ecological processes and adaptive traits involved in this radiation.</p>
<p>I think the paper could be clarified in its prose, and that the discussion could be more informative regarding the putative roles of the inversions in adaptation to each ecotypic niche. Identifying key, large inversions shared in various ways across the different taxa is really a great step forward. However, the population genomics analysis requires further work to describe and decipher in a more systematic way the evolutionary forces at play and their consequences on the various inversions identified.</p>
<p>The model of evolution involving multiple inversions putatively linking together co-adapted &quot;cassettes&quot; could be better spelled out since it is not entirely clear how the existing theory on the recruitment of inversions in local adaptation (e.g. Kirkpatrick and Barton) operates on multiple unlinked inversions. How such loci correspond to distinct suites of integrated traits, or not, is not very easy to envision in the current state of the manuscript.</p>
<p>The role of one inversion in sex determination is apparent and truly intriguing. However, the implication of such locus on ecological adaptation is somewhat puzzling. Also, whether sex determination loci can flow across species via introgression seems quite important as a route to chromosomal sex determination, so this could be discussed further.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewers for the careful review of our manuscript. Overall, they were positive about our use of cutting-edge methods to identify six inversions segregating in Lake Malawi. Their distribution in ~100 species of Lake Malawi species demonstrated that they were differentially segregating in different ecogroups/habitats and could potentially play a role in local adaptation, speciation, and sex determination. Reviewers were positive about our finding that the chromosome 10 inversion was associated with sex-determination in a deep benthic species and its potential role in regulating traits under sexual selection. They agree that this work is an important starting point in understanding the role of these inversions in the amazing phenotypic diversity found in the Lake Malawi cichlid flock.</p>
<p>There were two main criticisms that were made which we summarize:</p>
<p>(1) Lack of clarity. It was noted that the writing could be improved to make many technical points clearer. Additionally, certain discussion topics were not included that should be.</p>
<p>We will rewrite the text and add additional figures and tables to address the issues that were brought up in a point-by-point response. We will improve/include (1) the nomenclature to understand the inversions in different lineages, (2) improved descriptions for various genomic approaches, (3) a figure to document the samples and technologies used for each ecogroup, and 4) integration of LR sequences to identify inversion breakpoints to the finest resolution possible.</p>
<p>(2) We overstate the role that selection plays in the spread of these inversions and neglect other evolutionary processes that could be responsible for their spread.</p>
<p>We agree with the overarching point. We did not show that selection is involved in the spread of these inversions and other forces can be at play. Additionally, there were concerns with our model that the inversions introgressed from a <italic>Diplotaxodon</italic> ancestor into <italic>benthic</italic> ancestors and incomplete lineage sorting or balancing selection (via sex determination) could be at play. Overall, we agree with the reviewers with the following caveats. 1. Our analysis of the genetic distance between <italic>Diplotaxodons</italic> and <italic>benthic</italic> species in the inverted regions is more consistent with their spread through introgression versus incomplete lineage sorting or balancing selection. 2. This question of selection is much more complicated in the context of the Lake Malawi cichlid radiation with ~800 different species. We believe the role of these inversions must be considered in a species- and time-specific way. In other words, the evolutionary forces acting on these inversions at the time of their formation are likely different than the role of the evolutionary forces acting now. Further the role of these inversions is likely different in different species. For example, the inversion of 10 and 11 play a role in sex determination in some species but not others and the potential pressures acting on the inverted and non-inverted haplotypes will be very different. These are very interesting and important questions booth for understanding the adaptive radiations in Lake Malawi and in general, and we are actively studying crosses to understand the role of these inversions in phenotypic variation between two species. We will modify the text to make all of these points clearer.</p>
