<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>Deficient Anterior pituitary with common Variable Immune Deficiency (DAVID) syndrome is a rare condition characterized by the association of adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency (ACTHD) and primary hypogammaglobulinemia, caused by <italic>NFKB2</italic> heterozygous mutations. Nuclear factor kappa B (NFKB) signaling is a key regulator of the immune system; however, the underlying mechanism of its association with endocrine symptoms remains unknown. Two main hypotheses explain the effects of mutant NFKB2 on the pituitary gland: an autoimmune hypophysitis, preferentially affecting corticotroph function, or a primary developmental defect. The role of NFKB2 in the development of the human pituitary was called into question by <italic>Nfkb2</italic>-deficient <italic>Lym1</italic> mice, which have normal pituitary functions.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to create a human disease model to define the role of <italic>NFKB2</italic> in human pituitary development.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We established pituitary organoids in three dimensions (3D) culture after directed differentiation from CRISPR/Cas9-edited human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC). First, we conducted a proof-of-concept study, introducing a homozygous <italic>TBX19<sup>K</sup></italic><sup>146</sup><italic><sup>R/K</sup></italic><sup>146</sup><italic><sup>R</sup></italic> missense pathogenic variant in hiPSC, an allele found in patients with congenital isolated ACTHD. Then, we used the same method to produce <italic>NFKB2<sup>D</sup></italic><sup>865</sup><italic><sup>G/D</sup></italic><sup>865</sup><italic><sup>G</sup></italic> mutant organoids, harboring the pathogenic missense variant previously identified in DAVID patients. This mutation causes a failure of NFKB2 p100 phosphorylation that blocks processing to form active NFKB2 p52. We then characterized pituitary organoid development by transcriptomics using bulk RNA sequencing and quantitative RT-PCR, and by immunofluorescence in section and whole-mount.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>Analysis of wild-type (WT) organoids demonstrated that this <italic>in vitro</italic> model recapitulates corticotroph cell differentiation. <italic>TBX19<sup>K</sup></italic><sup>146</sup><italic><sup>R/K</sup></italic><sup>146</sup><italic><sup>R</sup></italic> organoids conserved early expression of <italic>HESX1</italic>, but had significantly decreased <italic>PITX1</italic>, <italic>TBX19</italic>, <italic>LHX3,</italic> and <italic>POMC</italic> transcription<italic>. NFKB2<sup>D</sup></italic><sup>865</sup><italic><sup>G/D</sup></italic><sup>865</sup><italic><sup>G</sup></italic> organoids also had dramatically reduced corticotrophs. Furthermore, <italic>NFKB2<sup>D</sup></italic><sup>865</sup><italic><sup>G/D</sup></italic><sup>865</sup><italic><sup>G</sup></italic> perturbs the normal expression of 66 genes known to contribute to pituitary development, among which 21 transcription factors.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We used a combination of CRISPR/Cas9 editing and refinement of a 3D organoid culture protocol to model human ACTHD due to <italic>TBX19</italic> or <italic>NFKB2</italic> mutations. The <italic>NFKB2</italic> variant studied induced a significant decrease in corticotroph differentiation, demonstrating for the first time a direct functional role of NFKB2 in human pituitary development. Signaling through NFKB2 is thus a valid new candidate pathway in the pathogenesis of isolated or syndromic ACTHD.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency (ACTHD) is defined by an insufficient production of ACTH by the pituitary, followed by low adrenal cortisol production. Proper diagnosis and management of ACTHD is crucial, as it is a life-threatening condition in the neonatal period, characterized by hypoglycemia, cholestatic jaundice and seizures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Constitutional ACTHD, which is diagnosed at birth or during the first years of life, can be isolated or associated with deficiencies in other pituitary hormones such as growth hormone (GH) or thyrotropin-stimulating hormone (TSH) and termed combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD). ACTHD is genetically heterogeneous, due to mutations in genes coding mostly for transcription factors responsible for pituitary ontogenesis or their regulation. Responsible genes identified to date include the T-box transcription factor <italic>TBX19</italic> (also known as <italic>TPIT</italic>)<italic>, NFKB2, LHX3, LHX4, PROP1, HESX1, SOX2, SOX3, OTX2</italic> and <italic>FGF8</italic>.</p>
<p>Mutations of <italic>TBX19</italic> account for approximately two-thirds of neonatal-onset complete isolated ACTHD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. TBX19 is a T-box transcription factor restricted to pituitary pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-expressing cells in mice and humans. It is essential for <italic>POMC</italic> gene transcription and terminal differentiation of POMC-expressing cells in the anterior pituitary (also known as the adenohypophysis)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. POMC is cleaved to produce ACTH in corticotroph cells. <italic>TBX19</italic>-deficient mice have only a few pituitary <italic>POMC</italic>-expressing cells, with very low ACTH and undetectable corticosterone levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. In humans with isolated ACTH deficiency, <italic>TBX19</italic> mutations lead to loss-of-function by different mechanisms, such as the K146R (exon 2, c.437 A&gt;G) pathogenic variant located in the T-box region, which results in a loss of DNA-binding ability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Thanks to GENHYPOPIT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, an international network aimed at identifying new genetic etiologies of combined pituitary hormone deficiency, we described the first cases of DAVID (Deficient Anterior pituitary with common Variable Immune Deficiency) syndrome, a rare association of hypopituitarism (mainly ACTHD) and immune deficiency (hypogammaglobulinemia) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. DAVID syndrome is associated with variants in the nuclear factor kappa-B subunit 2 (<italic>NFKB2</italic>) gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. In particular, we reported that a pathogenic, heterozygous D865G (exon 23, c.2594 A&gt;G) <italic>NFKB2</italic> variant was found in a patient presenting with severe recurrent infections from 2 years of age, who at the age of 5 was diagnosed with ACTHD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Mutations in the C-terminal region of NFKB2 lead to the disruption of both non-canonical and canonical pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Full-length NFKB2 (p100) protein has 2 critical serines, S866 and S870, in the C-terminal domain. Phosphorylation of these sites yields the transcriptionally active form of NFKB2 (p52) by enabling the proteasomal processing of the larger p100 protein. The D865G mutation, located adjacent to the critical S866 phosphorylation site, protects mutant protein from proteasomal degradation, causes defective processing of p100 to p52, and results in reduced translocation of p52 to the nucleus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. <italic>NFKB2<sup>D</sup></italic><sup>865</sup><italic><sup>G/+</sup></italic> resulted in half of the normal level of processing to p52, whereas <italic>NFKB2<sup>D</sup></italic><sup>865</sup><italic><sup>G/D</sup></italic><sup>865</sup><italic><sup>G</sup></italic> exhibited near-absence of p52<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. The nuclear factor kappa B (NFKB) signaling pathway is a key regulator of the immune system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, which likely explains the immune phenotype of patients with DAVID syndrome, including susceptibility to infections and auto-immune disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. In contrast, the underlying mechanism causing pituitary disorders remains unknown, with two predominating hypotheses: an indirect autoimmune hypophysitis, preferentially affecting corticotroph function, or a primary developmental defect supported by the expression of <italic>NFKB2</italic> in the human fetal pituitary<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. However, a developmental role for NFKB2 was not confirmed in the <italic>Lym1</italic> mouse model, carrying a heterozygous or homozygous nonsense variant Y868*, which presented apparently normal pituitary development and function although impairing immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Although the mouse continues to be a relevant model for many aspects of pituitary organ development, we sought a higher-throughput method to assess pathogenic effects of new candidate genes or variants on human pituitary differentiation.</p>
<p>Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived organoids have emerged as promising models to study many developmental mechanisms and their perturbation in disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Pioneering work on human embryonic stem cells and later, hiPSC, established that 3D organoid models can replicate aspects of pituitary development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, and could thus be of major interest in modeling pituitary disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. In the present study, we applied recent progress in genome editing using CRISPR/Cas9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> to a refined protocol to derive 3D organoids from hiPSC in order to model ACTHD. We validated the recapitulation of corticotroph cell differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic> by introducing a <italic>TBX19</italic> mutation known to induce isolated human ACTHD and documenting the subsequent deficiencies in corticotroph development. When used to characterize the D865G <italic>NFKB2</italic> variant found in patients with DAVID syndrome, hiPSC-derived pituitary organoids displayed dramatically altered corticotroph differentiation in the absence of immune cells, demonstrating for the first time a direct and incontrovertible role for NFKB2 in human pituitary development.</p>

<title>Preparation of the CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA plasmid</title>
<p>For each targeted gene, a sgRNA plasmid was prepared as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Briefly, we designed a sgRNA sequence within 20 nucleotides of the target site, selected with the open-source CRISPOR tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://crispor.tefor.net/">http://crispor.tefor.net/</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>

Ten thousand cells per organoid were plated in 20 µL hanging drops under the lid of a 127.8 x 85,5mm single-well plate (Greiner bio-one) in growth factor-free, chemically defined medium (gfCDM) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) Knockout Serum Replacement (KSR; Thermo Fisher Scientific, #10828-010) and 20 µM Y-27632 (Sigma-Aldrich, # SCM75). The lid was inverted over the bottom chamber (filled with 10 mL of sterile water to avoid the evaporation of droplets) and incubated at 37°C/5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 2 days. Once aggregates formed, organoids were transferred to non-adhesive 100x20mm culture dishes (Corning) containing 10 mL of gfCDM medium supplemented with 10% KSR without Y-27632 and incubated at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> until day 6.

In line with the qRT-PCR results, <italic>TBX19</italic><sup>K146R/K146R</sup> organoids immunostaining on day 48 showed that LHX3 protein expression was decreased, in contrast to WT organoids (n= 10 organoids for each group, <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref>, 3C</bold>).

<p>Finally, in order to take into account the possibility of regionalized sampling or damage in the process of histological section, we also confirmed that ACTH production was nearly abolished in <italic>TBX19<sup>K</sup></italic><sup>146</sup><italic><sup>R/K</sup></italic><sup>146</sup><italic><sup>R</sup></italic> organoids overall on day 105 as compared to control organoids.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>After describing the rare combination of an anterior pituitary deficit, mostly ACTHD, with common variable immunodeficiency in DAVID syndrome, we and others found that affected patients carry <italic>NFKB2</italic> gene mutations affecting specific C-terminal residues of the NFKB2 protein known to play important roles in immunity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. As the spontaneous mouse knockout mutant of the orthologous gene lacks an endocrine phenotype, yet <italic>NFKB2</italic> is transcribed in the prenatal human pituitary gland, we wanted to investigate the mechanisms of ACTHD in a human disease model.</p>
<p>The available <italic>in vitro</italic> models to study ACTHD and CPHD had strong limitations. For instance, studies based on transfections and luciferase-coupled hormone promoters can only give indirect evidence of the effect of a variant of unknown significance on the activity of a given transcription factor, as they are based on non-physiological amounts of DNA and promoter constructs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Murine models only partially replicate human CPHD, as already shown for <italic>PROP1</italic> mutations in ACTHD (absent in mice but present in 40% of humans)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. However, reprogramming differentiated adult cells into induced pluripotent stem cells and advances in genome editing technologies using CRISPR/Cas9 broadened possibilities for modeling novel aspects of human disease <italic>ex vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Organoid culture has allowed the modeling of otherwise inaccessible congenital human disorders affecting the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, intestine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, kidney<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, liver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, pancreas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, ovary<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, and lung<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. In the present study, we established a human <italic>in vitro</italic> model of congenital ACTHD using 3D pituitary organoids differentiated from <italic>TBX19<sup>K146R/K146R</sup></italic> and <italic>NFKB2<sup>D865G/D865G</sup></italic> hiPSC generated by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, in order to compare them with their isogenic WT equivalents. After confirming that this model could recapitulate relevant aspects of pituitary development, we then determined whether it could also replicate a disease, namely ACTHD.</p>
<p>As the <italic>TBX19<sup>K146R</sup></italic> homozygous variant is known to cause ACTHD in humans, we designed a human organoid model derived from <italic>TBX19<sup>K146R/K146R</sup></italic> hiPSC as a proof of principle. In line with the <italic>Tbx19<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, <italic>TBX19<sup>K146R/K146R</sup></italic> organoids displayed markedly defective corticotroph differentiation, as compared to WT organoids, thereby validating the methodological approach. Interestingly, in organoids carrying a <italic>TBX19<sup>K146R/K146R</sup></italic> missense mutation that affects DNA binding, a few corticotroph cells were still present, suggesting either a role for TBX19 independent of its DNA binding activity or persistence of residual DNA binding activity with this mutation.</p>
<p>Using this same approach with <italic>NFKB2<sup>D865G/D865G</sup></italic> organoids generated by CRISPR/Cas9-edited hiPSC, we demonstrated for the first time a role for NFKB2 in pituitary development. Heterozygous mutations in the C-terminal region of <italic>NFKB2</italic>, such as D865G, were reported in DAVID syndrome, leading to the disruption of both non-canonical and canonical pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Although <italic>NFKB2<sup>D865G</sup></italic> has been identified in a heterozygous state in patients with ACTHD, we decided to generate a homozygous model of <italic>NFKB2<sup>D865G/D865G</sup></italic> to determine first whether NFKB2 was involved in human pituitary development at all and could explain the defect in ACTH production in DAVID syndrome (OMIM#, 615577) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Indeed, while concomitant common variable immune deficiency (CVID) can be explained by the key roles of NFKB signaling in the immune system, the mechanism of the endocrine deficits caused by <italic>NFKB2</italic> mutations was unknown. In mouse models, deletion of <italic>Nfkb2</italic> causes abnormal germinal center B-cell formation and differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. However, the spontaneous <italic>Lym1</italic> mouse model, which carries a truncating variant Y868* in the <italic>Nfkb2</italic> orthologue that prevents its cleavage into a transcriptionally active form, had apparently normal corticotroph function and ACTH expression in the pituitary in both heterozygotes and homozygotes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Mutant <italic>Nfkb2</italic> homozygotes do display reduced fertility and more severe immune abnormalities than their heterozygous counterparts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Using pituitary organoids differentiated from a <italic>NFKB2<sup>D865G/D865G</sup></italic> hiPSC line in comparison with its unmutated control and in the absence of an immune response, we have demonstrated that human corticotroph development is directly disrupted by the same missense mutation found in DAVID syndrome.</p>
<p>The precise molecular mechanisms by which NFKB2 impairs corticotroph development remain to be determined. However, our results suggest both early and late effects on corticotroph differentiation. First, NFKB2 may be involved in the early steps of pituitary development. RNA-seq data on day 48 of <italic>NFKB2<sup>D865G/D865G</sup></italic> organoid development showed increased <italic>HESX1</italic> and <italic>BMP4</italic> transcription, which may reflect blockade in an undifferentiated state evocative of the Rathke’s pouch epithelial primordium: indeed, down-regulation of HESX1 is necessary for proper pituitary development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. This is also supported by RNA-seq results showing downregulation of <italic>PITX1, HES1, LHX3</italic> and <italic>FGF10</italic> in mutant organoids, as their expression is known to be necessary for progression to a later progenitor state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Finally, concordant with the hypothesis of a differentiation blockade, upregulation of epithelial markers such as E-cadherin and keratin-8 was observed in mutant <italic>NFKB2<sup>D865G/D865G</sup></italic> organoids on day 48 while in contrast, there were no changes in Wnt and hedgehog signaling pathways. Second, NFKB2 could also be involved in the final steps of corticotroph differentiation. While qRT-PCR showed increased levels of <italic>TBX19</italic> mRNA in mutant organoids, this did not lead to the expected increase in <italic>POMC</italic> mRNA transcripts. Similarly, some <italic>NFKB2</italic> mutants had TBX19+ cells without simultaneous ACTH expression. This suggests that NFKB2 is necessary for POMC synthesis in TBX19-specified cells, which <italic>NFKB2<sup>D865G</sup></italic> may prevent. This could be due to abnormal DNA binding of the NFKB heterodimer to the <italic>POMC</italic> promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> and/or regulation of <italic>PCSK1</italic>, the gene coding for the enzyme necessary to convert POMC to ACTH. Alternatively, <italic>NFKB2<sup>D865G</sup></italic> could also block TBX19+ cells in a pre-differentiated corticotroph state through its derepression of chromatin remodeling factors such as EZH2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The organoid model described in this paper presents several advantages over other approaches. It is a true human model of ACTHD, emphasizing the limits of mouse models as exemplified by the <italic>Lym1</italic> model, which showed that Nfkb2 was dispensable for murine pituitary development. Despite some technical constraints, CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing of hiPSC is a powerful approach to elucidate gene function in congenital pituitary deficiency patients, as shown for the role of hypothalamic OTX2 regulation of pituitary progenitor cells in congenital pituitary hypoplasia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. While the prevalence of pathogenic variants of known genes in primary hypopituitarism is currently estimated to be below 10%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, exome and whole-genome sequencing regularly identify new genes and variants, for which pathogenicity remains uncertain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. This model or refinements thereof could thus become the gold standard to confirm involvement of a given gene in human anterior pituitary development, or to classify new variants of unknown significance as likely benign or pathogenic. Finally, pituitary organoids derived from human embryonic stem cells have been transplanted subcutaneously into mice with hypopituitarism; grafted cells were able to secrete ACTH and respond to corticotropin-releasing hormone stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. The near future may therefore promise patients with hypopituitarism innovative substitutive treatments with their own reprogrammed cells.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have designed and validated a model replicating human constitutive ACTHD using a combination of CRISPR/Cas9 and directed differentiation of hiPSC into 3D hypothalamic-pituitary organoids. Not only has this proof-of-concept reproduced the known prerequisite for the TBX19 transcription factor in human corticotroph differentiation, it has also allowed a new classification of a <italic>NFKB2</italic> variant of previously unknown clinical significance as pathogenic in pituitary development. From a clinical viewpoint, our organoid model can provide evidence for the pathogenic role of new candidate genes or variants investigated in patients where none other is available, especially in a rare disease affecting a poorly accessible organ like the pituitary gland. From a physiological viewpoint, modeling corticotroph deficiency using hiPSC allows to support the functional role of NFKB2 in human pituitary differentiation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
NFKB mutations are thought to be one of the causes of pituitary dysfunction, but until now they could not be reproduced in mice and their pathomechanism was unknown. The authors used the differentiation of hypothalamic-pituitary organoids from human pluripotent stem cells to recapitulate the disease in human iPS cells carrying the NFKB mutation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors achieved their primary goal of recapitulating the disease in human cells. In particular, the differentiation of the pituitary gland is closely linked to the adjacent hypothalamus in embryology, and the authors have again shown that this method is useful when the hypothalamus is suspected to be involved in pituitary abnormalities caused by genetic mutations.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
On the other hand, the pathomechanism is still not fully understood. This study provides some clues to the pathomechanism, but further analysis of NFKB expression and experiments investigating the relevant factors in more detail may help to clarify it further.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
DAVID syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by variable immune dysfunction and variable ACTH deficiency. Nine different families have been reported, and all have heterozygous mutations in NFKB2. The mechanism of NFKB2 action in the immune systems has been well-studied, but nothing is known about its role in the pituitary gland.</p>
<p>The DAVID mutations cluster in the C-terminus of the NFKB2 and interfere with cleavage and nuclear translocation. The mutations are likely dominant negative, by affecting dimer function. ACTH deficiency can be life-threatening in neonates and adults, thus, understanding the mechanism of NFKB2 action in pituitary development and/or function is important.</p>
<p>The authors use CRISPR/Cas gene editing of human iPSC-derived pituitary-hypothalamic organoids to assess the function of NFKB2 and TBX19 in pituitary development. Mutations in TBX19 are the most common, known cause of pituitary ACTH deficiency, and the mechanism of action has been studied in mice, which phenocopy the human condition. Thus, the TBX19 organoids can serve as a positive control. The Nfkb2 mouse model has a p.Y868* mutation that impairs cleavage of NFKB2 p100, and the immune phenotype mimics the patients with DAVID mutations, but no pituitary phenotype was evident. Thus, a human organoid model might be the only approach suitable to discover the etiology of the pituitary phenotype.</p>
<p>Overall, the authors have selected an important problem, and the results suggest that the pituitary insufficiency in DAVID syndrome is caused by a developmental defect rather than an autoimmune hypophysitis condition. The use of gene editing in human iPSC-derived hypothalamic-pituitary organoids is significant, as there is only one example of this previously, namely studies on OTX2. Only a few laboratories have demonstrated the ability to differentiate iPSC or ES cells to these organoids, and the authors have improved the efficiency of differentiation, which is also significant.</p>
<p>The strength of the evidence is excellent. However, the two ACTH-deficient organoid models use a single genetically engineered clone, and the potential for variability amongst clones makes the conclusions less compelling. Since the authors obtained two independent clones for NFKB2 it is not clear why only one clone was studied. Finally, the effect of TBX19 on early pituitary fate markers is somewhat surprising given the phenotype of the knockout mice and patients with mutations. Thus, the use of a single clone for that study is also worrisome.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors make mutations in TBX19 and NFKB2 that exist in affected patients. The TBX19 p.K146R mutation is recessive and causes isolated ACTH deficiency. Mutations in this gene account for 2/3 of isolated ACTH deficiency cases. The NFKB2 p.D865G mutation is heterozygous in a patient with recurrent infections and isolated ACTH deficiency. NFKB2 mutations are a rare cause of ACTH deficiency, and they can be associated with the loss of other pituitary hormones in some cases. However, all reported cases are heterozygous.</p>
<p>The developmental studies of organoid differentiation seem rigorous in that 200 organoids were generated for each hiPSC line, and 3-10 organoids were analyzed for each time point and genotype. Differentiation analysis relied on both RNA transcript measurements and immunohistochemistry of cleared organoids using light sheet microscopy. Multiple time points were examined, including seven times for gene expression at the RNA level and two times in the later stages of differentiation for IHC.</p>
<p>
TBX19 deficient organoids exhibit reduced levels of PITX1, LHX3, and POMC (ACTH precursor) expression at the RNA and IHC level, and there are fewer corticotropes in the organoids, as ascertained by POMC IHC.</p>
<p>The NFKB2 deficient organoids have a normal expression of the early pituitary transcription factor HESX1, but reduced expression of PITX2, LHX3, and POMC. Because there is no immune component in the organoid, this shows that NFKB2 mutations can affect corticotrope differentiation to produce POMC. RNA sequencing analysis of the organoids reveals potential downstream targets of NFKB2 action, including a potential effect on epithelial-to-mesenchymal-like transition and selected pituitary and hypothalamic transcription factors and signaling pathways.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
There could be variation between individual iPSC lines that is unrelated to the genetically engineered change. While the authors check for off-target effects of the guide RNA at predicted sites using WGS, a better control would be to have independently engineered clones or to correct the engineered clone to wild type and show that the phenotypic effects are reversed.</p>
<p>All NFKB2 patients are heterozygous for what appear to be dominant negative mutations that affect protein cleavage and nuclear localization of processed protein as homo or heterdimers. The organoids are homozygous for this mutation. Supplemental Figure 4 indicates that one heterozygous clone and two homozygous mutant clones were obtained. Analysis of these additional clones would give more strength to the conclusions, showing reproducibility and the effect of mutant gene dosage.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This manuscript by Mac et al addresses the causes of pituitary dysfunction in patients with DAVID syndrome which is caused by mutations in the NFKB2 gene and leads to ACTH deficiency. The authors seek to determine whether the mutation directly leads to altered pituitary development, as opposed to an autoimmune defect, by using mutating human iPSCs and then establishing organoids that differentiate into pituitary tissue. They first seek to validate the system using a well-characterised mutation of the transcription factor TBX19, which also results in ACTH deficiency in patients. Then they characterise altered pituitary cell differentiation in mutant NFKB2 organoids and show that these lack corticotrophs, which would lead to ACTH deficiency.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The conclusion of the paper that ACTH deficiency in DAVID syndrome is independent of an autoimmune input is strong.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
1. The authors correctly emphasise the importance of establishing the validity of an iPSC-based model in being able to recapitulate in vivo dysfunctional pituitary development through characterisation of a TBX19 knock-in mutation. Whilst this leads to the expected failure of functional corticotroph differentiation, other aspects of the normal pituitary differentiation pathway upstream of corticotroph commitment seem to have been affected in surprising ways. In particular, the loss of LHX3 and PITX1 in TBX19 mutant organoids compared with wild type requires explanation, especially as the mutant protein would only be expected to be expressed in a small proportion of anterior pituitary lineage cells. If the developmental expression profile of key transcription factors in mutant organoids does not recapitulate that which occurs in vivo, any interpretation of the relevance of expression differences in the NFKB2 organoids to the mechanism(s) leading to corticotroph function in vivo has to be questionable. It is notable that the manipulation of iPSC cells used to generate mutants through CRISPR/Cas9 editing is not applied to the control iPSC line. It is possible that these manipulations lead to changes to the iPSC cells that are independent of the mutations introduced and this may change the phenotype of the cells. A better control would have been an iPSC line with a benign knock-in (such as GFP into the ROSA26 locus).</p>
<p>2. In the results section of the manuscript the authors acknowledge that hypothalamic tissue in the NFKB2 mutant organoid may be having an effect on the development of pituitary tissue. However, in the discussion the emphasis is entirely on pituitary autonomous mechanisms such as pituitary HESX1 expression or POMC gene regulation; in the conclusion of the abstract, a direct role for NFKB2 in pituitary differentiation is described. Whilst the data here may suggest a non-immune mediated alteration in pituitary function in DAVID syndrome, if this is due to alteration of the developing hypothalamus then this is not direct. A fuller discussion of the potential hypothalamic contribution and/or further characterisation of this aspect is warranted.</p>
<p>3. qRT-PCR data presented in Figure 6A shows negligible alteration of HESX1 expression at all time points in NFKB2 mutant organoids. This is not consistent with the 2-fold increase in HESX1 expression described in day 48 organoids found by bulk RNA sequencing. How do the authors reconcile these results and why is one result focused on in the discussion where a potential mechanism for a blockade of normal pituitary cell differentiation is suggested? Further confirmation of HESX1 expression is required.</p>
<p>4. Throughout the authors focus on POMC gene expression and ACTH antibody immunopositive as being indicative of corticotroph cell identity. In the human fetal pituitary melanotrophs are present and most ACTH antibodies are unable to distinguish these cells from corticotrophs. Is the antibody used specifically for ACTH rather than other products of the POMC gene? It is unlikely that all the ACTH-positive cells are melanotrophs, nevertheless, it is important to know what the proportions of the 2 POMC-positive cell types are. This could be distinguished by looking for the expression of NeuroD1, which would also define whether corticotrophs are committed but not fully differentiated in the NFKB2 mutant organoids. In support of an effect on corticotrophs, it is notable that CRHR1 expression (which would be expected to be restricted to this cell type) is reduced by 84% in bulk RNAseq data (Table 1) and this may be an indicator of the loss of corticotrophs in the model.</p>
<p>5. Notwithstanding the caveats about whether the organoid model recapitulates in vivo pituitary differentiation (see 1 above) and whether the bulk RNAseq accurately reflects expression levels (see 3 above), there are potentially some extremely interesting changes in gene expression shown in Table 1 which warrant further discussion. For example, there is a 25-fold reduction in POU1F1 expression which may be expected to reflect a loss of somatotrophs in the organoid (and possibly lactotrophs) and highlights the importance of characterising the effect of NFKB2 on other anterior pituitary cell types within the organoid. If somatotrophs are affected, this may be relevant to the organoids as a model of DAVID syndrome as GH deficiency has been described in some individuals with NFKB2 mutations. The huge increase in CGA expression may reflect a switch in cell fate to gonadotrophs, as has been described with a loss of TPIT in the mouse. These are examples of the changes that warrant further characterisation and discussion.</p>
<p>6. How do the authors explain the lack of effect of NFKB2 mutation on global NFKB signalling?</p>
