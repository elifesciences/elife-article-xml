<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) exhibit substantial molecular and immune heterogeneity, complicating risk assessment and treatment. Here, we define three distinct transcriptional subtypes (C1, C2, C3) through integrative transcriptomic and immunogenomic profiling. C1 is characterized by hypoxia-driven pathways and an immunosuppressive microenvironment, correlating with poor prognosis. C2 exhibits a highly inflamed immune landscape with robust CD8+ T cell infiltration, suggesting potential sensitivity to immunotherapy. C3 is enriched in metabolic reprogramming pathways and displays intermediate clinical outcomes. Genetic analysis reveals subtype-specific mutational patterns, with pseudohypoxic driver mutations (SDHB, VHL, SDHA, SDHD) predominant in C1 and C3, while kinase pathway alterations (NF1, RET) define C2. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing further delineates immune ecosystem diversity. Notably, we identify ANGPT2, PCSK1N, and GPX3 as key subtype-specific biomarkers, with ANGPT2 driving tumor progression in C1 and emerging as a potential therapeutic target. Our findings provide a refined molecular classification integrating immune and genomic features, offering a framework for improved prognostication and precision therapies in PPGLs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) are rare, highly heterogeneous neuroendocrine tumors that pose significant challenges in prognosis assessment due to their complex molecular landscape and variable clinical behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Postoperative recurrence and metastasis rates for PPGLs vary widely, ranging from 6.0 to 17.4% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], complicating treatment and management strategies. An accurate assessment of the risk for recurrence and metastasis following surgery is essential for optimal management, as it directly informs decisions regarding postoperative surveillance and therapy.</p>
<p>Current genomic subtypes, such as pseudohypoxic, kinase signaling, and Wnt-altered subtypes, have shown promise in identifying the molecular characteristics of PPGLs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. However, these approaches have limited applicability, as the overall germline mutation rate in PPGL patients is only 30-40% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] leaving a substantial portion of PPGLs without actionable genomic markers. This creates a gap in our ability to predict recurrence and metastasis based solely on genetic profiles. While some genotype-phenotype correlations have been established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], molecular subclassifications have advanced our understanding of PPGLs biology, the role of secondary molecular events, particularly in the tumor microenvironment (TME), remains underexplored. The TME has been shown to influence prognosis and response to treatment in other tumor types, and emerging evidence suggests that it may play a critical role in the development and progression of PPGLs. However, its precise contribution to disease progression in PPGLs has yet to be fully elucidated.</p>
<p>This study aims to bridge these gaps by analyzing multiple PPGLs cohorts with a focus on the transcriptional landscape and immune microenvironment. Using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], we seek to define the transcriptional subtypes of PPGLs, explore how these subtypes are linked to immune infiltration patterns, and identify key transcriptional alterations associated with recurrence and metastasis. We also aim to propose potential prognostic markers and assess the impact of immune microenvironment profiles on disease progression. This comprehensive analysis will provide new insights into the biology of PPGLs and improve the predictive accuracy of postoperative recurrence and metastasis risk.</p>

<title>Characterization of Three Transcriptional Subtypes in PPGLs via WGCNA</title>
<p>In this study, we employed WGCNA to explore the transcriptional landscape of PPGLs, successfully identifying three distinct transcriptional subtypes that are associated with varying clinical outcomes and may affect disease progression through mechanisms such as immune infiltration. Our analysis encompassed a comprehensive cohort of 87 PPGLs patients from the First hospital of Jilin University (PPGLs cohort), supplemented by an extensive dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) that included 179 samples (TCGA cohort), which allowed us to validate our findings on a broader scale. We utilized Immunohistochemistry (IHC), RNA sequencing, and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to analyze the samples, integrating molecular profiles with clinical data to predict recurrence and metastasis based on the identified transcriptional subtypes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). WGCNA revealed three major transcriptional subtypes within the PPGL cohorts, labeled as Cluster 1 (C1), Cluster 2 (C2), and Cluster 3 (C3). Functional enrichment analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) further validated the biological significance of these transcriptional subtypes. Subtype C1 is enriched in pathways associated with hypoxia and HIF-1 signaling, which are vital for tumor survival and aggressiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Subtype C3âs enrichment in metabolic pathways, such as fatty acid metabolism and parathyroid metabolism, reflects its adaptation to metabolic stress, potentially revealing targets for metabolic intervention.</p>

</fig>
<p>A detailed analysis of gene expression within each subtype revealed several critical marker genes that characterize each group (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Subtype C1 is marked by genes involved in HIF-1 signaling and angiogenesis, such as <italic>ANGPT2</italic> and <italic>CAV1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. In contrast, subtype C2 is defined by genes, including <italic>PCSK1N</italic> and <italic>FTL</italic>, while subtype C3 shows a significant upregulation of genes like <italic>DYNLL2</italic> and <italic>GPX3</italic>. The neuroendocrine (NE) features, assessed through a NE score, reveal distinct patterns among the three PPGL subtypes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Notably, subtype C2 demonstrates significantly elevated NE score in comparison to subtypes C1 and C3, suggesting a strong neuroendocrine phenotype. Subtype C1 exhibited higher cell cycle scores (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>), epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) scores (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>), and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signaling scores (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>) compared to subtypes C2 and C3. This suggests that C1 may promote rapid tumor growth, metastasis, and potentially lead to a poorer prognosis. Subtype C2, on the other hand, shows an increased inflamed score compared to subtypes C1 and C3, suggesting a more inflamed tumor microenvironment that may be more responsive to immunotherapy (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, our WGCNA-based analysis of PPGLs reveals distinct transcriptional subtypes with unique molecular features, highlighting the diseaseâs heterogeneity and providing insights into the underlying mechanisms that may drive varied clinical behaviors.</p>

<title>Genetic Mutation Patterns and Pathway Alterations Across Transcriptional Subtypes of PPGLs</title>
<p>To elucidate the relationship between transcriptional subtypes and previous genetic mutation classifications, we utilized genetic variation data from 179 PPGLs patients in TCGA cohort. The mutation profile for each subtype highlights distinct genetic alterations in PPGLs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Subtype C1 exhibits a high frequency of mutations in genes associated with the pseudohypoxia pathway, such as <italic>VHL</italic> and <italic>SDHB</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], suggesting a unique adaptation to hypoxic conditions that may drive tumor progression. In contrast, subtype C2 predominantly features mutations in genes involved in kinase signaling pathways, including <italic>NF1</italic> and <italic>RET</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], which imply active signaling networks that could influence tumor growth and response to therapies. Subtype C3 does not exhibit a clearly defined pathway but presents a diverse mutational landscape, indicating the complexity of tumor biology in this group.</p>

</fig>
<p>When analyzing the proportion of genetic alterations in key pathways (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), we found that more than half of the cases in each subtype lacked detectable driver mutations. Among the patients with genetic alterations, subtypes C1 and C3 exhibited a significantly higher proportion of pseudohypoxic signaling alterations compared to C2. In contrast, subtype C2 was more strongly enriched for kinase pathway mutations and WNT alterations. A closer examination of pseudohypoxic mutations revealed a significant concentration of <italic>SDHB</italic> and <italic>VHL</italic> mutations in subtype C1, while subtype C3 exhibited a notable concentration of <italic>SDHA</italic> and <italic>SDHD</italic> mutations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Notably, subtype C2 patients exhibited the highest proportion of kinase pathway involvement, along with the greatest variety of kinase pathway mutations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>Mutation features, such as microsatellite instability (MSI), tumor mutational burden (TMB), and mutations in pathways like MYC-associated factor X (MAX), which are commonly used to assess the efficacy of clinical immunotherapy, do not show significant differences among subtypes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Additionally, principal component analysis (PCA) effectively distinguished transcriptional subtypes within the PPGLs cohort, further supporting the validity of the subtype classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. In both the Magnus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] and TCGA cohorts, PCA similarly confirmed that transcriptional subtypes could significantly differentiate PPGLs subgroups, and that transcriptional subtyping outperformed traditional genetic mutation-based classification in distinguishing PPGLs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). In summary, our study offers a thorough molecular characterization of PPGLs, identifying three distinct subtypes with unique transcriptional features.</p>

<title>Immune Infiltration Profiles Across Transcriptional Subtypes of PPGLs</title>
<p>To elucidate the immune-infiltration characteristics of different transcriptomic subtypes, we applied the xCell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]algorithm to analyze the RNA-seq data from the PPGLs and TCGA cohorts, revealing tumor microenvironment infiltration features at the transcriptional level. The heatmap illustrates the distribution and abundance of different immune cells across the three subtypes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Subtype C2, which showed significantly higher inflamed scores compared to subtypes C1 and C3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>), exhibited increased levels of CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes, such as T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. In contrast, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) were found to be reduced. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining analysis of infiltrated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells further supports the quantitative findings from the inflamed score, demonstrating that subtype C2 has more pronounced CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration at the tumor site compared to subtypes C1 and C3 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). These findings reinforce the heatmap data and suggest an active cytotoxic immune response in C2. In further statistical analysis, both the PPGLs cohort and the TCGA cohort showed that the C2 subtype had significantly higher infiltration of cytotoxic lymphocytes and CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells, while exhibiting low infiltration of immunosuppressive cells (such as HSC), reflecting an activated immune microenvironment. In contrast, the C1 subtype was enriched in HSC but showed the lowest levels of cytotoxic lymphocyte and CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 cell infiltration. The immune microenvironment infiltration profile of the C3 subtype was intermediate between the two (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C-D</xref>). This validation in the TCGA cohort, a larger, independent dataset, underscores the robustness of our findings and their potential relevance across different PPGL populations.</p>

Each model is compared to subtype C1 as the reference group. Orange represents subtype C2, and green represents subtype C3. Comparisons were calculated by one-way ANOVA (B-D). Data are presented as mean Â± SD.

<p>To further investigate the relationship between transcriptomic subtypes and the presence of tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic lymphocytes (TILs), we applied multiple linear regression models. After adjusting for various potential factors that could influence TIL infiltration, we aimed to determine whether transcriptomic subtypes still have an impact on the degree of TIL infiltration. In the PPGLs cohort, regardless of whether the crude model (Model 1), the age, gender, and primary site-adjusted Model 2, or Model 3 (which further adjusted for Ki-67, SSTR2, and SDHB expression based on Model 2) was used, the results showed that compared to the subtype C1, the subtype C2 exhibited the most significant TILs infiltration, followed by the subtype C3 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). This conclusion was also validated in the TCGA cohort (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). In summary, our extensive immunological profiling across the transcriptional subtypes of PPGLs reveals distinct immune landscapes, with subtype C2 exhibiting an active immunological profile.</p>

<title>Transcriptional Diversity and Immune Microenvironment Characteristics in PPGL Subtypes</title>
<p>To further clarify the tumor microenvironment characteristics of each transcriptional subtype, we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) analysis on 32 PPGL patients in Magnusâs cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. The UMAP analysis successfully categorized the genetic profiles into three distinct subtypes: C1, C2, and C3, while also identifying various cell types, including immune cells, chromaffin, myeloid, and fibroblast cells across the samples (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). This diverse cellular representation highlights the complex biological composition of PPGLs and correlates with specific mutational profiles such as <italic>SDHB, VHL</italic>, and <italic>RET</italic>. Consistent with transcriptomic sequencing data from the TCGA cohort (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-D</xref>), subtype C1 predominantly harbors <italic>VHL</italic> and <italic>SDHB</italic> mutations, while subtype C2 is primarily enriched in mutations related to kinase pathways such as <italic>RET</italic> and <italic>HRAS</italic>. Subtype C3 is mainly characterized by mutations in <italic>SDHA</italic> and <italic>SDHD</italic>. After extracting the immune cells, we performed further cluster analysis. UMAP visualization revealed that the infiltrating immune cells were categorized into 12 distinct subsets, including CD8<sup>+</sup> T, CD4<sup>+</sup> T, NK, B cells, dendritic cells (DC), and others (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Further examination of immune cell distribution using UMAP in subtypes C1, C2, and C3, compared to normal tissue, reveals distinct clustering patterns of immune cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C-D</xref>). This visualization indicates a higher proportion of cytotoxic lymphocyte immune infiltration, specifically CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, in subtype C2 compared to subtypes C1 and C3, with no significant involvement of NK cells. Although no significant differences were observed in the overall macrophage content analysis across the different transcriptional subtypes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C-D</xref>), further clustering of macrophages using single-cell sequencing revealed an increased proportion of tumor-suppressing M1 macrophages and a significantly reduced proportion of tumor-promoting tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the C2 subtype compared to the other two subtypes.</p>

<p>To determine whether the increased CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration in subtype C2 is associated with enhanced immunoregulatory function, we analyzed ligand-receptor interactions using CellChat. The results revealed that the interactions between CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and themselves, as well as with CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and NK cells, were significantly enhanced through chemokine pathways such as CCL-CCR. In contrast, the TGFB-TGFBR ligand-receptor interaction between CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and immunosuppressive M2 macrophages and TAM cells was significantly weakened (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). In conclusion, the increased infiltration of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in subtype C2 may contribute to immune activation by interacting with other immune cells in the microenvironment.</p>
<p>Pseudotime analysis was used to elucidate the developmental pathways of tumor cells in PPGLs, highlighting dynamic shifts between transcriptional states, particularly the transition from a naive to an activated state within the tumor microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Pseudotime analysis reveals that compared with normal adrenal cells, subtypes C2 and C1 follow distinct developmental trajectories, while subtype C3 occupies an intermediate position between the C1 and C2 pathways. This suggests that C3 may represent a transitional state between the two, which helps explain the significant differences observed between C1 and C2 in terms of neuroendocrine characteristics, tumor proliferation, HIF-1 pathway activity, and the tumor immune microenvironment, with C3 consistently lying between them (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, our multi-omics analysis illuminates the transcriptional diversity and intricate immune interactions present in PPGLs, providing a comprehensive overview of the genetic and immune profiles that characterize each subtype. These results not only deepen our understanding of PPGL biology but also open avenues for more targeted and effective therapeutic strategies tailored to the distinct features of each subtype.</p>

<title>Subtype-Specific Gene Expression Profiles and Clinical Outcomes in PPGLs</title>
<p>To convert this transcriptional subtype into a clinically applicable classification tool, we initially employed a linear regression model to compare the effect values (Î² value) of various candidate marker genes (Supplementary Fig. 1) on the transcriptional subtypes. We then identified the genes with the most significant effect values and statistical differences for each subtype as the marker genes for that subtype. Ultimately, we identified the genes <italic>ANGPT2, PCSK1N</italic>, and <italic>GPX3</italic>, which are significantly overexpressed and have the most significant Î² values in subtypes C1, C2, and C3, respectively, as the marker genes for these three subtypes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 1). <italic>ANGPT2</italic>, involvement in angiogenesis and vascular remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>], had significantly higher expression in subtype C1 compared to C2 and C3, which may contribute to the aggressive characteristics of this subtype. <italic>PCSK1N</italic>, encoding the neuroendocrine protein ProSAAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>], exhibited notably high expression levels in subtype C2. This is consistent with our finding of significantly elevated NE scores in subtype C2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), further suggesting that this subtype possesses the most prominent neuroendocrine characteristics. Additionally, <italic>GPX3</italic>, a significantly upregulated molecule in the C3 subtype, is involved in the regulation of redox homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], which may be closely associated with the active metabolic state in this subtype. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the differential expression patterns of ANGPT2, PCSK1N, and GPX3 in C1, C2, and C3 subtypes, respectively (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). These findings not only validate the transcriptomic data but also emphasize the potential biological roles these genes may play in the pathophysiology of PPGLs.</p>

<p>A Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis revealed significant differences in patient outcomes based on subtype classification (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). Patients in subtype C1 exhibited markedly worse progression-free survival (PFS) compared to those in subtypes C2 and C3, underscoring the critical role of subtype stratification in predicting clinical outcomes. Additionally, Cox regression analysis quantified the impact of these subtypes on PPGL patient prognosis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). The models, adjusted for various factors, confirmed that subtype C1 was associated with the highest risk of recurrence and metastasis.

<title><italic>ANGPT2</italic> as a Key Regulator and Diagnostic Marker in PPGL Subtype C1</title>
<p><italic>ANGPT2</italic> had significantly higher expression in subtype C1 compared to C2 and C3, indicating its potential involvement in angiogenesis and vascular remodeling, which may contribute to the aggressive characteristics of this subtype. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve highlights the diagnostic potential of <italic>ANGPT2</italic> in subtype C1, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.880 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>), demonstrating its high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing between the subtypes based on their molecular profiles. The samples were categorized into <italic>ANGPT2</italic><sup>high</sup> and <italic>ANGPT2</italic><sup>low</sup> groups based on the cutoff of <italic>ANGPT2â</italic>s ROC in the PPGLs cohort. It was revealed that the <italic>ANGPT2</italic><sup>high</sup> group was associated with higher scores in the cell cycle, EMT, and HIF-1 signaling pathways (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B-D</xref>). This suggests that <italic>ANGPT2</italic> may not only serve as a specific biomarker for subtype C1 but also act as a regulator of tumor progression and the tumorâs ability to adapt to hypoxic conditions.</p>
<p>To further validate our findings, we employed the rat PPGL cell line PC12 and used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to knock out (KO) the <italic>ANGPT2</italic> gene, which was confirmed by Western blot analysis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). We then compared the tumor growth curves of <italic>ANGPT2</italic> KO (<italic>ANGPT2</italic><sup>â/â</sup>) and <italic>ANGPT2</italic><sup>WT</sup> PC12 cells in subcutaneous xenograft models in BALB/c nude mice. The results showed that the <italic>in vivo</italic> growth of <italic>ANGPT2</italic><sup>â/â</sup> cells was significantly slower (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F-G</xref>). RNA-seq analysis confirmed that, after <italic>ANGPT2</italic> knockout, the expression scores of key genes involved in EMT, tumor metastasis, proliferation, and hypoxia-related pathways were markedly reduced in the PC12 cell line (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H-L</xref>). This suggests that <italic>ANGPT2</italic>, a marker gene for subtype C1, functions as a regulatory molecule in the malignant biological behavior of PPGLs. Targeting this molecule may provide a new therapeutic approach for subtype C1 of PPGLs, which is associated with the highest malignancy and poorest prognosis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The significant biological heterogeneity and wide distribution of PPGLs contribute to substantial differences in patient outcomes, making their classification and risk assessment a critical focus in clinical practice. Traditional classification methods based on anatomical origin and pan-genomic approaches centered on pathogenic mutations have offered insights but fail to fully capture the complexity of these tumors, given the relatively low prevalence of detectable mutations.</p>
<p>Our study addresses these gaps by introducing a novel transcriptional subtype classification framework that effectively distinguishes PPGL patients based on transcriptomic expression. This classification demonstrates significantly improved differentiation capability compared to pan-genomic classification and has been validated across independent cohorts. Immunohistochemical analysis further confirmed the robustness of this classification, revealing subtype-specific clinicopathological features that closely align with their molecular characteristics, underscoring its clinical applicability.</p>
<p>Analysis of genomic characteristics revealed that transcriptional subtypes C1 and C3 were enriched in pseudohypoxic genomic subtypes but exhibited distinct mutation profiles: C1 was primarily associated with <italic>SDHB</italic> and <italic>VHL</italic> mutations, while C3 was predominantly linked to <italic>SDHA</italic> and <italic>SDHD</italic> mutations. Notably, more than half of the patients across all subtypes lacked detectable pathogenic mutations, yet their transcriptome expression profiles mirrored those of patients with such mutations. This finding highlights a previously overlooked patient population in genomic studies.</p>
<p>Further investigation into the tumor microenvironment revealed substantial differences among subtypes. Subtype C1 exhibited the most immunosuppressive microenvironment, characterized by low infiltration of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells, high infiltration of HSCs, and an elevated proportion of TAMs. Immune activation pathways were weaker in C1, with enhanced inhibitory interactions involving M2 macrophages and TAMs. In contrast, the C2 subtype demonstrated the most activated and inflammatory tumor microenvironment, with the highest inflammatory scores and robust immune cell interactions. These findings provide a foundation for stratified immunotherapy strategies.</p>
<p>The assessment of postoperative recurrence and metastatic risk in PPGLs remains one of the most critical challenges in current clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Identifying high-risk patients with precision has become a major focus of research. While several approaches, such as pathology-based scoring systems (e.g., PASS and PAGG scores) and genomic mutation-based evaluation systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>], have been explored, none have achieved satisfactory outcomes. In this study, subtype C1 was also identified as the poorest prognostic group, exhibiting heightened tumor proliferation, enhanced EMT, and the highest recurrence and metastatic risk. Importantly, we identified <italic>ANGPT2</italic> was identified as a key marker gene and regulator driving the aggressive behavior of C1, providing both a novel tool for identifying high-risk patients and a potential therapeutic target.</p>
<p>In summary, this transcriptional classification framework advances our understanding of PPGL heterogeneity and provides a theoretical foundation for designing targeted therapeutic strategies. By integrating molecular and immune features, it enables precision medicine approaches that have the potential to improve outcomes for patients with this challenging cancer type.</p>

<title>Patient cohorts</title>
<p>We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with PPGLs who underwent surgery at the First Hospital of Jilin University between October 2019 and March 2022. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples from these patients were retrieved and reevaluated by two pathologists using hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining and the original pathological reports. Patients with combined PPGLs or evidence of other tumors were excluded from the study. Clinical, pathological, and demographic data were obtained by reviewing electronic medical records. Follow-up information was gathered through regular visits or telephone interviews. RNA bulk sequencing was performed on FFPE samples from 87 patients with complete clinical data and confirmed PPGL diagnoses, along with 5 FFPE samples of normal adrenal tissue as controls. The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Hospital of Jilin University (23K101-001).

<p>This study presents an exploration of PPGL tumour bulk transcriptomics and identifies three clusters of samples (labeled as subtypes C1-C3). Each subtype is then investigated for the presence of somatic mutations, metabolism-associated pathways and inflammation correlates, and disease progression.

<p>Thank you for your valuable suggestion. In response to the reviewerâs request for further clarification on âhow previously published single-nuclei data were assigned to the newly defined C1-C3 subtypes,â we have provided additional methodological details in the revised manuscript (lines 103-109). Specifically, we aggregated the single-nucleus RNA-seq data to the sample level by summing gene counts across nuclei to generate pseudo-bulk expression profiles. These profiles were then normalized for library size, log-transformed (log1p), and z-scaled across samples. Using genesets scores derived from our earlier WGCNA analysis of PPGLs, we defined transcriptional subtypes within the Magnus cohort (Supplementary Figure. 1C). We further analyzed the single-nucleus data by classifying malignant (chromaffin) nuclei as C1, C2, or C3 based on their subtype scores, while non-malignant nuclei (including immune, stromal, endothelial, and others) were annotated using canonical cell-type markers (Figure. 4A).</p>

<p>Thank you for your valuable suggestion. In the revised manuscript (lines 74-79), Figure. 1A, Table S1 and Supplementary Figure. 1A, we harmonized anatomic site annotations from our PPGL cohort and the TCGA cohort and analyzed the distribution of tumor origin (adrenal vs extra-adrenal) across subtypes. The site composition is essentially uniform across C1-C3âapproximately 75% pheochromocytoma (PC) and 25% paraganglioma (PG)âwith only minimal variation. Notably, the proportion of extra-adrenal origin (paraganglioma origin) is slightly higher in the C1 subtype (see Supplementary Figure 1A), which aligns with the biological characteristics of tumors from this anatomical site, which typically exhibit more aggressive behavior.</p>

<p>A study that furthers the molecular definition of PPGL (where prognosis is variable) and provides a wide range of sub-experiments to back up the findings. One of the key premises of the study is that identification of driver mutations in PPGL is incomplete and that compromises characterisation for prognostic purposes. This is a reasonable starting point on which to base some characterisation based on different methods. The cohort is a reasonable size, and a useful validation cohort in the form of TCGA is used. Whilst it would be resource-intensive (though plausible given the rarity of the tumour type) to perform RNA-seq on all PPGL samples in clinical practice, some potential proxies are proposed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for their positive assessment of our studyâs rationale. We fully agree that RNA sequencing for all PPGL samples remains resource-intensive in current clinical practice, and its widespread application still faces feasibility challenges. It is precisely for this reason that, after defining transcriptional subtypes, we further focused on identifying and validating practical molecular markers and exploring their detectability at the protein level.</p>
<p>In this study, we validated key markers such as ANGPT2, PCSK1N, and GPX3 using immunohistochemistry (IHC), demonstrating their ability to effectively distinguish among molecular subtypes (see Figure. 5). This provides a potential tool for the clinical translation of transcriptional subtyping, similar to the transcription factor-based subtyping in small cell lung cancer where IHC enables low-cost and rapid molecular classification.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the subtyping performance of these markers has so far been preliminarily validated only in our internal cohort of 87 PPGL samples. We agree with the reviewer that larger-scale, multi-center prospective studies are needed in the future to further establish the reliability and prognostic value of these markers in clinical practice.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The performance of some of the proxy markers for transcriptional subtype is not presented.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with your comment regarding the need to further evaluate the performance of proxy markers for transcriptional subtyping. In our study, we have in fact taken this point into full consideration. To translate the transcriptional subtypes into a clinically applicable classification tool, we employed a linear regression model to compare the effect values (Î² values) of candidate marker genes across subtypes (Supplementary Figure. 1D-F). Genes with the most significant Î² values and statistical differences were selected as representative markers for each subtype.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we identified ANGPT2, PCSK1N, and GPX3âeach significantly overexpressed in subtypes C1, C2, and C3, respectively, and exhibiting the most pronounced Î² valuesâas robust marker genes for these subtypes (Figure. 5A and Supplementary Figure. 1D-F). These results support the utility of these markers in subtype classification and have been thoroughly validated in our analysis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>There is limited prognostic information available.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable suggestion. In this exploratory revision, we present the available prognostic signal in Figure. 5C. Given the current event numbers and follow-up time, we intentionally limited inference. We are continuing longitudinal follow-up of the PPGL cohort and will periodically update and report mature time-to-event analyses in subsequent work.</p>
