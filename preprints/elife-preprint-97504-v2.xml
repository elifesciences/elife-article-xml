<title>Abstract</title><p>Hematopoietic dysfunction has been associated with a reduction in the number of active precursors. However, precursor quantification at homeostasis and under diseased conditions is constrained by the scarcity of available methods. To address this issue, we optimized a method for quantifying a wide range of hematopoietic precursors. Assuming the random induction of a stable label in precursors following a binomial distribution, estimates depend on the inverse correlation between precursor numbers and the variance of precursor labeling among independent samples. Experimentally validated to cover the full dynamic range of hematopoietic precursors in mice (1 to 10<sup>5</sup>), we utilized this approach to demonstrate that thousands of precursors, which emerge after modest expansion during fetal-to-adult transition, contribute to native and perturbed hematopoiesis. We further estimated the number of precursors in a mouse model of Fanconi Anemia, showcasing how repopulation deficits can be classified as autologous (cell proliferation) and non-autologous (lack of precursor). Our results support an accessible and reliable approach for precursor quantification, emphasizing the contemporary perspective that native hematopoiesis is highly polyclonal.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Continuous self-renewal and differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) is fundamental to blood production. Even though rare cases exist where a single HSPC clone supports hematopoiesis, the HSPC population contributing to homeostatic hematopoiesis is usually highly polyclonal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. For example, the number of HSPCs actively participating in white blood cell production was estimated to range from 20,000 to 200,000 in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Conversely, a decline in the number of active hematopoietic precursors has been linked to hematopoietic dysfunction. For example, in humans older than 70 years of age, hematopoietic dysfunction coincides with an abrupt reduction in the HSPCs population actively contributing to blood production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>].</p>
<p>These observations underscore the association between a low number of active hematopoietic precursors and hematological function. Yet, few methods are suitable for quantifying active hematopoietic precursors in a native environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. In mice, methods utilizing <italic>in situ</italic> barcodes often suffer from barcode homoplasy, preventing total precursor number estimation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. In humans, estimations based on somatic mutations and computational modeling carry a high degree of uncertainty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. The absence of precise precursor quantification methods in their natural environment hampers the study of precursor numbers across different conditions and their potential use as predictive functional markers.</p>
<p>In mice, the quantification of developmental hematopoietic precursors has been achieved using animals engineered with a Confetti cassette [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. This cassette can randomly recombine and express one of four fluorescence proteins (FPs, being RFP, CFP, YFP, or GFP) upon Cre induction, resulting in variability in Confetti expression pattern in mice that inversely correlates with precursor numbers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. While suitable for developmental hematopoiesis, this method has limited linear range (50-2500), impeding its potential application to adult hematopoiesis or clonally restricted hematopoiesis. To measure hematopoietic precursors in various conditions, expansion of the detection range is desired.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the random induction of Confetti colors in HSPCs bears similarity with X-chromosome inactivation (XCI). In XCI, one of the X chromosomes is randomly inactivated in precursor cells, a process that adheres to a binomial distribution. Formula derivation from binomial distribution implies that a higher XCI variance among individuals correlates with a smaller number of precursors at the time of inactivation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). As XCI is faithfully maintained in the progeny, this correlation has been used to estimate precursor numbers from mature blood cells in human and mouse, leading to the discovery of the first mutation (Tet2) that contributes to clonal hematopoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Nonetheless, XCI occurs exclusively in females, limiting its applicability in males. Additionally, XCI takes place during early development when few precursors are present, resulting in low sensitivity in adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>].</p>
<p>Building on insights from Confetti mice and XCI studies, we investigated whether random induction of Confetti FPs in precursor cells can be similarly modeled by a binomial distribution, whereby the variance of FPs inversely correlates with precursor numbers. Based on this relationship, we asked if we could broaden the measurable range of precursor number, which would allow us to expand the existing correlation range.</p>
<p>Examining the premises of binomial distribution and setting some assumptions, we report that the random induction of FPs among a group of mice or cells can be modeled by a binomial distribution. Experimental validation establishes a broadened linear range, covering the full spectrum of precursor numbers (1∼10<sup>5</sup>) and overcoming the prior range limit. We leverage this correlation to probe the number of hematopoietic precursors at homeostasis, post-myeloablation, during developmental expansion, and in a mouse model of inherited bone marrow failure.</p>

<title>Binomial distribution underlies the inverse linear correlation between FP% variance and the precursor numbers</title>
<p>To broaden the limited correlation range, we aimed to elucidate the mathematical relationship between variance and precursor numbers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Inspired by XCI, we asked how the stochastic induction of Confetti FPs in precursors may satisfy the premises of binomial distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. We found that when we assume the number of precursors remain the same for the condition tested, then induction of FPs meets the required premises: (1) the number of precursors, denoted as <italic>n</italic>, remains constant within a group of mice or cells; (2) each observation (e.g. each precursor) is independent; (3) each observation yields one of two outcomes (e.g., it signifies the presence or absence of RFP in a precursor); (4) the probability of success, represented as <italic>p</italic> (e.g., the likelihood of a precursor expressing RFP upon Confetti induction), remains consistent across all observations.</p>
<p>Should the induction of a FP adhere to a binomial distribution, precursor numbers can be estimated using the following equation:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="587737v2_eqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="587737v2_inline1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> signifies the estimated number of precursors, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="587737v2_inline2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> represents the estimated probability of a precursor being one given FP (e.g., <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="587737v2_inline3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>), and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="587737v2_inline4.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> denotes the estimated coefficient of variance (CV) of one given FP (e.g., <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="587737v2_inline5.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>). CV is the standard deviation divided by the mean, utilized by the empirical correlation formula.</p>
<p>The equation proposes a direct linear relationship between the precursor number and the CVs of individual FPs, supporting the empirical correlation formula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Indeed, by analyzing a published dataset providing precursor numbers and the corresponding distribution of FPs, we found that the correlation between <italic>n</italic> and individual CVs of FP exhibits superior fit (&gt;0.93), higher than the empirical correlation equation based on all three CVs (0.75) (Figure S1A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Moreover, according to <xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">equation 1</xref>, the y-intercept of correlation between precursor number and CV was influenced by FP<sub>mean</sub>%, while the slope was the same (-2) regardless of FP<sub>mean</sub>%. Given the unequal value of RFP<sub>mean</sub>%, CFP<sub>mean</sub>%, and YFP<sub>mean</sub>% in the published dataset, the correlation equations show significantly distinct y-intercepts (p&lt;0.0001) (Figure S1A and B). In contrast, the slopes of these correlation equations were similar (p=0.49, with all 95% confidence intervals encompassing -2, the theoretical value) (Figure S1A).</p>
<p>In conclusion, the FP induction in precursor cells can be modeled by a binomial distribution with the assumption that precursor numbers are constant among a group of mice. This sets the mathematical basis for the inverse linear correlation between variance of FP% and the number of precursors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>A broad range of precursor numbers correlates with variance of FP%</title>
<p>While the correlation formula derived from binomial distribution does not impose any range limitation, experimental errors may confound the measurement of variance. We next aimed to experimentally confirm this correlation. To streamline the calculation, we used standard deviation instead of CV to compute variance. The correlation between standard deviation and precursor numbers is expressed through the following equation:
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="587737v2_eqn2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="587737v2_inline6.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> denotes the estimated standard deviation of a given FP% (e.g. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="587737v2_inline7.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>).</p>
<p>Given this equation, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="587737v2_inline8.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> exhibits a linear and inverse correlation with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="587737v2_inline9.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. Indeed, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="587737v2_inline10.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="587737v2_inline11.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="587737v2_inline12.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> exhibited a linear and inverse correlation with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="587737v2_inline13.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> in the published data (Figure S1C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>].</p>
<p>To simplify the validation, we used a two-color cell model HL-60 bearing one of the two FPs (BFP and GFP, wherein GFP represents non-BFP) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Although the Confetti cassette recombination can generate one of four colors, our estimation is based on a single given FP (e.g. a precursor expresses RFP or not), making this simplification justifiable.</p>
<p>We first proved that neither BFP nor GFP HL-60 cells had a competitive growth advantage over the other, ensuring that HL-60 progeny mirrored the seeding population (Figure S1D). We next sorted one to 10<sup>7</sup> cells into individual wells and allowed them to proliferate for at least three generations before assessing BFP% at the end of the culture (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). We focus on cell range up to 10<sup>5</sup> cells as 1.4×10<sup>5</sup> non-HSC LSK and 5.2×10<sup>3</sup> active HSCs were previously estimated in an adult female mouse, which corresponds to the highest possible precursor numbers in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. We considered the survival rate of cells in wells receiving a single HL-60 cell (53% to 60%), to ensure the accuracy of the number of cells seeded.</p>
<p>Consistent with the proposed correlation, as seeded numbers increase, BFP% standard deviation decreases (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). The variance of BFP% reveals an inverse correlation with the seeding numbers (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.996) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). After normalizing for cell survival rates, the calculated numbers closely align with the expected numbers from one to 10<sup>6</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). We had anticipated that measurement of small variance in high precursor numbers may be confounded by experimental errors. Indeed, at cell numbers larger than 10<sup>6</sup>, the standard deviation of BFP% and the expected number reached a plateau (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>, grey circles). To ensure accurate measurement without confounding errors, we suggest 10<sup>5</sup> to be the upper limit for experimental measurement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Experimental practices for accurate precursor number measurement</title>
<p>It is crucial to ensure the accuracy of variance measured because variance of FP% is solely used for estimation. Based on the data from the two-color HL-60 model, we conclude that there are at least three experimental practices required for accurate cell estimates: (1) exclusion of outliers; (2) sufficient flow cytometry recorded events; (3) sufficient sample size per group. Both outliers and insufficient recorded events inaccurately inflate sample variance, leading to underestimation of precursor numbers (Figure S1E and F). We found that the minimum recorded events increase in tandem with the seeded number, in contrast to the reported 500-event threshold (Figure S1F) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>].</p>
<p>While having a small sample size per biological replicate is possible, the variability of estimates among replicates would be high (Figure S1G). Practically, achieving a large sample size (&gt;20) is cumbersome in mice. To determine a feasible sample size for relatively accurate estimates, we resampled datapoints to calculate the variability reduction as sample size increases (Figure S1H). Our analyses reveal that five samples per group are sufficient to substantially minimize error, whereas an additional increase in sample size leads to marginal error reduction. We therefore use at least five mice per biological replicates for our precursor estimations.</p>

<title>Inducible HSC-Scl-CreER<sup>T</sup>-targeted Confetti labeling in the active blood precursors at the adult stage</title>
<p>To label hematopoietic precursors and quantify their number <italic>in vivo</italic>, we considered the choice of Cre mouse line to be crossed with Confetti. Historically, hematopoietic precursors are thought to be hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) capable of long-term repopulation. However, recent studies indicate that multipotent progenitors (MPPs) also contribute alongside HSCs in maintaining blood production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Hence, both HSCs and MPPs should be labeled.</p>
<p>Among Cre mouse lines capable of labeling HSCs and MPPs simultaneously at the adult stage (such as Rosa26<sup>CreERT2</sup>, Mx1-Cre, and HSC-Scl-CreER<sup>T</sup>), we chose HSC-Scl-CreER<sup>T</sup> because of its preference for labeling HSPCs (immunophenotypically defined as Lin<sup>-</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup>cKit<sup>+</sup> (LSK)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. To validate the specificity of HSC-Scl-CreER<sup>T</sup>, we generated mice possessing a single Confetti allele and homozygous HSC-Scl-CreER<sup>T</sup> alleles. We then examine Confetti expression one day after a two-day tamoxifen administration. Consistent with prior reports of HSC-Scl-CreER<sup>T</sup> activity, we observed Confetti expression in the LSK population and T cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, Figure S2A-E). Unexpectedly, Confetti expression was additionally detected in NK cells, CD41<sup>+</sup> cells, non-inflammatory monocytes (SSC-A<sup>low</sup>Ly6C<sup>-</sup>Ly6G<sup>-</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>), common myeloid progenitors (CMP, Lin<sup>-</sup> Sca-1<sup>-</sup>cKit<sup>+</sup>CD16/32<sup>-/low</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup>), and granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMP, Lin<sup>-</sup>Sca-1<sup>-</sup> cKit<sup>+</sup>CD16/32<sup>+</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] (Figure S2D-G). Considering the relatively shorter lifespan of these cells compared to HSC/MPP, the labeling in these cells should minimally impact precursor calculations, especially with a chase period post-labeling. While the Confetti induction in the relatively long-lived T cells precludes estimation based on mature T cells, we conclude that HSC-Scl-CreER<sup>T</sup> remains a practical choice for labeling active hematopoietic precursors.</p>

<p>The stability of Confetti labeling after induction is required for binomial distribution. Therefore, the absence of background Cre activity after Confetti induction is critical. We determine the background Cre activity in HSC-Scl-CreER<sup>T</sup>/Confetti animals by two approaches: (1) detecting Confetti expression in non-induced animals; (2) identifying cells co-expressing two Confetti FPs months after tamoxifen induction due to cassette &quot;flipping&quot; from background Cre activity. We observe no Confetti-expressing cells without tamoxifen treatment in mice up to 50 weeks old and minimal co-expression of two Confetti FPs in induced HSC-Scl-CreER<sup>T</sup>/Confetti animals (Figure S3A-B). Conversely, Vav-Cre/Confetti animals constitutively express Cre, resulting in ∼15% cells co-expressing two Confetti colors in peripheral blood (PB) T cells (Figure S3C-D). Both lines of evidence support minimal Cre background activity in HSC-Scl-CreER<sup>T</sup> and its use as a Cre driver for precursor number calculation.</p>

<title>The variance of FP% inversely correlates with precursor numbers <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>To ascertain the inverse correlation between variance of FP% and the number of hematopoietic precursors <italic>in vivo</italic>, we first investigate the variance of FP% in mice hosting various numbers of hematopoietic precursors. We generate these mice by non-competitively transplanting 0.25×10<sup>6</sup> or 4×10<sup>6</sup> induced CD45.2<sup>+</sup> HSC-Scl-CreER<sup>T</sup>/Confetti mouse bone marrow (BM) cells into CD45.1<sup>+</sup> recipient mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Given the constant frequency of precursors in the donor BM (1/10<sup>5</sup>) and the varying doses of donor BM cells, these mice received approximately 2.5 (“low precursor number”) or 40 (“high precursor number”) precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. While similar experiments transplanting defined numbers of precursors have been reported, the estimation for precursor numbers lower than 50 has not been explored.</p>
<p>Due to the scarcity of hematopoietic precursors in the BM, the precursor number seeded in recipients followed Poisson distribution instead of being constant, violating the premise (1) of binomial distribution. Nonetheless, our simulations show that the seeding number variation among recipient mice is relatively small, therefore the variance resulting from precursor number differences still dominates and inversely correlates with precursor numbers. A minor problem is that the estimated numbers are not at one-to-one ratio to expected numbers at low precursor number range (&lt;10, see Methods) (Figure S4A).</p>
<p>As cells are not 100% labeled with Confetti, for clarity, we use “FP<sub>PB</sub>%” or “FP<sub>BM</sub>%” to represent the frequency of a given FP in the PB or BM, and use “FP<sub>Conf</sub>%” to represent the frequency of a given FP in the Confetti<sup>+</sup> population. For total precursor number calculations, we normalize the number calculated from the Confetti-labeled population to Confetti labeling efficiency.</p>
<p>As expected, we observe higher RFP<sub>Conf</sub>% variance across all PB cell types in mice belonging to the “low precursor number” groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and Figure S4B-C). Since variance of any FP following a binomial distribution inversely correlates with precursor numbers, we also find higher CFP<sub>Conf</sub>% and YFP<sub>Conf</sub>% variance in the “low precursor number” groups (Figure S4D-E). Following the same principle, we observe higher RFP<sub>PB</sub>%, CFP<sub>PB</sub>%, YFP<sub>PB</sub>% and Confetti% variance in “low precursor number” mice (Figure S4F).</p>
<p>Applying <xref rid="eqn2" ref-type="disp-formula">equation 2</xref>, we find that the precursor numbers of B cells and myeloid cells are noticeably higher in the first two months than at four months post-transplantation, suggesting transient progenitor contributions at early time points (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). At four months post-transplantation, the estimated precursor numbers align with the expected values (in myeloid cells, 94 for “high precursor number” groups, three for “low precursor number” groups, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Again, for any FP following binomial distribution, variance of FP% inversely correlates with precursor numbers and thus can be leveraged to calculate precursor numbers (Methods). Since different FPs measure the same population of precursors, we expect the estimations from different FPs to be similar. Indeed, precursor numbers derived from RFP<sub>Conf</sub>% highly correlate with those estimated from YFP<sub>Conf</sub>% or CFP<sub>Conf</sub>% (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.885 for CFP% in Confetti<sup>+</sup>, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.769 for YFP% in Confetti<sup>+</sup>), as well as those from RFP<sub>PB</sub>%, YFP<sub>PB</sub>% and CFP<sub>PB</sub>% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>, Figure S4G).</p>
<p>Consistent with PB data, higher variance of RFP<sub>Conf</sub>% is also observed in the BM of “low precursor number” mice (Figure S5A). The precursor numbers estimated from various BM HSPC subpopulations align well with each other and are consistent within the same group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). However, in “high precursor number” groups, estimates from BM HSPCs are lower than those derived from PB myeloid cells (27 for BM HSPC, 94 for PB myeloid cells, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). This discrepancy may reflect uneven seeding of precursors to the BM throughout the body after transplantation, and the fact that we only sample a part of the BM (femur, tibia, and pelvis)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. In summary, we validate the inverse correlation between variance of FP% and precursor numbers <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, the quantification of precursor numbers is feasible even for precursor numbers outside the empirical correlation range.</p>

<title>Cell frequency measurements fail to reflect the differences in precursor numbers</title>
<p>Given that transplantation studies are performed non-competitively and the recipients are lethally irradiated, we expect to see minimal differences in donor chimerism between two groups, despite drastic differences in donor precursor numbers. Indeed, although we observe substantially lower donor chimerism in mice belonging to “low precursor number” groups during the first two months post-transplantation, the chimerism differences are very small by four months post-transplantation (5.5±2.8%, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). The initial differences in donor precursor numbers do not affect PB cell frequencies, except for the first month post-transplantation, when higher PB myeloid frequencies are observed in the “low precursor number” groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). This suggests myeloid cell production is enhanced when very few precursors are available after irradiation-mediated injury (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>In the BM, nucleated cell counts, donor chimerism and HSPC frequencies are mostly similar regardless of donor precursor numbers, suggesting that even extremely low numbers of hematopoietic precursors can still effectively repopulate a non-competitive environment (Figure S5B-D). Therefore, in cases where hematopoietic precursors expand or decline without competition, stem cell frequencies are less informative to study precursor activity. Measuring precursor numbers is more meaningful as low number of active precursors may be constrained by compensatory proliferation.</p>

<title>Thousands of hematopoietic precursors contribute to native hematopoiesis</title>
<p>While the empirical formula, which measures 50-2500 precursors, supports quantification of precursors labeled at fetal stages, it may not be applicable to native hematopoiesis, when the total precursor number may exceed 2500. Having validated the feasibility for measuring precursor numbers <italic>in vivo</italic> by Confetti animals, we next sought to investigate the number of active precursors contributing to native hematopoiesis. In HSC-Scl-CreER<sup>T</sup>/Confetti animals, we opt to label a smaller portion of HSPCs with a two-day treatment, despite the potential to label up to 60% HSPCs with Confetti (CFP+YFP+RFP) by 14-day tamoxifen treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, Figure S6A).

<p>Unexpectedly, we observed a successive decrease of CFP<sub>Conf</sub>% and CFP<sub>PB</sub>% in some animals, which distort the distribution of CFP<sub>Conf</sub>% (Figure S6B and C). A similar decline is not observed in RFP<sub>Conf</sub>% or YFP<sub>Conf</sub>%, nor in RFP<sub>RFP+YFP</sub>% (calculated by RFP<sub>PB</sub>%/(RFP<sub>PB</sub>%+YFP<sub>PB</sub>%)) (Figure S6D and E). A similar loss of CFP<sub>Conf</sub>% is neither observed in animals with Confetti induction during fetal development, suggesting a potential immune response to CFP in adult-induced animals (Figure S6F). To circumvent this caveat, we decided to calculate precursor numbers solely based on the variance of RFP<sub>RFP+YFP</sub>%. Since only ∼2% of myeloid cells are labeled with CFP, we reason that the decline of CFP in some animals is unlikely to affect the calculation of total precursor numbers based on other FPs, such as RFP<sub>RFP+YFP</sub>%. Moreover, in transplantation studies, precursor numbers calculated with variance of RFP<sub>RFP+YFP</sub>% linearly correlate with those calculated using variance of other FPs (Figure S4G).</p>
<p>To further ensure accuracy, we focus on PB myeloid cells, as (1) Confetti labeling of T cells result from direct induction by HSC-Scl-CreER<sup>T</sup>, but not differentiation from HSPCs (Figure S2D); (2) Confetti labeling (RFP and YFP) of B cells does not plateau at seven months post-induction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>); (3) myeloid cells are of shorter lifespan. In myeloid cells, we focus on precursor numbers after four months post-induction, when their labeling reaches a plateau (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). The stability of average RFP<sub>RFP+YFP</sub>% suggests an equal contribution of RFP<sup>+</sup> and YFP<sup>+</sup> cells to the PB, a prerequisite for estimating precursor numbers from FP% distributions in the progenies (the myeloid cells) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Like those in PB, the average RFP<sub>RFP+YFP</sub>% in BM HSPC subpopulations is also stable, supporting non-biased differentiation of RFP<sup>+</sup> and YFP<sup>+</sup> precursor cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>Fitting data to <xref rid="eqn2" ref-type="disp-formula">equation 2</xref>, we estimate an average of 2667 precursors contributing to native myelopoiesis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, average of numbers at five to seven months post-induction). This number closely aligns with the clone number estimated by transposon-based barcodes statistic in granulocytes (831/30% = 2770) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>].</p>
<p>The average precursor number calculated from PB myeloid cells at the time of BM analysis (1958) matches those calculated from BM myeloid progenitors (MP, Lin<sup>-</sup>Sca-1<sup>-</sup>cKit<sup>+</sup>) and HSPCs (1773 and 1917), but it is five-fold higher than that of LT-HSC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Although LT-HSCs are thought to sustain steady-state hematopoiesis, recent studies suggest that ST-HSC and MPPs persist long-term as primary contributors to adult hematopoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. The observed discrepancy between the number of precursors contributing to LT-HSC and those contributing to MPPs indicates that at least some MPPs are not replaced by progenitors directly differentiated from LT-HSC at seven months post-induction, affirming the persistence of MPPs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Furthermore, the fact that PB myeloid and BM MP precursor numbers are closer to those of MPPs than LT-HSC confirms active and long-term (at least seven months) contributions from MPPs to steady-state myelopoiesis.</p>
<p>Of note, the quantity of precursor does not necessarily correlate with the frequency of cell type in the BM. For example, the cell frequency of MPP2 (Lineage<sup>-</sup>cKit<sup>+</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup>Flk2<sup>-</sup>CD48<sup>+</sup>CD150<sup>+</sup>) in BM is very low, but MPP2 comprises a modest number of precursors, making its frequency-to-precursor-number ratio the lowest among the HSPC subtypes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref> and S6G). The frequency-to-precursor-number ratio reflects how well precursors of a particular type proliferate to expand their absolute cell count. The low frequency-to-precursor-number ratio of MPP2 suggests that it expands more poorly than other HSPC subtypes.</p>
<p>In summary, we detect thousands of hematopoietic precursors contributing to adult hematopoiesis. At the time of BM analysis, the number of PB myeloid precursors is comparable to those observed in BM MP and HSPCs.</p>

<title>Precursor numbers determined by FP% variance confirm reduced clonality of progenitors after myeloablation</title>

<p>To determine the precursor changes post-5-FU treatment, we use the animals described in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> as untreated (UT) benchmark cohort, which were collected at the same age. At ten days post injection, the efficacy of 5-FU treatment is validated by lower PB myeloid cell frequency post-treatment and higher frequencies of BM progenitors compared to UT animals (Figure S7A and B). The high progenitor frequencies in the BM results from the depletion of cycling cells in the BM and the enhanced proliferation of HSPCs following 5-FU treatment.</p>
<p>Compared to UT animals, the precursor numbers of MP (including CMP, GMP, MEP) and HSPC significantly decrease, confirming a reduction in clonality in the c-Kit<sup>+</sup> population (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. By contrast, the precursor numbers of LT-HSC do not show a decreasing trend. While transplantation studies support unchanged clonality of primitive stem cells after a single dose of 5-FU, a similar investigation in a native environment has not been conducted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Our findings support the notion that native LT-HSC clonality remains unaltered following one-dose 5-FU treatment. Together, myeloablation treatment reinforces how the dynamics of precursor numbers can be tracked through Confetti pattern variations.</p>

<title>Modest developmental expansion of active lifelong precursors</title>
<p>HSCs are thought to undergo substantial expansion in the fetal liver during fetal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. However, a recent study employing the empirical formula challenges this notion by quantifying endogenous lifelong hematopoietic precursors labeled at various developmental stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. It revealed limited expansion of hematopoietic precursors during the fetal liver stage (from E10 to E15,1.8- to 2.7-fold) as well as a gradual and moderate increase from the fetal liver to the post-natal stage (2.4- to 10-fold) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. Although intriguing, most post-natal measurements in this study fell outside the empirical linear range, leaving the genuine degree of post-natal precursor expansion uncertain. As our formula quantitatively assesses a wide range of precursor numbers, we set out to directly compare the numbers of precursor labeled at various development stages (E11.5 and E14.5, by one dose of tamoxifen; adult-stage, benchmark shown in in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, all analyzed at the same age) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>For accuracy, we first examine the dynamics of Confetti labeling. In E14.5-induced animals, the Confetti labeling of T cells almost double from one month to four months of age (4.7% at one month, 9.3% at four months), suggesting Confetti<sup>+</sup>-labeled precursors contribute more to post-natal T cells than non-labeled precursors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Therefore, for T cells in E14.5-induced animals, we focus on precursor numbers generated after three months of age. The Confetti labeling for E11.5-induced animals remain stable for all timepoints examined (Figure S7C).</p>
<p>Similar to adult-induction, the distribution of average FP% is stable for fetal-induction, supporting equal proliferation of RFP<sup>+</sup> and YFP<sup>+</sup> cells (Figure S7D). Unlike adult-induction, fetal-labeled precursor numbers can be calculated with various combination of FP%, since the expression of CFP introduced at the fetal stages is stable (Figure S6F). Nonetheless, for consistency, all precursor numbers are calculated with variance of RFP<sub>RFP+YFP</sub>%, the one employed in adult-induction animals.</p>
<p>The resulting precursor number estimates for E11.5 and E14.5-labeled cohorts are similar in all PB cell types except at two and three months of age, echoing the previous study reporting limited lifelong precursor expansion in the fetal liver (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. Precursor numbers calculated from BM subpopulations are also comparable between the two timepoints (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Although E9.5-labeled clones are reported to seed non-uniformly across bones, the precursor numbers calculated from PB myeloid cells do not significantly differ from those calculated from BM MP and HSPC in E14.5-labeled animals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>].</p>
<p>For comparison between fetal- and adult-induced animals, we focus on PB myeloid cells, as adult-induced animals have non-saturated labeling in B cells and non-HSPC-rooted Confetti labeling in T cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Here, we observe a relatively small increase of precursor numbers in adult-induced animals in PB and BM compared to those labeled at the fetal stage (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). The increase between E11.5/E14.5- and adult-labeled precursors is less than ten-fold, similar to a previous report (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>].</p>
<p>Together, we confirm minimal to no expansion of lifelong precursors in the fetal liver stage and a minor expansion of expansion of lifelong precursors from fetal liver to adult stage.</p>

<title><italic>Fancc<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice have normal numbers of hematopoietic precursors at steady-state</title>
<p>Our approach provides an opportunity to investigate the number of active HSPC precursors in the native environment. To showcase precursor quantification in genetic mouse models, we focus on Fanconi Anemia (FA), the most common inherited bone marrow failure syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. Current FA mouse models exhibit mostly normal adult hematopoiesis at steady state but demonstrate reduced repopulation ability upon BM transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. It remains unclear if their steady-state blood production is sustained by a reduced number of precursors, predisposing them to repopulation defects after transplantation.</p>
<p>To quantify precursor number in a mouse model of FA, we generate <italic>Fancc</italic><sup>+/+</sup>, <italic>Fancc</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and <italic>Fancc</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice with a single Confetti allele and homozygous HSC-Scl-CreER<sup>T</sup> alleles (Fancc<sup>+/+</sup>Confetti<sup>fl/+</sup>HSC-Scl-CreER<sup>T/T</sup>, hereafter <italic>Fancc</italic><sup>+/+</sup>; Fancc<sup>+/-</sup>Confetti<sup>fl/+</sup>HSC-Scl-CreER<sup>T/T</sup>, hereafter <italic>Fancc</italic><sup>+/-</sup>; Fancc<sup>-/-</sup> Confetti<sup>fl/+</sup>HSC-Scl-CreER<sup>T/T</sup>, hereafter <italic>Fancc</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>].

<title>The number of <italic>Fancc<sup>-/-</sup></italic>precursors remains unchanged in mice transplanted with young donor cells</title>
<p>While <italic>Fancc</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice have a similar number of precursors as their wildtype counterparts at homeostasis, it is unknown whether the reduced repopulation ability post-transplantation stems from diminished precursor numbers, reduced cell expansion, or a combination of both [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. To understand the underlying mechanism, we performed competitive transplantation using BM cells from three-month-old Confetti-induced <italic>Fancc</italic><sup>+/+</sup>, <italic>Fancc</italic><sup>+/-</sup> or <italic>Fancc</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice along with CD45.1<sup>+</sup> competitor cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>, Figure S9A). Consistent with previous studies, recipient mice of <italic>Fancc</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells show significantly lower donor chimerism in the PB and BM compared to those of <italic>Fancc</italic><sup>+/+</sup> or <italic>Fancc</italic><sup>+/-</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>, Figure S9B). Despite lower donor chimerism, PB and BM precursor numbers were unaffected in <italic>Fancc</italic><sup>-/-</sup> recipient mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>, Figure S9C-E). This suggests that reduced <italic>Fancc</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cell proliferation instead of fewer active precursors is likely the cause for the reduced repopulation capacity post-transplantation.</p>

<title>Ageing <italic>Fancc</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice have reduced lymphoid hematopoietic precursors upon transplantation</title>
<p>Ageing <italic>Fancc</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice have been reported to develop hematologic neoplasms, resulting in decreased survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. To determine if aging <italic>Fancc<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells also maintain similar precursor numbers post-transplantation, we competitively transplanted BM cells from nine-month-old Confetti-induced <italic>Fancc<sup>+/+</sup></italic> or <italic>Fancc<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice with CD45.1<sup>+</sup> competitor cells, a stage when aging <italic>Fancc<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice start to show decreased survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>] (Figure S9F).</p>
<p>The diminished repopulation ability of <italic>Fancc<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells is reaffirmed by lower PB and BM chimerism (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>, Figure S9I). While no differences in precursor numbers are noted during the initial post-transplantation period, a slight yet consistent reduction in lymphoid precursors is observed in <italic>Fancc<sup>-/-</sup></italic>recipient mice at three to five months post-transplantation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>, Figure S9G and H). Changes in precursor numbers in the BM of KO recipients are less clear, as we observed high variance in several HSPC subtypes (Figure S9J). Nonetheless, precursor numbers of MEP, LSK and ST-HSC showed a consistent reduction. In conclusion, aging <italic>Fancc<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice showed a modest but consistent loss of active PB lymphoid precursors post-transplantation, implying decreased lymphoid precursors additionally compromise repopulation capacity as <italic>Fancc<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice age.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The polyclonal nature of endogenous hematopoiesis imposes methodological problems on a robust dynamic measurement. Inspired by the XCI studies, we successfully employed the correlation formula informed by binominal distribution to quantify precursor number in native hematopoiesis. Using HSC-Scl-CreER<sup>T</sup>/Confetti animals, we estimate thousands of precursors contributing to adult native hematopoiesis, a number comparable to the previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. This number results from a moderate increase during fetal-to-adult transition and respond dynamically to myeloablation by 5-FU. Applied to a mouse model of inherited bone marrow failure (Fancc<sup>-/-</sup> mice), we detected normal precursor numbers at steady state and decreased lymphoid precursors upon transplantation of aging donors.</p>
<p>Although the linear relationship between variance of FP% and precursor numbers has been described, its measurable range has been limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Estimates outside this linear range may erroneously fall within it, making it challenging to distinguish accurate measurements within the range from inaccurate ones beyond it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Based on binomial distribution, we expanded the measurable range to encompass the full spectrum of hematopoietic precursors in mice, minimizing the likelihood of inaccuracies. Furthermore, the linear correlation based on binomial distribution can accommodate any labeling system that follows the underlying premises, without the need for the multispectral Confetti cassette.</p>
<p>Having established a quantitative measurement, we were initially surprised by the moderate differences between fetal and adult-precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. The maximum increase observed (seven-fold observed in CMP) was substantially lower than the increase of competitive repopulation units (CRU) from E12 to E16 determined by limited dilution assays (∼38-fold) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>), as well as the escalation from immunophenotype-defined HSPC counts (28- to 47-fold, from 3-5×10<sup>3</sup> at E14.5 to 1.4×10<sup>5</sup> at two months old) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. It is possible that we overestimated E11.5 precursors, as the numbers of lifelong E11.5 precursors were substantially higher (on average 753 PB myeloid precursor, 512 HSPC precursors) than the one to two repopulation units estimated with transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. Nonetheless, our results were comparable to the ∼870 hematopoietic cluster cells observed at E11.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. We may have underestimated precursor numbers in adult-labeled animals, as most adult HSCs are quiescent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. However, HSC precursor numbers did not increase after induced proliferation by one dose 5-FU treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Therefore, we confirm the moderate precursor numbers difference between fetal- and adult-stage, emphasizing the analysis of hematopoiesis in a native environment. Future studies using different methods to investigate precursor activity locally should validate this result.</p>
<p>Novel methods tracing clones <italic>in situ</italic> offer new opportunities to study native hematopoiesis, yet most are challenging to apply in genetic models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. Since only two mouse lines are required (Confetti and Cre, sometimes Cre is already included for conditional deletion of alleles), our approach is particularly convenient to study hematopoiesis in mouse models of genetic disorders. Applying precursor measurements to <italic>Fancc<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, we observe a minor decrease in precursor numbers after transplantation of aging donors. Although donor chimerism differences had been linked to differences in precursor numbers, reduced proliferation capacity may also contribute to reduced competitive repopulation capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. In this case, definitive precursor number analysis is necessary to differentiate these possibilities.</p>
<p>Currently, concerns regarding clonal restriction in the context of FA gene therapy arises, as the engraftment of gene-corrected stem cells has yielded marginal clinical benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. For the first time, we demonstrate that FA cells maintain a normal precursor quantity post-transplantation, thereby disproving clonal attrition, including putative homing deficits post-transplantation as a cause in this model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. However, it is imperative to acknowledge that the majority of murine models of FA, including the <italic>Fancc<sup>-/-</sup></italic>model utilized herein, do not recapitulate the pathophysiology observed in FA patients. Future investigations in other FA mice and studies leveraging FA patient-derived materials will be pivotal in corroborating and validating the findings presented here.</p>
<p>While we implemented a careful data processing procedure, one pitfall of our analyses was that we inferred precursor numbers from their progenies, assuming uniform and linear expansion from precursor to progenies. A recent study showed non-uniform precursor clone sizes, although the level of non-uniformity is low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. In cases where the non-uniformity is high, according to mathematical modeling, we measured the major contributors to hematopoiesis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. Another potential caveat is that the relative contribution of Confetti-labeled precursors to blood production compared to non-labeled precursors remains unknown. Future studies using different Cre drivers should validate the precursor numbers for steady-state hematopoiesis.</p>
<p>In summary, we substantially broadened the applicable range of the correlation between variance of FP% and the precursor based on binomial distribution. We discovered thousands of precursors contributing to steady-state adult murine hematopoiesis and validated that fetal-to-adult precursor expansion is indeed limited. This analysis highlights active precursor numbers as an important metric in both normal and genetic mouse models.</p>

where <italic>n</italic> signifies the number of precursors, <italic>p</italic> represents the probability of an individual being one of the FPs (e.g., RFP), and σ<sup>2</sup> denotes the variance of specific FP% (e.g. σ<sub>RFP%</sub><sup>2</sup>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. In experiments, <italic>p</italic> will be estimated with the average FP% in the Confetti<sup>+</sup> cells (e.g. RFP<sub>mean</sub>%), and σ<sup>2</sup> will be estimated with the variance of FP% among a group of individual or mice (e.g. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="587737v2_inline14.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>). Consequently, the estimation of precursors number n is calculated using the following equation:

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study by Liu and colleagues uses lineage tracing of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in situ to infer the clonal dynamics of adult hematopoiesis. The authors apply a new mathematical analysis framework enabling a wider range of clonal estimation and the revised study 1) provides evidence of polyclonal adult hematopoiesis, 2) provides insights on clonal dynamics during fetal liver hematopoiesis, and 3) reveals unexpectedly high polyclonality in a mouse model of bone marrow failure (Fanconi anemia), arguing against the prevalent views of clonal attrition in this context. The evidence in this extensively revised and improved study is <bold>compelling</bold>, with methods, data and analyses more rigorous than the current state-of-the-art, which will be of broad interest not only to stem cell and developmental biologists working on hematopoiesis, but also to researchers working on other systems.</p>

<p>Previous studies have used a randomly induced label to estimate the number of hematopoietic precursors that contribute to hematopoiesis. In particular, the McKinney-Freeman lab established a measurable range of precursors of 50-2500 cells using random induction of one of the 4 fluorescent proteins (FPs) of a Confetti reporter in the fetal liver to show that hundreds of precursors establish lifelong hematopoiesis. In the presented work, Liu and colleagues aim to extend the measurable range of precursor numbers previously established and enable measurement in a variety of contexts beyond embryonic development. To this end, the authors investigated whether the random induction of a given Confetti FP follows the principles of binomial distribution such that the variance inversely correlates with the precursor number. The authors validated their hypothesis and identified sampling conditions to minimize experimental error using a simplified in vitro system. They use tamoxifen-inducible Scl-CreER, active in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), to induce Confetti labeling and investigate whether they could extend their model to cell numbers below 50 with in vivo transplantation of high versus low numbers of Confetti total bone marrow (BM) cells. The data generated are generally robust. While the lower and upper limits of the model may show some small error or have not yet been completely validated experimentally, it extends the measurable range of precursor from 15 - 10^5 cells. The authors then apply their model to estimate the number of hematopoietic precursors that contribute to hematopoiesis in a variety of contexts including adult steady state, fetal liver, following myeloablation, and a genetic model of Fanconi anemia.</p>
<p>Their data highlight the importance of estimating precursor numbers and not just donor frequency in transplantation settings and show that native hematopoiesis is highly polyclonal. Their data also confirm previous findings from Ganuza et al, 2022 that demonstrate no major expansion of precursors between E11.5 - E14.5. Finally, their work reveals intact Fancc-/-precursor numbers following transplantation, suggesting that the observed reduced chimerism is due to defects in cell proliferation.</p>
<p>The conclusions are generally sound and based on high-quality data. As the authors note, future studies should validate the model using alternative Cre-drivers to exclude any potential functional difference between labelled and non-labelled cells. Although this system does not permit tracing of individual clones, the modeling presented allows measurements of clonal activity covering nearly the entire HSPC population (as recently estimated by Cosgrove et al, 2021) and can be applied to a wide range of in vivo contexts with relative ease.</p>

<p>The manuscript is well written, with beautiful and clear figures, and both methods and mathematical models are clear and easy to understand. Since 2017, Mikel Ganuza, Shannon McKinney-Freeman et al have been using these Confetti approaches that rely on calculating the variance across independent biological replicates as a way to infer clonal dynamics. This is a powerful tool and it is a pleasure to see it being implemented in more labs around the world. One of the cool novelties of the current manuscript is using a mathematical model (based on a binomial distribution) to avoid directly regressing the Confetti labeling variance with the number of clones (which only has linearity for a small range of clone numbers). As a result, this current manuscript of Liu et al. methodologically extends the usability of the Confetti approach, allowing them more precise and robust quantification.</p>
<p>They then use this model to revisit some questions from various Ganuza et al. papers, validating most of their conclusions. The application to the clonal dynamics of hematopoiesis in a model of Fanconi anemia (Fancc mice) is very much another novel aspect, and shows the surprising result that clonal dynamics are remarkably similar to the wild-type (in spite of the defect that these Fancc HSCs have during engraftment).</p>
<p>Overall, the manuscript succeeds at what it proposes to do, stretching out the possibilities of this Confetti model, which I believe will be useful for the entire community of stem cell biologists, and possibly make these assays available to other stem cell regenerating systems.</p>
<p>The revised version has incorporated the reviewer suggestions, strengthening the solidity of the arguments and statements, and highlighting alternative interpretations. My comments were addressed in full.</p>

<p>The paper presents a solid method for quantifying hematopoietic precursors using statistical variance as a proxy, providing valuable insights into hematopoietic dynamics across different physiological and pathological scenarios. The findings are pivotal for understanding hematopoietic dynamics. The strength of the evidence is convincing and acknowledges limitations such as the binomial assumption and the need of tools to measure clonality.</p>
<p>Liu et al. focus on a mathematical method to quantify active hematopoietic precursors in mice using Confetti reporter mice combined with Cre-lox technology. The paper explores the hematopoietic dynamics in various scenarios, including homeostasis, myeloablation with 5-fluorouracil, Fanconi anemia (FA), and post-transplant environments. The key findings and strengths of the paper include (1) precursor quantification: The study develops a method based on the binomial distribution of fluorescent protein expression to estimate precursor numbers. This method is validated across a wide dynamic range, proving more reliable than previous approaches that suffered from limited range and high variance outside this range; (2) dynamic response analysis: The paper examines how hematopoietic precursors respond to myeloablation and transplantation; (3) application in disease models: The method is applied to the FA mouse model, revealing that these mice maintain normal precursor numbers under steady-state conditions and post-transplantation, which challenges some assumptions about FA pathology. Despite the normal precursor count, a diminished repopulation capability suggests other factors at play, possibly related to cell proliferation or other cellular dysfunctions. In addition, the FA mouse model showed a reduction in active lymphoid precursors post-transplantation, contributing to decreased repopulation capacity as the mice aged. The authors are aware of the limitation of the assumption of uniform expansion. The paper assumes a uniform expansion from active precursor to progenies for quantifying precursor numbers. This assumption may not hold in all biological scenarios, especially in disease states where hematopoietic dynamics can be significantly altered. If non-uniformity is high, this could affect the accuracy of the quantification. Overall, the study underscores the importance of precise quantification of hematopoietic precursors in understanding both normal and pathological states in hematopoiesis, presenting a robust tool that could significantly enhance research in hematopoietic disorders and therapy development. This manuscript would be interesting to the readers of eLife.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Previous studies have used a randomly induced label to estimate the number of hematopoietic precursors that contribute to hematopoiesis. In particular, the McKinneyFreeman lab established a measurable range of precursors of 50-2500 cells using random induction of one of the 4 fluorescent proteins (FPs) of a Confetti reporter in the fetal liver to show that hundreds of precursors establish lifelong hematopoiesis. In the presented work, Liu and colleagues aim to extend the measurable range of precursor numbers previously established and enable measurement in a variety of contexts beyond embryonic development. To this end, the authors investigated whether the random induction of a given Confetti FP follows the principles of binomial distribution such that the variance inversely correlates with the precursor number. They tested their hypothesis using a simplified 2-color in vitro system, paying particular attention to minimizing sources of experimental error (elimination of outliers, sample size, events recorded, etc.) that may obscure the measurement of variance. As a result, the data generated are robust and show that the measurable range of precursors can be extended up to 105 cells. They use tamoxifen-inducible Scl-CreER, which is active in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) to induce Confetti labeling, and investigated whether they could extend their model to cell numbers below 50 with in vivo transplantation of high versus low numbers of Confetti total bone marrow (BM) cells. The premise of binomial distribution requires that the number of precursors remains constant within a group of mice. The rare frequency of HSPCs in the BM means that the experimentally generated &quot;low&quot; number recipient animals showed some small variability of seeding number, which does not follow the requirement for binomial distribution. While variance due to differences in precursor numbers still dominates, it is unclear how accurate estimated numbers are when precursor numbers are low (&lt;10).</p>

<p>According to our simulation, the differences between estimated numbers and the corresponding expected numbers are more profound at numbers below 10, but they are still relatively small. Since Figure S4A is in log-scale, it might be difficult for readers to appreciate the magnitude in difference from the graph. We plan to add a linear scale figure to Figure S4A for better visualization of the absolute value differences (left). We also plan to provide an additional graph quantifying the value differences between estimated and expected values for numbers below 15 (right). From both graphs, the maximum difference between estimated n and expected n occurs at 10 precursor numbers (estimated as 7.6). We admit that these numbers are not numerically the same, and some minor correction of the formula may be needed if a very accurate absolute number is warrant. However, we also want to emphasize that 1. most estimated n values are within 25% range of the expected n; 2. despite the minor discrepancy, the estimated n is still highly correlated with the expected n, so the comparison between different precursor numbers was not affected.</p>

<p>The authors then apply their model to estimate the number of hematopoietic precursors that contribute to hematopoiesis in a variety of contexts including adult steady state, fetal liver, following myeloablation, and a genetic model of Fanconi anemia. Their modeling shows:</p>
<p>- thousands of precursors (~2400-2600) contribute to adult myelopoiesis, which is in line with results from a previous study (Sun et al, 2014).</p>
<p>- myeloablation (single dose 5-FU), while reducing precursor numbers of myeloid progenitors and HSPCs, was not associated with a reduction in precursor numbers of LTHSCs.</p>
<p>- no major expansion of precursor number in the fetal liver derived from labeling at E11.5 versus E14.5, consistent with recent findings from Ganuza et al, 2022.</p>
<p>- normal precursor numbers in Fancc-/- mice at steady state and from competitive transplantation of young Fancc-/- BM cells, suggesting that reduced Fancc-/- cell proliferation may underlie the reduced chimerism upon transplantation.</p>
<p>- reduced number of lymphoid precursors following transplantation of BM cells from 9month-old Fancc-/- animals (beyond this age animals have decreased survival).</p>
<p>Although this system does not permit the tracing of individual clones, the modeling presented allows measurements of clonal activity covering nearly the entire HSPC population (as recently estimated by Cosgrove et al, 2021) and can be applied to a wide range of in vivo contexts with relative ease. The conclusions are generally sound and based on high-quality data. Nevertheless, some results could benefit from further explanation or discussion:</p>
<p>- The estimated number of LT-HSCs that contribute to myelopoiesis is not specifically provided, but from the text, it would be calculated to be 1958/5 = ~391. Data from Busch et al, 2015 suggest that the number of differentiation-active HSCs is 5.2x103, which is considered the maximum limit. There is nevertheless a more than 10-fold difference between these two estimates, and it is unclear how this discrepancy arises.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>First, we would like to clarify a sentence in the manuscript.</p>
<p>“The average myeloid precursor number at the time of BM analysis (1958) matched the average precursor number calculated from BM myeloid progenitors (MP, Lin-Sca-1-cKit+) and HSPCs (1773 and 1917), but it was five-fold higher than that of LT-HSC (Figure 3E).”</p>
<p>In this sentence, we compared the number of precursors calculated from peripheral blood myeloid cells to the those calculated from BM myeloid progenitor, HSPC and LT-HSC. However, we did not intend to imply that those precursors numbers calculated from HSPC and LT-HSC specifically contribute to myelopoiesis. To avoid misunderstanding, we propose to change this sentence to read:</p>
<p>“The average precursor number calculated from PB myeloid cells at the time of BM analysis (1958) matched those calculated from BM myeloid progenitors (MP, Lin-Sca-1-cKit+) and HSPCs (1773 and 1917), but it was fivefold higher than that of LT-HSC (Figure 3E).”</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we appreciate the reviewers’ comment on the gap between the precursor numbers of LT-HSC and the number of differentiation-active HSCs reported in Busch et al, 2015. We propose the following explanation:</p>
<p>First of all, precursor numbers reflect LT-HSC self-renewal by symmetric division and maintenance by asymmetric division but not differentiation. To compare the number of differentiation-active LT-HSC, precursor numbers measured from differentiated progeny (progenitors) is a better choice. As our system does not differentiate the origin of a precursor, measuring the precursor number of differentiation-active LT-HSC is difficult, since progenitors may also derive from other long-lived MPPs. However, if we assume that most divisions of LT-HSC are asymmetric division, generating one LT-HSC and one progenitor, then we can approximate the number of differentiation-active HSCs with the precursor numbers of LT-HSC.</p>
<p>Second, when Busch et al, 2015 calculated the number of differentiation-active HSC, they measured the cumulative activity of stem cells by following the mice up to 36 weeks postinduction. Our method measured the recent but not accumulative activity of HSC, thus the number of differentiation-active HSC in Busch et al 2015 is predicted to be higher.</p>
<p>Third, Busch et al, 2015 used Tie2MCM Cre to trace HSC. It has been shown that Tie2+ HSC have a higher reconstitution capacity (Ito et al 2016, Science), but no one has compared the <italic>in situ</italic> activity of Tie2+ and Tie2- HSC in a native environment. Since the behavior of HSCs <italic>in situ</italic> may be very different from their behavior in a transplantation setting, it is possible that Tie2+ HSC are more prone to differentiation than Tie2- HSC in a native environment, leading to an overestimation of differentiation-active HSC in the HSC pool.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Similarly, in Figure 3E, the estimated number of precursors is highest in MPP4, a population typically associated with lymphoid potential and transient myeloid potential, whereas the numbers of MPP3, traditionally associated with myeloid potential, tend to be higher but are not significantly different than those found in HSCs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe this question results from similar confusion of the nomenclature of myeloid precursors in the previous question. As explained previously, the precursors quantified reflect a variety of possible differentiation routes, not just myelopoiesis. Thus, Figure 3E did not suggest that the lymphoid-biased MPP4 has more myeloid precursors than LTHSC. Instead, it simply means more precursors contribute to MPP4 population than the LT-HSC pool. We apologize for the confusion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- The requirement for estimating precursor numbers at stable levels of Confetti labeling is not well explained. As a result, it is unclear how accurate the estimates of B cell precursors upon transplantation of Fancc-/- cells are. In previous experiments on normal Confetti mice (Figure 3B), the authors do not estimate precursors of lymphopoiesis because Confetti labeling of B cells is not saturated, and this appears to be the case in Fanc-/- animals as well (Fig. 5B).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the request for clarification. Our approach required the labeling level to be stable in peripheral blood because we calculate the total number of precursors by normalizing precursor numbers in Confetti+ population with the labeling level (precursor numbers in Confetti+ population divided by labeling efficiency). If the labeling level is not saturated, then the calculation of total precursors will be overestimated. This requirement is more important in native hematopoiesis, since it takes a long time for the mature population, especially the lymphoid population, to be fully replaced by the progenies from the labeled HSPC population (as suggested by Busch et al 2015 and Säwen et al 2018). In transplantation, since lethal irradiation was performed, mature blood cells were rapidly generated by HSPCs, thus saturation of labeling level is not a major concern for precursor quantification. We plan to add Author response image 2 as evidence that Confetti labeling level was stable in mice transplanted with <italic>Fancc-/-</italic> cells.</p>

<p>- Do 9-month-old Fanc-/- animals have reduced lymphoid precursors as well?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Because of the non-saturated labeling in peripheral blood B cells and extra-HSPC induction of Confetti in T cells, we cannot accurately measure lymphoid precursor numbers in 9-month-old <italic>Fancc-/-</italic> animals. As an alternative, the precursor number of lymphoid biased MPP4 population were comparable between <italic>Fancc+/+</italic> and <italic>Fancc-/-</italic> animals (Figure 5D).   We plan to add the frequency of common lymphoid progenitors (defined by Lin-IL-7Ra+Sca-1midcKitmid) add a supplementary figure to show were CLP frequencies between these two genotypes.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript by Liu et al. uses Confetti labeling of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in situ to infer the clonal dynamics of adult hematopoiesis. The authors apply a new mathematical framework to analyze the data, allowing them to increase the range of applicability of this tool up to tens of thousands of precursors. With this tool, they (1) provide evidence for the large polyclonality of adult hematopoiesis, (2) offer insights on the expansion dynamics in the fetal liver stage, (3) assess the clonal dynamics in a Fanconi anemia model (Fancc), which has engraftment defects during transplantation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is well written, with beautiful and clear figures, and both methods and mathematical models are clear and easy to understand.</p>
<p>Since 2017, Mikel Ganuza and Shannon McKinney-Freeman have been using these Confetti approaches that rely on calculating the variance across independent biological replicates as a way to infer clonal dynamics. This is a powerful tool and it is a pleasure to see it being implemented in more labs around the world. One of the cool novelties of the current manuscript is using a mathematical model (based on a binomial distribution) to avoid directly regressing the Confetti labeling variance with the number of clones (which only has linearity for a small range of clone numbers). As a result, this current manuscript of Liu et al. methodologically extends the usability of the Confetti approach, allowing them more precise and robust quantification.</p>
<p>They then use this model to revisit some questions from various Ganuza et al. papers, validating most of their conclusions. The application to the clonal dynamics of hematopoiesis in a model of Fanconi anemia (Fancc mice) is very much another novel aspect, and shows the surprising result that clonal dynamics are remarkably similar to the wild-type (in spite of the defect that these Fancc HSCs have during engraftment).</p>
<p>Overall, the manuscript succeeds at what it proposes to do, stretching out the possibilities of this Confetti model, which I believe will be useful for the entire community of stem cell biologists, and possibly make these assays available to other stem cell regenerating systems.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>My main concern with this work is the choice of CreER driver line, which then relates to some of the conclusions made. Scl-CreER succeeds at being as homogenous as possible in labeling HSC/MPPs... however it is clear that it also labels a subcompartment of HSC clones that become dominant with time... This is seen as the percentage of Confettirecombined cells never ceases to increase during the 9-month chase of labeled cells, suggesting that non-labeled cells are being replaced by labeled cells. The reason why this is important is that then one cannot really make conclusions about the clonal dynamics of the unlabeled cells (e.g. for estimating the total number of clones, etc.).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewers’ comments. We also agree that this is especially a concern for measuring B cell precursors in native hematopoiesis. For myeloid cells, the increase was much less profound (0.5% per month) after month four post-induction. One way to investigate the dynamics of unlabeled cells is to induce different groups of mice with different doses of tamoxifen so that labeling efficiency varies among different groups. With 14 days of tamoxifen treatment, maximum 60% of HSPC can be labeled (RFP+CFP+YFP). If the unlabeled cells behave similarly with labeled cells, then varying the labeling efficiency shouldn’t affect the total number of precursors calculated (if excluding the potential effect of longer tamoxifen treatment on HSC). While we haven’t extensively performed such lengthy experiment, we have performed one measurement (5 mice) with 14-days of tamoxifen treatment and showed that peripheral blood myeloid precursor numbers calculated from this experiment were comparable to the ones from Figure 3 (2-day tamoxifen).</p>

</fig>
<p>It's possible that those HSPC that are never labeled with Confetti even during longer tamoxifen treatment could behave differently. In this case, a different Cre driver may provide insight into the total precursor numbers.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I am not sure about the claims that the data shows little precursor expansion from E11 to E14. First, these experiments are done with fewer than 5 replicates, and thus they have much higher error, which is particularly concerning for distinguishing differences of such a small number of clones. Second, the authors do see a ~0.5-1 log difference between E11 and E14 (when looking at months 2-3). When looking at months 5+, there is already a clear decline in the total number of clones in both adult-labeled and embryonic-labeled, so these time points are not as good for estimating the embryonic expansion. In any case, the number of precursors at E11 (which in the end defines the degree of expansion) is always overestimated (and thus, the expansion underestimated) due to the effects of lingering tamoxifen after injection (which continues to cause Confetti allele recombination as stem cell divide). Thus, I think these results are still compatible with expansion in the fetal liver (the degree of which still remains uncertain to me).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agreed adding additional replicates will reducing any error and boost confidence in our conclusions. The dilemma of comparing fetal- and adult-labeled cohorts is that HSPC activities could not be synchronized among different developmental stages. At fetal to neonatal stage, HSPC proliferate faster to generate new blood cells and support developmental need, while at adult stage HSPC proliferate much slower. Thus, it takes long time for the mature myeloid cells in the adult-labeled cohort to reach a stable Confetti labeling and provide an accurate quantification of precursor. While we agree that it might be better to compare precursor numbers in earlier months, we preferred to compare precursor numbers at later time points for the aforementioned reasons. The other option is to compare the number of HSPC precursors in the BM at earlier time points, as no equilibration of labeling level is required in HSPC, but this requires earlier sacrifice, compromising long term assessment.</p>
<p>We did not revisit questions about the lingering effect of tamoxifen, as this has been studied by Ganuza et al 2017. They showed that tamoxifen was not able to induce additional Confetti recombination if given one day ahead, suggesting the effective window for tamoxifen is less than 24h.</p>
<p>Based on our data, the expansion of lifelong precursors range anywhere from 1.4 to 7.0 (Figure 4G). It’s possible that we might observe a higher level of expansion if the comparison was done in earlier time points. Nonetheless, the assertion that the expansion of life-long HSPC is not as profound as evidenced by transplantation, emphasizes value of HSPC activity analysis <italic>in situ</italic>.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Liu et al. focus on a mathematical method to quantify active hematopoietic precursors in mice using Confetti reporter mice combined with Cre-lox technology. The paper explores the hematopoietic dynamics in various scenarios, including homeostasis, myeloablation with 5-fluorouracil, Fanconi anemia (FA), and post-transplant environments. The key findings and strengths of the paper include (1) precursor quantification: The study develops a method based on the binomial distribution of fluorescent protein expression to estimate precursor numbers. This method is validated across a wide dynamic range, proving more reliable than previous approaches that suffered from limited range and high variance outside this range; (2) dynamic response analysis: The paper examines how hematopoietic precursors respond to myeloablation and transplantation; (3) application in disease models: The method is applied to the FA mouse model, revealing that these mice maintain normal precursor numbers under steady-state conditions and posttransplantation, which challenges some assumptions about FA pathology. Despite the normal precursor count, a diminished repopulation capability suggests other factors at play, possibly related to cell proliferation or other cellular dysfunctions. In addition, the FA mouse model showed a reduction in active lymphoid precursors post-transplantation, contributing to decreased repopulation capacity as the mice aged. The authors are aware of the limitation of the assumption of uniform expansion. The paper assumes a uniform expansion from active precursor to progenies for quantifying precursor numbers. This assumption may not hold in all biological scenarios, especially in disease states where hematopoietic dynamics can be significantly altered. If non-uniformity is high, this could affect the accuracy of the quantification. Overall, the study underscores the importance of precise quantification of hematopoietic precursors in understanding both normal and pathological states in hematopoiesis, presenting a robust tool that could significantly enhance research in hematopoietic disorders and therapy development. The following concerns should be addressed.</p>
<p>Major Points:</p>
<p>• The authors have shown a wide range of seeded cells (1 to 1e5) (Figure 1D) that follow the linear binomial rule. As the standard deviation converges eventually with more seeded cells, the authors need to address this limitation by seeding the number of cells at which the assumption fails.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While number range above 105 is not required for our measurement of hematopoietic precursors in mice, we agree that it will be valuable to understand the upper limit of experimental measurement. we plan to seed 106-107 cells per replicate to address reviewer’s comments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Line 276: This suggests myelopoiesis is preferred when very few precursors are available after irradiation-mediated injury. Did the authors see more myeloid progenitors at 1 month post-transplantation with low precursor number? The authors need to show this data in a supplement.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While we appreciate the concern, we did not generate this dataset because this requires take down of a substantial number of animals at one-month post-transplantation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor Points:</p>
<p>• Please cite a reference for line 40: a rare case where a single HSPC clone supports hematopoiesis.</p>
<p>• Line 262-263: &quot;This discrepancy may reflect uneven seeding of precursors to the BM throughout the body after transplantation and the fact that we only sampled a part of the BM (femur, tibia, and pelvis).&quot; Consider citing this paper (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2023.09.019">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2023.09.019</ext-link>) that explores the HSPCs migration across different bones.</p>
<p>• Lines 299 and 304. Misspellings of RFP.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate reviewer’s suggestions and will modify as suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• The title is misleading as the paper's main focus is the precursor number estimator using the binomial nature of fluorescent tagging. Using a single-copy cassette of Confetti mice cannot be used to measure clonality.</p>

<p>We appreciate reviewer’s suggestions and plan to modify the title of the manuscript to read: “Dynamic Tracking of Native Precursors in Adult Mice”.</p>
