<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>The advent of large-scale sequencing in both development and disease has identified large numbers of candidate genes that may be linked to important phenotypes. Validating the function of these candidates <italic>in vivo</italic> is challenging, due to low efficiency and low throughput of most model systems. We have developed a rapid, scalable system for assessing the role of candidate genes using zebrafish. We generated transgenic zebrafish in which Cas9 was knocked-in to the endogenous <italic>mitfa</italic> locus, a master transcription factor of the melanocyte lineage. We used this system to identify both cell-autonomous and non-cell autonomous regulators of normal melanocyte development. We then applied this to the melanoma setting to demonstrate that loss of genes required for melanocyte survival can paradoxically promote more aggressive phenotypes, highlighting that <italic>in vitro</italic> screens can mask <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotypes. Our high-efficiency genetic approach offers a versatile tool for exploring developmental processes and disease mechanisms that can readily be applied to other cell lineages.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Efficient cell type-specific knockout of genes is crucial for unraveling the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying cell function, development, and transformation. Zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) have emerged as a powerful genetic model organism for studying these processes. The large number of animals that can be easily generated make it advantageous (compared to other systems like mice) for querying large numbers of genetic variants that may have links to human diseases. However, most studies in this system use germline knockout, which makes it difficult to determine whether the identified gene has a specific function in a particular lineage, or whether the phenotype reflects a more general developmental defect. Furthermore, many genes which might have lineage specific functions cannot be studied using germline knockout, since embryonic lethality often accompanies global knockout of essential genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. To overcome these limitations, several groups have explored tissue-specific and conditional knockout strategies in zebrafish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. For example, the MAZERATI system uses tissue-specific promoter transgenes to drive Cas9 expression, which are introduced via plasmid injection into one-cell stage embryos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Despite these advancements, efficiency remains of paramount importance. In normal development, low-efficiency knockout of a gene can mask important phenotypes, as the mutant cells can readily be outcompeted by wild-type or inframe mutations. Efficiency is even more important in the cancer context. Mutation of a tumor suppressor (i.e., PTEN) need not be highly efficient, since clones with a Darwinian advantage will inevitably outcompete other clones. However, in situations where we want to study necessity of a tumor promoting gene <italic>in vivo</italic> (i.e., an oncogene), cells which have mutations of a key driver gene will easily be outcompeted by nearby clones. Such efficiency is critical as sequencing projects such as All of Us, the UK Biobank and the Cancer DepMap continue to identify hundreds of new candidate genes on a regular basis, many of which have yet to be characterized <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Skin color pigmentation is amongst the most heterogeneous of genetic systems, with a large number of loci linked to melanocyte development. Mutations in pleiomorphic genes such as <italic>sox10, ednrb, jam3b, tuba8l3, meox1</italic> and <italic>kit</italic> yield clear defects in melanocyte/melanophore development, but these mutants also have defects in other tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Many of these genes are also expressed in melanoma, but their specific <italic>in vivo</italic> function in tumorigenesis remains poorly understood.</p>
<p>In this study, we wished to develop a highly efficient and scalable system to understand <italic>in vivo</italic> genetic dependencies, using melanocytes and melanoma as an exemplar. By integrating the Cas9 nuclease into the endogenous melanocyte-specific <italic>mitfa</italic> locus, we achieved highly efficient and specific gene disruption across the melanocyte developmental lineage. We used our <italic>mitfa</italic><sup>Cas9</sup> knockin animals to inactivate the pigmentation gene <italic>albino</italic> and the embryonic essential genes <italic>sox10, tuba1a,</italic> and <italic>ptena/b</italic> in melanocytes without additional developmental or off-target phenotypes. We also demonstrated that this system can be used to efficiently induce melanomas in wild-type fish by inactivating the tumor suppressors <italic>tp53</italic> and <italic>ptena/b</italic> within melanocytes also expressing the melanoma oncogene BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>. Inactivating the neural crest transcription factor <italic>sox10</italic> in these tumors significantly decreased melanoma initiation but resulted in rare invasive tumors that highly expressed the <italic>sox9</italic> transcription factor, highlighting that unexpected <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotypes can emerge that aren’t predicted from <italic>in vitro</italic> studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Our system can thus be used to advance our understanding of melanocyte biology and the genetic underpinnings of phenotypic switching in melanoma, an approach that can readily be used for other cell types.</p>

<title>Targeted integration of Cas9 to the <italic>mitfa</italic> locus</title>
<p>To selectively disrupt genes in a melanocyte lineage-specific manner, we established a transgenic zebrafish line harboring Cas9 at the endogenous <italic>mitfa</italic> locus. <italic>Mitfa</italic> expression is detectable by 18 hours postfertilization (hpf) and is highly expressed in pigment cells including melanocytes, xanthophores and their progenitors. To achieve knock-in, we utilized the GeneWeld method, which enables efficient integration of DNA cassettes using homology mediated end joining (HMEJ)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. The knock-in cassette, containing Cas9 and BFP driven by the eye-specific γ-crystallin promoter, was targeted to exon 2 of the <italic>mitfa</italic> gene, which leads to disruption of the endogenous <italic>mitfa</italic> gene (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We strategically selected this genomic site for several reasons. First, this is the sole exon shared among the three <italic>mitfa</italic> protein-coding transcripts. Furthermore, targeting Cas9 to exon 2 offers the flexibility of replicating this knock-in strategy in <italic>casper</italic> zebrafish, a transparent fish widely used for melanoma studies that harbor a premature stop codon in <italic>mitfa</italic> exon 3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>The knock-in vector, along with Cas9 protein and guide RNAs targeting either the <italic>mitfa</italic> integration site or the sequences flanking the 5’ and 3’ homology arms, were injected into 1-cell stage wild-type Tropical 5D (T5D) zebrafish embryos (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. An average of 19% of injected embryos had detectable ocular BFP expression at 3 days postfertilization (dpf), indicating successful integration (Figure S1A). Embryos were raised to adulthood then crossed with WT T5D fish. The resulting F1 embryos were screened for BFP+ eyes and tail clippings were sequenced to confirm precise integration of the knock-in cassette at the <italic>mitfa</italic> locus. We sequenced four F1 fish and detected on-target integration at the <italic>mitfa</italic> locus in all four fish (Figure S1B). In zebrafish, one copy of <italic>mitfa</italic> is sufficient for the normal development of neural crest-derived melanocytes, but loss of both copies of <italic>mitfa</italic> results in loss of the melanocyte lineage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. To determine the effect of a single copy of <italic>mitfa</italic><sup>Cas9</sup> on melanocytes, <italic>mitfa</italic><sup>Cas9</sup> fish were in-crossed and the resulting siblings were imaged at various time points (Figure S1C). WT and <italic>mitfa</italic><sup>Cas9</sup> fish exhibited indistinguishable melanocyte patterning during both embryonic and adult stages. However, as expected, fish carrying two copies of Cas9 (<italic>mitfa</italic><sup>Cas9/Cas9</sup>) resembled the <italic>nacre</italic> mutant (<italic>mitfa</italic>-/-), characterized by complete loss of melanocytes, indicating the endogenous <italic>mitfa</italic> gene is disrupted on knock-in alleles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. We used zebrafish harboring one knock-in allele (<italic>mitfa</italic><sup>Cas9</sup>) for all subsequent experiments to allow us to test gene function in melanocytes.</p>
<p>To assess whether Cas9 expression was restricted to melanocytes, we performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on 3dpf WT and <italic>mitfa</italic><sup>Cas9</sup> embryos to measure <italic>mitfa</italic> and Cas9 mRNA expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and S1D). In both WT and <italic>mitfa</italic><sup>Cas9</sup> fish, <italic>mitfa</italic> was detected within the embryonic melanocyte stripe regions as expected. In <italic>mitfa</italic><sup>Cas9</sup> fish, Cas9 mRNA was detected only within melanocyte stripe regions also expressing <italic>mitfa</italic>. These results provide functional validation for on-target integration and tissue-restricted expression of Cas9 to the melanocyte lineage.</p>

<title>Melanocyte-specific loss of the human skin color associated gene <italic>slc45a2</italic> results in robust loss of pigmentation</title>
<p>To assess the effectiveness of our stable <italic>mitfa</italic><sup>Cas9</sup> line, we first targeted the <italic>albino</italic> gene (<italic>slc45a2</italic>). Large scale GWAS studies have repeatedly identified SNPs in this gene as tightly linked to human skin color variation, and germline disruption leads to a complete loss of pigmentation in melanocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. This distinct phenotype enables the visual observation of Cas9 activity in zebrafish injected with <italic>albino</italic> gRNA. To test our system, we designed plasmids, denoted MG-gRNA, containing a zU6:gRNA cassette followed by <italic>mitfa</italic>:GFP to enable visualization of cells expressing the <italic>albino</italic> gRNA. MG-<italic>albino</italic> and MG-NT were injected into one-cell stage embryos from crosses between <italic>mitfa</italic><sup>Cas9</sup> and WT fish, which express Cas9 in all melanocytes but exhibit mosaic gRNA expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Embryos were screened for BFP+ eyes to identify those harboring <italic>mitfa</italic><sup>Cas9</sup>. Upon adulthood, 92% of F0 MG-<italic>albino</italic> fish had mosaic loss of pigmentation within the melanocyte stripe regions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B and C</xref>). Unpigmented regions maintained GFP expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), indicating that the breaks in melanocyte stripes arise from loss of pigmentation in melanocytes rather than loss of the melanocyte lineage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). As expected, control MG-NT clutch mates displayed normal pigmentation and GFP+ melanocytes were indistinguishable from GFP-regions on the same fish (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B and C</xref>).</p>
<p>We next aimed to determine the efficiency of <italic>mitfa</italic><sup>Cas9</sup> in the F1 generation, in which every melanocyte stably expresses the <italic>albino</italic> gRNA and <italic>mitfa</italic><sup>Cas9</sup>. To generate F1 lines, we outcrossed the F0 MG-gRNA fish to WT and sorted embryos for BFP+ eyes and GFP+ melanocytes. F1 MG-<italic>albino</italic> fish exhibited a near complete loss of pigmentation, demonstrating that our <italic>mitfa</italic><sup>Cas9</sup> system is highly efficient in F1 fish (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D and E</xref>). To study the effect of <italic>albino</italic> inactivation across various stages of development, F1 MG-gRNA fish were once again outcrossed to WT, generating F2 MG-gRNA fish expressing one copy of <italic>mitfa</italic><sup>Cas9</sup>. Imaging revealed a measurable pigmentation loss in F2 MG-<italic>albino</italic> melanocytes as early as 3 days post-fertilization (dpf) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F and G</xref>). F2 MG-<italic>albino</italic> fish maintained loss of pigmentation throughout development, indicating the sustained activity of <italic>mitfa</italic><sup>Cas9</sup> (Figure S2A-D).</p>
<p>To confirm on-target cutting of the <italic>albino</italic> gene in the melanocyte lineage (and not other tissues), the skin from F1 MG-<italic>albino</italic> fish was dissected and GFP+ and GFP-cells were isolated using FACS (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). GFP+ cells encompass <italic>mitfa</italic>-expressing melanocytes, xanthophores, and their progenitors, while GFP-cells represent other non-melanocytic, non-<italic>mitfa</italic> expressing skin cells, such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and immune cells. We performed CRISPR-seq on DNA from both populations to directly measure Cas9 efficiency and specificity, quantifying the proportion of indels at the <italic>albino</italic> locus. Although we have previously shown that FACS sorting melanocytic cells is possible, it is important to note that we often observe high levels of contaminating keratinocytes in FACS sorted melanocyte populations, which may lead to an underestimation of the true allelic frequency in our CRISPR-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Despite this, robust inactivation of the <italic>albino</italic> gene was observed in GFP+ (<italic>mitfa</italic>-expressing) cells, confirming somatic inactivation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). The majority of indels were frame-shift inducing mutations. A likely PCR or sequencing artifact resulting in a “T” insertion was excluded from the frameshift indel percentage as it was observed in all conditions including WT fish with no pigmentation phenotype (Figure S2E). These results confirm that our <italic>mitfa</italic><sup>Cas9</sup> system allows us to inactivate genes within the melanocytic lineage <italic>in vivo</italic> in a highly efficient and specific manner.</p>

<p>Having confirmed that our <italic>mitfa</italic><sup>Cas9</sup> system allows us to rapidly, efficiently and specifically manipulate melanocyte gene expression, we next wanted to target embryonic essential genes. Detecting “negative” gene knockout phenotypes such as cell death can be challenging <italic>in vivo</italic> due to the selective advantage that WT cells have over mutants. Current tissue specific knockout systems lack the sensitivity to detect negative phenotypes.</p>
<p>To assess the effectiveness of our <italic>mitfa</italic><sup>Cas9</sup> model in detecting negative phenotypes, we utilized it to target <italic>sox10</italic>, a transcription factor vital to the neural crest lineage and indispensable for overall survival of both zebrafish and mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Consequently, a global knockout approach is not feasible for studying the function of <italic>sox10</italic> in adult melanocytes <italic>in vivo</italic>. Germline knockout of <italic>sox10</italic> in zebrafish leads to severe defects in peripheral nerve development and the complete absence of melanocytes, and the animals die around day 14<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Due to the complete absence of melanocytes and their precursor cells, melanoblasts, in <italic>sox10</italic><sup>-/-</sup> fish, it has not been possible to study the specific role of <italic>sox10</italic> on these more differentiated cell types <italic>in vivo</italic>. One of the key unanswered questions is how <italic>sox10</italic> balances its role in maintaining melanoblast stemness with promoting terminal differentiation, particularly in the context of adult melanocyte regeneration.</p>
<p>We leveraged our <italic>mitfa</italic><sup>Cas9</sup> system to specifically inactivate <italic>sox10</italic> in the melanocyte lineage. <italic>mitfa</italic><sup>Cas9</sup> fish injected with a MG-<italic>sox10</italic> plasmid exhibited noticeable gaps in their melanocyte stripes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-B</xref>). Germline deletion of a <italic>sox10</italic> enhancer region similarly affects adult stripe patterning in zebrafish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. In contrast to the <italic>albino</italic> F0 fish, the gaps in the stripes of the <italic>sox10</italic> F0 fish were not occupied by unpigmented GFP+ melanocytes, indicating a potential defect in the survival or differentiation of melanocytes upon loss of <italic>sox10</italic>. This phenotype became even more pronounced in the stable F1 lines, where several gaps are visible (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Zebrafish have four dark stripes occupied by melanocytes, which alternate with light colored interstripes occupied by yellow pigmented xanthophores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Typically, melanocyte stripe 1D (dorsal) is wider than the interstripe X0 directly below it, as observed in MG-NT F1 fish (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C and D</xref>). However, the opposite is true for MG-<italic>sox10</italic> F1 fish, where we observed an apparent widening of the interstripe region and narrowing of the melanocyte stripes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C and D</xref>). Melanocytes were counted in fish treated with epinephrine to aggregate melanosomes, revealing a significant reduction in the number of melanocytes in the F1 <italic>sox10</italic> KO fish compared to F1 NT fish (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Reduction in GFP+ cells within the xanthophore interstripes (X0) suggested that <italic>sox10</italic> deficiency also negatively affected xanthophore populations, in line with previous work indicating a role for <italic>sox10</italic> in specifying both xanthophores and melanocytes in zebrafish embryos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Melanocytes continually regenerate throughout life, typically from a progenitor population of melanoblasts or melanocyte stem cells. We next assessed whether <italic>sox10</italic> was required for this. We treated adult fish with neocuproine, a copper chelator previously shown to kill mature, pigmented melanocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. We then compared regeneration from these progenitors in MG-<italic>sox10</italic> and MG-NT F1 fish by counting the percentage of melanocytes that emerged after 7, 15, and 70 days (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). At days 7 and 15, when the melanocytes were still in the process of regenerating from melanoblasts, there were no significant differences between the two groups. However, by the time regeneration was completed we found a significant disparity between the regenerative potential of MG-NT and MG-<italic>sox10</italic> fish. At 70 days post-neocuproine treatment, MG-NT fish had regenerated an average of 82% of their melanocytes, whereas only 53% of melanocytes had regenerated in MG-<italic>sox10</italic> fish (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3G-H</xref>). These findings demonstrate that <italic>sox10</italic> is required for adult melanocyte regeneration, highlighting its requirement within melanoblast populations outside of neural crest specification.</p>

<title>Non-autonomous functions of <italic>tuba1a</italic> on melanocytes</title>
<p>One of the significant challenges of conventional global knockout methods is the inability to differentiate between cell-autonomous and non-autonomous phenotypes. This distinction is particularly crucial in melanocyte studies due to their direct and indirect interactions with diverse cell types. A notable example of genes with pleiotropic effects is the tubulin gene family, whose α/β tubulin heterodimers form microtubules essential for various cellular processes such as cell division, motility, and intracellular transport across various cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Microtubules are also critical for the transport of melanosomes in melanocytic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Mutation of tubulin genes such as <italic>tuba8l3a</italic> in zebrafish leads to highly pleiotropic effects including defects in melanocyte patterning, CNS abnormalities, and altered craniofacial morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. We chose to focus on the closely related α tubulin gene <italic>tuba1a</italic>, which is highly expressed in many cell types of the developing zebrafish including melanocytes, but whose specific function in these cells remains unexplored<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Non-cell type specific knockout of <italic>tuba1a</italic> with the Alt-R CRISPR Cas9 system results in extensive embryo abnormalities including a curved tail phenotype, pericardial edema, and melanocytes with more dispersed pigmentation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-B</xref>, S3A-B). We found that compared to 71% survival of NT Alt-R embryos, only 10% of embryos injected with <italic>tuba1a</italic> Alt-R survive to 14dpf (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>

<p>Similar to <italic>sox10,</italic> the embryonic lethality of global <italic>tuba1a</italic> knockout prevents the study of knockout phenotypes in adult fish. To overcome this limitation, we implemented our <italic>mitfa</italic><sup>Cas9</sup> system to specifically knock out <italic>tuba1a</italic> in melanocytes. Unlike global knockout of <italic>tuba1a</italic>, melanocyte specific loss of <italic>tuba1a</italic> resulted in viable adult fish with no obvious abnormalities (Figure S3C-D). Surprisingly, we did not observe the dispersed melanocyte phenotype in any <italic>mitfa</italic><sup>Cas9</sup> MG-<italic>tuba1a</italic> embryos (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, E). Based on this observation, we hypothesized that <italic>tuba1a</italic> may be functioning in a cell non-autonomous manner on melanocytes.</p>
<p>The dispersed pigmentation observed in <italic>tuba1a</italic> Alt-R embryos resembles that seen in blind zebrafish, which fail to contract their melanosomes in response to light<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. This light-mediated camouflage involves retinal ganglion cells signaling hypothalamic neurons to release melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), which then binds to MCH receptors on melanocytes, triggering melanosome aggregation via microtubules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. The normal melanosome dispersion observed in <italic>mitfa</italic><sup>Cas9</sup> MG-<italic>tuba1a</italic> fish suggests that rather than a cell-intrinsic defect in melanosome aggregation, <italic>tuba1a</italic> may indirectly influence melanocytes through potential defects in retinal and/or central nervous system cells crucial for light-mediated camouflage. Interestingly, TUBA1A mutation in humans can result in both ophthalmologic and brain abnormalities and morpholino-based knockdown of tuba1a in zebrafish inhibits CNS development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To further test this idea, we treated <italic>tuba1a</italic> Alt-R embryos with epinephrine to assess their ability to contract melanosomes in response to a non-visual stimulus. <italic>Tuba1a</italic> Alt-R embryos exposed to epinephrine had robust aggregation of melanosomes, demonstrating that the loss of <italic>tuba1a</italic> did not impair melanosome transport (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F, G</xref>). This finding further supports a non-autonomous role for <italic>tuba1a</italic> in melanocytes. Utilizing the <italic>mitfa</italic><sup>Cas9</sup> system distinguish cell-autonomous from non-autonomous gene functions provides valuable insights into the complex dynamics of cell-cell interactions and how genes function within cellular and organismal networks.</p>

<title>Targeting tumor suppressors with <italic>mitfa</italic><sup>Cas9</sup> induces melanoma</title>
<p>We next turned our attention to melanoma. In humans, tumor suppressors such as <italic>PTEN</italic> and <italic>TP53</italic> are somatically inactivated in melanoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. In contrast, the most commonly used zebrafish models of melanoma use a germline <italic>tp53</italic> mutation, which is not typically seen in humans with the disease and precludes our ability to discern the role of <italic>tp53</italic> inactivation specifically in melanocytes and melanoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. While global <italic>tp53</italic> loss is not lethal, it does lead to a wide range of non-melanoma tumors, which can deteriorate fish health and confound melanoma studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Furthermore, current zebrafish melanoma models typically involve the utilization of MiniCoopR <italic>mitfa</italic> rescue cassettes into <italic>casper</italic> or <italic>nacre</italic> zebrafish, which are devoid of normal pigment cells. Although this method is highly efficient, it does not accurately represent melanoma initiation in the context of normal skin architecture and relies on artificial overexpression of <italic>mitfa</italic>. To mimic human melanoma initiation more accurately, we used our <italic>mitfa</italic><sup>Cas9</sup> model to assess tumor initiation using melanoma-specific gene knockout in animals with wild-type skin. Previous studies have shown that expression of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> and loss of <italic>tp53</italic> in WT (non-<italic>casper</italic>) fish results in relatively low tumor burden, so we decided to also target <italic>ptena</italic> and <italic>ptenb</italic>, the zebrafish orthologs of human <italic>PTEN</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. <italic>Ptena/ptenb</italic> loss in combination with <italic>tp53</italic> has been shown to accelerate melanoma formation in zebrafish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To first address the effect of <italic>ptena/b</italic> loss on normal melanocytes, we generated melanocyte-specific knockouts of <italic>ptena</italic> and <italic>ptenb</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Like <italic>sox10</italic> and <italic>tuba1a</italic>, germline knockout of <italic>ptena/b</italic> is embryonic lethal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. In our <italic>ptena/ptenb</italic> F0 melanocyte-specific KO fish, survival was normal. We observed an aberrant expansion of the melanocytes outside of the stripe regions they normally are restrained to, suggesting that inactivation of <italic>ptena</italic> and <italic>ptenb</italic> induces defects in melanocyte patterning (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A and B</xref>). However, loss of <italic>ptena/b</italic> alone was not sufficient to induce melanoma.</p>

<p>To generate tumors, we co-injected <italic>mitfa</italic><sup>Cas9</sup> embryos with plasmids encoding <italic>mitfa:</italic>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> and sgRNAs targeting <italic>tp53</italic> and <italic>ptena</italic>/<italic>b</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Larvae were sorted for BFP+ eyes, indicating mitfa-Cas9 integration, and monitored for tumors over 30 weeks. No tumors were detected in BFP-fish from any of the injection conditions (n=136). We also did not observe any tumors in BFP+ fish injected with either BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> alone (n=35) or ptena/b; <italic>tp53</italic> guides in the absence of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> (n=17). In contrast, tumors developed in all BFP+ groups injected with both <italic>mitfa:</italic>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> and gRNA plasmids. Approximately 5% of fish from the BRAF;<italic>tp53</italic> group developed tumors (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). This aligns with a previous study where 6% of <italic>tp53</italic>-/- fish developed tumors when injected with a BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> construct <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Targeting of <italic>ptena</italic> and <italic>ptenb</italic> in <italic>mitfa</italic><sup>Cas9</sup> fish co-injected with <italic>mitfa</italic>:BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> resulted in a higher tumor incidence of 29% (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>When all three tumor suppressors (<italic>tp53, ptena, ptenb</italic>) were targeted in combination with BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>, 59% of fish developed tumors by 30 weeks post fertilization (wpf) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed that all tumor samples expressed BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>, while p-AKT, a hallmark of <italic>PTEN</italic> inactivation, was only detected in samples with <italic>ptena/b</italic> KO (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). To confirm on-target cutting, DNA was extracted from tumors and CRISPR sequencing was performed on PCR amplicons for each tumor suppressor gene. A large proportion of reads contained indels at the target locus for each of the target genes (<italic>ptena</italic>, <italic>ptenb</italic>, and <italic>tp53</italic>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref> and S4). Some tumors had an array of mutations, while others appeared to be composed largely of a one dominant clone (Figure S4A to C). Our system thus allows us to rapidly dissect the melanocyte-specific function of both oncogenes (BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>), as well as putative tumor suppressors (<italic>tp53</italic>, <italic>ptena/b</italic>), while avoiding pleiotropic effects of global tumor suppressor loss.</p>

<title>Targeting of lineage-specific oncogenes decreases tumor initiation but promotes progression</title>
<p>Our next objective was to leverage the mitfa<sup>Cas9</sup> fish as a tool for identifying or validating potential genetic dependencies within melanoma. Genetic dependencies can be difficult to study <italic>in vivo</italic> since inactivation of a required gene inevitably leads to selection for non-mutant alleles, as has been previously shown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. In melanoma, the DepMap has identified <italic>SOX10</italic> as the top <italic>in vitro</italic> genetic dependency necessary for tumor cell proliferation, suggesting it acts as a lineage-specific oncogene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. In prior work in both zebrafish and mice, loss of <italic>sox10</italic> is clearly associated with a loss of tumor initiating potential and cell proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Yet its specific role <italic>in vivo</italic> remains unclear, since it is required for neural crest and melanocyte specification, making it difficult to know whether its effects reflect loss of the entire lineage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Given our data above showing that <italic>sox10</italic> is required specifically in melanocyte patterning and regeneration, we wished to investigate its function in melanoma.</p>
<p>To assess this, we generated plasmids containing multiple sgRNAs driven by three distinct zU6 promoters (zU6A, zU6B, and zU6C) to simultaneously target both tumor suppressors (<italic>tp53, ptena/ptenb</italic>) and tumor promoting genes (<italic>sox10</italic>) in the same cells, which reduces the chance of selecting for non-mutant alleles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. We co-injected these plasmids with <italic>mitfa</italic>:BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>, sorted fish for BFP+ eyes, and tracked tumor free survival over the course of 50 weeks (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Consistent with the DepMap prediction, <italic>sox10</italic> inactivation markedly reduced tumor incidence, which likely reflects loss of proliferation. Only 3/96 (3.1%) fish with <italic>sox10</italic> knockouts initiated melanomas compared to the 24/94 fish (25.5%) from the NT condition that developed tumors (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>).

<p>Although <italic>sox10</italic> clearly reduced tumor initiation, we noted “escapers”. These tumors appeared morphologically very distinct compared to the <italic>sox10</italic> intact tumors. Specifically, these tumors were highly invasive with a mesenchymal morphology compared to the typical BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> melanoma (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). This observation raised the possibility that these tumors had undergone “phenotype switching”, a form of cell plasticity in which cells reversibly move between opposite extremes of proliferation versus invasive states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. In melanoma, the proliferative state is thought to be characterized by high expression of <italic>SOX10</italic>, whereas the mesenchymal, invasive state is characterized by high expression of <italic>SOX9</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. These two highly related transcription factors have seemingly opposite and possibly antagonistic roles in melanoma. <italic>In vitro</italic>, knockout of <italic>SOX10</italic> in a variety of human cell lines is associated with acquisition of a <italic>SOX9</italic><sup>hi</sup> state, which has been suggested to be linked to the invasive phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>.

These data raised the hypothesis that the more invasive tumors we see in our escaper fish was due to gain of <italic>sox9</italic> expression. To test this, we stained our <italic>sox10</italic> CRISPR tumors for <italic>sox9</italic> and discovered that 2 of the 3 <italic>sox10</italic> KO tumors markedly upregulated <italic>sox9</italic> relative to control tumors expressing NT gRNA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C and D</xref>). This data highlights that <italic>in vitro</italic> genetic studies such as the DepMap, which rely on proliferation as the readout, can mask more complex <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotypes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The ability to model genetic dependencies <italic>in vivo</italic> is one of the most important uses of model organisms. Forward genetic mutagenesis screens using compounds such as ENU or EMS led to the identification of many key developmental genes in organisms such as Drosophila, C. elegans, Saccharomyces, zebrafish, and many others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. These approaches have rapidly accelerated in the era of TALENs and CRISPR, readily allowing for knockout of nearly any gene in a wide variety of non-model organisms. Cre/Lox approaches have further augmented our ability to discern the cell-type specific effects of these genes, although these are still laborious and time consuming, especially in models such as mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Alongside these approaches have been remarkable advances in large scale sequencing of human tissues. GWAS-like efforts such as the UK Biobank and the US All of Us programs have identified thousands of germline variants (SNPs) that may be linked to interesting phenotype variation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. A conceptually similar approach is also happening in diseases such as cancer, in which efforts such as the TCGA, ICGC and DepMap have continued to unveil new potential somatic variants (SNVs) linked to cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Across these efforts, in both development and disease, the large number of candidate variants makes it challenging to connect these genotypes to phenotypes. This is especially acute in melanoma, where the large number of somatic variants generated by UV radiation leads to a high number of background mutations that may or may not have pathogenic function. Thus, there is a substantial need for <italic>in vivo</italic> models that allow for rapid and efficient modeling of candidate genes. Our development of the <italic>mitfa</italic>-Cas9 knockin line provides such a method. One major advantage is that phenotypes can be readily screened either in the F0 generation (as mosaics) or in the F1 generation (3 months later). The F1 fish in particular are advantageous, since they allow for highly efficient biallelic knockout of the gene of interest, allowing for very quick identification of genes that only have recessive phenotypes (i.e., <italic>albino</italic>). On a per gene basis, this saves well over 3 months of work compared to germline knockouts and uses vastly fewer animals since all F1 animals (even those for recessive alleles) are informative. Additionally, this model eliminates the issue of inbreeding, promoting healthier genetic lines and facilitating the potential for outcrossing with any available fish line. Because we demonstrate that the Cas9 is completely restricted to the melanocyte lineage, with no detectable off-target expression, this easily allows us to discern the melanocyte-specific effect of pleiotropic genes very efficiently.</p>
<p>One interesting observation of our melanoma studies is evidence that loss of melanoma genetic dependencies like <italic>SOX10</italic> (as suggested by the human DepMap data) can still lead to tumors, albeit with very different biological behaviors. In both the fish and in the human samples we analyzed, loss of <italic>SOX10</italic> leads to acquisition of a <italic>SOX9</italic><sup>hi</sup> state instead<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. <italic>SOX9</italic> is increasingly recognized to be a potent mediator of tumor cell invasiveness, which is what we observe in our fish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. One implication of this finding is that clinical targeting of transcription factors like <italic>SOX10</italic>, long considered an ideal therapeutic approach, could lead to unexpected outcomes in which tumors might proliferate less but become more invasive or resistant to therapy. Whether this phenomenon of <italic>SOX10/SOX9</italic> switching is a general phenomenon, or specific to that class of TFs, remains to be determined. However, a similar phenomenon has been observed for <italic>MITF</italic>, another melanocytic TF, suggesting this idea of TF switching needs to be more thoroughly explored in the future<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Finally, while our studies clearly focused on the melanocyte lineage, highly similar approaches could be taken for virtually any cellular lineage in which master regulators or markers are known. Given the large number of already identified promoter/enhancer fragments in the zebrafish, this would be an important extension of our system to study gene variants in the context of development and other diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Our approach has several limitations that may need to be addressed in future studies. Due to the constitutive nature of the Cas9, we have little control over the timing of its expression. Because it is knocked into the endogenous <italic>mitfa</italic> locus, the expression of Cas9 will vary with the endogenous regulation of that gene. In future iterations of this general approach, swapping the Cas9 for an inducible version would allow for better timed knockout of genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. Because <italic>mitfa</italic> itself is expressed in melanoblasts, melanophores and xanthophores during different stages of development, choosing a promoter (e.g. PMEL) that is more tightly restricted to melanocytes may be advantageous. Finally, although our system was relatively efficient, we still did not see 100% knockout. This may reflect that it is relatively easy to bypass the CRISPR lesion in an exon with an in-frame mutation. The use of multiple sgRNAs, or sgRNAs that target promoter regions, rather than exons, could further augment efficiency of knockout. Alternatively, instead of targeting DNA, we could consider using RNA targeting CRISPR enzymes. Recent work has shown that RNA degradation induced by Cas13 works in zebrafish and may allow for more nuanced knockdown rather than knockout of a given candidate gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. This may especially have advantages in the context of melanoma, where genes are commonly dysregulated rather than completely knocked out. We envision it would be relatively straightforward to knock Cas13 into the locus of interest using an analogous approach to the one we have taken here.</p>

<title>Zebrafish husbandry and ethics statement</title>
<p>All zebrafish experiments adhered to institutional animal protocols and were conducted in compliance with approved procedures. Fish stocks were maintained at a temperature of 28.5 °C, under 14:10 light:dark cycles, with pH set at 7.4, and salinity-controlled conditions. The zebrafish were fed a standard diet comprising brine shrimp followed by Zeigler pellets. Approval for the animal protocols outlined in this manuscript was obtained from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), under protocol number 12-05-008. Anesthesia was conducted using Tricaine (4 g/l, Syndel, Ferndale, WA, USA) from a stock of 4 g/l and diluted to 0.16 mg/ml. Adult zebrafish of both sexes were equally employed in all experiments. Embryos, collected through natural mating, were incubated in E3 buffer (5 mM NaCl, 0.17 mM KCl, 0.33 mM CaCl2, 0.33 mM MgSO4) at 28.5 °C. The wild-type strain used was Tropical 5D Zebrafish (T5D)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>GeneWeld plasmid construction</title>
<p>A combination of restriction enzyme digestion and HiFi cloning was used to construct the GeneWeld pPRISM-nCas9n, γcry1:BFP vector for targeted integration to isolate an nls-Cas9-nls knockin. A 765 bp fragment containing the Porcine teschovirus-1 polyprotein 2A peptide sequence was amplified from the pPRISM-2A-Cre, γcry1:BFP vector (Addgene #117789) with primers Ori-F and 2A-R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. The nCas9n cDNA was amplified from the expression vector pT3TS-nCas9n (Addgene #46757) with primers Cas9-F and Cas9-R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. A KpnI/SpeI fragment containing the pPRISM-2A-Cre, gcry1:BFP vector backbone was assembled with the 2A and nCas9n PCR amplicons using the NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Cloning Kit (NEB # E5520S) following the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
<p>Homology arms were designed as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Briefly, 48bp homology arms complementary to the <italic>mitfa</italic> target site were designed using GTagHD (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genesculpt.org/gtaghd/">http://www.genesculpt.org/gtaghd/</ext-link>) for the pPRISM GeneWeld plasmid series. The two pairs of complementary oligos can be found in Table S1. 5’ and 3’ arms were cloned sequentially into the pPRISM-nCas9n, γcry1:BFP vector. The 3’ homology arm oligos were annealed and cloned into the vector using the BspQI restriction site as previously described. Due to the multiple BfuAI sites within Cas9, instead of using BfuAI restriction cloning, we alternatively used in-fusion cloning (Takara Bio) to insert a gBlock (IDT) containing the 5’ homology arm into the pPRISM-nCas9n, gcry1:BFP vector. Primers and gblock sequence used for cloning are listed in Table S1. The 5’ and 3’ homology arms were sequenced with primers 5’homologycheckF and R3’_pgtag_seq, respectively.</p>

<title>Injection of GeneWeld reagents</title>
<p>Injections of GeneWeld reagents were performed on one-cell stage embryos. We used the Alt-R CRISPR-Cas9 system (IDT) for the initial knock-in of nCas9n, γcry1:BFP to the <italic>mitfa</italic> locus. In brief, 100 μM tracrRNA (IDT 1075928) was mixed at a 1:1 ratio with either <italic>mitfa</italic> crRNA or universal crRNA then incubated at 95 °C for 5 min. Recombinant Cas9 (IDT 1081059) was incubated with both sgRNAs for 10 min at 37 °C to form the RNP complex. The GeneWeld pPRISM-5’mitfaHom-nCas9n, gcry1:BFP-3’mitfaHom plasmid was then added to the injection mix along with phenol red (Sigma-Aldrich P0290). The final concentrations injected into the embryos were: 75 pg/nl Cas9, 12.5 pg/nl <italic>mitfa</italic> sgRNA, 12.5 pg/nl Universal sgRNA, and 5 pg/nl pPRISM plasmid.</p>

<title>RNA-FISH HCR<italic/></title>
<p>We adapted the HCR protocol from Ibarra-Garcia-Padilla et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. Briefly, embryos were collected and treated with 0.0045% 1-phenyl 2-thiourea (PTU) (Sigma-Aldrich) after 24 hpf to block pigmentation. Embryos were harvested at 72 hpf and fixed in 4% PFA (Santa Cruz) for 24 hrs at 4 °C. Embryos were then washed with PBS and dehydrated/permeabilized with a series of MeOH (Millipore) washes. Embryos were rehydrated with a series of MeOH/PBST washes, permeabilized with acetone (Fisher Scientific) and incubated with Proteinase K (Millipore) for 30 min. This was followed by further fixation with 4% PFA. Embryos were pre-hybridized in probe hybridization buffer (PHB) before incubating them with HCR probes in PHB at concentration of 20nM. Probe sequences for <italic>mitfa</italic> and Cas9 can be found in Table S1. Embryos were washed with probe wash buffer before being pre-amplified with probe amplification buffer (PAB). Following pre-amplification, amplifier hairpins were thawed, snap-cooled, and mixed with PAB to a concentration of 36 nM. Embryos were incubated in the hairpin solution followed by washes with 5×SSCT and 1× PBST. Embryos were stained with 2 µg/mL DAPI in PBST and mounted on glass slides.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Perlee et al. sought to generate a zebrafish line where CRISPR-based gene editing is exclusively limited to the melanocyte lineage, allowing assessment of cell-type restricted gene knockouts. To achieve this, they knocked in Cas9 to the endogenous mitfa locus, as mitfa is a master regulator of melanocyte development. The authors use multiple candidate genes - albino, sox10, tuba1a, ptena/ptenb, tp53 - to demonstrate their system induces lineage-restricted gene editing. This method allows researchers to bypass embryonic lethal and non-cell autonomous phenotypes emerging from whole body knockout (sox10, tuba1a), drive directed phenotypes, such as depigmentation (albino), and induce lineage-specific tumors, such as melanomas (ptena/ptenb, tp53, when accompanied with expression of BRAFV600E). While the genetic approaches are solid, the argued increase in efficiency of this model compared to current tools was untested, and therefore unable to be assessed. Furthermore, the mechanistic explanations proposed to underlie their phenotypes are mostly unfounded, as discussed further in the Weaknesses section. Despite these concerns, there is still a clear use for this genetic methodology and its implementation will be of value to many in vivo researchers.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strongest component of this manuscript is the genetic control offered by the mitfa:Cas9 system and the ability to make stable, lineage-specific knockouts in zebrafish. This is exemplified by the studies of tuba1a, where the authors nicely show non-cell autonomous mechanisms have obfuscated the role of this gene in melanocyte development. In addition, the mitfa:Cas9 system is elegantly straightforward and can be easily implemented in many labs. Mostly, the figures are clean, controls are appropriate, and phenotypes are reproducible. The invented method is a welcomed addition to the arsenal of genetic tools used in zebrafish.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The major weaknesses of the manuscript include the overly bold descriptions of the value of the model and the superficial mechanistic explanations for each biological vignette.</p>
<p>The authors argue that a major advantage of this system is its high efficiency. However, no direct comparison is made with other tools that achieve the same genetic control, such as MAZERATI. This is a missed opportunity to provide researchers the ability to evaluate these two similar genetic approaches. In addition, Fig.1 shows that not all melanocytes express Cas9. This is a major caveat that goes unaddressed. It is of paramount importance to understand the percentage of mitfa+ cells that express Cas9. The histology shown is unclear and too zoomed out of a scale to make any insightful conclusions, especially in Fig.S1. It would also be beneficial to see data regarding Cas9 expression in adult melanocytes, which are distinct from embryonic melanocytes in zebrafish. Moreover, this system still requires the injection of a plasmid encoding gRNAs of interest, which will yield mosaicism. A prime example of this discrepancy is in Fig.6, where sox10 is clearly still present in &quot;sox10 KO&quot; tumors.</p>
<p>The authors argue that their model allows rapid manipulation of melanocyte gene expression. Enthusiasm for the speed of this model is diminished by minimal phenotypes in the F0, as exemplified in Fig.2. Although the authors say &gt;90% of fish have loss of pigmentation, this is misleading as the phenotype is a very weak, partial loss. Only in the F1 generation do robust phenotypes emerge, which takes &gt;6 months to generate. How this is more efficient than other tools that currently exist is unclear and should be discussed in more detail.</p>
<p>In Figure 3, the authors find that melanocyte-specific knockout of sox10 leads to only a 25% reduction in melanocytes in the F1 generation. This is in contradiction to prior literature cited describing sox10 as indispensable for melanocyte development. In addition, the authors argue that sox10 is required for melanocyte regeneration. This claim is not accurate, as &gt;50% of melanocytes killed upon neocuproine treatment can regenerate. This data would indicate that sox10 is required for only a subset of melanocytes to develop (Fig.3C) and for only a subset to regenerate (Fig.3G). This is an interesting finding that is not discussed or interrogated further.</p>
<p>Tumor induction by this model is weak, as indicated by the tumor curves in Figs.5,6. This might be because these fish are mitfa heterozygous. Whereas the avoidance of mitfa overexpression driven by other models including MAZERATI is a benefit of this system, the effect of mitfa heterozygosity on tumor incidence was untested. This is an essential question unaddressed in the manuscript.</p>
<p>In Fig.6, the authors recapitulate previous findings with their model, showing sox10 KO inhibits tumor onset. The tumors that do develop are argued to be highly invasive, have mesenchymal morphology, and undergo phenotypic switching from sox10 to sox9 expression. The data presented do not sufficiently support these claims. The histology is not readily suggestive of invasive, mesenchymal melanomas. Sox10 is still present in many cells and sox9 expression is only found in a small subset (&lt;20%). Whether sox10-null cells are the ones expressing sox9 is untested. If sox9-mediated phenotypic switching is the major driver of these tumors, the authors would need to knockout sox9 and sox10 simultaneously and test whether these &quot;rare&quot; types of tumors still emerge. Additional histological and genetic evaluation is required to make the conclusions presented in Fig.6. It feels like a missed opportunity that the authors did not attempt to study genes of unknown contribution to melanoma with their system.</p>
<p>Overall, this manuscript introduces a solid method to the arsenal of zebrafish genetic tools but falls short of justifying itself as a more efficient and robust approach than what currently exists. The mechanisms provided to explain observed phenotypes are tenuous. Nonetheless, the mitfa:Cas9 approach will certainly be of value to many in vivo biologists and lays the foundation to generate similar methods using other tissue-specific regulators and other Cas proteins.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript describes a genetic tool utilizing mutant mitfa-Cas9 expressing zebrafish to knockout genes to analyze their function in melanocytes in a range of assays from developmental biology to tumorigenesis. Overall, the data are convincing and the authors cover potential caveats from their model that might impact its utility for future work.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors do an excellent job of characterizing several gene deletions that show the specificity and applicability of the genetic mitfa-Cas9 zebrafish to studying melanocytes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Variability across animals not fully analyzed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Perlee et al. present a method for generating cell-type restricted knockouts in zebrafish, focusing on melanocytes. For this method, the authors knock-in a Cas9 encoding sequence into the mitfa locus. This mitfaCas9 line has restricted Cas9 expression, allowing the authors to generate melanocyte-specific knockouts rapidly by follow-up injection of sgRNA expressing transposon vectors.</p>
<p>The paper presents some interesting vignettes to illustrate the utility of their approach. These include 1) a derivation of albino mutant fish as a demonstration of the method's efficiency, 2) an interrogation and novel description of tuba1a as a potential non-autonomous contributor to melanocyte dispersion, and 3) the generation of sox10 deficient melanoma tumors that show &quot;escape&quot; of sox10 loss through upregulation of sox9. The latter two examples highlight the usefulness of cell-type targeted knockouts (Body-wide sox10 and tuba1a loss elicit developmental defects). Additionally, the tumor models involve highly multiplexed sgRNAs for tumor initiation which is nicely facilitated by the stable Cas9.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The approach is clever and could prove very useful for studying melanocytes and other cell types. As the authors hint at in their discussion, this approach would become even more powerful with the generation of other Cas9-restricted lineages so a single sgRNA construct can be screened across many lineages rapidly (or many sgRNA and fish lines screened combinatorially).</p>
<p>The biological findings used to demonstrate the power of the approach are interesting in their own right. If it proves true, tuba1a's non-autonomous effects on melanosome dispersion are striking, and this example demonstrates very nicely how one could use Perlee et al.'s approach to search for other non-autonomous mechanisms systematically. Similarly, the observation of the sox9 escape mechanism with sox10 loss is a beautiful demonstration of the relevance of SOX10/SOX9's reciprocal regulation in vivo. This system would be a very nice model for further interrogating mechanisms/interventions surrounding Sox10 in melanoma.</p>
<p>Finally, the figure presentation is very nice. This work involves complex genetic approaches including multiple fish generations and multiplexed construct injections. The vector diagrams and breeding schemes in the paper make everything very clear/&quot;grok-able,&quot; and the paper was enjoyable to read.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The mitfa-driven GFP on their sgRNA-expressing cassette is elegant, but it makes one wonder why the endogenous knock-in is necessary. It would strengthen the motivation of the work if the authors could detail the potential advantages and disadvantages of their system compared to expressing Cas9 with a lineage-specific promoter from a transposon in their introduction or discussion.</p>
<p>Related to the above - is mitfa haplosufficient? If the mitfaCas9/+ fish have any notable phenotypes, it would be worth noting for others interested in using this approach to study melanoma and pigmentation.</p>
<p>A core weakness (and also potential strength) of the system is that introduced edits will always be non-clonal (Fig 2H/I). The activity of individual sgRNAs should always be validated in the absence of any noticeable phenotype to interpret a negative result. Additionally, caution should be taken when interpreting results from rare events involving positive outgrowth (like tumorogenesis) to account for the fact many cells in the population might not have biallelic null alleles (i.e., 100% of the gene product removed).</p>
<p>Along those lines: in my opinion, the tuba1a results are the most provocative finding in the paper, but they lack key validation. With respect to cutting activity, the Alt-R and transgenic sgRNA expression approaches are not directly comparable. Since there is no phenotype in the melanocyte specific tuba1a knockouts, the authors must confirm high knockout efficiency with this set of reagents before making the claim there is a non-autonomous phenotype. This can be achieved with GFP+ sorting and NGS like they performed with their albino melanocytes.</p>
<p>The whole-body tuba1a knockout phenotype is expected to be pleiotropic, and this expectation might mask off-target effects. Controls for knockout specificity should be included. For instance, confidence in the claims would greatly increase if the dispersed melanosome phenotype could be recovered with guide-resistant tuba1a re-expression and if melanocyte-restricted tuba1a re-expression failed to rescue. As a less definitive but adequate alternative, the authors could also test if another guide or a morpholino against tuba1a phenocopies the described Alt-R edited fish.</p>
<p>I have similar questions about the sox10 escapers, but these suggestions are less critical for supporting the authors claims (especially given the nice staining). Are the sox10 tumors relatively clonal with respect to sox10 mutations? And are the sox10 tumor mutations mostly biallelic frameshifts or potential missense mutations/single mutations that might not completely remove activity? I am particularly curious as SOX10 doesn't seem to be completely absent (and is still very high in some nuclei) in the immunohistochemistry.</p>
