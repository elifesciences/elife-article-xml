<title>Abstract</title><sec>
<title>Objective</title>
<p>Synovium is home to immune and stromal cell types that orchestrate inflammation following a joint injury; in particular, macrophages are central protagonists in this process. We sought to define the cellular and temporal dynamics of the synovial immune niche in a mouse model of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA), and to identify stromal-immune crosstalk mechanisms that coordinate macrophage function and phenotype.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Design</title>
<p>We induced PTOA in mice using a non-invasive tibial compression model of anterior cruciate ligament rupture (ACLR). Single cell RNA-seq and flow cytometry were used to assess immune cell populations in healthy (Sham) and injured (7d and 28d post-ACLR) synovium. Characterization of synovial macrophage polarization states was performed, alongside computational modeling of macrophage differentiation, as well as implicated transcriptional regulators and stromal-immune communication axes.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>Immune cell types are broadly represented in healthy synovium, but experience drastic expansion and speciation in PTOA, most notably in the macrophage portion. We identified several polarization states of macrophages in synovium following joint injury, underpinned by distinct transcriptomic signatures, and regulated in part by stromal-derived macrophage colony-stimulating factor signaling. The transcription factors Pu.1, Cebpα, Cebpβ, and Jun were predicted to control differentiation of systemically derived monocytes into pro-inflammatory synovial macrophages.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We defined different synovial macrophage subpopulations present in healthy and injured mouse synovium. Nuanced characterization of the distinct functions, origins, and disease kinetics of macrophage subtypes in PTOA will be critical for targeting these highly versatile cells for therapeutic purposes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Arthritis encompasses a host of disease manifestations in joints, characterized in part by aberrant crosstalk between stromal and immune cells, with a central unifying feature of disease being inflammation. Inflammation is driven by a diverse and highly plastic set of resident and infiltrating immune cells that can speciate into distinct functional phenotypes and engage in reciprocal crosstalk with stromal cells. While a physiological inflammatory response is integral to restoring tissue homeostasis after insults such as trauma or infection, aberrant immune cell responses underpin chronic inflammation and its associated pathological effects in many tissue contexts. For instance, early studies of diet-induced obesity in mice showed recruitment of pro-inflammatory macrophages to adipose tissue from circulating monocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. In systemic sclerosis, interactions between distinct macrophage subsets and fibroblasts drive them to adopt pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic phenotypes, respectively, that underpin disease progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Specifically, osteopontin produced by pathologic <italic>SPP1+</italic> macrophages promotes production of type I collagen by skin fibroblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Fibroblasts in sclerotic lesions produce high levels of TLR4 that drive persistent fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The synovium is a heterogenous connective tissue in joints, populated with immune cells, vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells, fibroblasts, adipocytes, and other mesenchymal-lineage stromal cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Synovium is increasingly recognized as a principal regulator of intra-articular inflammation in osteoarthritis (OA), given its highly vascularized nature and abundance of resident immune cells compared to tissues such as meniscus and cartilage. Synovial inflammation, now appreciated as a pathologic driver of OA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, is characterized by expansion of resident synovial fibroblasts and immune cells as well as influx of systemically derived immune cells; however, we have a limited understanding of the cellular, molecular, and temporal mechanisms of these interactions, and how they differ or correspond across forms of arthritis.</p>
<p>The specific roles of distinct activated immune cell populations in orchestrating synovial inflammation have been well characterized in the context of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, providing valuable insights of disease pathogenesis and advancing therapeutic efficacies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Our understanding of pathologic immune cell landscape in post-traumatic OA (PTOA) synovium and its contribution to inflammation is only in its infancy, however.</p>
<p>Whether macrophage expansion is a necessary mechanism to restore homeostasis or a deleterious pathological manifestation is still controversial. Macrophage ablation in mice by clodronate liposomes yielded generally favorable OA outcomes, including reduced osteophyte formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, however pharmacogenetic macrophage depletion using the MaFIA mouse resulted in systemic inflammation, exacerbated immune influx into the joint, with no attenuation of OA severity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Indeed, synovial macrophages play critical physiological functions such as the timely clearance of apoptotic cells, which is impaired in OA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. In a model of inflammatory arthritis, Huang et al showed that resolution requires the suppression of pro-inflammatory, systemically-derived F4/80<sup>hi</sup> MHC Class II<sup>+</sup> macrophages and that macrophages with a resident-like phenotype promote inflammatory resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. As such, dissecting macrophage identity, origin, and function in arthritis remains critical to better understanding disease etiology.</p>
<p>In this study, we employed a non-invasive anterior cruciate ligament rupture (ACLR) model of PTOA that recapitulates traumatic joint injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> to dissect the dynamic immune cell environment in PTOA synovium, with a focus on the early post-injury period. Importantly, the ACLR model avoids the need for surgery and its confounding effects on synovial inflammation. We utilized single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry to identify distinct immune cell types in healthy and PTOA synovia, with a focus on macrophages, and identified potential stromal-derived crosstalk mechanisms responsible for emergence of pro-inflammatory macrophage subtypes.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Mice</title>
<p>Male and female mice on a C57Bl/6 background were used for all experiments. Mice were housed in ventilated cages of up to five animals, given chow food and water, on a 12 h light/dark cycle. At time of injury, mice were 12-14 weeks old, and were euthanized by CO2 asphyxia. We induced PTOA using a previously reported and characterized model involving non-invasive rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACLR) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Sham mice were given anesthesia and analgesic, but not subjected to injury. All protocols were conducted in accordance with approved IACUC protocols at the University of Michigan.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Perfusion of vasculature</title>
<p>To perfuse blood, mice were euthanized then washed with 70% ethanol. The thoracic cavity was opened through the diaphragm, and ribs were cut bilaterally to open the anterior ribcage, which was held with a hemostat. A butterfly needle was injected into the left ventricle and secured. A small incision was made in the right atrium to allow blood to escape, and the mouse was positioned to facilitate drainage from the thoracic cavity. The butterfly needle was connected to a perfusion pump filled with sterile PBS, which was perfused at a rate of 200 mL/h for 15 minutes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Tissue harvest and digestion</title>
<p>Synovium was dissected from the medial, lateral, and anterior compartment of the knee, including the fat pad, as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Synovia were digested for 35 minutes in a 1.5 mL mixture containing DMEM with 400 μg/mL collagenase IV, 400 μg/mL liberase, 400 μg/mL DNaseI. 10 seconds of vortexing was performed at 0, 15 and 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Whole joints were isolated and digested in two stages, according to a detailed, published protocol from Leale <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Hindlimbs from the mouse were removed by cutting the proximal leg muscles and dislocating at the hip. Muscles from around the knee joint were trimmed, taking care not to disturb the joint capsule, using a dissection microscope. PBS was used to keep the tissues moist throughout dissection. The knee joint was dislocated at the femoral and tibial growth plates to obtain just the whole joint, which was then transferred to a petri dish for mincing with a scalpel. Minced joint tissue was subjected to 30 minutes of digestion, shaking at 90 rpm at 37°C. This first digestion, to yield the soft tissue fraction, used a 5 mL mixture comprised of 1% collagenase IV (w/v) and 400 µg/mL DNaseI in DMEM containing 5% fetal calf serum. After 30 minutes, the digestate was passed over a 70 µm strainer to collect undigested tissue. Undigested tissue was rinsed with DMEM and 5% fetal calf serum, then digested for a further 90 minutes at 90 rpm and 37°C. This second digestion, to yield the hard tissue fraction, used a 5 mL mixture comprised of 2% collagenase II (w/v) and 400 µg/mL DNaseI in DMEM with 5% fetal calf serum. At the conclusion of soft and hard tissue digests, single cell suspensions were washed in DMEM containing 5% fetal calf serum then subjected to red blood cell lysis with cold ACK lysis buffer before proceeding to flow cytometry staining.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Flow cytometry</title>
<p>After digestion of synovium or whole joints, single cell suspensions were washed with FACS buffer (PBS containing 2% fetal calf serum and 1 mM EDTA) and 1 µL of FcX TruStain PLUS (Biolegend) was added to each sample. Cells were stained for 30 minutes at 4°C in the dark using fluorescently conjugated antibodies (Supplementary Table 1). After staining, cells were washed with FACS buffer and passed through 35 µm strainers into tubes for flow cytometry. TOPRO3 dye was added for determination of viability. An unstained control was included for all experiments, as well as single-stained control tubes and fluorescence-minus-one tubes for setting negative and positive populations for each color. Flow cytometry was performed on a BD LSRFortessa machine using FACSDiva software for data acquisition.</p>
<p>To visualize high-parameter flow cytometry data in two dimensions, dimensionality reduction was performed using the t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) algorithm in FlowJo v10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. The automatic learning configuration was used (opt-SNE) and parameters were set to: iterations 1000; perplexity 30; learning rate 5498; KNN algorithm, Exact (vantage point tree); gradient algorithm, Barnes-Hut. All analysis was performed in FlowJo v10 (BD/TreeStar).</p>

<title>Single-cell analysis of synovial immune cells</title>
<p>Data for the scRNA-seq analysis of synovial immune cells in the ACLR model of PTOA was drawn from GSE211584. Two biological replicates, each comprised of a male and a female synovium, were present for each of the following conditions: Sham (healthy, uninjured), 7d ACLR, and 28d ACLR. Quality control and filtering were performed using Seurat (R, v4.1.0) as described in the original publication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. As shown in Figure S1A, immune cell clusters (2, 5 and 8) were computationally subset from all synovial cells. Re-clustering and non-linear dimensionality reduction using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) was undertaken with dims = 1:35 and res = 0.2. Cluster identities were designated based on the expression of marker genes using the <italic>FindAllMarkers</italic> function and using the Cluster Identity PRedictor tool (CIPR) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Due to the low abundance of certain immune cell types and difficulty resolving between subsets of cell types, the <italic>CellSelector</italic> tool in Seurat was used to designate cluster identities in a supervised manner based on known marker genes.</p>

<sec id="s2f">
<title>Recapitulation of publicly available datasets</title>
<p>We searched the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database using the search terms ‘arthritis’ and ‘synovium’. Datasets from <italic>mus musculus</italic> that did not exclude hematopoietic cells were retrieved and read into RStudio using Seurat. Quality control and filtering were undertaken faithful to the parameters and details provided in the originating publication methods. Where parameters were not provided, defaults were used: <italic>min.cells</italic> = 200, <italic>min.features</italic> = 200, <italic>max.features</italic> = 90<sup>th</sup> percentile cutoff, <italic>mito.ratio</italic> &lt; 10%. Counts were normalized with the <italic>NormalizeData</italic> function using the <italic>LogNormalize</italic> method, then integrated using RPCA with <italic>variable features</italic> = 3000. Recapitulations for each dataset can be found in Figures S2 (Culemann <italic>et al</italic>), S3 (Sebastian <italic>et al</italic>) and S4 (Muench <italic>et al</italic>).</p>
<p>GSE134420, a scRNA-seq dataset produced by Culemann <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, was comprised of sorted CD45+ CD11b+ Ly6G-cells (macrophages/monocytes) from hindpaw synovia of mice subjected to the K/BxN serum transfer arthritis model of RA. No parameters were provided for quality control, so the default parameters above were used. For non-linear dimensionality reduction with UMAP, seven clusters emerged (dims = 1:30, res = 0.15). One cluster was identified as stromal cells (cluster 6), so was removed. Remaining clusters (immune only: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) were computationally subset and re-clustered using dims = 1:30 and res = 0.15, yielding five clusters, each with unique markers broadly corresponding to the original publication, although the Stmn1+ and Acp5+ macrophages fell into the same cluster.</p>
<p>GSE200843, a scRNA-seq dataset produced by Sebastian <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, was comprised of sorted CD45+ cells (all hematopoietic) from whole knee joints of mice subjected to the ACLR model of PTOA. Data were filtered using min.features &gt; 500 and min.cells = 5, in accord with the original publication. We further excluded the top 10% of cells with the highest nFeatures using nFeatures &lt; 4500 and percent.mt &lt; 10, then normalized data using the <italic>LogNormalize</italic> method, and integrated data across all samples using reciprocal PCA, with variable features = 3000. Non-linear dimensionality reduction utilized dims = 1:30 and res = 0.04 to yield seven clusters. A stromal cluster (cluster 4) and an erythrocyte cluster (cluster 6) were detected in the ensuing object, based on marker gene expression. All other clusters (immune only: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5) were then computationally subset and re-clustered using dims = 1:25 and res = 0.07 to yield seven clusters.</p>
<p>GSE184609, a scRNA-seq dataset produced by Muench <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, was comprised of sorted live cells from hindpaw synovia of mice subjected to the GPI-induced model of RA. The authors originally used dims = 1:20 for non-linear dimensionality reduction, and filtered based on nFeature and percent.mt cutoffs; however, the values for cutoffs and resolution were not provided. To recapitulate their data most faithfully, we used dims = 1:30 and res = 0.4, and obtained 21 clusters, representing all live sorted cells from the hindpaw synovium. Based on marker gene expression and cluster identity prediction by CIPR, we excluded non-immune cell clusters (1, 3, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20) and computationally subset only the immune cells (0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 15, 16, 17). Immune cells were re-clustered using dims = 1:30 and res = 0.15, yielding eight clusters.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="s2g">
<title>Integration of datasets</title>
<p>The recapitulated immune objects for each dataset above were integrated using reciprocal PCA in Seurat with variable features = 3000. Non-linear dimensionality reduction was performed using dims = 1:30 and res = 0.2 to generate an integrated UMAP plot for all datasets. The resulting ten clusters were annotated using <italic>FindAllMarkers</italic> and CIPR. Mast cells, due to their very low abundance, were clustered separately in a supervised manner using <italic>CellSelector</italic>, based on expression of marker genes <italic>Il4</italic>, <italic>Kit</italic>, <italic>Fcer1a</italic> and <italic>Mcpt4</italic>.</p>

<sec id="s2h">
<title>Analysis of macrophages in OA and RA datasets</title>
<p>To compare macrophages and monocytes between disease states, two clusters were computationally subset from the integrated object for all datasets (the macrophage and monocyte clusters). Non-linear dimensionality reduction was used to generate a UMAP with dims = 1:20 and res = 0.05, containing three clusters that were annotated using <italic>FindAllMarkers</italic> output. To assess differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the macrophage cluster between RA (Culemann and Muench) and PTOA (Sebastian and Knights), <italic>FindMarkers</italic> was used. First, macrophages from control vs RA disease, and from control vs PTOA disease were compared to yield DEGs. Using a cutoff of padj &lt; 0.05, the DEGs from both control vs disease comparisons were then compared for overlapping genes and their directionality. To assess differentially regulated pathways in RA or PTOA macrophages, we used PantherDB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> and the Gene Ontology database. First, DEGs unique to the RA vs control comparison, and unique to the PTOA vs control comparison, were separately entered into PantherDB for statistical overrepresentation analysis (Gene Ontology: Biological Pathways). To assess conserved pathways in RA and PTOA macrophages, we took DEGs common to both comparisons and with the same directionality and performed statistical overrepresentation testing using GO: Biological Pathways and GO: Molecular Function on PantherDB. All pathway analyses were performed using Fisher’s Exact testing and False Discovery Rate (FDR) was calculated to generate adjusted <italic>P</italic> values (padj). Data were expressed as bubble plots using <italic>ggplot2</italic> v3.4.2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2i">
<title>Macrophage clustering and trajectory analysis</title>
<p>Myeloid cell clusters from our scRNA-seq data were computationally subset from all immune cells in Seurat, then were exported into Monocle3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> for re-clustering to uncover subsets and perform trajectory analysis. Mast cells, DCs and granulocytes were removed from the myeloid object, leaving only monocytes and macrophages, to mitigate the confounding variance from disparate cell types. The monocytes and macrophages were clustered with 15 dimensions, and <italic>cluster_cells()</italic> parameters of resolution = 2.5e-4 and k = 11. For differentiation trajectory analysis, default <italic>learn_graph</italic> arguments were applied to generate a trajectory trail map, which robustly sequestered into two partitions. Differential gene expression analysis and functional pathway analysis were then performed on the three clusters confined to the first partition, containing cells with hallmarks of resident macrophages. Pairwise differential expression analyses were performed with the basal resident, resident-like A, and resident-like B macrophages clusters using <italic>FindMarkers</italic> in Seurat. To assess enriched pathways in each of these three clusters, DEGs from the prior pairwise analyses were used for statistical overrepresentation testing in PantherDB.

<title>Diverse immune cell types are present in healthy and injured synovium</title>
<p>Having characterized the stromal niche of synovium in PTOA and defined distinct functional subsets of fibroblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, we sought to understand the immune profile of healthy and injured synovium. Using our published scRNA-seq data of synovial cells from Sham, 7d ACLR or 28d ACLR mice (GSE211584), we computationally subset only immune cells based on their cluster identity and verified their positivity for <italic>Ptprc</italic> expression (encoding CD45) and negativity for <italic>Pdgfra</italic> expression (encoding PDGFRα) (Fig S1A-B). In the absence of stromal and vascular cells that would otherwise confound variance, re-clustering was performed on the immune cells, revealing a diverse profile of innate and adaptive cell types, including monocytes and macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), T cells, B cells, mast cells, granulocytes, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and natural killer (NK) cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>, Fig S1C). Abundance of synovial immune cells greatly increased acutely after injury (7d ACLR), with a degree of resolution occurring by 28d ACLR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B-C</xref>). Macrophages, unsurprisingly, predominated both numerically and proportionally in healthy and injured synovium, with various subsets of T cells and DCs comprising most of the remaining cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>, Fig S1D-F). To assess whether the immune cell types observed in scRNA-seq based on their transcriptomic signatures were detectable at the functional protein level using surface markers, we employed multi-color flow cytometry. Indeed, all major groups of immune cells were identified within the CD45+ pool of synovial cells, based on their surface marker and light scatter profiles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D-E</xref>).</p>

<title>Integration of joint immune cells from mouse scRNA-seq datasets</title>
<p>Given the recent proliferation of studies seeking to describe the immune landscape in murine arthritis models, there is a strong rationale for harmonizing this publicly available data to characterize similarities and differences. We obtained four published scRNA-seq datasets for integration and further analysis of the immune cell niche: Culemann <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> (GSE134420; sorted CD45+ CD11b+ Ly6G-cells from hindpaw synovia of mice subjected to the K/BxN serum transfer arthritis model of inflammatory arthritis/RA); Sebastian <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> (GSE200843; sorted CD45+ cells from whole knee joints of mice subjected to the ACLR model of PTOA); our data, from Knights <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> (GSE211584; knee synovium from mice subjected to the ACLR model of PTOA); and Muench <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> (GSE184609; sorted live cells from hindpaw synovia of mice subjected to the GPI-induced model of inflammatory arthritis/RA).</p>
<p>Datasets were obtained from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus then recapitulated in accordance with parameters provided in the Methods sections of each paper, including computational removal of any non-immune cell clusters (Fig S2-S4). The resulting immune cell-only objects were integrated using reciprocal PCA and assigned identities based on known marker genes and alignment to published transcriptomic signatures of immune cell types using the Cluster Identity PRedictor (CIPR) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A-B</xref>, Fig S5A). Monocytes, macrophages, DCs, neutrophils, B cells, T and NK cells, mast cells, and proliferating immune cells were all detected, and the same, or very similar, cell types clustered closely together across datasets following integration (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A-D</xref>). Likely owing to the disparate models (inflammatory arthritis/RA or PTOA), anatomical locations (knee synovium, whole knee joint, or hindpaw synovium), and experimental approaches (eg. sorting only monocytes and macrophages), certain cell types predominated in some datasets but were largely absent in others. This was most strikingly evident with the neutrophil clusters (Neut-1, -2 and -3) present primarily in the Sebastian and Muench datasets, the latter of which modeled rheumatoid arthritis in which neutrophils are known to play a larger role<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. One explanation for high neutrophil abundance in these datasets may be bone marrow contamination, given that these studies digested the whole knee joint (Sebastian) or the whole hindpaw (Muench). We detected a high abundance of neutrophils in digested whole knee joints by flow cytometry - approximately half of all CD45+ cells (Fig S6A). This number was not reduced when mice were systemically perfused to clear the vasculature, suggesting that neutrophils in the joint digest are not derived from local blood vessels. Comparison of the gene signatures of neutrophil clusters 1, 2 and 3 to publicly available neutrophil datasets support that these cells, particularly Neut-1, are more likely bone marrow-derived than true intra-articular tissue neutrophils (Fig S6B-C, Supplementary Table 2).</p>

<p>CellChat analysis of outgoing signaling patterns for each cluster in PTOA and RA highlighted monocytes as dominant drivers of signaling with a high degree of commonality between diseases (Fig S8). Macrophages and osteoclasts, on the other hand, exhibited more disparate outgoing signaling programs between PTOA and RA. To better understand transcriptomic similarities and differences between macrophages from PTOA and RA synovial joints, we next performed two differential gene expression analyses: i) PTOA versus healthy control macrophages (Sebastian and Knights) and ii) RA versus healthy control macrophages (Culemann and Muench). 85 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found exclusively between PTOA and control macrophages, 89 DEGs were found exclusively in the RA versus control comparison, and 21 DEGs overlapped between both analyses (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>, Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). Thus, to determine perturbed pathways unique to macrophages in each disease state separately, we used exclusive DEGs to perform pathway analysis using Gene Ontology (Supplementary Table 5). In PTOA macrophages, compared to controls, collagen metabolism, myeloid differentiation regulation, neutrophil chemotaxis and glial cell apoptosis pathways were all enriched (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref>). In RA macrophages on the other hand, response to corticotropin-releasing hormone (known to be pro-inflammatory and enriched in RA synovial fluid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>), Th1 differentiation, and cellular response to mercury were all perturbed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3G</xref>).

To eliminate variation from other cell types and to more sensitively describe transcriptional variance amongst macrophages, we computationally isolated monocytes and macrophages from all immune cells in our scRNA-seq dataset (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>, Fig S9A). Five clusters emerged, expressing classical monocyte and macrophage markers <italic>Itgam</italic> (encoding CD11b), <italic>Adgre1</italic> (encoding F4/80), <italic>Csf1r</italic> (encoding the M-CSF receptor) and <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>, Fig S9B).

<p>The top DEGs between resident-like macrophage clusters were analyzed to better understand their potential functional differences (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>, Supplementary Table 6). Compared to basal resident macrophages, the resident-like A cluster was enriched for functions pertaining to complement activation and cell migration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4F</xref>). Resident-like B cells had enriched CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling and production of macrophage inflammatory protein, compared to the basal resident cells. On the other hand, compared to the two polarized resident-like macrophage subsets, basal resident cells had functional enrichment of homeostatic biological pathways including phagocytosis, endocytosis, and apoptosis.

<p>Monocytes expressing <italic>Ly6c2</italic>, <italic>Plac8</italic> and <italic>Chil3</italic> were also present, particularly after injury, and trajectory analysis suggested that they give rise to a pro-inflammatory cluster expressing <italic>Ccr2</italic> and genes encoding MHC Class II, which we have termed infiltrating macrophages.

<title>Stromal-immune crosstalk via M-CSF signaling</title>
<p>Stromal and immune cells participate in autocrine and paracrine signaling within synovium, and we sought to define key signaling axes that regulate the synovial immune cell niche.

The M-CSF pathway, involving the ligands M-CSF (macrophage colony stimulating factor) and IL-34, and the M-CSF receptor, was highly induced after injury, but primarily in the stromal-to-immune direction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>, Fig S10), implying that stromal-derived ligands regulate synovial immune cells expressing the M-CSF receptor – namely, macrophages.

<p>CellChat hierarchy plots, which infer directionality and degree of signaling between each cell type based on ligand-receptor interactions of a given pathway, were generated for all synovial cells from Sham, 7d ACLR, and 28d ACLR. In Sham synovium, lining and sublining fibroblasts, as well as pericytes, were the primary producers of M-CSF and/or IL-34 ligand, with macrophages and dendritic cells being the primary signal-receiving cell types (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>). After injury, alongside the increased cell type diversity, there were more M-CSF pathway interactions (number of connections) with higher probabilities (thickness of connections), which, again, originated from fibroblasts and pericytes and signaled towards myeloid cells. A small population of mast cells also sent outgoing signals at 7d ACLR only. No immune-to-stromal signaling via the M-CSF pathway was predicted (Fig S11). Expression patterns of M-CSF pathway genes in synovial cell types confirmed fibroblasts as the major source of <italic>Csf1</italic> ligand, with no expression seen in immune cells (except for mast cells); pericytes were the primary source of <italic>Il34</italic> ligand; and <italic>Csf1r</italic> expression was confined to the immune cell compartment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E-G</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Chronic synovitis is recognized to drive various pathological processes associated with arthritis, including pain and tissue damage, but the early cellular and molecular events following joint injury are not well described. We recently demonstrated that synovial fibroblasts expand rapidly and phenotypically diverge into distinct functional subsets in PTOA, alongside pathological activation of canonical Wnt signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. The present work demonstrates the injury-induced immune cell dynamics concurrent with the activation of synovial fibroblasts, and our flow cytometric and transcriptomic analyses demonstrate that while most immune cells are rare in healthy synovium, joint injury causes massive diversification and influx of immune subsets. Macrophages exhibited the greatest expansion, and our single-cell transcriptomic analyses identified a resident macrophage population that polarizes into two phenotypes following injury, in addition to an infiltrating macrophage population derived from monocytes. Synovial stromal cells were highly active in mediating immune cell infiltration and expansion, with unbiased modeling of stromal-immune crosstalk identifying that M-CSF signaling is among the most perturbed ligand-receptor axes after injury. The TFs Jun, Cebpα, Cebpβ, and Pu.1 were identified as putative mediators of differentiation from monocytes to synovial macrophages.</p>
<p>Among the most pressing questions in the field of PTOA research is which immune cells drive disease versus which promote resolution following joint injury. Rigorously describing immune cell dynamics and the relative contribution of specific cellular subsets to disease processes such as pain, osteophyte formation, and cartilage damage will facilitate the development of targeted, disease-modifying therapies. Consistent with prior studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>, our transcriptomic profiling demonstrated that healthy synovia contained all major immune cell types, including rare subsets such as mast cells and T cells, and this was corroborated by flow cytometry. As we did not perfuse mice prior to tissue collection, some of these may be blood-derived, but mature immune cells such as mast cells, T cells, B cells, and dendritic cells are unlikely to be present in healthy synovial tissue vasculature in sufficient numbers to generate this result. Robust lineage tracing studies are lacking to describe the origin, maintenance, and replenishment of these immune cells, which will require more specific tools given that recent scRNA-seq studies have revealed that many of the existing genetic reporter systems are insufficient to distinguish between resident versus systemically-derived cells, or exhibit too much overlap in expression among different immune subsets (e.g. <italic>LysM-cre</italic>, <italic>Cx3cr1-cre</italic>, <italic>Ccr2-cre</italic>).</p>
<p>Macrophages were the most numerous immune cell type in healthy and injured synovium and exhibited the greatest expansion following injury. In healthy tissue, we identified a resident synovial macrophage population with a <italic>Timd4+ Lyve1+ Folr2+</italic> (TLF) signature that resembled homeostatic tissue-resident macrophages described in other tissue contexts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Trajectory analysis predicted that these resident macrophages could expand into two injury-induced resident-like subsets: one marked by <italic>Mrc1</italic> (encoding CD206) and <italic>Gas6</italic>, and another marked by <italic>Cd9, Spp1</italic> and <italic>Trem2</italic> expression. Several recent studies have corroborated the existence of a pro-fibrotic macrophage population that emerges in different disease contexts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>, expressing <italic>Spp1</italic> (encoding osteopontin), <italic>Cd9</italic> and <italic>Trem2</italic>, strongly suggesting that the resident-like B macrophage population we identified in PTOA synovium is functionally analogous, which is significant in light of the strong fibrotic phenotype of PTOA synovium. Our trajectory modeling pointed towards these pro-fibrotic macrophages arising from synovium-resident TLF+ macrophages after injury. In liver cirrhosis, however, trajectory analysis suggested a monocytic origin for <italic>Spp1</italic>+ macrophages. Thus, robust <italic>in vivo</italic> fate mapping studies are critical to elucidate their true origins. The resident-like A cluster that emerged after injury expressed <italic>Mrc1</italic> (CD206), historically associated with an anti-inflammatory and reparative phenotype, and which has been shown to mediate collagen turnover<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. In addition their potentially beneficial role in regulating extracellular matrix, the resident-like A population also expressed <italic>Gas6</italic>, which is required for efficient efferocytosis of apoptotic cells by synovial macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> – an important aspect of inflammatory resolution that goes awry in OA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. It is noteworthy that conventional “M1” and “M2” markers, such as <italic>Il1b</italic>, <italic>Tnf</italic>, <italic>Arg1</italic> and <italic>Il10</italic>, revealed no appreciable separation across our clusters, placing further impetus to move beyond the simplistic M1-M2 spectrum of macrophages. Mechanistic and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies are now warranted to describe the precise pathophysiological functions of these subsets in OA, their ontogenies, and their spatial distribution in the various synovial niches.</p>
<p>We further identified a clear monocyte-to-macrophage trajectory, and these infiltrating macrophages highly expressed the pro-inflammatory genes encoding for CCR2, IL-1β, TNF-α, MHC Class II, among others. Huang <italic>et al</italic> recently demonstrated in murine inflammatory arthritis that synovial inflammatory resolution is achieved, in part, by suppressing the <italic>in situ</italic> differentiation of infiltrating monocytes to a F4/80<sup>hi</sup> MHC Class II<sup>+</sup> phenotype, which would otherwise promote chronic inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Thus, we conclude that the monocyte-derived macrophages we identified to emerge in synovium following joint injury are pro-inflammatory and analogous to those described by Huang <italic>et al</italic>, and developing an understanding of the molecular mechanisms that promote their recruitment and differentiation following joint injury is critical. We therefore undertook further focused analysis of the transcriptional trajectory spanning monocytes to infiltrating macrophages, and we identified Jun, Cebpα, Cebpβ, and Pu.1 as TFs potentially regulating the gene programs of monocyte-to-macrophage maturation in OA synovium. These have been previously attributed to regulate macrophage maturation in other disease contexts such as rheumatoid arthritis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>, often in concert with each other<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>, however empirical studies demonstrating whether maturation of systemically-derived monocytes into inflammatory synovial macrophages during OA is dependent on these TFs are needed.</p>
<p>To understand which stromal-derived signals recruit or activate immune cells, we extended the widely-utilized cellular crosstalk toolbox CellChat to identify the ligand-receptor axes most perturbed by joint injury and most active in stromal-to-immune communication, in an unbiased fashion. By deriving probability ratios for all possible multi- and uni-directional stromal-immune signaling axes in healthy and injured joints, M-CSF signaling emerged as a major crosstalk axis activated by injury. M-CSF (and its alternative ligand, IL-34) has been shown to mediate monocyte-macrophage maturation via the M-CSF receptor in other disease contexts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>, and monoclonal antibody-mediated M-CSF receptor inhibition ameliorated cytokine production in human RA synovial explants and mitigated disease severity in murine collagen-induced arthritis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Our TF binding analysis revealed Pu.1 as a putative regulator of <italic>Csf1r</italic>, in agreement with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. Ongoing studies are seeking to understand whether synovial fibroblast-derived M-CSF activates putative regulators like Pu.1, to promote monocyte maturation towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Further work is also needed to describe which upstream pathways promote M-CSF and IL-34 ligand secretion by synovial fibroblasts, pericytes and mast cells. Given the universal dependence of macrophages, both resident and recruited, on M-CSF signaling, dissecting the nuanced mechanistic distinctions such as ligand-receptor combination, ligand bioavailability, sending and receiving cell types, and spatial proximity, will be crucial if targeting M-CSF signaling is to be harnessed therapeutically in OA. In conjunction, accurately defining the temporal dynamics, ontogenies, and pathological versus protective functions of distinct macrophage subtypes in synovium will be integral if these cells are to be targeted for intra-articular treatment.</p>

<p>This study provides <bold>useful</bold> information by identifying the cell type (macrophages) in synovial tissues involved in the pathogenesis of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (OA) and clarifying distinct transcriptomic signatures that may be a good therapeutic target for OA. However, the analysis performed so far is <bold>incomplete</bold>, with a main weakness being the lack of data to confirm the authors' speculation about the underlying mechanisms.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors recently reported a scRNA-seq-based study focused on synovial fibroblasts using a mouse model of post-traumatic OA (Ref. 21). In the present manuscript, they reanalyzed the scRNA-seq data to investigate the diversity and roles of macrophages. In addition to their original scRNA-seq data (Ref. 21), they utilized the deposited data of other OA or RA models (Ref. 25-27) and compared cell types in the synovium. The authors extracted the macrophage/monocyte group, compared differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between OA and RA synovium, and analyzed macrophage subsets, including trajectory analysis. They further estimated the crosstalk between stromal and immune cells via M-CSF signaling, and transcription factors for monocyte differentiation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The descriptions are comprehensive, based on the scRNA-seq data including the original and other independent studies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, methods of sample preparation must be different, for example, the extent and location of excised synovium. The comparison with other studies is meaningful and informative; however, caution should be exercised regarding the potentially significant impact of methodological differences on the analysis results.</p>
<p>The various data obtained from these technologies are comprehensive and useful; however, they are just estimates. Without confirmation by experiments, it is impossible to determine how much of it can be believed. This issue is not limited to this paper.</p>
<p>Most of all signaling pathways and molecules described in the latter part of this study are previously known.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The manuscript by Knights et al set out to identify the specific immune cells and their contribution to the development of osteoarthritis. They performed a comprehensive analysis of scRNA-seq and flow cytometry using different stages of the PTOA model and sought to identify specific synovial macrophages in OA. Computational analysis revealed that M-CSF signaling in synovium plays an important role in stromal-immune crosstalk in OA. They also found that four transcription factors including Pu.1, Cebp-alpha, Cebp-beta, and Jun regulate the differentiation of monocytes into pro-inflammatory synovial macrophages in OA.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The main strength of this study is the profiling of immune cells which will be a valuable resource for better understanding the pathogenesis of OA. The work is technically sound, and the level of analysis of gene expression, clustering, cell-cell communication, and dynamic changes in gene modules over time is state-of-the-art.</p>
<p>The reviewer appreciates that the authors uncovered the transcriptional network that regulates the differentiation of synovial macrophages in OA. In addition, the identification of M-CSF signaling as a major crosstalk axis in OA development is also intriguing.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Although the scRNA-seq analysis of immune cells in OA is quite convincing, the data has been rather descriptive and superficial at this stage. The authors did not show the in vivo significance of their findings in OA development.</p>

<p>We greatly appreciate the feedback provided by reviewers on this manuscript. One of our key objectives was to provide a comprehensive, detailed resource for researchers using single-cell transcriptomics to study arthritis, especially immune cells like macrophages. We strived to perform thorough, wide-ranging analyses that are both accessible and useful to other scientists in the field, and that we hope will serve as the basis for many future avenues of study. As such, we acknowledge that this work is a “first step”, providing a strong descriptive foundation with some mechanistic insight that we and others will continue pursuing. Preliminary studies in our laboratory seeking to dissect signaling mechanisms associated with the M-CSF pathway have illuminated how complex and context-dependent this signaling is, which is an important consideration for future in vivo investigations. Further, it is indeed true that attempting to harmonize transcriptomic data across studies, models, laboratories, and dissection/processing methods is fraught with difficulty and prone to misinterpretation – and we made an effort to highlight this in our manuscript, particularly with respect to where synovial immune cells were recovered from, and how. We encourage healthy discussion within the field for developing shared, unified protocols for harvests and processing upstream of transcriptomic experiments.</p>
