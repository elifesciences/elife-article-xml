<title>Abstract</title><p>Ischemic stroke, one of the leading causes of death in the world, is accompanied by the dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which aggravates neuron damage. However, the mechanisms underlying the restoration of BBB in the chronic stage after stroke remain unclear. Here, we investigated the changes in the pericyte pool and their effects on BBB function and brain self-repair after stroke. Using lineage tracing, RNA-seq and immunofluorescence staining, we detected endothelial cells (ECs) transdifferentiated into pericytes (E-pericytes) after stroke in the MCAO model. E-pericytes depletion by diphtheria toxin A (DTA) aggravated BBB leakage and exacerbated neurological deficits in the MCAO model. The myeloid cell-driven transdifferentiation of ECs into pericytes accelerated BBB restoration and brain self-repair after stroke via endothelial-mesenchymal transformation (EndoMT). Decreasing the number of E-pericytes by specific knockout of the <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> gene in ECs also aggravated BBB leakage and exacerbated neurological deficits. Specific-ECs overexpression of the <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> gene promoting E-pericytes transdifferentiation reduced BBB leakage and exerted neuroprotective effects. Our findings solve a key question about how changes in the pericyte pool after stroke affect the restoration of BBB function and brain self-repair and may offer a new approach to therapy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>All vertebrate creatures have evolved strategies for tissue repair after an accident or conflict and effective tissue repair is critical for survival. The liver is the only solid organ that uses regenerative mechanisms to ensure that the liver-to-bodyweight ratio is always at 100% of what is required for body homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Vascular repair is crucial in liver regeneration because blood vessels can provide nutrients and oxygen to facilitate tissue restoration and functional recovery in the chronic stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Vascular repair is essential in skin wound healing as it promotes the formation of new blood vessels, enhances tissue regeneration, and supports the delivery of nutrients and oxygen to the wound site in larger injuries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. The liver and skin demonstrate a powerful ability for tissue self-repair, which benefits from vascular repair. As one of the most important organs, current knowledge and research on the contribution of vascular repair to brain self-repair are inadequate.</p>
<p>Stroke results in large-scale cell death because of ongoing ischemia and hypoxia, which remain a major cause of adult disability and death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. The definitive spontaneous repairing processes in the brain remain largely unknown after stroke and the decoding and harnessing of these processes may accelerate brain recovery which usually takes years. Until recently, such efforts mainly involved protective factors and cell transplants designed to rescue or replace a specific population of neurons, and the results have largely been disappointing in clinical outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Treatments to reduce neuronal death and limit acute damage are desirable by timely restoring blood vessel reperfusion in the cute phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. No proven medical therapies exist for restoring cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the chronic phase. Unfortunately, the knowledge of brain-self repair by remedying vascular vessels after stroke in the chronic repair phase is still rare.</p>
<p>The vascular hierarchy comprises arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins. Nutrient and gas exchange occurs primarily in the capillary beds, up to 90% of blood vessel length<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Capillaries are mainly composed of endothelial cells (ECs) and pericytes, which safeguard the functions of capillary beds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. ECs and pericytes respond to different reactions and fates after stroke. Pericytes rapidly exhibited apoptosis and death after stroke, nevertheless ECs tolerance ischemia and hypoxia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. When pericytes were lost, the functions of vascular vessels, BBB and CBF, were destroyed. BBB serves as a critical selective barrier that regulates the exchange of substances between the blood and the central nervous system (CNS), maintaining an obligatory environment for cell communications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Effective CBF is essential for cell survival in the brain after stroke. The prevention of BBB leakage and the decrease of CBF due to pericyte loss is important for vascular and neurological functions after stroke.</p>
<p>The endothelium is capable of remarkable plasticity. Certain ECs in the embryo undergo hematopoietic transition, giving rise to multi-lineage hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, which are crucial for developing the blood system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. ECs can undergo EndoMT, acquiring mesenchymal properties. This process is important in various physiological and pathological conditions, such as fibrosis and cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Endocardial endothelial cells are progenitors of pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells in the murine embryonic heart via EndoMT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Protein C receptor-expressing (Procr<sup>+</sup>) ECs would give rise to de novo formation of ECs and pericytes in the mammary gland<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. In situ, is there a self-repair mechanism to replenish the pericytes pool from ECs for protection functions of blood vessels after stroke in the chronic repair phase that is unknown?</p>
<p>In the acute and subacute phases after stroke, myeloid cells were dominant immune cells entering the brain parenchyma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Most myeloid cells could not occupy the ischemic brain for a long time and faded away by releasing various factors, including pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory and trophic factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Blocking myeloid cell recruitment using anti-CCR2 antibody and <italic>CCR2</italic> gene knockout mice impaired long-term spontaneous behavioral recovery after stroke via reducing anti-inflammatory macrophages and angiogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. TGF-β1 was predominantly co-localized with CD68<sup>+</sup> activated microglia and macrophage in mice after distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> and TGF-β1 is important in the pathogenesis of the angiogenic response in ischemic brain tissue in patients after stroke<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. At the same time, TGF-β is the main driver of EndoMT, which is involved in endothelial-to-pericytic transition in the murine embryonic heart and mammary gland<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. However, it remains unclear whether myeloid cells can drive endothelial-to-pericytic transition to replenish the pericyte pool and remedy the functions of vascular vessels after stroke in the chronic phase.</p>
<p>The study was to verify that ECs can transdifferentiate into E-pericytes to replenish the pericyte pool in situ and assess the role of E-pericytes in the restoration of BBB function and brain self-repair. In the MCAO model, we discovered that ischemic stroke induced EC-to-pericyte transdifferentiation. Myeloid cells drive E-pericytes via the TGFb1-TGFβR2 pathway. The specific decrease in the number of E-pericytes by DTA and knockout of the <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> gene in ECs increased BBB leakage and impaired long-term spontaneous behavioral recovery. Increasing the number of E-pericytes via overexpression of the <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> gene in ECs alleviated BBB leakage and enhanced long-term spontaneous behavioral recovery. These results reveal the previously unappreciated transdifferentiation of E-pericyte to replenish the pericyte pool after, its role in BBB restoration and brain self-repair after stroke and how infiltrating myeloid cells drive E-pericyte formation. Our study uncovered a new mechanism for accelerating brain self-repair and provided a new approach to therapy after stroke.</p>

<title>Changes in the pericyte pool after stroke</title>
<p>To study EC-to-pericyte transdifferentiation after stroke and the underlying mechanisms, we first aimed to explore changes in the pericyte pool after stroke. We used the MCAO model in mice to mimic stroke patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. CD13<sup>+</sup> pericytes and CD31<sup>+</sup> ECs were found to be TUNEL positive on capillary in our stroke model. Moreover, only half of the pericytes survived at reperfusion 2 days (RP2D), while over 80% of ECs survived (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The number of CD13<sup>+</sup> pericytes on capillary also decreased but then increased at RP2D and RP7D after stroke (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-C</xref>). Flow cytometry also revealed that the number of pericytes significantly decreased, from 100% on the contralateral side to approximately 50% on the ipsilateral side at RP2D, but gradually increased following reperfusion after stroke (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-E</xref>). Overall, there was a 68.1% increase in the pericyte pool from RP2D to RP34D and a 40.5% increase in total pericytes at RP34D (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>).</p>

<p>Considering these findings, we next aimed to assess why the number of pericytes increased in the chronic phase after stroke. EdU was injected into the mice at different times to identify proliferating pericytes and ECs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>), and it was found that cell proliferation occurred mainly within the first three days after stroke (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). Both pericytes and ECs underwent self-proliferation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>), EdU<sup>+</sup> ECs accounted for fewer than 10% of all ECs and EdU<sup>+</sup> pericytes accounted for approximately 12.9% of all pericytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). EdU<sup>+</sup> pericytes and ECs ceased proliferating after RP7D (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>). Thus, 12.9% of the pericytes present at RP34D originated from self-proliferation, whereas the origin of the other 27.6% of new pericytes remained unknown.</p>

<title>scRNA-seq was used to explore the fate of ECs after stroke</title>
<p>To explore the origin of the other 27.6% of new pericytes conversion from ECs after stroke, we used Cdh5CreERT2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>(induced endothelial cells, iECs);Ai47 or Ai14 mice which were labeled ECs in homeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1A</xref>). First, we confirmed that ECs were specifically labeled in the brain parenchyma of iECs;Ai47 mice. Without tamoxifen, ECs were not labeled with EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1B-C</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining revealed the EGFP signal only represents ECs markers positive (CD31<sup>+</sup>, ERG<sup>+</sup>, GLUT1<sup>+</sup>, and VE-Cadherin<sup>+</sup>) cells in the brain parenchyma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1D-G</xref>, S1I). We also found that the EGFP signal does not represent pericyte markers (CD13<sup>+</sup>, PDGFRβ<sup>+</sup>, α-SMA<sup>+</sup>, and NG2<sup>+</sup> cells) cells in the brain parenchyma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1H-J</xref>).

After sorting by 10X Genomics and quality control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2A</xref>), we obtained 3568 cells from the sham group, 4147 cells from the MCAO group at RP7D and 5070 cells from the MCAO group at RP34D. We used different markers based on literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> to identify the cell types (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) and found 9 major cell types: arterial ECs, venous ECs (2 types), capillary ECs, capillary-venous ECs, smooth muscle cells (SMCs), pericytes, fibroblasts, microglia and ependymal cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).

<p>A heatmap was used to visualize the top DEGs in the pseudotime trajectory (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>) and found that they were related mainly to pericyte transcription factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> (Tbx15, Foxc2, Twist1, Tbx18) and pericyte markers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> (Cspg4, Pdgfrb, Rgs4) in cell fate P1 and arterial ECs markers (Mgp, Gkn3) in cell fate P2. Among the DEGs, EC-related transcription factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> (Erg, Mecom, Foxf2, Foxq1, Sox17, Sox18 and Zic3) were downregulated as differentiation progressed, and the expression of pericyte-related transcription factors (Tbx15, Foxd1, Tbx18, Heyl and Twist1), which are critical for pericyte development, increased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Pseudotime trajectory analysis suggested that the developmental trajectory was from ECs to pericytes and arterial ECs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). Thus, the scRNA-seq results indicated that ECs might turn into pericyte-like cells after stroke.</p>

<title>ECs can give rise to pericyte-like cells after stroke</title>
<p>To verify that ECs might give rise to pericyte-like cells after stroke, we performed lineage tracing in iECs;Ai47 mice subjected to stroke. The graph shows the time of given tamoxifen, MACO model and different time points for analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3A</xref>). Laser speckle analysis revealed that CBF was reduced by approximately 80% after MCAO, indicating our ischemic model success in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3B</xref>). Immunofluorescence revealed that there were existing EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells, detached from blood vessels, owning to long processes with secondary branches and no expression EC markers (CD31, ERG, GLUT1 and VE-Cadherin), in the ischemic area at RP34D (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3C</xref>). Theoretically, EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells only exist in ECs and express ECs markers in parenchyma at homeostasis. However, the above EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells lost the characteristics of ECs (EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs), which indicated those cells had changed fate. Moreover, the EGFP<sup>+</sup>CD31<sup>-</sup> cells expressed classic pericyte markers (CD13, PDGFRβ and NG2) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-C</xref>), which also indicated ECs might turn into pericyte-like cells after stroke.</p>

<p>Cardiac pericytes upregulate the expression of fibrosis-related genes, exhibiting matrix-synthesizing and matrix-remodeling abilities after myocardial infarction. Some pericytes in the infarct region express fibroblast marker PDGFRɑ, which is beneficial for ECM in myocardial infarction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Our model also found that EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs expressed fibroblast marker PDGFRɑ (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). However, EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs did not express vimentin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3D</xref>), which indicates that the EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs were not fibroblasts, but pericyte-like cells that expressed certain proteins involved in matrix remodeling. Moreover, EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs did not express microglia markers (Iba1 and CD68) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3E</xref>), which indicated that EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs were not microglia.</p>
<p>The proportion of EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs located on vessels relative to total vascular pericytes was approximately 27.8% (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), that relative to total EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs was approximately 27.5% (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>), that relative to migrating EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs was approximately 38.1% (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>), and that relative to total pericytes was 22.45% (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs began to appear at RP7D, and their proportion peaked at RP14D (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>). Furthermore, the EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs survived over 514 days after MCAO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3F</xref>). At RP8D, EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs expressed PDGFRα (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>) and vimentin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>) but not CD13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3G</xref>) or NG2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3H</xref>). GO and KEGG analyses also revealed that EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs expressed genes involved in matrix synthesis, matrix remodeling and ossification at RP8D (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3L-M</xref>). These results indicated that EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs presented fibroblast-like cells characteristics at RP8D and pericyte-like cells at RP34D. The majority of the EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs were located in the penumbra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3I</xref>), and they were not proliferation, as they were not labeled by EdU at RP34D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3J</xref>), which indicated that the EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs were converted from ECs via transdifferentiation.</p>
<p>In iECs;Ai47 mice, fewer than 1% of nucleated cells in bone marrow (BM) were labeled with EGFP, main myeloid cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Macrophages could invade the brain and develop pericytes in the early phase of vascular development in the CNS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Therefore, we aimed to eliminate EGFP<sup>+</sup> macrophages from the BM after stroke. We intracerebroventricularly injected newborn Cdh5CreERT2 P2 mice with AVV2/9-CAG-DIO-EGFP. EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs still expressed the pericyte marker CD13 at RP34D, with the percentage of EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs expressing CD13 approaching 100% at RP34D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3K</xref>). We also used other methods to specifically label ECs and to verify the conversion of ECs to pericytes. In Tie2Dre;Mfsd2aCrexER;Ai47 mice, ECs in the brain are specifically labeled, in which EC would give rise to CD13<sup>+</sup> EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs at RP34D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3L</xref>). Similarly, AAV2/9-BI30-CAG-EGFP specifically infected ECs, and following injection, close to 100% of EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs still expressed CD13 at RP34D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3M</xref>).</p>
<p>To explore transcriptome characteristics of EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs at RP34D, we isolated EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs at RP34D for RNA-seq analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4A</xref>). Principal component analysis revealed that the cells clustered into ECs and EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4B</xref>). Analysis of a heatmap showing the top 100 DEGs between ECs and EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4C</xref>) revealed differences in their transcriptomes. The heatmap showed that EC-specific transcription factor genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4D</xref>), EC-enriched transmembrane receptor genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4E</xref>) and EC-enriched ligand genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4F</xref>) were expressed in ECs but expressed or expressed at low levels in EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs. However, pericyte-specific transcription factor genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4G</xref>), pericyte-enriched transmembrane receptor genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4H</xref>) and pericyte-enriched ligand genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4I</xref>) were not expressed or expressed at low levels in ECs but expressed in EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs. Therefore, ECs lost their EC-like transcriptome, and EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs acquired a pericyte-like transcriptome after stroke. A total of 379 and 220 genes were significantly upregulated and downregulated, respectively, in EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs compared with ECs at RP34D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4J</xref>). GO enrichment analysis of the upregulated DEGs in EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs was further performed, and according to the top 10 GO terms, the EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs presented greater aerobic capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4K</xref>) than did the ECs, which exhibited a stronger preference for anaerobic metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. KEGG pathway analysis of the upregulated DEGs in EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs was further performed, and the upregulated DEGs were most significantly enriched in endothelial cell migration, epithelial cell migration, epithelial and tissue migration, which was consistent with the detachment of EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs from blood vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3C</xref>). These results confirmed that EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs exhibit pericyte-like characteristics and ECs give rise to pericyte-like cells after stroke. Therefore, we named EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs with E-pericytes, as they were derived from ECs.</p>

<title>Depletion of E-pericytes impedes BBB repair</title>

Whether E-pericytes generation also contributes to preserving BBB function after stroke is unknown. To specifically deplete E-pericytes after stroke (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), we first used AAV2/9-BI30-NG2 promotor-DIO-DeRed (DeRed) to label E-pericytes at RP34D (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B-C</xref>). Then we used AAV2/9-BI30-NG2 promoter-DIO-DTA (DTA) virus, which injected before MCAO (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), to deplete E-pericytes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). We found that Evans blue leakage decreased with increasing reperfusion time and that there was no obvious Evans blue signal at RP34D (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>), which indicates self-repair of the BBB. Depletion of E-pericytes by DTA resulted in a significant increase in Evans blue leakage (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>) and trypan blue leakage (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>) at RP34D after stroke.

<p>Additionally, flow cytometry analysis of cytoplasmic gene expression confirmed that 1.6% of CD31<sup>+</sup> ECs expressed α-SMA at RP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figure S5C</xref>), which was close to the proportion of E-pericytes relative to CD31<sup>+</sup> ECs.

<title>Infiltrating myeloid cells express TGFβ1 in the brain after stroke</title>
<p>We found that the TGFβ-TGFβR2 pathway is involved in the expression of EndoMT markers and the generation of E-pericytes after stroke. Therefore, we explored the source of TGFβ after stroke. The three main TGFβ isoforms in mammals are TGFβ1, TGFβ2, and TGFβ3, and TGFβ1 accounts for more than 90% of total TGFβ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. In young female mice subjected to distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO), the TGFβ1 protein predominantly colocalized with CD68, activated microglia and macrophages, at 3 days poststroke<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.

Moreover, <italic>Tgfb1</italic> mRNA was not expressed in CD13<sup>+</sup> pericytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Figure S6C</xref>). During the acute and subacute phases after stroke, immune cells that infiltrate the ischemic brain are primarily of the myeloid lineage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Initially, flow cytometric analysis revealed that CD45<sup>hi</sup> immune cells were predominantly of the myeloid lineage after stroke, with the majority being monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Figure S6D-F</xref>). CD45<sup>+</sup> cells were sorted 2 days after MCAO, and single cell sequencing analysis revealed that these cells were also primarily of the myeloid lineage (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>).

<p>We quantified the number of CD31<sup>+</sup> ECs and found that it decreased when infiltrating myeloid cells were eliminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Figure S7D</xref>), indicating decreased ECs. The number of CD13<sup>+</sup> pericytes in the ischemic area was significantly reduced after ischemic stroke, and the EC/pericyte ratio was increased when infiltrating myeloid cells were eliminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Figure S7D-E</xref>), which suggested that vascular integrity was disrupted. We also detected a reduction of NeuN<sup>+</sup> neurons after ischemic stroke when infiltrating myeloid cells were eliminated (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>), indicating that fewer neurons survived. The elimination of infiltrating myeloid cells resulted in a low survival rate (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref>). Moreover, the elimination of infiltrating myeloid cells decreased the latency to fall from the rotarod in the rotarod test (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8F</xref>), increased the frequency of falling from the pole (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8G</xref>), increased the deviation from normal in the corner test (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8H</xref>), and impaired the removal of adhesive tape from the forepaw in the adhesive removal test (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8I</xref>).

<title>EC-specific knockout of the <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> gene aggravates BBB leakage and neurological deficits after stroke</title>
<p>As we found that infiltrating myeloid cells drives the transdifferentiation of ECs into pericytes via the TGFb1-TGFβR2 pathway, we next aimed to explore whether blocking the TGFb1-TGFβR2 pathway in ECs also impacts BBB leakage and neurological deficits via E-pericytes. To this end, we increased the proportion of E-pericytes via EC-specific overexpression of the <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> gene or eliminated E-pericytes via EC-specific expression of the <italic>DTA</italic> gene. When Tgfbr2 was overexpressed to increase E-pericytes and DTA was expressed in transformed cells to deplete E-pericytes, we found that there was no significant change in the number of E-pericytes in the Tgfbr2 + DTA group compared with the DTA group (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref>). Moreover, there was no difference in BBB leakage between the <italic>DTA</italic> expression group and the group in which <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> was overexpressed and <italic>DTA</italic> was expressed (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B</xref>).

Moreover, trypan blue leakage increased at RP34D with EC-specific loss of the <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Figure S8A</xref>). BBB leakage did not change significantly from RP7D to RP14D, while the proportion of E-pericytes increased. However, BBB leakage increased significantly after the elimination of E-pericytes (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9D</xref>), which declares that E-pericytes promote the normal repair of BBB from RP7D to RP14D. Interestingly, no obvious dextran-rhodamine B (∼70 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Figure S8B</xref>) or Texas Red (∼71 kDa) leakage was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Figure S8C</xref>). The elimination of E-pericytes allowed Evans blue and trypan blue to cross the BBB. Thus, these findings indicate that E-pericytes contribute to BBB integrity. We detected a reduction in the number of NeuN<sup>+</sup> neurons after stroke in mice with EC-specific loss of the <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> gene (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9E</xref>), which led to much more severe neurological deficits.

<p>The Elimination of E-pericytes by DTA exacerbated BBB leakage, decreased CBF, and impeded neurological and spontaneous behavioral recovery.

<p>Regarding neuronal changes, we also detected an increase of NeuN<sup>+</sup> neurons after ischemic stroke in EC-specific overexpression of the Tgfbr2 protein group, indicating that more neurons survived (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10B</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study demonstrated that ECs transdifferentiated into pericytes after stroke, accelerating BBB functional recovery, increasing CBF, and facilitating neurological behavioral recovery. Infiltrating myeloid cells were found to drive E-pericytes generation and restore BBB function and neurological functional recovery.</p>
<p>In other tissues, myeloid cells have been reported in tissue repair. Monocytes regulate hypodermal adipocytes and associated leptin-mediated revascularization of wounds post-infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Macrophages actively secrete metabolites during regeneration to establish immune–muscle stem cells (MuSCs) crosstalk in a GSDMD-dependent manner to promote tissue repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. In our study, cerebral ischemic injury and repair also involve both the cerebral cells and the immune system, which play a critical role in determining stroke outcomes. Studies have shown that <italic>CCR2</italic> knockout and pharmacological inhibition of CCR2 attenuated monocyte-derived macrophage (MDM)-induced acute brain injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. However, MDMs recruited to the injured brain early after ischemic stroke contribute to long-term spontaneous functional recovery during the chronic stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. The ability of MDMs to promote functional recovery because macrophages are polarized toward the anti-inflammatory phenotype and promote angiogenesis during the recovery stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. However, the precise role of myeloid cells in angiogenesis and spontaneous behavioral recovery after stroke remains to be elucidated. Our experimental results demonstrated that inhibiting the infiltration of myeloid cells into the brain could reduce the number of CD31<sup>+</sup> ECs, implying the decrease of angiogenesis, and CBF. Furthermore, the suppression of myeloid cell-derived TGFβ1 in the brain restrains endothelial-to-pericytic transition and decreases the pool of pericytes. Pericytes play a vital role in angiogenesis and maintaining the stability of newly formed blood vessels. Therefore, the reduced number of pericytes caused by the inhibition of myeloid cells may ultimately impede angiogenesis and CBF. Our results may reveal that myeloid cells promote angiogenesis by driving the endothelial-to-pericytic transition.</p>
<p>During the acute phase of stroke, ischemia and hypoxia lead to rapid death of pericytes, which increases BBB leakage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Although the decrease of pericytes during the acute phase of stroke has been reported, there is almost no research on the pericyte pool during the chronic phase. Our study found that during the chronic phase of stroke, the pericyte pool gradually increased, including both the self-proliferation of pericytes and the conversion of ECs to pericytes. E-pericytes were crucial for the function of vascular vessels during brain self-repair. When we depleted E-pericytes, it led to the loss of vascular vessels’ self-recovery function, including BBB and CBF, and hindered neurological recovery. Increasing the number of E-pericytes reduced Evans blue leakage, augmented CBF and promoted neurological recovery. This suggests the importance of E-pericytes for blood vessel self-recovery.</p>
<p>Unlike the liver and skin owing to powerful self-healing ability, stroke can lead to severe disability due to the limited capacity of cerebral cells to regenerate or replace dead cells, especially neurons. Exploring and confirming therapeutic theory for neurons and other cell protection is necessary for stroke. Synapse-level reconstruction of neural circuits and remyelination are involved in the recoverable process via various neurotrophic factors and cell transplants, which also are confronted with rigorous challenges to maintain long-term survival because of lack of effective blood flow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Our results illustrated a new pathway for brain-self repair after stroke in the chronic stage. We found that ECs can give rise to pericytes to replenish the pool, accelerating the restoration of BBB function. Not only that, but E-pericytes may also increase angiogenesis, regulating no-reflow vessels to restore blood flow, thereby increasing the CBF of the whole ischemic brain. All the above improvements are beneficial in promoting neuron survival and functional recovery after stroke.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the brain also has a limited ability to repair itself, which is not as strong as the liver and skin, but if you can amplify the brain’s ability to repair itself, it will be a huge progress for the therapy of stroke. The role of TGFβ family members in angiogenesis is underscored by the observations that nearly all mice with knockout of specific TGFβ family members die during midgestation due to yolk sac angiogenesis defects and that mutations in the genes encoding TGFβ pathway components are linked to an increasing number of human pathologies involving vascular dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Our results revealed that increasing TGFβR2 expression could increase the number of E-pericytes, reduce BBB leakage, increase CBF and accelerate neurological functional recovery. Thus, the TGFβ1-TGFβR2 pathway is a potential therapeutic agent for promoting brain-self repair after stroke. At the same time, ECs may be transformed into pericytes in other tissues after ischemia, suggesting that activation of the TGFβ1-TGFβR2 pathway may also be involved in the repair of other tissues.</p>
<p>In summary, we presented transdifferentiation from ECs to pericytes after stroke, spanning from the processes of conversion to the functions of restoring BBB function and neurological functional recovery. We also verified that E-pericytes were driven by infiltrating myeloid cells, which released TGFβ1 to induce ECs subjected to EndoMT. The discovery of E-pericytes in fueling the destructive pericyte pool to remedy the functions of the lost pericytes after stroke indicates the capacity of brain self-repair from cell transformation.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>Our research revealed that after stroke, ECs can be converted into E-Pericytes. The TGFβ-TGFβR2 pathway had been shown to induce EndoMT in ECs, leading to the formation of fibroblast-like cells at RP8D. This phenomenon has been confirmed in other disease models. However, the conversion of fibroblast-like cells into pericytes has been rarely reported. We were not exploring how fibroblast-like cells convert into pericytes, which key transcription factors were involved in this process, and whether these transcription factors can be manipulated to regulate E-Pericytes more specifically, thereby promoting recovery after stroke. Some E-Pericytes were found to migrate from blood vessels, while others adhered with blood vessels. Based on the normal positioning of pericytes, E-Pericytes located on blood vessels are expected to function more effectively. Therefore, how to promote the return of migrating E-pericytes to blood vessels remains an unsolved problem.</p>

<title>Animal care and tissue dissection</title>
<p>All animal experiments were carried out following protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the School of Life Sciences, Westlake University. Wild-type C57BL6/J mice were purchased from the Laboratory Animal Resources Center of Westlake University. Cdh5CreERT2 mice were a gift from Le-Ming Zheng (Peking University). Gt (ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup><sup>(CAG-EGFP*)Hze</sup> (Ai47) was shared by Zilong Qiu (ION). We crossed Cdh5Cre-ERT2 mice to Ai47 mice to generate Cdh5CreERT2:Ai47 mice. Standard chow and water were provided to mice ad libitum. Four mice were housed in each cage. All animals were housed in a standard animal room with a 12/12-hour light/dark cycle at 25 °C. Both male and female mice were used in this study. Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (100mg/kg), and brain dissection was performed immediately for FACS experiments or cardiac PFA perfusion was performed for the immunohistochemistry experiment. After fixation, brains were dissected and kept in 4% PFA for an additional 4 hours and then transferred to PBS until further processing.</p>

<title>MCAO</title>
<p>Adult mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (100 mg/kg) and body temperature was maintained during surgery with a heating pad. A midline neck incision was made, the right common carotid artery was carefully separated from the vagus nerve, and the artery was ligated using a 5.0-string. A second knot was made on the left external carotid artery. The right internal carotid artery (ICA) was isolated, and a knot was left loose with a 5.0-string. This knot was not tightened until the intraluminal insertion was done. A small hole was cut in the common carotid artery before it was bifurcated to the external carotid artery and ICA. A silicon-coated monofilament (tip diameter = 230 μm, Doccol Corporation, 602256PK5Re) was gently advanced into the ICA until it stopped at the origin of the MCA in the circle of Willis. The third knot on the ICA was closed to fix the filament in position. During MCA occlusion (2 h), mice were kept in a warm cage at 25 °C.</p>

<title>Laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI)</title>
<p>LSCI provides a measure of CBF by quantifying the extent of blurring of dynamic speckles caused by the motion of red blood cells through the vessels. Briefly, mice were placed under an RFLSI III device (RWD Life Sciences) before and after the suture was successfully inserted through the CCA. The skull over both hemispheres was exposed by making an incision along the midline of the scalp. When a 785 nm laser is used to illuminate the brain, it produces a random interference effect that represents blood flow in the form of a speckle pattern. Scattering light was detected by a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, and the images were acquired by custom software from RWD Life Sciences Company. For each acquisition, a total of 160 images, each of which measured 2048 ×2048 pixels, were collected at 16 Hz.</p>

<sec id="s4e">
<title>Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF)</title>
<p>After the laser emitted by the LDF device is irradiated onto the tissue, the laser is scattered by the moving red blood cells in the blood, causing a change in the frequency of the scattered light. This frequency change is related to the speed of the red blood cells, so the blood flow velocity can be inferred by measuring the Doppler shift. Briefly, mice were placed under an LDF device (moorVMS-LDF1) before and after the suture was successfully inserted through CCA at RP34D. Connect the probe to the Laser Doppler Flowmeter, turn on the device to start measuring, determine the brain area you wish to measure, position the Laser Doppler probe on the desired brain area, record the data, export the raw data and analysis.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study aims to understand the role of endothelial cell differentiation into pericytes in the restoration of blood-brain barrier function after ischemic stroke. Identification of pericytes derived from endothelial cells and the involvement of myeloid cell-derived TGFβ1 signaling are <bold>compelling</bold> new findings, but future studies will be needed to validate the origin and nature of these pericytes. The work will be of interest to blood-brain barrier and basic and translational stroke researchers.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Li and colleagues study the fate of endothelial cells in a mouse model of ischemic stroke. Using genetic lineage tracing approaches, they find that endothelial cells give rise to non-endothelial cells, which they term &quot;E-pericytes.&quot; They further show that depleting these cells exacerbates blood-brain barrier leakage and worsens functional recovery. The authors also provide evidence that endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, myeloid cell-derived TGFβ1, and endothelial TGFβRII are involved in this process. These are potentially interesting findings, however, the experimental evidence that endothelial cells undergo transdifferentiation to non-endothelial cells is weak, as is the evidence that these cells are pericytes. Addressing this foundational weakness will facilitate interpretation of the other findings.</p>
<p>In this revised manuscript, the authors corrected labeling errors and included negative controls for flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry data. They did not, however, substantively address the major weaknesses below related to rigorously demonstrating the cellular origin and identity of &quot;E-pericytes.&quot;</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The authors address an important question about blood vessel function and plasticity in the context of stroke.</p>
<p>(2) The authors use a variety of genetic approaches to understand cell fate in the context of stroke. Particularly commendable is the use of several complementary lineage tracing strategies, including an intersectional strategy requiring both endothelial Cre activity and subsequent mural cell NG2 promoter activity.</p>
<p>(3) The authors address upstream cellular and molecular mechanisms, including roles for myeloid-derived TGFβ.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors use Cdh5-CreERT2; Ai47 mice to permanently label endothelial cells and their progeny with eGFP. They then isolate eGFP+ cells from control and MCAO RP7D and RP34D brains, and use single cell RNA-seq to identify the resulting cell types. Theoretically, all eGFP+ cells should be endothelial cells or their progeny. This is a very powerful and well-conceived experiment. The authors use the presence of a pericyte cluster as evidence that endothelial to pericyte transdifferentiation occurs. However, pericytes are also present in the scRNA-seq data from sham mice, as are several other cell types such as fibroblasts and microglia. This suggests that pericytes and these other cell types might have been co-purified (e.g., as doublets) with eGFP+ endothelial cells during FACS and may not themselves be eGFP+. Pericyte-endothelial doublets are common in scRNA-seq given that these cell types are closely and tightly associated. Additionally, tight association (e.g., via peg-socket junctions) can cause fragments of endothelial cells to be retained on pericytes (and vice-versa) during dissociation. Finally, it is possible that after stroke or during the dissociation process, endothelial cells lyse and release eGFP that could be taken up by other cell types. All of these scenarios could lead to purification of cells that were not derived (transdifferentiated) from endothelial cells. Authors note that the proportion of pericytes increased in the stroke groups, but it does not appear this experiment was replicated and thus this conclusion is not supported by statistical analysis. The results of pseudotime and trajectory analyses rely on the foundation that the pericytes in this dataset are endothelial-derived, which, as discussed above, has not been rigorously demonstrated.</p>
<p>(2) I have the same concern regarding inadvertent purification of cells that were not derived from endothelial cells in the context of the bulk RNA-seq experiment (Fig. S4), especially given the sample-to-sample variability in gene expression in the RP34D, eGFP+ non-ECs group (e.g., only 2/5 samples are enriched for mesenchymal transcription factor Tbx18, only 1/5 samples are enriched for mural cell TF Heyl). If the sorted eGFP+ non-ECs were pericytes, I would expect a strong and consistent pericyte-like gene expression profile.</p>
<p>(3) Authors use immunohistochemistry to understand localization, morphology, and marker expression of eGFP+ cells in situ. The representative &quot;E-pericytes&quot; shown in Fig. 3A-D are not associated with blood vessels, and the authors' quantification also shows that the majority of such cells are not vessel-associated (&quot;avascular&quot;). By definition, pericytes are a component of blood vessels and are embedded within the vascular basement membrane. Thus, concluding that these cells are pericytes (&quot;E-pericytes&quot;) may be erroneous.</p>
<p>(4) CD13 flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry are used extensively to identify pericytes. In the context of several complementary lineage tracing strategies noted in Strength #2, CD13 immunohistochemistry is the only marker used to identify putative pericytes (Fig. S3J-M). In stroke, CD13 is not specific to pericytes; dendritic cells and other monocyte-derived cells express CD13 (Anpep) in mouse brain after stroke (PMID: 38177281, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://anratherlab.shinyapps.io/strokevis/">https://anratherlab.shinyapps.io/strokevis/</ext-link>).</p>
<p>(5) Authors conclude that &quot;EC-specific overexpression of the Tgfbr2 protein by a virus (Tgfbr2) decreases Evans blue leakage, promotes CBF recovery, alleviates neurological deficits and facilitates spontaneous behavioral recovery after stroke by increasing the number of E-pericytes.&quot; All data in Fig. 10, however, compare endothelial Tgfbr2 overexpression to a DsRed overexpression control. There is no group in which Tgfbr2 is overexpressed but &quot;E-pericytes&quot; are eliminated with DTA (this is done in Fig. 9B, but this experiment lacks the Tgfbr2 overexpression-only control). Thus, the observed functional outcomes cannot be ascribed to &quot;E-pericytes&quot;; it remains possible that endothelial Tgfbr2 overexpression affects EB leakage, CBF, and behavior through alternative mechanisms.</p>
<p>In response to this comment, authors wrote: &quot;in Figures 9A-B, we observed no significant difference in Evans blue leakage between the Tgfbr2 overexpression group and the Tgfbr2 overexpression + DTA group (P=0.8153), this suggests that the impact of Tgfbr2 overexpression on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is primarily attributed from the E-pericytes generated by Tgfbr2 expression.&quot;</p>
<p>I do not see data from a Tgfbr2 overexpression-only group in Fig. 9B. Further, I do not understand authors' logic: If the mechanism by which EC Tgfbr2 overexpression acts to reduce BBB leakage is by increasing the number of &quot;E-pericytes,&quot; depleting &quot;E-pericytes&quot; with DTA in this context should increase BBB leakage.</p>
<p>(6) Single-cell and bulk RNA-seq data are not available in a public repository (such as GEO). Depositing these data would facilitate their independent reevaluation and reuse.</p>
<p>In response to this comment, authors indicated they submitted data to GEO, but did not provide an accession number.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The data and experiments presented in that study convincingly show that a subpopulation of endothelial cells undergo transformation into pericyte-like cells after stroke in mice. These so-called &quot;E-pericytes&quot; are protective and might present a new target for stroke recovery. The authors used a huge battery of different techniques and modified signaling pathways and cellular interactions using several genetic and pharmacological tools to show that TGFbeta and EndoMT are causes of this transformation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The amount of different genetic and pharmacological approaches in combination with sophisticated techniques such as single-cell RNAseq is impressive and convincing. The results support their conclusions and the authors achieved their aims. The findings will strongly impact the field of cerebrovascular recovery after stroke and might open up new therapeutic targets.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In addition to improving the written and graphical presentation of the results, there is only one point I would like to see clarified: the inclusion of additional experiments, even if they have already been performed but are not applicable due to methodological difficulties regarding the role of Procr+ cells. Negative results also help the scientific community avoid unnecessary experiments and advance understanding.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s recommendation to explore more convincing data, including staining, FACS, and scRNA-seq analysis. We initially employed traditional lineage tracing methods to demonstrate that endothelial cells can transform into pericytes after stroke. We utilized Cdh5CreERT2;Ai47 mice, Tie2-Dre;Mfsd2aCreER;Ai47 mice, and AAV-BI30 virus-infected Ai47 mice. However, in our validation of the transformed cells as pericytes, there are limitations to our results. While three pericyte markers (CD13, NG2, and PDGFRβ) were used in Cdh5CreERT2;Ai47 mice, only one marker (CD13) was applied in Tie2Dre; Mfsd2aCreER;Ai47 and AAV-BI30 virus-infected Ai47 mice. This is insufficient, and the other two pericyte markers (NG2 and PDGFRβ) need to be verified in these models.</p>
<p>At scRNA-seq, although we observed an increased proportion of pericyte/EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells after stroke, we did not rule out potential contamination by pericyte cells, nor did we include sufficient replicates. To address these issues, we can explore additional methods for analyzing scRNA-seq data, increasing sample replicates, and eliminating pericyte contamination using advanced algorithms. Furthermore, we can use chimeric-related mutations to compare normal endothelial cells, normal pericytes, endothelial-derived pericytes (E-pericytes), and intermediate fibroblast-like cells at the DNA level. This approach will help identify and trace chimeric-related mutations across different cell types and developmental stages. Finally, we can track the entire process of endothelial cell transformation into pericytes using two-photon imaging in vivo.</p>

<p>Thank you for your thoughtful comment.</p>
<p>Indeed, we face the challenge of obtaining pure cells. As the reviewer has pointed out, several factors may contribute to cell contamination. For instance, the meninges of adult mice are difficult to remove completely, which may lead to fibroblast contamination. Although Cdh5CreERT2 can specifically label endothelial cells in the normal brain parenchyma, there may still be very few unspecific cells in certain brain regions, such as the choroid plexus and periventricular areas, resulting in the presence of ependymal cells. To address these issues, we can improve our methodology by carefully removing the meninges, choroid plexus, and periventricular cells during sample preparation. Additionally, we need to increase the N of the transcriptome samples to enhance the reliability of our data.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) I have the same concern regarding the inadvertent purification of cells that were not derived from endothelial cells in the context of the bulk RNA-seq experiment (Figure S4), especially given the sample-to-sample variability in gene expression in the RP34D, eGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs-group (e.g., only 2/5 samples are enriched for mesenchymal transcription factor Tbx18, only 1/5 samples are enriched for mural cell TF Heyl). If the sorted eGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs were pericytes, I would expect a strong and consistent pericyte-like gene expression profile.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an interesting question.</p>
<p>Indeed, significant differences were observed in the expression of pericyte-related transcriptional profiles within the eGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs group. For instance, transcription factors such as Hic1 and Fosl1 were nearly absent in the eGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs group. We propose several potential explanations for these observations:</p>
<p>(1) The sorted eGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs group may contain other cell types, leading to contamination.</p>
<p>(2) The eGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs group may not uniformly express all pericyte-related transcriptional profiles.</p>
<p>(3) The temporal dynamics of transcription factor expression (i.e., different factors being expressed at different stages) could contribute to the observed variability.</p>
<p>(4) The heterogeneity in the timing of endothelial-to-pericyte transformation (i.e., some cells have already transformed into pericytes while others are in the process of transformation at the early stage) may result in significant differences in transcriptional profiles.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors use immunohistochemistry to understand localization, morphology, and marker expression of eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells in situ. The representative &quot;E-pericytes&quot; shown in Figure 3A-D are not associated with blood vessels, and the authors' quantification also shows that the majority of such cells are not vessel-associated (&quot;avascular&quot;). By definition, pericytes are a component of blood vessels and are embedded within the vascular basement membrane. Thus, concluding that these cells are pericytes (&quot;E-pericytes&quot;) may be erroneous.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, we found that 72.2% of E-pericytes were free and not associated with blood vessels. Normally, pericytes surround blood vessels and connect to endothelial cells. However, in certain diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and diabetic encephalopathy, pericytes can detach from blood vessels. In our stroke model, we observed that pericytes detach from blood vessels. This phenomenon can be explained by two possible scenarios:</p>
<p>(1) After endothelial cells transform into E-pericytes, the E-pericytes detach from blood vessels due to the pathological environment following stroke.</p>
<p>(2) After stroke, blood vessel function is impaired, leading to vascular degeneration. Endothelial cells shed from the blood vessels and subsequently transform into E-pericytes.</p>
<p>Therefore, preventing pericyte detachment from blood vessels after stroke represents an important scientific challenge.</p>

<p>(4) CD13 flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry are used extensively to identify pericytes. In the context of several complementary lineage tracing strategies noted in Strength #2, CD13 immunohistochemistry is the only marker used to identify putative pericytes (Figure S3J-M).

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their valuable input. In the context of stroke, CD13 is not specific to pericytes. Additionally, pericytes lack a single specific marker; instead, their identity is determined by a combination of multiple markers. To more convincingly validate the identity of pericytes, it is necessary to incorporate additional pericyte markers alongside several complementary lineage tracing strategies.</p>

<p>(5) The authors conclude that &quot;EC-specific overexpression of the Tgfbr2 protein by a virus (Tgfbr2) decreases Evans blue leakage, promotes CBF recovery, alleviates neurological deficits and facilitates spontaneous behavioral recovery after stroke by increasing the number of E-pericytes.&quot; All data in Figure 10, however, compare endothelial Tgfbr2 overexpression to a DsRed overexpression control.

<p>We thank the reviewer for their valuable comment. Although in Figures 9A-B, we observed no significant difference in Evans blue leakage between the Tgfbr2 overexpression group and the Tgfbr2 overexpression + DTA group (P=0.8153), this suggests that the impact of Tgfbr2 overexpression on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is primarily attributed from the E-pericytes generated by Tgfbr2 expression. Furthermore, in Figure 10A, the inclusion of the Tgfbr2 overexpression + DTA group would provide stronger evidence that the effects of Tgfbr2 overexpression on the BBB and neurobehavioral outcomes are mainly due to the E-pericytes derived from Tgfbr2 expression.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>In this study, Li et al. reported that endothelial cells in the brain can differentiate into pericytes to promote the restoration of blood-brain barrier (BBB) function after stroke. Understanding the mechanisms underlying BBB restoration post-stroke is crucial to the field. Using lineage tracing, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and immunostaining, Li et al. detected the transdifferentiation of endothelial cells (ECs) into E-pericytes in the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. The specific knockout of Tgfbr2 in ECs reduced the number of E-pericytes, exacerbated BBB leakage, and worsened neurological deficits. This observation of EC to pericyte differentiation is novel; however, the conclusions at this stage are not fully supported by the evidence provided.</p>
<p>(1) The authors claimed, based on the EdU assay, that 12.9% of pericytes present at RP34D originated from self-proliferation, while the origin of the remaining 27.6% of new pericytes remains unclear. This raises concerns, as the EdU assay is not 100% efficient in detecting all proliferating cells. If EdU<sup>+</sup> ECs account for fewer than 10% of all ECs, it follows that other EdU-ECs must have alternative origins.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>That is an interesting question. To address this issue, we need to consider the following aspects:</p>
<p>(1) The EdU assay is not 100% efficient in detecting all proliferating cells, which means that the actual proportion of proliferating pericytes may be higher than 12.9%, while the proportion of pericytes from other sources may be lower than 27.6% (as determined by FACS). This is consistent with the observation in Figure 3H (immunofluorescence analysis), where EGFP<sup>+</sup> pericytes accounted for only 24.5% of all pericytes.</p>
<p>(2) The dose of EdU administered in our study was relatively high (200 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection, daily), which may increase the efficiency of EdU labeling.</p>
<p>(3) When EdU<sup>+</sup> endothelial cells (ECs) constitute less than 10% of all ECs, it does suggest that EdU-ECs could be a source of pericytes. However, at least EdU<sup>+</sup> ECs cannot transform into pericytes, as we did not detect any EdU<sup>+</sup>EGFP<sup>+</sup> pericytes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The reference for Cdh5CreERT2 is cited as 25, which is a review article published in ATVB. This review lists many different drivers, and the specific Cdh5CreERT2 line used in this study is not identified. This specificity is critical for accurate lineage tracing of ECs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although the review I mentioned did not address this, the specificity of Cdh5CreERT2 in the brain has been demonstrated in other studies (Boyé K, et al. Nat Commun. 2022 Mar 4;13(1):1169; Patel A, et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2024 Dec 3;121(49):e2322124121). We have further confirmed that Cdh5CreERT2 specifically labels endothelial cells in the brain parenchyma (Figure S1). Additionally, we found nonspecific labeling in the blood (less than 1% CD45+ blood cells, primarily myeloid cells) and meninges outside the brain parenchyma. We ruled out nonspecific transdifferentiation labeling in the blood through bone marrow reconstitution experiments and in the meninges using in vivo two-photon imaging (results not shown).</p>

<p>(3) The scRNA-seq data should include GFP signals to track the increasing number of pericytes from early to late stages post-injury. This is the only independent method from staining to verify that the pericytes are indeed derived from GFP<sup>+</sup> ECs after brain injury. Sham samples should be utilized as strict side-by-side controls.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a valuable suggestion. We observed that, despite being positive for EGFP protein, only 50% of the sorted cells expressed the EGFP gene at the transcriptome level. This phenomenon has also been reported in other studies (Rodor J,et al a. Cardiovasc Res. 2022 Aug 24;118(11):2519-2534.). For these reasons, we did not rely on GFP signals to track the increase in pericyte numbers from early to late stages post-injury.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Since Ai47 is employed, there are three different variants of green fluorescent proteins, including ZsGreen, which may result in signals being spotted in the staining. The GFP signal detected could also represent dead cells that have lost CD31 expression.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The detected GFP signal could also originate from dead cells that have lost CD31 expression, which is a plausible explanation. As shown in Figure 3I, EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs peak at RP14D and then decline, suggesting that some EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs either die or revert to endothelial cells (ECs). Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that we captured some dead EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs; however, as indicated in Figure 3I, this proportion is likely less than 25%. Additionally, pericytes are prone to death in ischemic and hypoxic environments (Figure 1A), which explains why some of the transformed EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs may die. Nevertheless, at RP514D, we can still detect EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs, indicating that a subset of these cells can survive for an extended period (Figure S3F).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The quality of the staining images is not convincing, as some non-ECs and ECs are in close proximity, leading to potential artifacts in signal interpretation. The reviewer cannot rely solely on single staining techniques to be convinced of EC differentiation into pericytes. Although it has been reported that ECs can differentiate into pericytes during development, this phenomenon in the adult brain is surprising; thus, more rigorous evidence with strong lineage tracing data should be provided through multiple measurements.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Why some non-ECs and ECs are located nearby:</p>
<p>(1) Non-ECs exhibit characteristics of pericytes, which are typically adjacent to ECs.</p>
<p>(2) Could this proximity lead to potential artifacts in signal interpretation? We believe this is unlikely, as we also observed a significant number of non-ECs located far from ECs on blood vessels (Figure 3A-B, Figure S3M).</p>
<p>(3) Three pericyte markers (CD13, NG2, and PDGFRβ) were also used to verify the transformed cells, while the three pericyte markers were not expressed in normal endothelial cells.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) FACS (Fluorescence-activated cell sorting) should be employed to quantitatively assess the contribution of GFP<sup>+</sup> ECs to pericytes at each stage after injury, compared to sham controls.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, if the contribution of GFP<sup>+</sup> ECs to pericytes could be assessed at each time point, the role of E-pericytes in the pericyte pool could be better explained, and the proportion of E-pericytes would become more prominent. In Figure 3, we did not use FACS to evaluate the contribution of GFP<sup>+</sup> ECs to pericytes at each stage post-injury. Instead, we only assessed the ratio of EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs to all EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells. However, we did verify the contribution of GFP<sup>+</sup> ECs (E-pericytes) to pericytes at RP34D using FACS (CD13+ DsRed/CD13 = 25.6%, Figure 4C). This ratio is consistent with the immunofluorescence data (Figure 3H).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) In Tie2Dre;Mfsd2aCrexER;Ai47 mice, ECs in the brain are specifically labeled, indicating that ECs could give rise to CD13+ EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs at RP34D (Figure S3L). However, the GFP signal for Ai47 is not homogeneous, displaying many spotted patterns. Using tdTomato as an alternative for detection could enhance clarity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We repeated the experiment using tdTomato as the reporter gene in mice and observed results consistent with those obtained using Ai47 as the reporter gene. For consistency, all results presented are based on Ai47. Regarding the spotted patterns observed with Ai47, this phenomenon can be attributed to the relatively low laser intensity (2%). Higher laser intensity would cause overexposure of EGFP<sup>+</sup> ECs. To address the issue of spotted patterns in Ai47 imaging, we can improve the visualization of complete cell morphology (as shown in Figure S3M) by increasing the gain value, which enhances the background signal.</p>

<p>(8) The data concerning the genetic ablation of pericytes lacks specificity. There is insufficient evidence to support that DTA is specifically expressed in E-pericytes. The authors should utilize DTR (Diphtheria Toxin Receptor) and confirm that DTR expression is restricted to pericytes derived from GFP<sup>+</sup> ECs. Treatment with diphtheria toxin, but not PBS as a control, should specifically ablate these E-pericytes without affecting any other GFP-pericytes in the brain following injury.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did not verify that DTA expression was restricted to E-pericytes. To ensure that DTA is only expressed in converted E-pericytes, we employed two strategies:</p>
<p>(1) Specific Targeting of Endothelial Cells: We used the AAV-BI30 virus to specifically infect endothelial cells. Although not 100% exclusive, 98.5% of the expression occurred in endothelial cells, with minimal infection in neurons and microglia. Additionally, we combined this with Cdh5CreERT2 to control the DIO action in the virus. This means that only endothelial cells expressing both Cdh5CreERT2 and infected with AAV-BI30 could undergo cell fate changes and transform into pericytes, subsequently expressing markers such as NG2 and driving DTA expression in E-pericytes (Figure 4A).</p>
<p>(2) Validation of DTA Expression: To prevent off-target expression of DTA in other cell types, we plan to verify DTA protein expression using specific antibodies to confirm whether DTA is expressed in unintended cells. Alternatively, as suggested, we could utilize the Diphtheria Toxin Receptor (DTR) system. By ensuring that DTR expression is restricted to pericytes derived from GFP<sup>+</sup> ECs, treatment with diphtheria toxin would specifically ablate these E-pericytes without affecting other GFP- pericytes in the brain post-injury.</p>

<p>(9) There is currently no convincing genetic data demonstrating that Tgfb signaling overexpression or deletion modulates the transdifferentiation of ECs to pericytes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, this is an important consideration. Although we knocked out the TGFβ receptor in endothelial cells (ECs) and observed a reduction in the formation of E-pericytes (Figure 6D and 6G), it would be more informative to specifically knockout the Tgfb gene in myeloid cells or monocyte-macrophage lineages to determine whether these cells are the primary source of TGFβ driving endothelial cell transformation. Additionally, injecting TGFβ protein directly into the brains of mice could help explore whether exogenous TGFβ promotes the formation of E-pericytes.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) The authors write: &quot;When Tgfbr2 was overexpressed and DTA was expressed specifically in the same ECs, DTA prevented the EC-specific overexpression of the Tgfbr2 gene and increased the proportion of E-pericytes.&quot;. The authors' strategy for DTA expression involves the NG2 promoter, which, in principle, is not active in ECs. Thus how can DTA be &quot;expressed specifically in the same ECs&quot; and how can DTA &quot;prevent EC-specific overexpression&quot; of Tgfbr2?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our purpose is not clearly expressed. The statement should be revised to: “When Tgfbr2 was overexpressed to increase E-pericytes and DTA was expressed in transformed cells to deplete E-pericytes, we found that there was no significant change in the number of E-pericytes in the Tgfbr2 + DTA group compared with the DTA group.”</p>

<p>(8) The interpretation of Evans blue leakage as &quot;low molecular weight&quot; leakage should be revised since Evans blue binds serum albumin and thus it is the molecular weight of this complex (~67 kDa) that is relevant.</p>

<p>We agree with the reviewer. Yes, it should not be stated that Evans blue is low molecular weight, as it binds to serum albumin to form complexes. The text has been revised to: “Interestingly, no obvious leakage of dextran-rhodamine B (~70 kDa) (Figure S8C) or Texas Red (~71 kDa) was detected (Figure S8D). However, the elimination of E-pericytes allowed evans blue and trypan blue to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB).”</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>In Figure S9A, we assessed changes in blood flow using laser speckle imaging. Laser speckle imaging relies on random interference patterns formed by scattered light when a laser strikes tissue. Moving red blood cells alter the contrast of the speckle pattern: faster blood flow results in quicker speckle changes and lower contrast, while slower blood flow leads to slower speckle changes and higher contrast. By analyzing these changes in speckle contrast, blood flow dynamics can be evaluated in real-time and non-invasively.</p>
<p>In Figure S9B, we measured blood flow changes using Laser Doppler flowmetry. When a laser interacts with flowing blood, the moving red blood cells scatter the light, causing a frequency shift (Doppler shift). Faster blood flow results in a greater frequency shift, while slower blood flow leads to a smaller frequency shift. By detecting the frequency shift of the scattered light, blood flow velocity and changes can be measured in real time and non-invasively. In Laser Doppler Flowmetry (LDF), the unit of the vertical axis is typically Perfusion Units (PU). PU is a relative unit used to represent changes in blood flow rather than absolute blood flow velocity. These methods have now been further explained in the diagram.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We captured images and quantified neurons in the cortex and striatum of the brain. Our statistical analysis further demonstrated that, at RP34D, the presence of E-pericytes in the brain does not exhibit region-specificity. Instead, the formation of E-pericytes is driven by TGFβ1, which is regulated by immune cells. Ultimately, the distribution and activity of these immune cells are influenced by the severity of ischemia and hypoxia.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>The reason for referencing this literature is to highlight that endothelial cells (ECs) during breast development can give rise to pericytes, which serves as background knowledge supporting our research. To further explore this phenomenon in brain, we used ProcrCreERT2;Ai47 mice subjected to MCAO (middle cerebral artery occlusion) to investigate whether Procr+ ECs could transform into pericytes, similar to what occurs in mammary glands. However, since ProcrCreERT2 labels not only ECs but also pericytes in the brain, the results did not achieve our goal and were therefore not included in the study.</p>
