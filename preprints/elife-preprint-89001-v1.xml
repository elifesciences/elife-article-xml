<title>Abstract</title>
<p>What genomic sequences make protein-coding genes generate divergent expression in closely related species, specifically, differentiate humans from apes, puzzle many researchers. Many studies examined species-specific gene birth, gene loss, and changes in promoters and transcription factor binding sites, but the identification and impact of human-specific lncRNAs remain unexplored. This study identified human-specific lncRNAs from GENCODE-annotated human lncRNAs, predicted their DNA binding sites (DBSs) genome-wide, and analyzed the DBSs and their counterparts in modern humans (CEU, CHB, and YRI), archaic humans (Altai Neanderthals, Denisovans, and Vindija Neanderthals), and chimpanzees. The results reveal how human-specific lncRNAs and their DBSs have transcriptionally regulated gene expression human-specifically. The rewiring of gene expression has undergone continuous evolution, significantly changed gene expression in the brain, promoted the adaptive evolution of humans, and influenced differences in modern humans. These results reveal the importance of human-specific lncRNAs (for human evolution) and highlight the importance of other species-specific lncRNAs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Genomic changes that drive evolution include gene birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kaessmann, 2010</xref>), gene loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Albalat and Canestro, 2016</xref>), and changes in regulatory sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Prud’homme et al., 2007</xref>). Small genomic differences between humans and other hominids, but significant phenotypic and behavioral differences, make what genomic changes at what time critically drove human evolution an enduring puzzle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Anton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Pollen et al., 2023</xref>). Waves of studies have identified genes that promote human brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Evans et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fiddes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mekel-Bobrov et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Pinson et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Suzuki et al., 2018</xref>). However, conclusions from gene birth-centered studies are controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Currat et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Timpson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Yu et al., 2007</xref>). In particular, genes important for brain development (e.g., <italic>NOTCH2NL</italic> and <italic>ASPM</italic>) do not necessarily account for many human traits that preceded or coincided with brain enlargement. Recent studies revealed the importance of regulatory sequences for human evolution, including new sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Liu et al., 2021</xref>), lost sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">McLean et al., 2011</xref>), sequences showing accelerated evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mangan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Prabhakar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Whalen and Pollard, 2022</xref>), and the turnover of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Krieger et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Otto et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). An unexplored question is how simian- and human-specific lncRNAs, with the sequences of their DNA binding sites, regulate conserved genes and drive human evolution.</p>
<p>On this question, experimental studies have generated multiple findings. (a) The chimpanzee and human genomes are almost 99% identical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium, 2005</xref>). (b) About one-third of human lncRNAs are primate-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Derrien et al., 2012</xref>). (c) Species-specific lncRNAs have distinct expression profiles in organs of different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Sarropoulos et al., 2019</xref>). (d) Many lncRNAs can bind to DNA sequences by forming RNA:DNA triplexes (Abu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Almakarem et al., 2012</xref>), thereby recruiting histone and DNA modification enzymes to binding sites to regulate nearby gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lee, 2009</xref>; Roadmap <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Epigenomics et al., 2015</xref>). (e) Approximately 40% of differentially expressed genes in humans result from interspecies epigenetic differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hernando-Herraez et al., 2015</xref>). Compared with gene-centered hypotheses of human evolution, these findings suggest an alternative hypothesis – distinctly rewired gene expression by human-specific (HS) lncRNAs and their DNA binding sites has critically promoted human evolution and determined human traits.</p>
<p>Orthologous lncRNA genes can be identified by sequence search by structure and sequence alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Nawrocki, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Nawrocki and Eddy, 2013</xref>). HS lncRNAs can be identified upon orthologues of human lncRNAs in other mammals. RNA:DNA triplexes follow specific base-pairing rules (Abu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Almakarem et al., 2012</xref>). These rules allow the prediction of lncRNAs’ DNA binding domains (DBD) and DNA binding sites (DBS) (DBDs and DBSs indicate predicted sequences of DNA binding domains and binding sites) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wen et al., 2022</xref>). Gene expression in most human organs and tissues has been profiled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">GTEx Consortium, 2017</xref>). Genomes of modern humans, archaic humans, and multiple apes have been sequenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1000 Genomes Project Consortium et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Prufer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Pru fer et al., 2013</xref>). These results enable us to examine the above alternative hypothesis.</p>
<p>HS lncRNAs and their DBSs may have occurred in three situations – (a) HS lncRNAs occurred before their DBSs, (b) HS lncRNAs and their DBSs occurred simultaneously, (c) HS lncRNAs occurred after their DBSs. It is also unknown which situation the rewiring hypothesis corresponds to. In this study, we identified HS lncRNAs upon the orthologues of the GENCODE-annotated human lncRNA genes in 16 mammalian genomes and predicted HS lncRNAs’ DBDs and DBSs in the genome of modern humans (CEU, CHB, and YRI) and these DBSs’ counterparts in the genomes of archaic humans (Altai Neanderthals, Denisovans, Vindija Neanderthals), and chimpanzees (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Then, we analyzed the sequences and evolution of HS lncRNAs and their DBSs, functional enrichment of target genes, and impact of HS lncRNA regulation on gene expression in GTEx organs and tissues in archaic and modern humans. Our genome and transcriptome analyses suggest that HS lncRNAs and their DBSs have substantially and distinctly rewired gene expression during human evolution. The rewiring of gene expression also greatly determines differences between human populations.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>HS lncRNAs regulate diverse genes and transcripts</title>
<p>After searching for the orthologues of the 13562 GENCODE-annotated human lncRNA genes (v18) in 16 mammalian genomes by sequence and structure alignment using the <italic>Infernal</italic> program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Nawrocki, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Nawrocki et al., 2009</xref>), we identified 66 HS lncRNA genes (Supplementary Table 1). We predicted HS lncRNAs’ DBSs in the 5000 bp promoter regions of the 179128 Ensembl-annotated transcripts (release 79) using <italic>the LongTarget</italic> program (Supplementary Note 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lin et al., 2019</xref>). 105141 strong DBSs (binding affinity &gt; 60, mean length &gt; 147 bp) were identified in 96789 transcripts of 23396 genes, and 152836 weak DBSs (36 &lt; binding affinity &lt; 60) were identified in 127898 transcripts of 33185 genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>; Supplementary Table 2, 3). Genes and transcripts whose promoter regions contain the DBS of an HS lncRNA were assumed targets of the HS lncRNA. Several HS lncRNAs have DBSs in nearly all genes and transcripts (e.g., RP11-423H2.3 has strong DBSs in 73855 transcripts of 17941 genes), and only about 1.5% of target genes (0.6% of target transcripts) are human-specific (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Many transcripts have DBSs for multiple HS lncRNAs, many HS lncRNAs have multiple DBSs in a single transcript, and HS lncRNAs themselves show complex targeting relationships (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>; Supplementary Note 2). These findings suggest that HS lncRNAs substantially regulate gene expression.</p>
<p>DBS prediction was validated and supported by multiple methods and datasets (Supplementary Note 1; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig 1</xref>-<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). (a) DBSs of HS lncRNAs overlap well with experimentally identified DNA methylation and histone modification signals in multiple cell lines (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genome.UCSC.edu">https://genome.UCSC.edu</ext-link>). (b) DBSs of NEAT1 and MALAT1 overlap well with experimentally identified DNA binding sites of NEAT1, MALAT1, and MEG3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mondal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">West et al., 2014</xref>). (c) Many DBSs co-localize with annotated cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) in genes’ promoter regions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genome.UCSC.edu">https://genome.UCSC.edu</ext-link>). (d) We used CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out the DBD (100-200 bp) of seven lncRNAs (three HS lncRNAs and four wrongly transcribed lncRNAs) in multiple cell lines and performed RNA-seq before and after DBD knockout. Gene expression analysis revealed that the |fold change| of target genes was significantly larger than the |fold change| of non-target genes (one-sided Mann-Whitney test, p = 3.1e-72, 1.49e-114, and 1.12e-206 for the HS lncRNA RP13-516M14.1, RP11-426L16.8, and SNORA59B, and p = 2.58e-09, 6.49e-41, 0.034, and 5.23e-07 for the four wrongly transcribed lncRNAs). The results suggest that the changed expression of target genes was caused by the knockout of DBDs. (e) Finally, the <italic>LongTarget</italic> program uses the Smith-Waterman local alignment to simultaneously identify DBDs and DBSs. The alignment algorithm determines that a DBS of 147 bp is extremely unlikely to be generated by chance (p &lt; 8.2e-19 to 1.5e-48).</p>

<label>2.</label><title>Target genes characterize human evolution and traits</title>
<p>Since strong and weak DBSs could occur early and late in human evolution, we examined whether their target genes were enriched in specific functions important for human evolution. We sorted target genes by DBS’s binding affinity, chose the top 2000 genes (DBS sequence &gt; 252 bp, DBS binding affinity &gt; 151) and bottom 2000 genes (DBS sequence &lt; 60 bp, DBS binding affinity &gt; 36), and performed over-representation analysis using the <italic>g:Profiler</italic> program and Gene Ontology (GO) database (Supplementary Table 4). The two target gene sets are co-enriched in GO terms important for human evolution, including “neuron projection development” (GO:0031175), “learning” (GO:0007612)), “regulation of anatomical structure size” (GO: GO:0090066), “head development” (GO:0060322), and “regulation of locomotion” (GO:0040012)) (Supplementary Note 3; Supplementary Table 4). 514 DBSs have binding affinity &gt; 300 (DBS sequences &gt; 500 bp) (Supplementary Table 5). Genes containing these strongest DBSs include <italic>IFNAR1</italic> and <italic>NFATC1</italic> (important for immune function), <italic>KIF21B</italic> and <italic>NTSR1</italic> (critical for neural development), <italic>SLC2A11</italic> and <italic>SLC2A1</italic> (involved in glucose usage), <italic>BAIAP3</italic> and <italic>TAS1R3</italic> (a brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor and a receptor for the sweet taste response), and some primate-specific noncoding RNA genes (e.g., <italic>CTD-3224I3.3</italic> which is highly expressed in the cerebellum, lung, and testis) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, genes with weak DBSs are enriched in GO terms including “response to alcohol” (GO:0097305), “response to temperature stimulus” (GO:0009266), and “DNA methylation or demethylation” (GO:0044728), and “female pregnancy” (GO:0007565) (Supplementary Note 3; Supplementary Table 4).</p>

<label>3.</label><title>The rewiring of gene expression has greatly evolved</title>
<p>The human genome is almost 99%, 99%, and 98% identical to the genomes of chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Prufer et al., 2012</xref>). Given these HS lncRNA genes, we assessed to what extent their DBS sequences are human-specific (whether DBSs occurred before, at the same time, or after HS lncRNAs). 97.81% of strong DBSs were found to have counterparts in chimpanzees, suggesting that most DBS sequences occurred before HS lncRNAs.</p>
<p>To examine the evolution of HS lncRNAs and their DBSs during human evolution, we identified their counterparts in Altai Neanderthals, Denisovans, and Vindija Neanderthals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Prufer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Pru fer et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). HS lncRNAs and strong DBSs have counterparts in these archaic humans, but the distances of HS lncRNAs are small than the distances of DBSs between archaic and modern humans (all “distance” means distance per base). We computed DBS distances in two ways – from the human ancestor (downloaded from the EBI website) to chimpanzees, archaic humans, and modern humans (the first type of distances) and between the modern humans and chimpanzees and archaic humans (the second type of distances). In the first type of distances, many DBSs’ distances from the human ancestor to modern humans were smaller than to archaic humans. For example, DBSs in the top 20% (5033) genes in the human ancestor have distances &gt; 0.015 to modern humans, but more DBSs have distances &gt; 0.015 to Altai Neanderthals, Denisovans, and even chimpanzees (Supplementary Note 3). This defect may be caused by that the human ancestor was built using six primates without archaic humans. The second type of distances agree well with the phylogenetic distances between chimpanzees, archaic humans, and modern humans and suggest that greatly changed sequences occurred in very limited DBSs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1AE</xref>). For example, DBSs in the top 20% (4248) genes in chimpanzees have distances &gt; 0.034, and DBSs having distances &gt; 0.034 in genes in Altai Neanderthals, Denisovans, and Vindija Neanderthals are 1256, 2514, and 134 (Supplementary Table 6).</p>
<p>To examine whether the target genes of the mostly changed DBSs in chimpanzees and archaic humans are enriched in specific functions, we performed over-representation analysis for genes with using the <italic>g:Profiler</italic> program and Gene Ontology (GO) database. Since 4248, 1256, and 2514 genes in chimpanzees, Altai Neanderthals, and Denisovans have DBS distances &gt; 0.034 (to modern humans), to make the statistical significance comparable, we examined the top 1256 genes in each analysis. The two sets of genes with largest DBS distances from modern humans to chimpanzees and Altai Neanderthals are enriched in many common GO terms, but “behavior” (GO:0007610) and “cognition” (GO:0050890) have higher significance in Altai Neanderthals than in chimpanzees (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). In addition, only genes in Altai Neanderthals are also enriched in such GO terms as “learning” (GO:0007612), “learning or memory” (GO:0007611), and “glucose homeostasis” (GO:0042593). The 134 genes whose DBS distances &gt; 0.034 from Vindija Neanderthals to modern humans, as expected, are enriched only in two GO terms with low significance, including “smoothened signaling pathway” (GO:0007224) and “regulation of smoothened signaling pathway” (GO:0008589) (Supplementary Table 7). These results reveal that critical DBS changes occurred in genes involved in brain functions and some metabolism pathways in early archaic humans.</p>

<label>4.</label><title>Gene regulation by HS lncRNAs shows differences in modern humans</title>
<p>We next used the 1000 Human Genome data to analyze single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs with minimal allele frequency (MAF) ≥ 0.1) in DBSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1000 Genomes Project Consortium et al., 2012</xref>). Many DBSs were found to be highly polymorphic (Supplementary Table 8). The most SNP-rich DBSs (&gt; 10 SNPs, 5 times the average number of SNPs for all DBSs) are in genes important for human evolution, including <italic>IFNAR1</italic>, <italic>NFATC1</italic>, <italic>TAS1R3</italic>, <italic>INS</italic>, <italic>ST3GAL4</italic>, and <italic>FN3KRP</italic> (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These SNPs affect DBS binding affinity, no matter they are favored, neutral, or recessive. A feature of modern human diets is high sugar intake, which causes non-enzymatic oxidation of proteins (i.e., glycation) and deactivates protein functions. Among proteins encoded by genes with the most SNP-rich DBSs, TAS1R3 recognizes diverse natural and synthetic sweeteners, Insulin decreases blood glucose concentration, ST3GAL4 regulates protein glycosylation, and FN3KRP deglycates proteins. It worth noting that DBSs in these genes have counterparts with mostly changed sequences in chimpanzees and archaic humans (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), indicating human-specific evolution of the regulation of these genes.</p>

<p>We further used multiple statistical tests, including XP-CLR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2010</xref>), iSAFE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Akbari et al., 2018</xref>), Tajima’s D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tajima, 1989</xref>), Fay-Wu’s H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fay and Wu, 2000</xref>), the fixation index (Fst) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Weir and Cockerham, 1984</xref>), and linkage disequilibrium (LD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Slatkin, 2008</xref>), to detect selection signals in HS lncRNAs and strong DBSs in the human population CEU, CHB, and YRI (the representative populations of Europeans, Asians, and Africans). These tests detected selection signals in several HS lncRNA genes in CEU and CHB but not in YRI and selection signals in more DBSs in CEU and CHB than in YRI (Supplementary Note 4, 5; Supplementary Table 9, 10, 11).

<label>5.</label><title>SNPs in DBSs have cis-effects on gene expression</title>
<p>To examine the impact of DBS sequence differences on gene expression, we assessed the expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in DBSs using the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">GTEx Consortium, 2017</xref>). 1727 SNPs with MAF ≥ 0.1 in at least one population and absolute values of cis-effect size (ES) ≥ 0.5 in at least one tissue were identified in DBSs in autosomal genes (Supplementary Table 12,13). These eQTLs include 372 “conserved” ones (in DBSs in the three archaic and three modern humans) and 1020 “novel” ones (in DBSs only in the three modern humans). Many conserved eQTLs are in the brain and have high derived allele frequencies (DAFs) in all three modern populations. A notable eQTL that has high DAFs in all three populations and positive ES ≥ 0.5 in 44 out of 48 GTEx tissues is rs2246577 in the DBS in <italic>FN3KRP</italic>, whose encoded protein deglycates proteins to restore their function (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). On the other hand, many novel eQTLs are in a particular tissue and have population-specific DAFs (Supplementary Note 6).</p>
<p>We performed two analyses to examine that eQTLs in DBSs influence gene expression due to lncRNA-DBS interactions. First, we computed the expression correlation between HS lncRNAs and target transcripts with DBSs having eQTLs in specific tissues. Most (94%) HS lncRNA-target transcript pairs showed significant expression correlation in the tissues the eQTLs were identified (|Spearman’s rho| &gt; 0.3 and FDR &lt; 0.05). Second, we examined whether eQTLs are more enriched in DBSs than in promoter regions by computing and comparing the density of eQTLs in each DBS and each Ensembl-annotated promoter. The results confirm that eQTLs are more enriched in DBSs (one-sided Mann-Whitney test, p = 0.0) (Supplementary Note 6). Thus, many SNPs in DBSs have tissue-and population-specific cis-effects on gene expression.</p>

<p>We finally examined the impact of HS lncRNAs and their DBSs on gene expression in the GTEx tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">GTEx Consortium, 2017</xref>). 40 autosomal HS lncRNAs are expressed robustly (median TPM &gt; 0.1) in at least one tissue and form 198876 pairs with target transcripts in all tissues. 45% of these pairs show a significant expression correlation in specific tissues (Spearman’s |rho| &gt; 0.3 and FDR &lt; 0.05). In contrast, when randomly sampling 10000 pairs of lncRNAs and protein-coding transcripts genome-wide, the percent of pairs showing expression correlation with the same significance is only 2.3%. Notably, 56% of HS lncRNA-target transcript pairs with significant correlation are present in at least one brain region (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), indicating substantial gene expression regulation by HS lncRNAs in the brain.</p>

</fig>
<p>To verify the above conclusion, we analyzed nine experimental datasets (Supplementary Note 7). First, we analyzed two datasets of epigenetic studies (one examined H3K27ac and H3K4me2 profiling of human, macaque, and mouse corticogenesis, and the other examined gene expression and H3K27ac modification in eight brain regions in humans and four other primates) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Reilly et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). 84% and 73% of genes in the two datasets have DBSs for HS lncRNAs, significantly more enriched in HS lncRNA targets than the genome-wide background (p = 1.21e-21 and 1.2e-56, two-sided Fisher’s exact test). Second, we analyzed two datasets of PsychENCODE studies (one examined spatiotemporally differentially expressed genes and spatiotemporally differentially methylated sites in 16 brain regions, and the other examined the spatiotemporal transcriptomic divergence across human and macaque brain development) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). In the first dataset, 65 HS lncRNAs were expressed in all 16 brain regions, 109 transcripts had spatiotemporally differentially methylated sites in their promoters, and 56 of the 109 transcripts had DBSs for HS lncRNAs. In the second dataset, 8951 genes showed differential expression between the human and macaque brain, and 72% of differentially expressed genes in the human brain have DBSs of HS lncRNAs. Thus, both datasets show significant enrichment for HS lncRNA regulation. Third, three studies identified several genes critically regulating cortical expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Florio et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Suzuki et al., 2018</xref>). Of the 40 protein-coding genes reported by these studies, 29 have DBSs of HS lncRNAs in their promoter regions (Supplementary Table 14). Thus, these genes are enriched with DBSs of HS lncRNAs compared with the genome-wide background (p &lt; 0.01, two-sided Fisher’s exact test). Finally, we analyzed two datasets of brain organoids studies. By establishing and comparing cerebral organoids between humans, chimpanzees, and macaques, Pollen et al. identified 261 human-specific gene expression changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Pollen et al., 2019</xref>). By fusing human and chimpanzee iPS cells and differentiating the hybrid iPS cells into hybrid cortical spheroids, Agoglia et al. generated a panel of tetraploid human-chimpanzee hybrid iPS cells and identified thousands of genes with divergent expression between humans and chimpanzees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Agoglia et al., 2021</xref>). The 261 and 1102 genes in the two datasets are enriched with DBSs of HS lncRNAs compared with the genome-wide background (p = 1.2e-16 and 3.4e-74).</p>
<p>We next examined the evolution of the impact of HS lncRNAs and their DBSs on gene expression in the GTEx tissues. For each DBS in an HS lncRNA-target transcript pair correlated in a GTEx tissue, we computed the sequence distance of the DBS from modern humans to archaic humans. Then, we compared the distribution of DBS sequence distances in each tissue with the distribution of DBS sequence distances in all tissues (one-sided two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). DBSs in HS lncRNA-target transcript pairs correlated in brain regions have significantly changed sequence distances since the Altai Neanderthals and Denisovans (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting that gene expression regulation by HS lncRNAs in the brain has experienced significant evolution and that HS lncRNAs contributed greatly to rapid brain evolution. Results from other GTEx tissues, including Kidney_Cortex, Ovary, and Skin, also suggest that the rewired gene expression has influenced human evolution.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Modern humans differ from archaic humans and great apes little in genome sequences but greatly in phenotypes and behaviors, making what genomic differences critically determine the phenotypic and behavioral differences a compelling question. Several HS protein-coding genes promote the rapid expansion of neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fiddes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Florio et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Pinson et al., 2022</xref>). Variations in TFBS cause gene expression changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Franchini and Pollard, 2017</xref>). The rewiring of gene expression by TFs and TFBSs evolves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Johnson, 2017</xref>), so should the rewiring of gene expression by lncRNAs and their DBSs. However, the rewiring and evolution of the second case have been barely examined and poorly understood. This study identified HS lncRNAs and their DBSs, analyzed the rewiring and evolution of gene expression, and presents a new answer to the question of what genomic changes at what time critically drove human evolution. We performed seven CRISPR/Cas9 experiments to validate DBS prediction and analyzed multiple experimental datasets to validate our genome and transcriptome analyses. These results support the hypothesis that HS lncRNAs have distinctly rewired gene expression for adaptive evolution of humans.</p>
<p>Several findings are noteworthy. First, Neanderthal-inherited sequences have measurable impacts on gene expression, but the impacts are least detectable in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">McCoy et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we found that HS lncRNAs have more significantly influenced gene expression in the brain than in other tissues. Second, the regulation of genes by HS lncRNAs, making humans adapt to high sugar intake, has undergone great evolution. Third, genes regulated by HS lncRNAs are enriched in different functions at different stages. Fourth, old SNPs in DBSs are in genes regulating neural development, and new SNPs in DBSs are in genes regulating such processes as glucose metabolism.</p>
<p>The above findings help reveal the functions of HS lncRNAs and the adaptive evolution of humans and highlight the important functions of other species-specific lncRNAs. They also raise three questions. First, the protein-coding regions in the mouse and human genomes are about 85% identical, but many mouse lncRNAs are rodent-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Yue et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, a question is how mouse-specific lncRNAs specifically rewire gene expression in mice and how the rewiring influences the transcriptional differences between humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Breschi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hodge et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). Second, whether mice and other mammals have a lncRNA like RP11-423H2.3 that substantially rewires gene expression species-specifically. Third, the extent clade- and species-specific lncRNAs would make speciation and evolution preordained. These questions are of great interest and have practical importance.</p>

<p>LncRNAs bind to DNA sequences by forming RNA:DNA triplexes. Each triplex comprises triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFO) in the lncRNA and a triplex-targeting site (TTS) in the DNA sequence.

<p>We first aligned DBS sequences in the genomes of humans, chimpanzees, Altai Neanderthals, Denisovans, and Vindija Neanderthals using the <italic>MAFFT</italic>7 program for measuring sequence distances from modern humans to chimpanzees and archaic humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Katoh and Standley, 2013</xref>).

The two methods generated equivalent results. The largest distance between DBSs in humans and their counterparts in chimpanzees is 5.383. Since 2248 DBSs in 429 human genes do not have counterparts in chimpanzees, we assumed that the sequence distances of these DBSs between humans and chimpanzees were 10.0. Since the top 20% of DBSs in chimpanzees (including these 2248 DBSs) have distances ≥ 0.034, we used 0.034 as the threshold to identify the “mostly changed” DBSs in the chimpanzees and three archaic humans.</p>
<p>We determined human ancestral sequences of DBSs upon the human ancestor sequences from the EBI website, which were generated upon the EPO alignments of six primate species. We used the above-mentioned methods to compute DBSs’ sequence distances from the human ancestor to chimpanzees, archaic humans, and modern humans. We found that when the human-chimpanzee ancestral sequence has the ancestral sequence (which means the inferring of ancestral allele is of high confidence), DBS distances from the human ancestor to modern humans are larger than to archaic humans, but this situation only accounts for about 63.8%. For many DBSs, the distances from the human ancestor to modern humans are smaller than to archaic humans (especially Neanderthals and Denisovans) and even to chimpanzees. This defect may be caused by the absence of archaic humans in building the human ancestral sequence.</p>

First, we used the XP-CLR test (parameters = -w1 0.001 300 100 -p0 0.95, window size = 0.1 cM, grid size = 100 bp) to perform six pairwise genome-wide scans (i.e., CEU-CHB, CEU-YRI, CHB-CEU, CHB-YRI, YRI-CEU, and YRI-CHB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). The upper 1% of scores across the entire genome in each pairwise scan were 34.6 in the CEU-YRI scan, 16.8 in the CEU-CHB scan, 45.0 in the CHB-YRI scan, 26.9 in the CHB-CEU scan, 14.1 in the YRI-CEU scan, and 14.1 in the YRI-CHB scan. These scores were used as the thresholds of positive selection signals in these populations. Second, we used the <italic>iSAFE</italic> program to scan each genomic region that contains a HS lncRNA gene and its 500-kb upstream and downstream sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Akbari et al., 2018</xref>). Strongly selected loci were detected only in CEU and CHB. Third, we used the <italic>VCFtools</italic> program to calculate Tajima’s D values for each HS lncRNA gene in CEU, CHB, and YRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Danecek et al., 2011</xref>). The calculation was performed using a 1500-bp non-overlapping sliding window because the lengths of these genes exceed 1500 bp. To generate the background reference for judging the significant increase or decrease of Tajima’s D for HS lncRNA genes in a population, we calculated Tajima’s D values across the whole genome using a sliding window of 1500 bp. As values of Tajima’s D were compared with the background reference, a significant D&lt;0 and D&gt;0 indicate positive (or directional) selection and balancing selection, respectively, instead of population demography dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tajima, 1989</xref>). Fourth, we used the integrated Fst to detect positive selection signals in HS lncRNA genes. The Fst of each HS lncRNA gene was computed for three comparisons, i.e., CEU-YRI, CHB-YRI, and CHB-CEU. Extreme Fst values of SNPs were detected in HS lncRNA genes in the comparisons of CEU-YRI and CHB-YRI. Since allele frequencies for different loci vary in a genome and genetic drift may have different effects at different loci, we used a sliding window of 1500 for comparing Fst values of HS lncRNA genes with the genome-wide background. Extreme Fst values indicate positive selection. Finally, we applied linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis to each HS lncRNA gene. We computed the pairwise LD (r²) in CEU, CHB, and YRI for common SNPs (with minimal allele frequency (MAF) ≥ 0.05 in at least one population) in HS lncRNA genes and DBSs using the <italic>PLINK</italic> program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Purcell et al., 2007</xref>). Significantly increased LD was detected in SNPs in HS lncRNA genes in CEU and CHB. The LD patterns were portrayed using the <italic>Haploview</italic> program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Barrett et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we used the above tests to detect positive selection signals in DBSs. First, the 100 bp grid size of the XP-CLR test also allowed the detection of selection signals in DBSs. Second, we performed the Tajima’s D and Fay-Wu’s H tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fay and Wu, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tajima, 1989</xref>). We calculated Tajima’s D values for each DBS in CEU, CHB, and YRI using the <italic>VCFtools</italic> program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Danecek et al., 2011</xref>), with a sliding window of 147 bp (the mean length of strong DBSs). To generate the background reference for judging the significant increase or decrease of Tajima’s D in a population, we calculated Tajima’s D values across the whole genome using the same sliding window. As values of Tajima’s D were compared with the background reference, a significant D&lt;0 and D&gt;0 indicate positive (or directional) selection and balancing selection, respectively. Fay-Wu’s H values were calculated similarly using the <italic>VariScan</italic> program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Vilella et al., 2005</xref>). Calculating Fay-Wu’s H demands the ancestral sequences as the outgroup. We extracted the ancestral sequences of DBSs from the human ancestral sequence which was generated upon the EPO alignments of six primate species (human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, macaque, and marmoset) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase1/analysis_results/supporting/ancestral_alignm">ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase1/analysis_results/supporting/ancestral_alignm</ext-link> <underline>ents/</underline>). Third, we computed the Fst to measure the frequency differences of alleles in DBSs between populations. For the CEU-YRI, CHB-YRI, and CHB-CEU pairwise comparisons, we used the revised <italic>VCFtools</italic> program to compute the weighted Fst for all SNPs in each DBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Weir and Cockerham, 1984</xref>). Fourth, we integrated the weighted Fst values in the three populations into an “integrated Fst” which indicated whether the DBS locus was under selection in a certain population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Nielsen and Slatkin, 2013</xref>). We used sliding windows of 147 bp for comparing Fst values of DBSs with the genome-wide background. We empirically denoted the values of integrated Fst in the upper 10% of scores across the entire genome as statistically significant. To determine positive selection more reliably, we used Tajima’s D and the integrated Fst to jointly determine if a DBS was under positive selection in a population. The thresholds which determined the upper 10% of Tajima’s D values across the entire genome in CEU, CHB, and YRI were -0.97, -0.96, and -0.97, respectively, and the threshold which determined the upper 10% of integrated Fst values across the entire genome in the three populations was 0.22. For example, a DBS was assumed to be under positive selection in CEU if (a) the DBS had a Tajima’s D&lt;-0.97 in CEU and Tajima’s D&gt;0.0 in the two other populations and (b) the DBS had an integrated Fst&gt;0.22. Analogously, a DBS was assumed to be under positive selection in both CEU and CHB if the DBS had a Tajima’s D &lt;-0.97 in CEU, &lt;-0.96 in CHB, and &gt;0.0 in YRI, and had an integrated Fst&gt;0.22.</p>

<label>8.</label><title>Functional enrichment analysis of genes</title>
<p>We used the <italic>g:Profiler</italic> program (with the parameter settings: Organism=Homo sapiens, Ordered query = No, Significance threshold = Benjamini-Hochberg FDR, User threshold = 0.05, 50 &lt; terms size &lt; 1000) and the Gene Ontology (GO) database to perform over-representation analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Raudvere et al., 2019</xref>). Over-representation analysis is used to determine which <italic>a priori</italic> defined gene sets are more present (over-represented) in a subset of “interesting” genes than what would be expected by chance. Here, we used the analysis to examine different target gene sets are enriched in what GO terms (<italic>Biological Process</italic>). The target gene sets included genes with strongest DBSs in humans, genes with weakest DBSs in humans, and genes with the mostly changed DBSs in chimpanzees and three archaic humans. To choose genes with strongest DBSs, we ranked genes in descending order based on DBS binding affinity and chose the top 2000 genes for over-representation analysis. To choose genes with weakest DBSs, we first ranked genes in ascending order based on DBS binding affinity, then ranked genes in descending order based on the number of regulatory HS lncRNAs, and finally chose the top 2000 genes with binding affinity ≤ 40 and regulatory HS lncRNAs ≥ 5. We used the distance threshold of 0.034 to choose genes with mostly changed DBSs. Genes with mostly changed DBSs in chimpanzees include the 429 genes in which 2248 DBSs lack counterparts. 4248, 1256, 2514, and 134 genes in chimpanzees, Altai Neanderthals, Denisovans, and Vindija Neanderthals have DBSs or their counterparts with distance ≥ 0.034. To make the statistical significance of enrichment analysis comparable across chimpanzees, Altai Neanderthals, and Denisovans, we used the same number of genes (the top 1256 genes whose DBSs have the largest DBS distances) as the input to the <italic>g:Profiler</italic> program.</p>

<label>9.</label><title>Analysing SNP frequencies in human populations</title>
<p>The frequency of common SNPs (MAF ≥ 0.05) in DBSs in the three modern human populations was computed using the <italic>VCFtools</italic> package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Danecek et al., 2011</xref>). The ancestral/derived states of SNPs were inferred upon the human ancestor sequences and were used to determine derived allele frequency.</p>

<p>SNPs with MAF &gt; 0.1 in DBSs in any of the three modern human populations and absolute values of cis-effect size &gt; 0.5 (FDR &lt; 0.05) in any of the GTEx tissues were examined for an influence on the expression of the target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">GTEx Consortium, 2017</xref>). SNPs that are eQTLs in the GTEx tissues and have biased derived allele frequencies (DAF) in the three modern human populations were examined to estimate whether the eQTL is population-specific.</p>

<label>11.</label><title>Examining the tissue-specific impact of HS lncRNA-regulated gene expression</title>
<p>First, we examined the expression of HS lncRNA genes across the GTEx tissues. HS lncRNA genes with a median TPM value &gt; 0.1 in a tissue were considered robustly expressed in that tissue. Upon this criterion, 40 HS lncRNA genes were expressed in at least one tissue and were used to examine the impact of HS lncRNA regulation on gene and transcript expression (other HS lncRNAs may function in the cytoplasm). Since a HS lncRNA gene may have multiple transcripts, we adopted the transcript which contains the predicted DNA binding domain (DBD) and has the largest TPM value as the representative transcript of the HS lncRNA. We calculated the pairwise Spearman’s correlation coefficient between the expression of a HS lncRNA (the representative transcript) and the expression of each of its target transcripts using the <italic>scipy.stats.spearmanr</italic> program in the <italic>scipy</italic> package. The expression of a HS lncRNA gene and a target transcript was considered to be significantly correlated if the |Spearman’s rho| &gt; 0.3, with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR &lt; 0.05. We examined the percentage distribution of correlated HS lncRNA-target transcript pairs across GTEx tissues and organs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>
<p>We examined all GTEx tissues to determine in which tissues HS lncRNA-regulated gene expression may have undergone significant changes from archaic to modern humans. If a pair of HS lncRNA and target transcript are robustly expressed in a tissue and their expression shows a significant correlation (|Spearman’s rho| &gt; 0.3, with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR &lt; 0.05) in the tissue, we computed the sequence distance of the HS lncRNA’s DBS in the transcript from the three archaic humans to modern humans. We compared the sequence distances of all DBSs in each tissue with the sequence distances of all DBSs in all GTEx tissues (i.e. the distribution of all DBS distances was taken as the background). A one-sided two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to examine whether the sequence distances of all DBSs in a specific tissue deviate from the background distribution (which reflects the “neutral evolution” of gene expression). For a tissue, if the test result was Benjamini-Hochberg FDR &lt; 0.001, the tissue was considered to have significantly changed gene expression regulated by the HS lncRNA. We used different colors to mark tissues with significantly changed gene expression regulation since Altai Neanderthals, Denisovans, and Vindija Neanderthals, and used “D”, “AD”, and “ADV” to indicate changes since Denisovans, since Altai Neanderthals and Denisovans, and since Altai Neanderthals, Denisovans, and Vindija Neanderthals, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>

<title>Supplementary Note 1 – Supporting evidence for DBS prediction</title>
<p>We used multiple methods and datasets to validate DBS prediction. First, since lncRNAs can recruit epigenetic regulatory enzymes to lncRNAs’ DNA binding sites, we uploaded predicted DBSs of HS lncRNAs to the UCSC Genome Browser as a custom track, compared these DBSs with tracks such as “ENCODE DNA Methylation tracks” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc14">Meissner et al., 2008</xref>) and “ENCODE Histone Modification tracks” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc4">Ernst et al., 2011</xref>). We found that predicted DBSs overlap well with experimentally identified DNA methylation and histone modification signals in multiple cell lines (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, since lncRNAs’ DBSs can be detected genome-wide by experiments such as ChIRP-seq, we predicted the DBSs of the lncRNA MALAT1, NEAT1, and MEG3 and compared predicted DBSs with the experimentally identified DNA binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc16">Mondal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc25">West et al., 2014</xref>). We found that predicted DBSs agree well with experimentally identified DNA binding sites (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, we found that many DBSs also co-localize with ENCODE Candidate Cis-Regulatory Elements (cCREs) in promoter regions of genes (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). cCREs are the subset of representative DNase hypersensitive sites across ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics samples supported by either histone modifications (H3K4me3 and H3K27ac) or CTCF-binding data.</p>
<p>Fourth, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 technique to knock out the sequences that contain the DBD of seven lncRNAs (three HS lncRNAs and four wrongly transcribed long noncoding RNAs) in multiple cell lines and performed RNA-seq before and after the knockout. The deleted sequences were just 100-200 bp, and gene expression analysis revealed that the |fold change| of target genes was significantly larger than the |fold change| of non-target genes (one-sided Mann-Whitney test, p = 3.1e-72, 1.49e-114, and 1.12e-206 for HS lncRNA RP13-516M14.1, RP11-426L16.8, and SNORA59B, and p = 2.58e-09, 6.49e-41, 0.034, and 5.23e-07 for the four wrongly transcribed lncRNAs in cancer cell lines) (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). These results suggest that the deletion of DBD causes the changed expression of target genes (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>).</p>
<p>Fifth, the <italic>LongTarget</italic> program uses a variant of the Smith-Waterman algorithm to identify all local alignments in each lncRNA/DNA pair. Each alignment is a RNA:DNA triplex that consists of a TFO (triplex-formating oligonucleotides) and a TTS (triplex-targeting sites). A DBS is defined based on a set of densely overlapping TTSs, and a DBD is defined based on both TFOs and the DBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc10">He et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>LongTarget</italic> can more robustly and accurately identify DBS than some popular methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc24">Wen et al., 2022</xref>). To examine the likelihood a local alignment of 147 bp (the average length of strong DBSs) can be generated by chance in a 5000 bp DNA sequence, we randomly simulated two sequences seqA and seqB (which were 5000 bp and 147 bp) and aligned seqB to seqA using the EMBOSS <italic>Water</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/psa/emboss_water/">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/psa/emboss_water/</ext-link>) local alignment program with alignment identity controlled to 60% (because the default <italic>Identity</italic> parameter of the <italic>LongTarget</italic> program was 60%). The equation p = 1 − exp(−Kmne<sup>-ilS</sup>) was used to calculate a p value to estimate the likelihood, in which <italic>m</italic> and <italic>n</italic> were the length of seqA and seqB, <italic>K</italic> was a small adjusting constant (which was 0.1), λ was the normalization coefficient of the score (which was 0.3), and S was the alignment score. We repeated the simulation and calculation process 10000 times and determined that the maximal and minimal p values were between 8.2e-19 and 1.5e-48. Thus, a DBS of 147 bp is extremely unlikely to be generated by chance. This result also supports that the changed expression of target genes is caused by the knockout of DBDs in the CRISPR/Cas9 experiments.</p>

<title><bold>Supplementary Note 2 – Features of HS lncRNA-mediated gene expression regulation</bold></title>
<p>HS lncRNA-mediated gene expression regulation shows multiple features. First, HS lncRNAs themselves form complex targeting relationships (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>), suggesting networks and cascades of regulation. Second, some DBSs are human-specific sequences (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>), suggesting that human-specific sequences were explored by HS lncRNAs for regulating gene expression. Third, many genes and transcripts have DBSs for multiple HS lncRNAs (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>), suggesting co-regulation of functionally related genes. Fourth, certain genes and transcripts have multiple DBSs for one HS lncRNA, suggesting tissue-specific regulation. Fifth, selection signals were detected in some DBSs in specific populations (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>). Sixth, generally, HS lncRNAs on the Y chromosome have longer DBSs than HS lncRNAs on the autosomes (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>). Finally, SNPs in the DBSs of a HS lncRNA in multiple genes on a chromosome show LD, suggesting an association between these DBSs (<xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 11</xref>).</p>

<title><bold>Supplementary Note 3 – Target genes are enriched in specific functions</bold></title>
<p>Strong (binding affinity&gt;=60) and weak (binding affinity&lt;60) DBSs may indicate well-established and recently-formed gene expression regulation by HS lncRNAs. To examine if genes with strong and weak DBSs are enriched in different biological functions, we used the <italic>g:Profiler</italic> program (with the parameter settings: Organism=Homo sapiens, Ordered query=No, Significance threshold=Benjamini-Hochberg FDR, User threshold=0.05, 50&lt;terms size&lt;1000) and the Gene Ontology (GO) database to perform over-representation analysis. An over-representation analysis is used to determine which <italic>a priori</italic> defined gene sets are more present (over-represented) in a subset of “interesting” genes than what would be expected by chance. We used the top 2000 genes with strong DBSs and the bottom 2000 genes with weak DBSs as the input to <italic>g:Profiler</italic> (Supplementary Table 2-4). The two gene sets, with strong and weak DBSs, are enriched in many common GO terms with different significance. These GO terms include “neuron projection development” (GO:0031175) (2.36E-16 vs 3.79E-11), “neuron projection morphogenesis” (GO:0048812) (8.56E-16 vs 1.64E-09), and “female sex differentiation” (GO:0046660) (2.40E-2 vs 5.84E-04) (<xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 12</xref>). Genes with strong and weak DBSs are also enriched in different GO terms. Especially, genes with weak DBSs are enriched in slightly more GO terms (<xref rid="figs13" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 13</xref>), including “response to alcohol” (GO:0097305), “negative regulation of locomotion” (GO:0040013), “female gonad development” (GO:0008585), “response to temperature stimulus” (GO:0009266), “cerebral cortex development” (GO:0021987), “DNA methylation or demethylation” (GO:0044728), and “female pregnancy” (GO:0007565) (Supplementary Table 4). These DBSs and target genes reflect the recent adaptive evolution of humans.</p>
<p>Next, we examined DBSs that have most changed sequence distance (“distance” hereafter means the distance per base) in two ways. First, we computed DBS sequence distances from the human ancestor to chimpanzees, archaic humans, and modern humans (hg19) (i.e., from the root note to leaf nodes in the phylogenetic tree); second, we computed DBS sequence distances between modern humans (hg19) and chimpanzees and archaic humans (i.e., between leaf nodes in the phylogenetic tree). In the first type of DBS distances, DBSs in the top 20% (5033) genes have a distance &gt; 0.015 from the human ancestor to modern humans. When the human-chimpanzee ancestral sequence has the ancestral sequence (which means the inferring of ancestral allele is of high confidence), DBS distances from the human ancestor to modern humans are indeed larger than DBS distances from the human ancestor to archaic humans. However, it is unreasonable that more DBSs have distances &gt; 0.015 from the human ancestor to Altai Neanderthals, Denisovans, and even chimpanzees (<xref rid="figs14" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 14</xref>). We think these wrong distances may be because no archaic human genomes were used to build the human ancestral sequence. According to the file “homo_sapiens_ancestor_GRCh37_e71.README” and the paper “1000 Genomes Project Consortium. A global reference for human genetic variation. Nature 2015”, a high-confidence call in the human ancestor sequence is made when all three sequences - the ancestral (the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees), the sister (chimpanzees), and the ancestral of the ancestral sequences - agree. We found that only about 64% calls in the human ancestor sequence are high-confidence calls and that DBSs in human ancestral sequences with high-confidence have correct distances to the other five leaf nodes.</p>
<p>To examine whether DBS distances between leaf nodes mainly reflect the genetic changes in the human lineage or in the chimpanzee lineage, we also computed sequence distances for DBSs with the most changed sequences between humans and gorillas. We found that the DBS distances between humans and chimpanzees were significantly correlated with those between humans and gorillas (Spearman’s rho = 0.57, p = 0.0) and that these DBSs have a larger distance between humans and gorillas (<xref rid="figs15" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 15A</xref>). These results suggest that the sequence differences of the most changed DBSs between humans and chimpanzees are driven mainly by the genetic changes occurring in the human lineage but not in the chimpanzee lineage. The same results were observed when the archaic humans were examined (<xref rid="figs15" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 15B</xref>).</p>
<p>In the second type of distances, DBSs in 429 genes have no counterparts in chimpanzees, the largest distance between chimpanzees and modern humans was 5.383, DBSs in the top 20% (4248) genes in chimpanzees have distances &gt; 0.034, and DBSs having distances &gt; 0.034 in genes in Altai Neanderthals, Denisovans, and Vindija Neanderthals are 1256, 2514, and 134 (Supplementary Table 6). These distances agree with the phylogenetic distances between chimpanzees, archaic humans, and modern humans (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1AE</xref>). We assigned 10.0 as the distance of DBSs that lack counterparts in chimpanzees. Subsequently, to make the statistical significance of enrichment analysis comparable across chimpanzees, Altai Neanderthals, and Denisovans, we used the top 1256 genes whose DBSs &gt; 0.035 between modern humans and chimpanzees, Altai Neanderthals, and Denisovans as the input to the <italic>g:Profiler</italic> program. Genes in Altai Neanderthals are enriched in more GO terms than genes in chimpanzees, but many of these GO terms are highly related to human traits (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>; Supplementary Table 7). The differences in enriched GO terms in chimpanzees and Altai Neanderthals suggest that HS lncRNA-mediated gene expression regulation has greatly evolved from the human ancestor to Altai Neanderthals.</p>
<p>Finally, we also sorted DBSs by the distances from the human ancestor to the five leaf nodes, identified genes with mostly changed DBSs, and applied over-representation analysis to genes with mostly changed DBSs. It is interesting (and reasonable) to find that genes with largest DBS distances from the human ancestor to Altai Neanderthals and to modern humans are enriched in many common GO terms (e.g., “regulation of anatomical structure size” (GO:0090066), “behavior” (GO:0007610), and “cellular response to xenobiotic stimulus” (GO:0071466)), that the Altai Neanderthal-specific GO terms include “sensory system development” (GO:0048880), “brain development” (GO:0007420), and “adult locomotory behavior” (GO:0008344), and that the modern human-specific GO terms include “female pregnancy” (GO:0007565), “learning” (GO:0007612), and “cognition” (GO:0050890) (Supplementary Table 7). The differences in Neanderthal-specific and modern human-specific GO terms reasonably reflect the different stages of human evolution.</p>

<title><bold>Supplementary Note 4 – Positive selection signals in HS lncRNA genes</bold></title>
<p>We used multiple tests, including XP-CLR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc3">Chen et al., 2010</xref>), iSAFE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc2">Akbari et al., 2018</xref>), Tajima’s D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc22">Tajima, 1989</xref>), the fixation index (Fst) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc23">Weir and Cockerham, 1984</xref>), and linkage disequilibrium (LD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc20">Slatkin, 2008</xref>), to detect positive selection signals in HS lncRNA genes.</p>
<p>First, we used the XP-CLR program to scan the genome regions which contain HS lncRNAs and their 500-kb upstream and downstream sequences. Six pairwise comparisons were applied to the three human populations (CEU-CHB, CEU-YRI, CHB-CEU, CHB-YRI, YRI-CEU, and YRI-CHB). Selective sweeps were detected in the genome regions containing RP11-848P1.4 and RP11-598D14.1 in the CEU-YRI and CHB-YRI comparisons (<xref rid="figs16" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 16</xref>). Abundant SNPs in these regions have low derived allele frequency (DAF) in YRI, but are nearly fixed in CEU and CHB. Examples (with DAF in YRI, CEU, and CHB) include rs7208589 (DAF = 0.162, 0.990, and 0.995), rs8073226 (DAF = 0.148, 0.990, and 0.995), and rs9915124 (DAF = 0.181, 0.990, and 0.995) in the region containing RP11-848P1.4, and rs4690648 (DAF = 0.185, 0.939, and 0.917), rs11722101 (DAF = 0.269, 0.970, and 0.917), and rs11730933 (DAF = 0.292, 0.970, and 0.917) in the region containing RP11-598D14.1.</p>
<p>Second, we used the iSAFE program to detect favored mutations in HS lncRNA genes in these populations. Because selective sweeps caused by favored mutations may have varied lengths, we ran iSAFE four times with genome regions of 80, 500, 1000, and 2500 kb, which center at the HS lncRNA. Selective sweeps and favored mutations were detected robustly in genome regions containing RP11-598D14.1, RP11-848P1.4, AC006129.1, AC006129.4, CTD-2291D10.1, CTD-2291D10.2, and LA16c-306A4.2 in CEU and CHB, and in the genome region containing CTD-3051D23.4 in CHB (<xref rid="figs17" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 17</xref>). Mutations with top iSAFE scores were located in the gene body regions of HS lncRNAs, and their DAF values were low in YRI but high in CEU and CHB. In addition, all of the detected favored mutations have high LD (r<sup>2</sup>) scores.</p>
<p>Third, we used Tajima’s D and integrated Fst to detect positive selection signals in gene body regions of HS lncRNAs. Positive selection signals were detected in RP11-598D14.1, RP11-848P1.4, RP11-344P13.4, and RP11-426L16.8 in CEU and CHB, in AC129929.5 and RP11-423H2.3 in CEU, and in CTB-151G24.1 in CHB</p>
<p>(<xref rid="figs18" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 18</xref>). Since Tajima’s D values were referenced with the genome-wide background, D&lt;0 and D&gt;0 indicate positive (or directional selection) and balancing selection, respectively, instead of population demography dynamics. The Fst of each HS lncRNA gene, also referenced with the genome-wide background, was computed for the CEU-YRI, CHB-YRI, and CHB-CEU comparisons. Extreme Fst values of SNPs were detected in RP11-598D14.1 and AC129929.5 in the comparisons of CEU-YRI and CHB-YRI. Since Fst values were referenced with the genome-wide background, extreme Fst values indicate positive selection.</p>
<p>Finally, we applied LD analysis to each HS lncRNA gene. Significantly increased LD was detected in SNPs in AC024592.9, AC129929.5, RP11-157B13.7, RP11-277P12.10, CTD-2142D14.1, and CTD-2291D10.1 in CEU and CHB (<xref rid="figs19" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 19</xref>). The above results, taken together, indicate that HS lncRNA genes may have undergone more significant adaptive evolution in CEU and CHB than in YRI.</p>

<title><bold>Supplementary Note 5 – Positive selection signals in DBSs</bold></title>
<p>We used the tests mentioned above, including Tajima’s D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc22">Tajima, 1989</xref>), Fay and Wu’s H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc6">Fay and Wu, 2000</xref>), integrated Fst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc23">Weir and Cockerham, 1984</xref>), and LD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc20">Slatkin, 2008</xref>), to detect positive selection signals in DBSs in each population. These tests unveil positive selection signals in DBSs in specific target genes in specific populations (Supplementary Table 9-11).</p>
<p>First, we calculated Tajima’s D, Fst, and integrated Fst for polymorphic DBSs in CEU, CHB, and YRI. Positive selection signals were detected in DBSs in more genes in CEU and CHB than in YRI (Supplementary Table 10). These genes include the two pigmentation-related genes <italic>MC1R</italic> and <italic>MFSD12</italic>, the two odor reception-related genes <italic>OR6C1</italic> and <italic>TAS1R3</italic>, and the immune-related gene <italic>TLR1.</italic> These target genes may suggest the adaptation of gene expression regulation in CEU and CHB to changes in diet and the environment. In YRI, positive selection signals were detected in DBSs in genes such as <italic>SLCO4A1</italic> which encodes a protein mediating the Na-independent transport of organic anions (e.g., the thyroid hormones T3 and T4). DBSs in different transcripts of <italic>GNAS</italic> (a gene important for genomic imprinting) contain SNPs specifically selected for in different populations (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we calculated Fay-Wu’s H and integrated Fst for each polymorphic DBS in CEU, CHB, and YRI. Strong negative values (H &lt;-2), together with significantly large integrated Fst (&gt; 0.22), were obtained mainly in DBSs in CEU and CHB (Supplementary Table 11). These genes fall into two classes. The first class includes <italic>PASK, CPT1A</italic>, and <italic>EXOC7,</italic> which are important for glucose and lipid metabolism. <italic>PASK</italic> encodes a protein that plays a role in the regulation of insulin gene expression. <italic>CPT1A</italic> encodes a protein that exerts an important role in triglyceride metabolism. <italic>EXOC7</italic> encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in targeting SLC2A4 vesicles to the plasma membrane in response to insulin in adipocytes. The second class includes <italic>COMT, TAS1R3</italic>, and <italic>ALMS1,</italic> which are important for neural development. <italic>COMT</italic> is involved in the metabolism of adrenalin and noradrenalin. <italic>TAS1R3</italic> encodes a protein important for recognizing diverse natural and synthetic sweeteners. Mutations in <italic>ALMS1</italic> are associated with Alstrom syndrome.</p>
<p>Third, to examine whether gene expression regulation by HS lncRNAs is coordinated, we examined the LD between SNPs in DBSs of the same HS lncRNA chromosome-wide. When more than one SNP in a DBS has minimal allele frequency (MAF) &gt;= 0.05, we chose the SNP which had the strongest LD (r<sup>2</sup>). Despite genetic recombination, LD between DBSs was detected on some chromosomes in CEU and CHB (<xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 11</xref>; Supplementary Note 2).</p>
<p>Fourth, we computed the distances between DBSs in modern humans and their counterparts in archaic humans and compared the distances with the distances between annotated promoters and their counterparts in archaic humans. A considerable portion of DBSs (note that DBSs are within promoter regions) have larger distances than promoters between modern and archaic humans (<xref rid="figs20" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 20</xref>). We also computed the frequency distribution of SNPs (&gt; 0.05) in DBSs and found that SNPs are enriched with low and high frequencies (<xref rid="figs21" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 21</xref>), which is an indicator of positive selection.</p>
<p>Finally, we analyzed two experimental datasets. It was reported that the expression of a set of genes in T cell activation in response to pathogens shows significant variations in 348 healthy European, African, and Asian individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc27">Ye et al., 2014</xref>). To examine whether HS lncRNAs contribute to these variations, we examined whether DBSs in these genes have different binding affinities in different populations. We found that DBSs in <italic>IFITM3</italic>, <italic>IL2RA</italic>, <italic>IL17F</italic>, <italic>MXRA7</italic>, <italic>CCL22</italic>, and <italic>FADS2</italic> contain SNPs with biased frequencies in CEU, CHB, and YRI. A typical example is the DBSs in <italic>FADS2</italic> which is expressed differentially in Europeans and Africans. The two DBSs in <italic>FADS2-003</italic> and <italic>FADS2-010</italic>, respectively, contain four SNPs - rs71046746 has DAF 0.96/0.99/0.88 in CEU/CHB/YRI, but the other three unannotated SNPs have DAFs 0.24/0.22/0.01, 0.24/0.22/0.04, and 0.24/0.22/0.02 in CEU/CHB/YRI.</p>
<p>Another study examined genome-wide patterns of selection in 230 West Eurasians who lived between 6500 and 300 BC and identified selection signals in multiple genes which are associated with diet, pigmentation, and immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc13">Mathieson et al., 2015</xref>). We detected signatures of positive selection in DBSs in <italic>LCT</italic>, <italic>TLR1</italic>, <italic>TLR6</italic>, <italic>TLR10</italic>, <italic>SLC45A2</italic>, <italic>SLC22A4</italic>, <italic>MHC</italic>, <italic>ZKSCAN3</italic>, <italic>FADS1</italic>, <italic>FADS2</italic>, <italic>DHCR7</italic>, <italic>GRM5</italic>, <italic>ATXN2</italic>, and <italic>HERC2</italic>. Reliable population-specific selection signals were identified in the DBS of RP11-423H2.3 in <italic>HERC2</italic> (the Tajima’s D in CEU/CHB/YRI are -0.19/1.82/-1.12 and the integrated Fst is 0.27), in the DBSs of RP11-423H2.3 in <italic>TLR1</italic> and <italic>TLR6</italic> (the Tajima’s D in CEU/CHB/YRI are -1.26/-1.2/1.38 and the integrated Fst is 0.24), and in the DBS of SNORA59B in <italic>TLR1</italic> and <italic>TLR6</italic> (the Tajima’s D in CEU/CHB/YRI are -1.73/-0.9/1.76 and the integrated Fst is 0.24). Taken together, the above analyses suggest that population-specific selection signals in DBSs may help explain the phenotypic and physiological differences between human populations.</p>

<title><bold>Supplementary Note 6 – Considerable SNPs in DBSs have cis-effect on gene expression in specific tissues and populations</bold></title>
<p>To find supporting evidence for DBS influencing gene expression in tissues and organs, we first examined whether SNPs in DBSs have a cis-effect on gene expression using the data of the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc9">GTEx Consortium, 2017</xref>). The expression of some genes in specific tissues is of interest. For example, of the 21 SNPs which are eQTLs exclusively in the GTEx tissue Thyroid, 14 have high DAF in YRI (<xref rid="figs22" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 22</xref>). Correspondingly, in Africans, positive selection signals were found in genes involved in energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc5">Fan et al., 2019</xref>). Second, we computed the eQTL density for each DBS and each Ensembl-annotated promoter and compared eQTL density of the two kinds of sequences. We found that eQTLs were more enriched in DBSs than in promoters (one-sided Mann-Whitney test, p = 0.0) (<xref rid="figs23" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 23</xref>). Third, for DBS harboring eQTLs in specific tissues, 94% of the corresponding HS lncRNA-target transcript pairs exhibit expression correlation (|Spearman’s rho| &gt; 0.3 and FDR &lt; 0.05) in the eQTLs’ tissues.</p>
<p>Finally, we examined how many SNPs DBSs are DNA methylation QTL (mQTL) and histone modification QTL (haQTL). One study analyzed DNA methylation data from three populations (10 Caucasians, 10 African Americans, and 10 Japanese) and identified <italic>RGS6</italic>, <italic>CLEC2L</italic>, <italic>ABCF1</italic>, <italic>MIR3678</italic>, and <italic>EP400</italic> as having differential methylation in African Americans compared with Japanese and Caucasians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc8">Giri et al., 2017</xref>). Based on this study, we found that DBSs of several HS lncRNAs in some transcripts of <italic>RGS6</italic>, <italic>CLEC2L</italic>, and <italic>EP400</italic> (also <italic>EP400NL</italic>) had significantly different Tajima’s D and integrated Fst in YRI. Another study applied QTL analysis to a multi-omics dataset and identified a set of SNPs significantly associated with levels of gene expression, DNA methylation, and histone modification in the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc17">Ng et al., 2017</xref>). Ng et al. called SNPs with cis-effect (including eQTL, mQTLs, and haQTLs) xQTL and found that xQTL SNPs were enriched close to transcription start sites. We re-examined these xQTL SNPs and identified 4735 in the DBSs of HS lncRNAs (Supplementary Table 13). Notably, 4319 out of the 4735 xQTLs were meQTL SNPs, many of which had biased frequencies in CEU, CHB, and YRI.</p>

<title><bold>Supplementary Note 7 – HS lncRNAs critically regulate genes important for brain development</bold></title>
<p>The enlarged brain is one of the most prominent features of modern humans. We analyzed multiple datasets of experimental studies to examine the impact of HS lncRNAs on brain development. First, we analyzed two datasets of epigenetic studies. A comparative H3K27ac and H3K4me2 profiling of human, macaque, and mouse corticogenesis revealed that strongly concordant epigenetic gains are enriched in promoters of 301 genes which are active during human corticogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc19">Reilly et al., 2015</xref>). Of these genes (257 are annotated in hg38), 84% have DBSs for at least one HS lncRNA and 56% have DBSs for &gt;= 5 HS lncRNAs. Thus, these 301 genes are enriched significantly for regulation by HS lncRNAs compared with genes without DBSs of HS lncRNAs (p = 1.32e-26 for the situation of 56% genes and p = 1.21e-21 for the situation of 84% genes, two-sided Fisher’s exact test). Another study examined gene expression and H3K27ac modification in eight brain regions in humans and four other primates, and revealed 1851 genes (1687 genes annotated in hg38) with human-specific transcriptome differences and 240 genes with chimpanzee-specific transcriptome differences in at least one brain region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc26">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). Of these genes, 73% have DBSs for at least one HS lncRNA and 46% have DBSs for &gt;= 5 HS lncRNA. These data again indicate that genes related to brain development are enriched significantly in HS lncRNA targets (p = 1.1e-75 for the situation of 46% genes and p = 1.2e-56 for the situation of 73% genes, two-sided Fisher’s exact test).</p>
<p>Second, we analyzed the data from two studies conducted by the PsychENCODE consortium. The data of one study cover 16 brain regions and 9 time windows and include spatiotemporally differentially expressed genes, spatiotemporally differentially methylated sites, spatiotemporal variations of H3K27ac enrichment, and cell type marker genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc12">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Of the 66 HS lncRNAs, 65 were expressed in all of the 16 brain regions and in the 9 time windows, and 7 HS lncRNAs (RP11-423H2.3, RP11-706O15.5, RP13-539J13.1, SNORD3B-1, SNORD3B-2, RP4-740C4.7, and RP13-516M14.1) exhibited spatial or temporal expression differences. To assess the contribution of these 7 HS lncRNAs to the spatiotemporal changes of gene expression, we mapped the spatiotemporally differentially methylated sites to the promoters of annotated transcripts and identified 109 transcripts which had these sites in their promoters. We then predicted the DBSs of the 7 HS lncRNAs in the promoter regions of the 109 transcripts and found that 56 transcripts had DBSs for at least one of the 7 HS lncRNAs. In addition, 61% of 770 cell type-specific marker genes had at least one DBS of the s7 HS lncRNAs. These results suggest that HS lncRNAs regulate spatiotemporal gene expression and determine cell fate during brain development, probably by regulating DNA methylation in promoter regions. The other PsychENCODE study examined the spatiotemporal transcriptomic divergence across human and macaque brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc28">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). We examined the potential relationships between the HS lncRNAs and the 8951 genes showing differential expression between human and macaque brain during brain development. We identified DBSs of at least one HS lncRNAs in the promoter regions of 72% of differentially expressed genes in the human brain. Moreover, DBSs of at least 5 HS lncRNAs were identified in the promoter regions of 44% of differentially expressed genes. Compared with genes without DBS for HS lncRNAs, these differentially expressed genes are significantly enriched for regulation by HS lncRNAs (p = 0, Chi-square test). Of the 7 transcription factor genes differentially expressed between humans and macaques, four had DBSs of HS lncRNAs. These results support that gene expression in the human brain is highly regulated by HS lncRNAs.</p>
<p>Third, three recent studies identified several genes, including <italic>NOTCH2NL</italic> and <italic>Aspm</italic>, which are critical for regulating cortical expansion in the human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc7">Florio et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc11">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc21">Suzuki et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>NOTCH2NL</italic> is highly expressed in radial glia and activates Notch signaling to promote the clonal expansion of human cortical progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc7">Florio et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc21">Suzuki et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>Aspm</italic> is expressed in mice but shows no contribution to mouse corticogenesis. Nevertheless, an <italic>Aspm</italic> knockout greatly influenced corticogenesis in ferrets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc11">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>). We examined whether HS lncRNAs potentially regulate these genes. Of the 40 protein-coding genes reported by the three studies, 14 have DBSs of &gt;= 5 HS lncRNAs and 29 have DBSs of &gt;= 1 HS lncRNAs in their promoter regions (Supplementary Table 14). Compared with the background situation (22562 protein-coding genes’ promoter regions contain, but 20944 protein-coding genes’ promoter regions do not contain, DBSs of HS lncRNAs), the 40 protein-coding genes involved in cortical expansion are highly enriched for regulation by HS lncRNAs (p &lt; 0.01, two-sided Fisher’s exact test).</p>
<p>Recently, brain organoids have emerged as an important approach to studying primate neural development in vitro. By establishing and comparing cerebral organoids between humans, chimpanzees, and macaques, Pollen et al. identified 261 human-specific gene expression changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc18">Pollen et al., 2019</xref>). In another study, Agoglia et al. generated a panel of tetraploid human-chimpanzee hybrid iPS cells (i.e. hybrid induced pluripotent stem cells) by fusing human and chimpanzee iPS cells, and differentiated the hybrid iPS cells into hybrid cortical spheroids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc1">Agoglia et al., 2021</xref>). By allele-specific expression (ASE) analysis, Agoglia et al. identified thousands of genes with divergent expression between humans and chimpanzees at at least one time point. We obtained the 261 genes from the first study and the 1102 genes with |logFC| &gt; 1 and adjusted p &lt; 0.05 from the second study. Compared with the background situation mentioned above, the two sets of genes were significantly enriched with DBSs of HS lncRNAs (p = 1.2e-16 and 3.4e-74, respectively).</p>

<p>In this <bold>valuable</bold> manuscript, the authors attempt to examine the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in human evolution, through a set of population genetics and functional genomics analyses that leverage existing datasets and tools. Although the methods are at times <bold>inadequate</bold> - for example, suitable methods and/or relevant controls are lacking at many points, and selection is inferred sometimes too quickly - the results nonetheless point towards a possible contribution of long non-coding RNAs to the evolution of human biology and they suggest clear directions for future, more rigorous study.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>
While DNA sequence divergence, differential expression, and differential methylation analysis have been conducted between humans and the great apes to study changes that &quot;make us human&quot;, the role of lncRNAs and their impact on the human genome and biology has not been fully explored. In this study, the authors computationally predict HSlncRNAs as well as their DNA Binding sites using a method they have developed previously and then examine these predicted regions with different types of enrichment analyses. Broadly, the analysis is straightforward and after identifying these regions/HSlncRNAs the authors examined their effects using different external datasets.</p>
<p>Strengths/weaknesses</p>
<p>
By and large, the analysis performed is dependent on their ability to identify HSlncRNAs and their DBS. I think that they have done a good job of showing the performance metrics of their methods in previous publications. Thereafter, they perform a series of enrichment-type analyses that have been used in the field for quite a while now to look at tissue-specific enrichment, or region-specific enrichment, or functional enrichment, and I think these have been carried out well. The authors achieved the aims of their work. I think one of the biggest contributions that this paper brings to the field is their annotation of these HSlncRNAs. Thus a major revisionary effort could be spent on applying their method to the latest genomes that have been released so that the community could get a clean annotation of newly identified HSlncRNAs (see comment 2).</p>
<p>Comments</p>
<p>1. Though some of their results about certain HSlncRNAs having DBSs in all genes is rather surprising/suspicious, I think that broadly their process to identify and validate DBSs is robust, they have multiple lines of checks to identify such regions, including functional validation. These predictions are bound to have some level of false positive/negative rate and it might be nice to restate those here and on what experiment/validation data these were conducted. However, the rest of their analysis comprises different types of enrichment analysis which shouldn't be affected by outlier HSlncRNAs if indeed their FPR/FNR are low.</p>
<p>2. There are now several new genomes available as part of the Zoonomia consortium and 240 Primate consortium papers released. These papers have re-examined some annotations such as Human Accelerated Regions (HARs) and found with a larger dataset as well as better reference genomes, that a large fraction of HARs were actually incorrectly annotated - that is that they were also seen in other lineages outside of just the great apes. If these papers have not already examined HSlncRNAs, the authors should try and re-run the computational predictions with this updated set and then identify HSlncRNAs there. This might help to clarify their signal and remove lncRNAs that might be present in other primates but are somehow missing in the great apes. This might also help to mitigate some results that they see in section 3 of their paper in comparing DBS distances between archaics and humans.</p>
<p>3. The differences between the archaic hominins in their DBS distances to modern humans are a bit concerning. At some level, we expect these to be roughly similar when examining African modern humans and perhaps the Denisovan being larger when examining Europeans and Asians, but they seem to have distances that aren't expected given the demography. In addition, from their text for section 3, they begin by stating that they are computing two types of distances but then I lost track of which distance they were discussing in paragraph 3 of section 3. Explicitly stating which of the two distances in the text would be helpful for the reader.</p>
<p>4. Isn't the correct control to examine whether eQTLs are more enriched in HSlncRNA DBSs a set of transcription factor binding sites? I don't think using just promoter regions is a reasonable control here. This does not take away from the broader point however that eQTLs are found in DBSs and I think they can perform this alternate test.</p>
<p>5. In the discussion, they highlight the evolution of sugar intake, which I'm not sure is appropriate. This comes not from GO enrichment but rather from a few genes that are found at the tail of their distribution. While these signals may be real, the evolution of traits is often highly polygenic and they don't see this signal in their functional enrichment. I suggest removing that line. Moreover, HSlncRNAs are ones that are unique across a much longer time frame than the transition to agriculture which is when sugar intake rose greatly. Thus, it's unlikely to see enrichment for something that arose in the past 6000-7000 years would in the annotation that is designed to detect human-chimp or human-neanderthal level divergence.</p>

<p>Lin et al attempt to examine the role of lncRNAs in human evolution in this manuscript. They apply a suite of population genetics and functional genomics analyses that leverage existing data sets and public tools, some of which were previously built by the authors, who clearly have experience with lncRNA binding prediction. However, I worry that there is a lack of suitable methods and/or relevant controls at many points and that the interpretation is too quick to infer selection. While I don't doubt that lnc RNAs contribute to the evolution of modern humans, and certainly agree that this is a question worth asking, I think this paper would benefit from a more rigorous approach to tackling it.</p>
<p>At this point, my suggestions are mostly focused on tightening and strengthening the methods; it is hard for me to predict the consequence of these changes on the results or their interpretation, but as a general rule I also encourage the authors to not over-interpret their conclusions in terms of what phenotype was selected for when as they do at certain points (eg glucose metabolism).</p>
<p>I note some specific points that I think would benefit from more rigorous approaches, and suggest possible ways forward for these.</p>
<p>1. Much of this work is focused on comparing DNA binding domains in human-unique long-noncoding RNAs and DNA binding sites across the promoters of genes in the human genome, and I think the authors can afford to be a bit more methodical/selective in their processing and filtering steps here. The article begins by searching for orthologues of human lncRNAs to arrive at a set of 66 human-specific lncRNAs, which are then characterised further through the rest of the manuscript. Line 99 describes a binding affinity metric used to separate strong DBS from weak DBS; the methods (line 432) describe this as being the product of the DBS or lncRNA length times the average Identity of the underlying TTSs. This multiplication, in fact, undoes the standardising value of averaging and introduces a clear relationship between the length of a region being tested and its overall score, which in turn is likely to bias all downstream inference, since a long lncRNA with poor average affinity can end up with a higher score than a short one with higher average affinity, and it's not quite clear to me what the biological interpretation of that should be. Why was this metric defined in this way?</p>
<p>2. There is also a strong assumption that identified sites will always be bound (line 100), which I disagree is well-supported by additional evidence (lines 109-125). The authors show that predicted NEAT1 and MALAT1 DBS overlap experimentally validated sites for NEAT1, MALAT1, and MEG3, but this is not done systematically, or genome-wide, so it's hard to know if the examples shown are representative, or a best-case scenario.</p>
<p>It's also not quite clear how overlapping promoters or TSS are treated - are these collapsed into a single instance when calculating genome-wide significance? If, eg, a gene has five isoforms, and these differ in the 3' UTR but their promoter region contains a DBS, is this counted five times, or one? Since the interaction between the lncRNA and the DBS happens at the DNA level, it seems like not correcting for this uneven distribution of transcripts is likely to skew results, especially when testing against genome-wide distributions, eg in the results presented in sections 5 and 6. I do not think that comparing genes and transcripts putatively bound by the 40 HS lncRNAs to a random draw of 10,000 lncRNA/gene pairs drawn from the remaining ~13500 lncRNAs that are not HS is a fair comparison. Rather, it would be better to do many draws of 40 non-HS lncRNAs and determine an empirical null distribution that way, if possible actively controlling for the overall number of transcripts (also see the following point).</p>
<p>3. Thresholds for statistical testing are not consistent, or always well justified. For instance, in line 142 GO testing is performed on the top 2000 genes (according to different rankings), but there's no description of the background regions used as controls anywhere, or of why 2000 genes were chosen as a good number to test? Why not 1000, or 500? Are the results overall robust to these (and other) thresholds? Then line 190 the threshold for downstream testing is now the top 20% of genes, etc. I am not opposed to different thresholds in principle, but they should be justified.</p>
<p>Likewise, comparing Tajima's D values near promoters to genome-wide values is unfair, because promoters are known to be under strong evolutionary constraints relative to background regions; as such it is not surprising that the results of this comparison are significant. A fairer comparison would attempt to better match controls (eg to promoters without HS lncRNA DBS, which I realise may be nearly impossible), or generate empirical p-values via permutation or simulation.</p>
<p>4. There are huge differences in the comparisons between the Vindija and Altai Neanderthal genomes that to me suggest some sort of technical bias or the such is at play here. e.g. line 190 reports 1256 genes to have a high distance between the Altai Neanderthal and modern humans, but only 134 Vindija genes reach the same cutoff of 0.034. The temporal separation between the two specimens does not seem sufficient to explain this difference, nor the difference between the Altai Denisovan and Neanderthal results (2514 genes for Denisovan), which makes me wonder if it is a technical artefact relating to the quality of the genome builds? It would be worth checking.</p>
<p>5. Inferring evolution: There are some points of the manuscript where the authors are quick to infer positive selection. I would caution that GTEx contains a lot of different brain tissues, thus finding a brain eQTL is a lot easier than finding a liver eQTL, just because there are more opportunities for it. Likewise, claims in the text and in Tables 1 and 2 about the evolutionary pressures underlying specific genes should be more carefully stated. The same is true when the authors observe high Fst between groups (line 515), which is only one possible cause of high Fst - population differentiation and drift are just as capable of giving rise to it, especially at small sample sizes.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>(1) According to Figure 1A (according actually to Meyer et al., 2012, Prufer et al., 2017, and Prüfer et al., 2013), the phylogenetic distance from modern humans to Denisovan is shorter than the distance to Altai Neanderthal. However, also according to these studies, the branch of Denisovan is more remote to modern humans than Altai Neanderthal. Thus, it is not unreasonable to find that 2514 and 1256 DBSs have distances &gt; 0.034 in genes in Denisovans and Altai Neanderthals, respectively. Probably, both the phylogenetic distances and DBS distances depend considerably on the sampled genomes of Altai and Denisovan who lived on the earth for quite long. When new samples are obtained, these distances may be somewhat changed.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding “they are computing two types of distances but then I lost track of which distance they were discussing in paragraph 3 of section 3”, the second type of distances were discussed in section 3, and the distances computed in the first way were not further analyzed because “This defect may be caused by that the human ancestor was built using six primates without archaic humans”.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, the TFs-TFBSs and lncRNAs-DBSs relationships are comparable, and which one contains more QTLs is an interesting question. In this sense, it is reasonable to use TFBSs as the control. However, for three reasons, we did not perform the comparison and use TFBSs as the control. First, most TFBSs are predicted by varied methods, making us concern the reliability of comparing two sets of predictions. Second, most QTLs in DBSs are mQTLs but most QTLs in TFBSs are eQTLs. Third, probably a greater portion of TFBSs than DBSs are not in promoters, and the time consumption of LongTarget made us unable to predict DBSs truly genome-wide. Nevertheless, this is an interesting question deserving further exploring.</p>

<p>Multiple sugar metabolism-related pathways, including “glucose homeostasis” and “glucose metabolic process”, are found to be enriched only in Altai Neanderthal but not in chimpanzees (Figure 2). Indeed, HS lncRNAs are across a much longer time frame than the transition to agriculture. However, given that apes and monkeys know picking the ripe, sugar-rich fruits at the right time and place, we conjecture that archaic humans as hunter-gatherer could effectively explore natural sugars.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Length is an important metric of DBS, but it has a defect – a triplex of 100 bp may have 50% or 70% of nucleotides bound; in the two situations, the binding affinity of DBD and DBS is very different.</p>

Otherwise, if the three transcripts have different TSS, the three promoter regions were used to predict DBSs.</p>
<p>(2) A gene may have many DBSs if it has many transcripts, or few ones if it has just a few transcripts. We did not correct for this uneven distribution of transcripts, because our GTEx analysis was on the transcript level; it is well recognized that transcripts of the same gene can be expressed in different tissues.</p>
<p>(3) We randomly sampled a pair of non-HS lncRNA and a transcript for 10000 times (i.e., 10000 pairs). It is a point that multiple draws of 40 non-HS lncRNAs should be made to make the statistics more robust.</p>

<p>The over-representation analysis using g:Profiler was performed taking the whole genome as the background. Analyzing more DBSs (especially weak DBSs) would generate more results, but the results could be less reliable. Thus, there is a trade-off between analyzing fewer DBSs with relatively high reliability and analyzing more DBSs with relatively low reliability. Inevitably, the handling of this trade-off is somewhat subjective, and to carefully compare the two classes of DBSs per can be an independent question. Although weak DBSs were not systematically analyzed, the results from the strong DBSs undoubtedly suggest that HS lncRNAs have contributed greatly to human evolution.</p>

<p>We used the same workflow (and the same cutoff 0.034) to analyze Vindija and Altai Neanderthal and Denisovan. If a smaller cutoff was used, one would see more Vindija genes. The question again is that there is a trade-off. Analyzing epigenome and epigenetic regulation in archaic genomes is an interesting direction, and much more studies are needed before more reasonably setting related parameters and cutoffs.</p>
