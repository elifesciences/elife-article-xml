<title>Summary</title><p>Rab-dependent membrane trafficking is critical for changing the structure and function of dendritic spines during synaptic plasticity. Here, we developed highly sensitive sensors to monitor Rab protein activity in single dendritic spines undergoing structural long-term potentiation (sLTP) in rodent organotypic hippocampal slices. During sLTP, Rab10 was persistently inactivated (&gt;30 min) in the stimulated spines, whereas Rab4 was transiently activated over ∼5 min. Inhibiting or deleting Rab10 enhanced sLTP, electrophysiological LTP and AMPA receptor (AMPAR) trafficking during sLTP. In contrast, disrupting Rab4 impaired sLTP only in the first few minutes, and decreased AMPAR trafficking during sLTP. Thus, our results suggest that Rab10 and Rab4 oppositely regulate AMPAR trafficking during sLTP, and inactivation of Rab10 signaling facilitates the induction of LTP and associated spine structural plasticity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Structural long-term potentiation (sLTP) is the structural basis of long-term potentiation (LTP) and plays a critical role in learning and memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Upon electrical synaptic stimulation or glutamate uncaging, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) into dendritic spines triggers diverse downstream signaling cascades, including Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which lead to the increase in spine volume and synaptic efficacy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. sLTP has two distinct phases: it starts with a rapid and transient spine enlargement over the first few minutes (transient phase), followed by a sustained enlargement over hours (sustained phase)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Different pharmacological or genetic manipulations can selectively inhibit these two phases, indicating distinct induction mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. The sustained phase is known to be coupled with LTP, while the physiological role of the transient phase is less clear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the transient phase is associated with the rapid ultrastructural changes of PSD and surrounding membrane and thus may be important for the dramatic synaptic increase in the initial phase of sLTP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. In addition, the spine enlargement during the transient phase induces presynaptic potentiation through mechanical force by pushing on the presynaptic bouton<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>During LTP and sLTP, various internal membranes are exocytosed in dendrites in an activity-dependent manner to add spine membrane area, increase surface glutamate receptors, and release plasticity-related peptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Particularly, activity-dependent synaptic delivery of GluA1 subunit of AMPA-type glutamate receptor (AMPAR) is considered one of the major mechanisms to increase postsynaptic glutamate sensitivity during LTP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Several members of the postsynaptic exocytosis machinery have been identified, including the soluble NSF-attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins, complexin, synaptotagmins, and myosin Vb<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Among the molecules regulating intracellular trafficking, Rab GTPases constitute the largest Ras subfamily, with more than 60 members localized to distinct intracellular domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. As small GTPases, Rab proteins switch between two states, the guanosine-5’-triphosphate (GTP)-bound “active” state and the guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-bound “inactive” state. Specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) regulate the conversion between these two states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Once activated, Rab GTPases recruit diverse downstream effectors to coordinate intracellular transport during vesicle budding, movement, tethering, and fusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Several members of Rab GTPases have been shown to coordinate AMPAR trafficking during synaptic plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Rab8 and Rab11 regulate the exocytosis of AMPARs during LTP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, whereas Rab5 drives the endocytosis of AMPARs during long-term depression (LTD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Rab4 is dispensable for LTP but is required for the maintenance of spine morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Rab4 also regulates both the fast and slow endosomal recycling to the plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. However, the function of other Rabs in synaptic plasticity is little known. Notably, Rab10 is expressed in dendrites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> and has been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease resilience<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Thus, Rab10 is potentially involved in membrane trafficking during synaptic plasticity.</p>
<p>In the present study, we developed a general design of FRET/FLIM-based sensors for various Rab proteins. Among these sensors, we further focused on the spatiotemporal dynamics of Rab10 and Rab4 activity during sLTP. We found that postsynaptic stimulation leads to the persistent inactivation of Rab10 and transient activation of Rab4 in spines undergoing sLTP. These Rab activity changes are dependent on NMDAR and CaMKII activation. Moreover, knock-down analyses demonstrate that Rab10 serves as a negative regulator of sLTP, whereas Rab4 contributes to the transient phase of sLTP. In addition, postnatal deletion of Rab10 from excitatory neurons enhanced sLTP and electrophysiological LTP at Schaeffer collateral pathway. Furthermore, Rab10 negatively regulates activity-dependent GluA1 trafficking into the stimulated spines during sLTP, while Rab4 positively controls this process. Therefore, our results suggest that Rab10 inhibits AMPAR trafficking during synaptic potentiation and NMDAR-dependent inactivation of Rab10 facilitates LTP induction. On the contrary, Rab4 promotes AMPAR trafficking during sLTP and NMDAR-dependent activation of Rab4 regulates the transient phase of sLTP.</p>

<title>Highly sensitive and selective FRET sensors for Rab proteins</title>
<p>To image Rab signaling activity in single dendritic spines, we developed FRET sensors for Rab4, 5, 7, 8, and 10. The Rab sensors have two components: (1) the Rab protein tagged with a fluorescent protein that serves as a FRET donor (monomeric enhanced green fluorescent protein (mEGFP)-Rab or mTurquoise2-Rab) and (2) a Rab binding domain (RBD) from a specific effector protein that is tagged with two fluorescent proteins as FRET acceptors (mCherry-RBD-mCherry or mVenus-RBD-mVenus). When the Rab protein is activated, RBD and Rab increase their binding and thus increase FRET between the donor and acceptor fluorophores (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). The fraction of Rab bound to the RBD (binding fraction) was calculated by measuring the fluorescence lifetime of the donor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>.</p>

</fig>
<p>For Rab4, 5, 7, 8 and 10, we used Rabenosyn5 [439-503], EEA1 [36-128], FYCO1 [963-206], Rim2 [27-175] and Rim1 [20-277] as RBDs, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. To test the sensitivity and specificity of these Rab sensors, we took three approaches. First, we transfected wild-type (WT)-Rab, dominant-negative (DN)-Rab, and constitutively active (CA)-Rab sensors in HEK 293T cells. As expected, DN-Rab and CA-Rab sensors displayed lower and higher binding fractions than the WT-Rab sensor, respectively, indicating the sensitivity of Rab sensors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b,c</xref>). Particularly, Rab4 and Rab10 sensors showed significantly different binding fractions between WT- and DN- or CA-Rabs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b,c</xref>). For Rab10 sensor, we used the mTurquoise2-mVenus pair instead of the mEGFP-mCherry pair since it reported higher binding fraction differences between WT- and DN-, as well as WT-and CA-Rab10 sensors in HEK 293T cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b,c</xref>, <xref rid="fige1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1a-d</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Second, we coexpressed a Rab sensor with the corresponding Rab GAPs or GEFs to test whether the sensor could respond to the known upstream signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Indeed, these GAPs and GEFs respectively decreased and increased the activity of Rab proteins as reported by the sensor (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d-I</xref>). Compared with Rab5 and Rab8, Rab4, Rab7 and Rab10 sensors displayed higher binding fraction changes in response to GAPs or GEFs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d-i</xref>). Third, we measured Rab activity change in response to N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) application in neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. We biolistically transfected rat organotypic hippocampal slices with each Rab sensor and imaged the proximal apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Bath application of NMDA (15 µM, 2 min) in zero extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> triggered a robust activation of Rab sensors in the dendrites, suggesting that Rab sensors could report neuronal Rab activities (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1j</xref>). Nevertheless, these Rab sensors showed different activation kinetics upon NMDA stimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1j</xref> and <xref rid="fige1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1e</xref>). Rab4 sensor was rapidly activated, peaked at 3 min and subsequently decayed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1j</xref> and <xref rid="fige1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1e</xref>). On the contrary, Rab5, 7, 8 and 10 sensors displayed a gradually accumulated activation pattern, which peaked at 6-11 min and decreased afterwards (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1j</xref> and <xref rid="fige1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1e</xref>). Notably, Rab10 sensor was transiently inactivated in the first 2 min, possibly reflecting a fast response to NMDAR activation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1j</xref> and <xref rid="fige1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1e</xref>). Overall, these results demonstrate that our Rab sensor strategy is generalizable to many Rab proteins.</p>

<title>Rab10 is persistently inactivated in the stimulated spines during sLTP</title>
<p>We biolistically transfected cultured organotypic hippocampal slices of rats with Rab10 sensor, and imaged the secondary apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons. mTurquoise2-Rab10, the sensor donor, was continuously distributed in the dendrites and spines, without showing an endosomal punctate pattern (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). To eliminate the effect of protein overexpression on its localization, we probed endogenous Rab10 by CRISPR-Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair (SLENDR) technique <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fige1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1f-j</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Endogenous Rab10 displayed a heterogeneous pattern: it is widely distributed along the dendrite and protrudes into the spines (<xref rid="fige1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1i</xref>). To elucidate the subcellular compartmentalization of Rab10, we further examined its colocalization with exogenously expressed endosomal markers <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fige1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1j</xref>). Rab10 is significantly overlapped with Rab7-labelled lysosomes, partially colocalized with Rab11-labelled recycling endosomes, but separated from Rab5-labelled early endosomes (<xref rid="fige1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1j</xref>).</p>

<p>To characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of Rab10 activity in single dendritic spines during sLTP, we combined two-photon glutamate uncaging with 2pFLIM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>, and imaged the secondary apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons expressing the Rab10 sensor at 25-27°C. Upon focal glutamate uncaging (0.5 Hz, 60 s) in zero extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup>, a single spine underwent a rapid volume increase within the first few minutes (ΔV<sub>transient</sub> = 275.9 ± 25.0%; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a,e,f</xref>), which decayed to a smaller but sustained volume increase lasting more than 30 min (ΔV<sub>sustained</sub> = 79.6 ± 6.7%; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a,e,g</xref>), consistent with the previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Concomitant with the spine enlargement, Rab10 showed a rapid and spine-specific decrease of activity in the stimulated spines, which lasted for more than 30 min (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a-d</xref>). Neither the changes in spine volume, basal binding fraction nor the changes in the binding fraction of Rab10 sensor correlated with the initial spine size (<xref rid="fige2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2a-e</xref>). To verify the specificity of the sensor response, we replaced the RBD of the Rab10 sensor with the RBD of Rab4 sensor (Rabenosyn5 [439-503], false acceptor). This false acceptor sensor did not show a significant change in FRET (measured as the binding fraction change) in the stimulated spines (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c,d,f,g</xref> and <xref rid="fige3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>). In addition, the Rab10 sensor displayed a similar inactivation pattern at a near physiological temperature (33-35°C; <xref rid="fige4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). In summary, our results demonstrate that Rab10 is persistently inactivated in the stimulated spines during sLTP, and this inactivation is compartmentalized in the stimulated spines.</p>
<p>The persistent inactivation of Rab10 during sLTP may be caused by the dilution of active Rab10 proteins due to the rapid spine enlargement. To examine this possibility, we compared the basal binding fraction of Rab10 sensor in spines and dendrites, and analyzed the subset of spines with lower Rab10 basal activity than the dendrite (<xref rid="fige5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5b-d</xref>). We found that Rab10 activity still decreased against the gradient at the spine neck upon sLTP induction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="fige5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5d</xref>). In addition, binding fraction of Rab10 sensor is independent of donor intensity (<xref rid="fige5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>). Thus, instead of passive signal dilution, the persistent inactivation of Rab10 requires active biological processes, presumably by translocating Rab10 positive vesicles out of the spine or directly inactivating Rab10 in the spine. To examine whether Rab10 distribution is changed during sLTP, we further analyzed the intensity of Rab10 donor in the stimulated spines and dendrites. Upon sLTP induction, Rab10 donor intensity significantly increased in the stimulated spines but remained unchaged in the dendrites (<xref rid="fige6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6a</xref>). The dramatic increase of Rab10 intensity in the stimulated spines was probably due to passive diffusion by spine enlargement. Therefore, we further analyzed the mean intensities of Rab10 donor in the stimulated spines and dendrites, which were similar prior and post sLTP induction (<xref rid="fige6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6b,c</xref>).</p>
<p>To further identify signaling pathways that inactivate Rab10 during sLTP, we applied pharmacological inhibitors targeting potential upstream components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Inhibition of NMDARs by 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5, 50 µM) completely abolished Rab10 inactivation and spine enlargement (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c,d,f,g</xref> and <xref rid="fige7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7a,b</xref>). Application of CN21 (10 µM), a CaMKII inhibitory peptide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>, abolished Rab10 inactivation while partially attenuating the volume change (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c,d,f,g</xref> and <xref rid="fige7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7c,d</xref>). In contrast, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor U0126 (20 µM) had no effect on Rab10 inactivation, although it impaired sLTP during the sustained phase (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c,d,f,g</xref> and <xref rid="fige7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7e,f</xref>). These results demonstrate that Rab10 is persistently inactivated in the stimulated spines during sLTP, and this inactivation is dependent on NMDARs and CaMKII but not on the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway.</p>

<title>Rab4 is transiently activated in the stimulated spines during sLTP</title>
<p>Next, we measured the spatiotemporal profile of Rab4 activity in dendrites during sLTP induced in single spines. Consistent with its localization in early and recycling endosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, mEGFP-Rab4, the sensor donor, showed a punctate distribution pattern (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). In the basal state, Rab4 sensor activity is not correlated with the donor intensity, and was lower in the spines than dendrites (<xref rid="fige5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5e-g</xref>). Glutamate uncaging (0.5 Hz, 60 s) induced a transient and sustained volume increase in the stimulated spines of neurons expressing Rab4 sensor (ΔV<sub>transient</sub> = 341.0 ± 29.4% and ΔV<sub>sustained</sub> = 77.6 ± 8.0%; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a,e</xref>-g). In contrast to the persistent inactivation of Rab10, Rab4 activity was transiently elevated in the stimulated spines and decayed, with no activity change in the adjacent spines or dendrites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a-d</xref>). This enhanced spine activity exceeds that of dendrite during sLTP, suggesting that the activation requires active processes (<xref rid="fige5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5h</xref>). Similarly to Rab10, we examined the intensity and mean intensity of Rab4 donor in the stimulated spines and dendrites. In the transient phase of sLTP, both the intensity and mean intensity of Rab4 donor significantly increased in the stimulated spines, suggesting recruitment of Rab4 into the stimulated spines (<xref rid="fige6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6d-f</xref>). In contrast, there was no donor intensity or mean intensity change in the dendrites (<xref rid="fige6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6d-f</xref>). Moreover, the initial spine volume was not correlated either with the volume changes, the basal activity of Rab4 reported or the level of Rab4 activation reported by the sensor (<xref rid="fige2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2f-j</xref>). Replacing the RBD of Rab4 sensor with the RBD for Rab10 sensor (Rim1 [20-227], false acceptor) showed no change of the binding fraction in the stimulated spines during sLTP, indicating the specificity of the sensor response (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c,d,f,g</xref> and <xref rid="fige8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>). In addition, the Rab4 sensor showed a similar transient activation pattern at a near-physiological temperature (33-35°C; <xref rid="fige9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9</xref>). Thus, our results demonstrate that Rab4 is transiently activated in the stimulated spines during sLTP, and this activation is compartmentalized in the stimulated spines.</p>

<title>Disruption of Rab10 signaling enhances structural and electrophysiological LTP, whereas disruption of Rab4 signaling inhibits the transient phase of structural LTP</title>
<p>Given that Rab10 and Rab4 display opposing activity profiles during sLTP, we hypothesized that they would have opposite functions in spine structural plasticity.

Under control condition with scrambled shRNA, application of a train of glutamate uncaging pulses (0.5 Hz, 60 s) in zero extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> induced a rapid spine volume increase in the transient phase, which decayed to a sustained enlarged volume for more than 30 min (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a,c</xref>).

<p>As an alternative strategy to inhibit Rab10 and Rab4 functions, we examined the effects of overexpressing DN-Rab mutants on spine structural plasticity.

CA1 pyramidal neurons expressing mCherry and SEP-GluA1 were imaged under two-photon microscopy. Since SEP-GluA1 is quenched in the acidic environment of endosomes, only the population on the surface emits fluorescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We pre-bleached surface SEP-GluA1 in a whole secondary dendrite with two-photon excitation, and measured the fluorescence recovery due to exocytosis in the spines after the induction of sLTP. Upon glutamate uncaging, the volume of the stimulated spines, measured with mCherry fluorescence, was increased by 352.8 ± 34.3% at 2 min (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a,b</xref>). Meanwhile, the fluorescence intensity of SEP-GluA1 was rapidly recovered from 15.4 ± 1.6% (0 min) to 108.8 ± 10.8% (2 min) in the stimulated spines (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a,b</xref>). However, in the non-stimulated adjacent spines and dendrites, SEP-GluA1 recovery was smaller and slower (for adjacent spines, from 17.3 ± 1.3% at 0 min to 28.9 ± 2.7% at 2 min; for dendrites, from 27.8 ± 1.4% at 0 min to 43.9 ± 1.9% at 2 min; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a,b</xref>). Overexpression of tetanus toxin light chain (TeTxLC), which cleaves vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>, significantly decreased both the spine enlargement and the SEP-GluA1 recovery in the stimulated spines, suggesting that the fluorescence recovery requires exocytosis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c-f</xref> and <xref rid="fige13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 13a</xref>).</p>

<p>To investigate whether Rab10 and Rab4 are involved in this activity-dependent postsynaptic AMPAR exocytosis, we knocked down endogenous Rab10 or Rab4 by respective shRNA, and monitored SEP-GluA1 exocytosis and sLTP in the stimulated and adjacent spines. No significant difference was seen in the adjacent spines or dendrites in either SEP-GluA1 recovery or mCherry intensity change among all groups (<xref rid="fige14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 14a-h</xref>). Compared with scrambled shRNA, expression of Rab10 shRNA enhanced the spine enlargement as well as SEP-GluA1 incorporation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a,c</xref>-f and <xref rid="fige13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 13d</xref>; measured at 2 min). These phenotypes were rescued by coexpressing shRNA-resistant Rab10 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a,c</xref>-f and <xref rid="fige13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 13e</xref>; measured at 2 min). Therefore, Rab10 negatively regulates GluA1 exocytosis in the stimulated spines during sLTP. In contrast, the expression of Rab4a and Rab4b shRNAs impaired spine enlargement (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a,e,f</xref> and <xref rid="fige13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 13b</xref>; measured at 2 min). It also significantly attenuated SEP-GluA1 recovery in the stimulated spines (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a,c,d</xref> and <xref rid="fige13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 13b</xref>; measured at 2 min).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The development of novel FRET-based biosensors for Rab proteins has revealed how Rab signaling pathways regulate sLTP in single dendritic spines. In brief, NMDAR activation triggers Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (∼ms) and CaMKII activation (∼s)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>, leading to the persistent inactivation of Rab10 (∼min) and transient activation of Rab4 (∼min) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g</xref>). Consistent with the directions and the duration of their activity change, Rab10 negatively regulates both the transient and sustained phase of sLTP and electrophysiological LTP. In contrast, Rab4 positively regulates the transient phase of sLTP. Thus, the temporal dynamics of Rab10 and Rab4 mirror the time courses of their functions in sLTP. Furthermore, Rab10 inhibits activity-dependent AMPAR trafficking during sLTP, while Rab4 promotes this process (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g</xref>). These results suggest that Rab4 and Rab10 play critical roles in two membrane trafficking events – AMPAR trafficking and spine enlargement – during sLTP.</p>
<p>Understanding the kinetics of Rab4 and Rab10 sensors is essential for interpreting their actual activity during sLTP. The Rab4 sensor exhibits a rapid rise and fall in activation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), indicating ON/OFF times of less than a few minutes. In contrast, the Rab10 sensor rapidly dissociates during sLTP induction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), with OFF kinetics occurring within one minute and fast ON kinetics in response to NMDA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1j</xref>). Given these rapid kinetics, the observed sustained inactivation of Rab10 likely reflects its true behavior rather than sensor dynamics.</p>
<p>Previous studies have suggested that gating of signaling regulates kinase-phosphatase balance during LTP. For example, activation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) pathway inactivates protein phosphatase, thereby gating CaMKII signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. Here we demonstrated that Rab10 is inactivated during sLTP and plays inhibitory roles in AMPAR trafficking and spine enlargement, suggesting that Rab10 acts as a gate for the membrane trafficking events during sLTP. Thus, gating of inhibitory signaling is likely a common mechanism in synaptic plasticity.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Rab4 facilitates membrane expansion and AMPAR trafficking, specifically during the transient phase of sLTP. In a previous study, LTP onset appears to be delayed in Rab4 knock-down neurons, implicating that Rab4 is required for the rapid increase of AMPAR current during LTP induction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Indeed, Rab4 is rapidly recruited into the spines in the transient phase of sLTP (<xref rid="fige6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6d-f</xref>). Consistently, recent ultrastructural analyses also demonstrated the increase of PSD complexity and membrane expansion during the transient phase of sLTP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. RhoA is another signaling molecule that plays a role specifically in the transient phase, likely by organizing the actin cytoskeleton in spines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. These signaling processes to rapidly reorganize spine structure during the transient phases would be critical for shaping the onset of synaptic transmission during LTP and sLTP.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Rab4, 5, 7, 8 and 10 sensors are all activated upon low-dose NMDA application (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1j</xref> and <xref rid="fige1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1e</xref>). However, they displayed distinct time courses and durations of activity change (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1j</xref> and <xref rid="fige1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1e</xref>). It is known that bath application of low-concentration NMDA induces LTD and dephosphorylation of AMPARs in the hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. During LTD, the rate of AMPAR internalization outweighs the rate of AMPAR exocytosis, resulting in a reduced number of synaptic AMPARs. Since Rab proteins are localized on different endosomes and coordinate individual parts of receptor trafficking, their distinct time courses and activity durations may reflect the involvement of related endosomes in LTD. Particularly, Rab10 sensor displayed bi-directional activity changes in response to sLTP or chemical LTD induction. To fully understand Rab10’s function in synaptic plasticity, it would be necessary to investigate its involvement in LTD.</p>
<p>Notably, the inactivation of Rab10 is persistent and lasts for over 30 min. Despite different time courses of activity during sLTP, other small GTPases RhoA, Cdc42, Rac1 and Ras also remain activated over 20 min<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Moreover, BDNF-TrkB signaling is rapidly activated in the spines and remains elevated for at least 60 min during sLTP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. The persistent inactivation pattern of Rab10 is possibly defined by the activity of its associated endosomal organelle in sLTP. Previous studies showed that Rab10 is localized on various membranes, including the early endosome, recycling endosome, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi and trans-Golgi network (TGN). With SLENDR-mediated knockin technique, we found that endogenous Rab10 is majorly overlapped with Rab7-labelled lysosome, partially colocalized with Rab11-labelled recycling endosome, but separated from Rab5-labelled early endosome <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fige1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1j</xref>). These results implicate that Rab10 may mediate the transport from recycling endosome to lysosome for protein degradation. Therefore, inactivation of Rab10 possibly inhibits AMPAR degradation pathway, resulting in more available AMPARs for synaptic insertion and synaptic potentiation.</p>
<p>Pharmacological analysis of Rab10 and Rab4 signaling pathways indicated that they are downstream of CaMKII, but not ERK. Previously, the Ras-ERK pathway has been implicated in regulating AMPAR delivery and sLTP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. Our data suggest that Rab10 and Rab4 act as parallel pathways that are independent of Ras-ERK signaling. The steps between CaMKII activation and Rab10 inactivation or Rab4 activation are still unclear. One possibility is through the direct phosphorylation of Rab proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>, or indirect regulations by Rab GAPs or GEFs. Interestingly, in contrast to the Ras-ERK pathway, which shows extensive spreading into dendrites or nucleus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>, the activity of Rab10 and Rab4 is restricted to the stimulated spines during sLTP. Thus, Rab10 and Rab4 may regulate local membrane trafficking in spines, whereas ERK may regulate AMPAR exocytosis in dendrites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>, through different downstream effectors. Notably, a spine-restricted pattern of signaling activity has also been observed for Cdc42 and Cofilin activation during sLTP, which promotes the actin polymerization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup>. Given that some Rab proteins are known to regulate actin polymerization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup>, it is plausible that they influence AMPAR exocytosis and spine enlargement through modulation of actin dynamics. Thus, the combination of local membrane trafficking and actin polymerization in spines appears important for spine expansion during sLTP.</p>
<p>Finally, our results highlight the diverse roles of Rab proteins in the orchestrated regulation of membrane trafficking during sLTP. It appears that Rab proteins operate in different directions and time windows. Whereas Rab10 negatively regulates sLTP for a long time (∼30 min), Rab4 positively regulates the initial ∼5 min of sLTP. Coordination of the upregulation and downregulation of the activity of various Rab proteins with unique functional and temporal properties would allow for the flexible and reliable control of membrane trafficking in multiple forms of spine structural plasticity. Although we measured the activity of only two Rab proteins in sLTP, it is likely that other members among the ∼60 Rab family proteins are critical for different spatiotemporal aspects of spine structural plasticity. Imaging the activity of other Rab proteins using similar Rab sensors will hopefully reveal the coordinated signaling that regulates membrane trafficking during synaptic plasticity.</p>

<p>As described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>, the fraction of donor bound to acceptor was determined by fitting a fluorescence lifetime curve that summed contributions from all pixels in the image, using a double exponential function convolved with the Gaussian pulse response function, as shown in the equation:

<graphic xlink:href="492345v3_ueqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>

In this equation, <italic>F<sub>0</sub></italic> is the peak fluorescence before convolution, while <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub> and <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>AD</italic></sub> represent the fractions of free donor and donor bound to the acceptor, respectively. <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub> is the time offset, <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub> is the fluorescence lifetime of the free donor, <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>AD</italic></sub> is the fluorescence lifetime of donor bound with acceptor, <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub> defines the width of the Gaussian pulse response function, and <italic>H</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is a fluorescence lifetime curve with a single exponential function convolved with the Gaussian pulse response function:

in which erfc is the complementary error function. We fixed <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub> as 2.46 ns, 2.60 ns and 4.15 ns, corresponding to the free mEGFP–Rab4a, mEGFP-Rab10, and mTurquoise2-Rab10 donors, respectively.

<p>To create the fluorescence lifetime image, we computed the mean photon arrival time, &lt; <italic>t</italic> &gt;, for each pixel using the following equation:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="492345v3_ueqn3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>

<title>Spine volume measurement</title>
<p>To estimate the spine volume in neurons expressing Rab sensors, we measured the integrated fluorescence intensity of mCherry-RBD-mCherry or mVenus-RBD-mCherry in the spine, which is proportional to the spine volume<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup>, and normalized it by the fluorescence intensity in the thick apical dendrite from the same neuron. We further multiplied this normalized value by the volume of the point spread function, which gives the spine volume in fL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>For the sensor experiments, we used mCherry as a volume indicator. We acknowledge that contributions from bleed-through from mEGFP-Rab (approximately 3%) and FRET changes (around 20%) could affect the volume measurements. However, since we observed similar fluorescence changes in both the green and red channels, we believe these factors have a minimal impact on our results (<xref rid="fige6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6a, d</xref>).</p>

The acquired images were analyzed by MATLAB (MathWorks) and ImageJ.</p>
<p>In <xref rid="fige14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 14</xref>, we addressed the impact of SEP-GluA1’s lateral diffusion by subtracting the change in spine surface area (Volume<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>/<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>) rather than correcting for spine volume. This approach is necessary because SEP-GluA1 is only fluorescent on the cell surface, while the fluorescence intensity of cytosolic proteins such as mCherry is proportional to spine volume. Therefore, the overall fluorescence change (<italic>ΔF</italic>) should be addition of the contribution from AMPAR trafficking (<italic>ΔF</italic><sub>t</sub>) and the change in surface area (<italic>ΔS</italic>) multiplied by the remaining SEP-GluA1 fluorescence per unit area (<italic>f</italic>):
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="492345v3_ueqn6.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
Since fluorescence immediately after photobleaching (before AMPAR trafficking happens), <italic>F<sub>o</sub>,</italic> is given by <italic>fS</italic> (<italic>S</italic> is the surface area of the spine):
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="492345v3_ueqn7.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
Assuming that the surface area change (<italic>ΔS</italic>/<italic>S</italic>) is the volume change (<italic>ΔV</italic>/<italic>V</italic>) to the power of 2/3, the contribution of the AMPAR trafficking can be calculated as:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="492345v3_ueqn8.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
Thus, we obtained the contribution of AMPAR trafficking by subtracting the volume change (<italic>ΔV</italic>/<italic>V</italic>) to the power of 2/3 from the fluorescence recovery (<italic>ΔF/F</italic>).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Wang et al. created a series of specific FLIM-FRET sensors to measure the activity of different Rab proteins in small cellular compartments. They apply the new sensors to monitor Rab activity in dendritic spines during induction of LTP. They find sustained (30 min) inactivation of Rab10 and transient (5 min) activation of Rab4 after glutamate uncaging in zero Mg. NMDAR function and CaMKII activation are required for these effects. Knock-down of Rab4 reduced spine volume change while knock-down of Rab10 boosted it and enhanced functional LTP (in KO mice). To test Rab effects on AMPA receptor exocytosis, the authors performed FRAP of fluorescently labeled GluA1 subunits in the plasma membrane. Within 2-3 min, new AMPARs appear on the surface via exocytosis. This process is accelerated by Rab10 knock-down and slowed by Rab4 knock-down. The authors conclude that CaMKII promotes AMPAR exocytosis by i) activating Rab4, the exocytosis driver and ii) inhibiting Rab10, possibly involved in AMPAR degradation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work is a technical tour de force, adding fundamental insights to our understanding of the crucial functions of different Rab proteins in promoting/preventing synaptic plasticity. The complexity of compartmentalized Ras signaling is poorly understood and this study makes substantial inroads. The new sensors are thoroughly characterized, seem to work very well and will be quite useful for the neuroscience community and beyond (e.g. cancer research). The use of FLIM for read-out is compelling for precise activity measurements in rapidly expanding compartments (i.e., spines during LTP). In addition to structural changes, evidence for functional LTP is provided, too.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The interpretation of the FRAP experiments (Fig. 5, Ext. Data Fig. 13) is not straightforward as spine volume and surface area greatly expand during uncaging. I appreciate the correction for added spine membrane shown in Extended Data Fig. 14i.</p>
<p>
Pharmacological experiments were not conducted or analyzed blind, risking bias in the selection/exclusion of experiments for analysis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Wang et al. developed a set of optical sensors to monitor Rab protein activity. Their investigation into Rab activity in dendritic spines during structural long-term plasticity (sLTP) revealed sustained Rab10 inactivation (&gt;30min) and transient Rab4 activation (~5 min). Through pharmacological and genetic manipulation to constitutively activate or inhibit Rab proteins, the authors discovered that Rab10 negatively regulates sLTP and AMPA receptor trafficking, while Rab4 positively influences sLTP but only during the transient phase. These optical sensors provide new tools for studying Rab activity in cell biology and neurobiology. The distinct kinetics and functions of Rab proteins are important for understanding synaptic plasticity. However, there are some concerns regarding result inconsistencies within this manuscript and with prior work.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The introduction of a series of novel sensors that can address numerous questions in Rab biology.</p>
<p>
(2) The use of multiple methods to manipulate Rab proteins to reveal the roles of Rab10 and Rab4 in LTP.</p>
<p>
(3) The discovery of Rab4 activation and Rab10 inhibition with different kinetics during sLTP, correlating with their functional roles in the transient (Rab4) and both transient and sustained (Rab10) phases of sLTP.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The discrepancy between spine phenotype and sLTP potential with Rab10 perturbation remains unexplained (refer to previous Weakness #4). The basal state is the outcome of many activity-dependent processes that are physiologically relevant. It is also unclear why different preparations would yield different results. These can be experimentally addressed, and it is at least important to highlight and discuss the discrepancies.</p>
<p>
(2) In the response, the authors estimated that the bleed-through from mEGFP-Rab is ~3% and the red channel signal from FRET changes is ~20%. The context of these percentages is unclear. Are they percentages of the total signal in the red channel, or does 3% refer to 3% of the green channel signal? Additionally, there is no explanation of how these numbers were estimated.</p>
<p>
(3) The changes in the fEPSP slope in response to theta burst stimulation (a decrease followed by a gradual increase) differ from prior publications (e.g. PMID: 1359925, 3967730, 19144965, 20016099). The explanation of these differences due to different conditions in response to Reviewer's recommendation #6 does not seem sufficient.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study examines the roles of Rab10 and Rab4 proteins in structural long-term potentiation (sLTP) and AMPA receptor (AMPAR) trafficking in hippocampal dendritic spines using various different methods and organotypic slice cultures as the biological model.</p>
<p>
The paper shows that Rab10 inactivation enhances AMPAR insertion and dendritic spine head volume increase during sLTP, while Rab4 supports the initial stages of these processes. The key contribution of this study is identifying Rab10 inactivation as a previously unknown facilitator of AMPAR insertion and spine growth, acting as a brake on sLTP when active. Rab4 and Rab10 seems to be playing opposing roles, suggesting a somewhat coordinated mechanism that precisely controls synaptic potentiation, with Rab4 facilitating early changes and Rab10 restricting the extent and timing of synaptic strengthening.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study combines multiple techniques such as FRET/FLIM imaging, pharmacology, genetic manipulations and electrophysiology to dissect the roles of Rab10 and Rab4 in sLTP. The authors developed highly sensitive FRET/FLIM-based sensors to monitor Rab protein activity in single dendritic spines. This allowed them to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of Rab10 and Rab4 activity during glutamate uncaging induced sLTP. They also developed various controls to ensure the specificity of their observations. For example, they used a false acceptor sensor to verify the specificity of the Rab10 sensor response.</p>
<p>This study reveals previously unknown roles for Rab10 and Rab4 in synaptic plasticity, showing their opposing functions in regulating AMPAR trafficking and spine structural plasticity during LTP.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In the first round of revision I raised these points:</p>
<p>(1) In sLTP, the initial volume of stimulated spines is an important determinant of induced plasticity. To address changes in initial volume and those induced by uncaging, the authors present Extended Data Figure 2. In my view, the methods of fitting, sample selection, or both may pose significant limitations for interpreting the overall results. While the initial spine size distribution for Rab10 experiments spans ~0.1-0.4 fL (with an unusually large single spine at the upper end), Rab4 spine distribution spans a broader range of ~0.1-0.9 fL. If the authors applied initial size-matched data selection or used polynomial rather than linear fitting, panels a, b, e, f, and g might display a different pattern. In that case, clustering analysis based on initial size may be necessary to enable a fair comparison between groups-not only for this figure but also for main Figures 2 and 3.</p>
<p>- The authors responded to this point as follows: For sensor uncaging experiments, we usually uncaged glutamate at large mushroom spines because we need to have a good signal-to-noise ratio. We just happen to choose these spines with different initial sizes for Rab4 sensor and Rab10 sensor uncaging experiments.</p>
<p>Even if they happen to choose these spine sizes, it is possible to compare only those that match in size. This does not require any additional experiments. Because of this, I do not find this response satisfactory.</p>
<p>(2) Another limitation is the absence of in vivo validation, as the experiments were performed in organotypic hippocampal slices, which may not fully replicate the complexity of synaptic plasticity in an intact brain, where excitatory and inhibitory processes occur concurrently. High concentrations of MNI-glutamate (4 mM in this study) are known to block GABAergic responses due to its antagonistic effect on GABA-A receptors, thereby precluding the study of inhibitory network activity or connectivity, which is already known to be altered in organotypic slice cultures.</p>
<p>- I found the Authors following response reasonable and useful:</p>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's comments and would like to clarify that we have conducted experiments in acute slices for LTP using conditional Rab10 knockout (Fig. 4k, 4l), and we obtained similar results. Additionally, we have recently published findings on the behavioral deficits observed in heterozygous Rab10 knockout mice (PubMed 37156612). These studies further support our conclusions and provide additional context for our findings.</p>

<p>Thank you for the evaluation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The interpretation of the FRAP experiments (Figure 5, Ext. Data Figure 13) is not straightforward as spine volume and surface area greatly expand during uncaging. I appreciate the correction for the added spine membrane shown in Extended Data Figure 14i, but shouldn't this be a correction factor (multiplication) derived from the volume increase instead of a subtraction?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this question. The fluorescence change should reflect a subtraction of surface area, as SEP-GluA1 is only fluorescent on the cell surface, unlike cytosolic mCherry, whose fluorescence intensity is proportional to spine volume. Therefore, the overall fluorescence change (Δ<italic>F</italic>) should be the addition of the contribution from AMPAR trafficking (Δ<italic>F<sub>t</sub></italic>) and the change in surface area (Δ<italic>S</italic>) multiplied by the remaining SEP-GluA1 fluorescence per unit area (<italic>f</italic>):</p>
<p>ΔF = Δ<italic>F<sub>t</sub></italic> + <italic>fΔS</italic></p>
<p>Since fluorescence immediately after photobleaching (before AMPAR trafficking happens), F<sub>o</sub>, is given by <italic>fS</italic> (<italic>S</italic> is the surface area of the spine):</p>
<p><italic>ΔF/F<sub>o</sub></italic> = Δ<italic>F<sub>t</sub></italic>/ F<sub>o</sub> + <italic>fΔS</italic> / <italic>fS</italic></p>
<p>= Δ<italic>F<sub>t</sub></italic>/<italic>fS</italic> + <italic>ΔS</italic>/<italic>S</italic></p>
<p>Assuming that the surface area change (<italic>ΔS</italic>/<italic>S</italic>) is the volume change (<italic>ΔV</italic>/<italic>V</italic>) to the power of 2/3, the contribution of the AMPAR trafficking can be calculated as:</p>
<p>Δ<italic>F<sub>t</sub></italic>/<italic>F</italic> = <italic>ΔF/F</italic> – (Δ<sup>V/V)<sup>2/3</sup></sup></p>
<p>This is the reason that we subtracted the contribution of the spine surface area. We have discussed this in the updated method section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Also, experiments were not conducted or analyzed blind, risking bias in the selection/exclusion of experiments for analysis. This reduces my confidence in the results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the reviewer's concern regarding the lack of blinding in our experiments. However, it is challenging to conduct blinded experiments for certain types of studies, such as sensor screening for a protein family, where we do not have expected results or a specific hypothesis prior to the experiments. In these cases, our primary readout is whether the sensor indicates any activity change upon stimulation.</p>
<p>To address this concern, after identifying that Rab10 is inactivated during structural LTP (sLTP) and is likely important for inhibiting spine structural LTP, we performed blinded electrophysiology experiments and obtained similar results (deletion of Rab10 from Camk2a-positive neurons leads to enhanced LTP; Fig. 4k, 4l).</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the positive evaluation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Lack of characterization of sensor kinetics, making it difficult to determine if the observed Rab kinetics during sLTP were due to sensor behavior or actual Rab activity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We estimated that the kinetics of the sensors for Rab4 and Rab10 are within a few minutes. For Rab4, we observed rapid increase and decrease of the activation in response to glutamate uncaging. Thus, this would be the upper limit of the ON/OFF time constants of Rab4. For Rab10, we observed a rapid dissociation of the sensor in response to sLTP induction within ~1 min. This means that the donor and acceptor molecules are quickly dissociated during the process. Thus, the off kinetics of the sensor is within the range of minute. Meanwhile, we have the on-kinetics from Rab10 activation (donor/accepter association) in response to NMDA application and again this is within a few minutes. Given these rapid sensor kinetics in neurons, our observation of the sustained inactivation of Rab10 should reflect the true behavior of Rab10, rather than just the sensor’s response.</p>
<p>We revised our manuscript discussion session as follows:</p>
<p>“Understanding the kinetics of Rab4 and Rab10 sensors is essential for interpreting their actual activity during sLTP. The Rab4 sensor exhibits a rapid rise and fall in activation (Fig. 3), indicating ON/OFF times of less than a few minutes. In contrast, the Rab10 sensor rapidly dissociates during sLTP induction (Fig. 2), with OFF kinetics occurring within one minute and fast ON kinetics in response to NMDA (Fig. 1j). Given these rapid kinetics, the observed sustained inactivation of Rab10 likely reflects its true behavior rather than sensor dynamics.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) It is crucial to assess whether the overexpression of Rab proteins as reporters, affects Rab activity and cellular structure and physiology (e.g. spine number and size).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While we did not measure the effects of Rab sensor overexpression on Rab activity or cellular structure and physiology, we showed that sLTP is similar in neurons expressing sensors. This suggests that the overexpression of Rab sensors does not significantly disrupt signaling required for sLTP.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The paper does not explain the apparently different results between NMDA receptor activation and glutamate uncaging. NMDA receptor activation increased Rab10 activity, while glutamate uncaging decreased it. NMDA receptor activation resulted in sustained Rab4 activation, whereas glutamate uncaging caused only brief activation of about 5 minutes. A potential explanation, ideally supported by data, is needed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is a long-standing question in the field why simple NMDA receptor activation by bath application of NMDA does not induce LTP, but instead induce LTD. Rab proteins are regulated by many GEFs and GAPs and identifying different mechanisms requires completely different techniques, such as molecular screening. While our manuscript provides some insights into this question by showing that they provide opposing signals for Rab10, we believe that identifying exact mechanisms would be out of the scope of this manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) There is a discrepancy between spine phenotype and sLTP potential with Rab10 perturbation. Rab10 perturbation affected spine density but not size, suggesting a role in spinogenesis rather than sLTP. However, glutamate uncaging affected sLTP, and spinogenesis was not examined. Explaining the discrepancy between spine size and sLTP potential is necessary. Exploring spinogenesis with glutamate uncaging would strengthen these results. Additionally, Figure 4j shows no change in synaptic transmission with Rab10 knockout, despite an increase in spine density. An explanation, ideally supported by data, is needed for the unchanged fEPSP slope despite an increase in spine density.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising these important questions. In our findings, shRNA-mediated knockdown of Rab10 did not alter spine size but did increase spine density in the basal state (Extended Data Fig. 11i). This suggests that Rab10 may restrict spinogenesis without affecting spine size. Conversely, sLTP induction via glutamate uncaging is an activity-dependent process that may involve different molecular mechanisms. The signal interplay between spinogenesis and sLTP and how the exact roles of Rab signaling in different modalities of plasticity would remain elusive for the future study.</p>
<p>The lack of change in synaptic transmission with Rab10 knockout, despite the increase in spine density from Rab10 shRNA knockdown, may be due to different preparation and developmental stages: spine density measurements were conducted with shRNA knockdown in organotypic slices (sliced at P6-8, DIV 9-13), while electrophysiological recordings were performed in knockout mice in acute slices from adult animals (P30-60).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Spine volume was imaged using acceptor fluorophores (mCherry, or mCherry/Venus) at 920nm, where the two-photon cross-section of mCherry is minimal. 920nm was also used to excite the donor fluorophore, hence the spine volume measurement based on total red channel fluorescence is the sum of minimal mCherry fluorescence from direct 920nm excitation, bleed-through from the green channel, and FRET. This confounded measurement requires correction and clarification.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We assumed that the most of fluorescence is from direct excitation of mCherry at 920 nm. The contribution from the bleed-through from mEGFP-Rab (~3%) and from FRET changes (~20%) may influence the volume measurements. However, since we observed similar fluorescence changes in the green and red channels, these factors would have only a minor impact on our results (Extended Data Fig. 6a, 6d). Also, please note that the volume change in neurons expressing sensors is just to check if the volume change is normal, and not a major point of this manuscript.  We clarified this in the method section as:</p>
<p>“For the sensor experiments, we used mCherry as a volume indicator. We acknowledge that contributions from bleed-through from mEGFP-Rab (approximately 3%) and FRET changes (around 20%) could affect the volume measurements. However, since we observed similar fluorescence changes in both the green and red channels, we believe these factors have a minimal impact on our results (Extended Data Fig. 6a, 6d).”</p>

Rab4 and Rab10 seem to be playing opposing roles, suggesting a somewhat coordinated mechanism that precisely controls synaptic potentiation, with Rab4 facilitating early changes and Rab10 restricting the extent and timing of synaptic strengthening.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study combines multiple techniques such as FRET/FLIM imaging, pharmacology, genetic manipulations, and electrophysiology to dissect the roles of Rab10 and Rab4 in sLTP. The authors developed highly sensitive FRET/FLIM-based sensors to monitor Rab protein activity in single dendritic spines. This allowed them to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of Rab10 and Rab4 activity during glutamate uncaging-induced sLTP. They also developed various controls to ensure the specificity of their observations. For example, they used a false acceptor sensor to verify the specificity of the Rab10 sensor response.</p>
<p>This study reveals previously unknown roles for Rab10 and Rab4 in synaptic plasticity, showing their opposing functions in regulating AMPAR trafficking and spine structural plasticity during LTP.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In sLTP, the initial volume of stimulated spines is an important determinant of induced plasticity. To address changes in initial volume and those induced by uncaging, the authors present Extended Data Figure 2. In my view, the methods of fitting, sample selection, or both may pose significant limitations for interpreting the overall results. While the initial spine size distribution for Rab10 experiments spans ~0.1-0.4 fL (with an unusually large single spine at the upper end), Rab4 spine distribution spans a broader range of ~0.1-0.9 fL. If the authors applied initial size-matched data selection or used polynomials rather than linear fitting, panels a, b, e, f, and g might display a different pattern. In that case, clustering analysis based on initial size may be necessary to enable a fair comparison between groups not only for this figure but also for main Figures 2 and 3.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for these questions. For sensor uncaging experiments, we usually uncaged glutamate at large mushroom spines because we need to have a good signal-to-noise ratio. We just happen to choose these spines with different initial sizes for Rab4 sensor and Rab10 sensor uncaging experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Another limitation is the absence of in vivo validation, as the experiments were performed in organotypic hippocampal slices, which may not fully replicate the complexity of synaptic plasticity in an intact brain, where excitatory and inhibitory processes occur concurrently. High concentrations of MNI-glutamate (4 mM in this study) are known to block GABAergic responses due to its antagonistic effect on GABA-A receptors, thereby precluding the study of inhibitory network activity or connectivity [1], which is already known to be altered in organotypic slice cultures.</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewer's comments and would like to clarify that we have conducted experiments in acute slices for LTP using conditional Rab10 knockout (Fig. 4k, 4l), and we obtained similar results. Additionally, we have recently published findings on the behavioral deficits observed in heterozygous Rab10 knockout mice (PubMed 37156612). These studies further support our conclusions and provide additional context for our findings.</p>

<p><bold>From the Senior/Reviewing Editor:</bold></p>
<p>I apologize that this took longer than intended. As you will see from the reviews there was some disagreement on several points. There was some disagreement among reviewers as to the strength of the evidence with some characterizing it as &quot;compelling,&quot; &quot;convincing,&quot; or &quot;solid&quot; while others felt the characterization of the sensors was &quot;incomplete&quot; and that this could have affected some of the conclusions. After extensive discussion, reviewers agreed that there was a valid concern that the conclusion that Rab10 activation is sustained could reflect a feature of the sensor. If Rab10/RBD dissociation rate were very low, and the affinity of binding were very high, this could lead to an incorrect estimate of the sustained binding due to sensor kinetics, not Rab10 activation. It was noted that this has been seen in other sensors previously (e.g. first generation PKA activity sensors), which the developers altered in later generations to increase reversibility and off kinetics of the sensor.</p>
<p>There was also discussion of how this might be addressed and we would be interested in your comments on this issue. It was suggested that it might be helpful to revise Figure 2b to show binding fraction dynamics separately for each spine (to determine whether any actually return to baseline). Subsequently, clustering of these binding dynamics into two groups could be summarized in a version of Fig. 2e for each cluster. Differences in spine volume dynamics between these clusters would provide a measure of how strongly Rab10 binding correlates with spine volume. If they never go back to baseline, some extra experiments with longer post-plasticity induction (150mins instead of 35), might show if any reversible Rab10 binding exists post-LTP induction.</p>
<p>An alternative suggestion was to measure the time course in the presence of a GAP or GEF, which should alter the kinetics.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the comments. It is important that the inactivation is observed as the dissociation of the donor and acceptor of the sensor.  Thus, the fact that the sensor rapidly decreases in response to uncaging means that they have rapid off kinetics. In addition, we provide evidence of a rapid increase of Rab10 in response to NMDA application, suggesting that kinetics is also rapid. We added discussion about this in the revised manuscript as:</p>
<p>“Understanding the kinetics of Rab4 and Rab10 sensors is essential for interpreting their actual activity during sLTP. The Rab4 sensor exhibits a rapid rise and fall in activation (Fig. 3), indicating ON/OFF times of just a few minutes. In contrast, the Rab10 sensor rapidly dissociates during sLTP induction (Fig. 2), with OFF kinetics occurring within one minute and fast ON kinetics in response to NMDA (Fig. 1j). Given these rapid kinetics, the observed sustained inactivation of Rab10 likely reflects its true behavior rather than sensor dynamics.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>There was also further discussion of the nature of the &quot;spine volume&quot; signal, given the fact that the two-photon cross-section of mCherry is minimal at 920nm. It was suggested that this could be due to direct acceptor excitation rather than FRET, but there was agreement that further clarity on this issue would be valuable.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We assumed that the most of fluorescence is from direct excitation of mCherry at 920 nm. The contribution from the bleed-through from mEGFP-Rab (~3%) and from FRET changes (~20%) may influence the volume measurements. However, since we observed similar fluorescence changes in the green and red channels, these factors would have only a minor impact on our results (Extended Data Fig. 6a, 6d). Also, please note that the volume change in neurons expressing sensors is just to check if the volume change is normal, and not a major point of this manuscript.  We clarified this in the method section as:</p>
<p>“For the sensor experiments, we used mCherry as a volume indicator. We acknowledge that contributions from bleed-through from mEGFP-Rab (approximately 3%) and FRET changes (around 20%) could affect the volume measurements. However, since we observed similar fluorescence changes in both the green and red channels, we believe these factors have a minimal impact on our results (Extended Data Fig. 6a, 6d).”</p>

<p>The equations in the methods section differ from other papers by the same lab (e.g. Laviv et al, Neuron 2020, Tu et al. Sci Adv. 2023, Jain et al. Nature 2024). Please clarify which equations are correct.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors</bold>):</p>
<p>The effects of Rab knockdown affect both spine volume expansion and AMPAR recovery in a very similar fashion. To explain this tight coupling, the authors suggest that the availability of membrane could be a limiting factor for spine enlargement. However, some Rabs are known to affect actin dynamics, which could also explain the dual effects on AMPAR exocytosis and spine enlargement. It is not easy to come up with an experiment to differentiate between these alternative explanations, as blocking actin polymerization would likely affect exocytosis, too. The authors should consider/discuss the possibility that all of the observed Ras effects result from altered actin dynamics and that the lipid bilayer is sufficiently fluid to form a minimal surface around the expanding cytoskeleton.</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestions. We included the discussion about the potential impact on the actin cytoskeleton by Rab10.</p>

<p>(3) In Figure 1f: Rab5 GAP expression increased the binding fraction against expectations. In addition, clarifying the color scheme in Figure 1 is needed. Are GAPs supposed to be blue/green, and GEFs red/orange? Figure 1f seems to contradict this color scheme.</p>

<p>(4) Quantification of the point spread function of the uncaging laser, response/settle time of the scan mirror during uncaging, and reason for changes in neighboring spines in many example images (e.g. Figure 2a, especially at 240 s; Figure 4a) would be important.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The laser is controlled by Pockels cells, which changes the laser intensity with microsecond resolution. The laser is parked for milliseconds during uncaging, much longer than the settling time of the mirror (~0.1 milliseconds). The point spread function of the uncaging laser is limited by the diffraction (~0.5 um). The uncaging spot size is mostly limited by the diffusion of uncaged glutamate, but our calcium imaging and CaMKII imaging show that the signaling is induced mostly in the stimulated spines (Lee et al., 2009; Chang et al., 2017, 2019).</p>

<p>(6) The traces in Figure 4k (fEPSP slope in response to theta burst stimulation, where there is a decrease in fEPSP slope followed by a gradual increase) differ from prior publications (e.g. PMID: 1359925, 3967730, 19144965, 20016099). An investigation and explanation for these differences are necessary.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments. We performed the experiments blindly and did not try to find a condition providing control data similar to previous publications. The variations in fEPSP responses compared to prior publications may be attributed to several factors, including differences in experimental conditions such as the genetic background of the animals used, the specific protocols for theta burst stimulation, and variations in the preparation of the hippocampal slices.</p>

<p>(7) The title and text state that Rab10 inactivation promotes AMPAR insertion. It is unclear if this is a direct effect on AMPAR insertion or an indirect effect through membrane remodeling. Providing data to distinguish these possibilities or adjusting the title/text to reflect alternative interpretations would be beneficial.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's feedback. To clarify, we have revised our terminology to use &quot;AMPAR trafficking&quot; instead of &quot;AMPAR insertion&quot;, as it includes both insertion and other mechanisms of AMPAR movement within the cell.</p>

<p>(8) Please provide an explanation for the initial Rab10 inactivation observed in Figure 1j upon NMDA application.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The application of NMDA in Fig. 1j is similar to the commonly used chemical LTD induction protocol. We used this broad stimulation approach to test whether our sensors could report Rab activity changes in neurons upon strong stimulation. However, it is an entirely different stimulation approach from the sLTP induction protocol, thus resulting in different sensor activity changes.  We describe the phenomenon in the revised manuscript, but we believe that detailed analyses of Rab10 activation in response to NMDA application are beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p>

<p>(9) Please explain why the study focuses on Rab4 and Rab10 instead of other Rab proteins.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>During our initial screening of sensors for various Rab proteins, we observed significant activity changes in the sensors for Rab4 and Rab10 upon sLTP induction. This suggested their potential relevance in synaptic processes, leading us to focus on understanding their specific roles in structural long-term potentiation.</p>
