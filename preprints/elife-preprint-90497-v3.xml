<title>Abstract</title><p>After exocytosis, release sites are cleared of vesicular residues to replenish with transmitter-filled vesicles. Endocytic and scaffold proteins are thought to underlie this site-clearance mechanism. However, the physiological significance of this mechanism at diverse mammalian central synapses remains unknown. Here, we tested this in a physiologically optimized condition using action potential evoked EPSCs at fast calyx synapse and relatively slow hippocampal CA1 synapse, in post-hearing mice brain slices at 37°C and in 1.3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. Pharmacological block of endocytosis enhanced synaptic depression at the calyx synapse, whereas it attenuated synaptic facilitation at the hippocampal synapse. Block of scaffold protein activity likewise enhanced synaptic depression at the calyx but had no effect at the hippocampal synapse. At the fast calyx synapse, block of endocytosis or scaffold protein activity significantly enhanced synaptic depression as early as 10 ms after the stimulation onset. Unlike previous reports, neither endocytic blockers nor scaffold protein inhibitors prolonged the recovery from short-term depression. We conclude that the release-site clearance by endocytosis can be a universal phenomenon supporting vesicle replenishment at both fast and slow synapses, whereas the presynaptic scaffold mechanism likely plays a specialized role in vesicle replenishment predominantly at fast synapses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chemical synaptic transmission depends upon fusion of transmitter-filled vesicles with the presynaptic membrane. At presynaptic terminals, there are a limited number of vesicular release sites, which can become refractory while discharged vesicles are remaining at the site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Katz, 1993</xref>), inhibiting subsequent vesicle fusion. Following inactivation of the temperature-sensitive endocytic protein dynamin in <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutant <italic>Shibire</italic>, short-term depression (STD) of neuromuscular synaptic currents evoked by action potentials (APs) are enhanced within 20 ms from the stimulation onset at 33°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kawasaki et al., 2000</xref>), suggesting that endocytosis plays a significant role in rapid release site-clearance in addition to its well-established role in vesicle recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Neher and Sakaba, 2008</xref>). The enhancement of STD by blocking endocytosis was reproduced at the calyx of Held in slices from rodent brainstem, associated with a pronounced prolongation in the recovery from STD of EPSCs evoked by a paired command pulses under voltage clamp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Hosoi et al., 2009</xref>). Fluorescence imaging with synaptopHluorin at cultured hippocampal synapses also showed that endocytic blockers, but not the vesicle acidification blockers, enhances steady state depression of exocytosis induced by high-frequency stimulation, suggesting slow clearance of vesicular component from release-sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Hua et al., 2013</xref>). Also, in cell culture studies, genetic ablation of the endocytic adaptor protein AP-2<italic>μ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Jung et al., 2015</xref>), synaptophysin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Rajappa et al., 2016</xref>), or the secretory carrier membrane protein SCAMP5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Park et al., 2018</xref>) enhances STD.</p>
<p>However, it remains open whether the endocytosis-dependent release site-clearance phenomenon reported at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kawasaki et al., 2000</xref>) plays physiological role at mammalian central synapses.</p>
<p>The presynaptic scaffold protein intersectin is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, which activates the Rho-GTPase CDC42, thereby regulating the filamentous (F) actin assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Hussain et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Marie et al., 2004</xref>). At the calyx of Held in slices from pre-hearing rodents, genetic ablation of intersectin 1 or pharmacological block of CDC42 abolishes the fast component of the rate of recovery from STD of EPSCs evoked by a pair of square pulses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Sakaba et al., 2013</xref>). They suggest that the scaffold protein cascade, comprising intersectin, CDC42 and F-actin, contributes to rapid vesicle replenishment possibly through release site-clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Japel et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Like the endocytosis-dependent site-clearance mechanism, its physiological significance at diverse mammalian central synapses remains unknown. To address these issues, we evoked EPSCs by afferent fiber stimulations in post-hearing (P13-15) mice brain slices, without presynaptic intracellular perturbation, at brainstem calyces of Held and hippocampal CA1 synapses at physiological temperature (PT, 37°C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Sanchez-Alavej et al., 2011</xref>) and in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing 1.3 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, in reference to rodent CSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Jones and Keep, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Silver and Erecinska, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Inglebert et al., 2020</xref>). The post-hearing calyx of Held is a fast-signaling auditory relay synapse that can respond to inputs up to 500 Hz without failure <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Sonntag et al., 2009</xref>) and displays STD during repetitive stimulation. In contrast, the hippocampal synapses from Schaffer collaterals (SCs) to pyramidal cells (PCs) in the CA1 area is a relatively slow synapse that starts to fail transmission already at 40 Hz in slice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Combe et al., 2018</xref>) and at 37°C and in 1.3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], short-term facilitation masked depression. At these synapses, we tested the effect of blocking endocytosis or scaffold protein cascade activity on EPSCs evoked by repetitive afferent fiber stimulations (30x) at different frequencies. These experiments indicated that the endocytosis-driven site-clearance mechanism activity-dependently supports vesicle replenishment, thereby counteracting synaptic depression at brainstem calyceal synapses and boosting synaptic facilitation at hippocampal CA1 synapses. In contrast, the vesicle replenishing role of the scaffold mechanism is activity independent and restricted to fast calyceal synapses, where it co-operates with the endocytosis-dependent site-clearance mechanism to upregulate synaptic strength, thereby maintaining the high-fidelity fast neurotransmission.</p>

<title>Potency of endocytic blockers on slow and fast endocytosis at the calyx of Held</title>
<p>To clarify physiological roles of endocytosis in high-frequency synaptic transmission, we first examined the effect of different endocytic inhibitors on fast and slow endocytosis, using presynaptic membrane capacitance measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Sun et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Yamashita et al., 2010</xref>) at post-hearing calyces of Held (P13-15) at PT (37°C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Renden and von Gersdorff 2007</xref>). Since genetic ablation of endocytic proteins can be associated with robust compensatory effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Ferguson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Park et al., 2013</xref>), we adopted acute pharmacological block using endocytic inhibitors Dynasore and Pitstop-2. For these experiments, we used 2.0 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] aCSF (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) to allow direct comparison with previous reports. Dynasore is a dynamin-dependent endocytosis blocker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Macia et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Newton et al., 2006</xref>) blocking both clathrin-mediated and clathrin-independent endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Park et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Delvendahl et al., 2016</xref>). A second endocytosis blocker Pitstop-2 is thought to preferentially block clathrin-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">von Kleist et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Delvendahl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Lopez-Hernandez et al., 2022</xref>) but it reportedly blocks clathrin-independent endocytosis as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Dutta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Willox et al., 2014</xref>).</p>

<p>At calyces of Held, a single short (5 ms) command pulse elicited an exocytic capacitance jump (<italic>Δ</italic>C<sub>m</sub>) followed by a slow endocytosis (29 fF/s in decay rate, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). In the presence of Dynasore (100 <italic>μ</italic>M) or Pitstop-2 (25 <italic>μ</italic>M) in the perfusate (within 10-60 min of application) this slow endocytic membrane recovery was almost completely blocked, whereas <italic>Δ</italic>C<sub>m</sub> or presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents were unchanged (Table S1). In a repetitive stimulation protocol, the accelerating endocytosis can be induced by a 1-Hz train of 20-ms square pulses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Wu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Yamashita et al., 2010</xref>). Dynasore or Pitstop-2 significantly inhibited the maximal rate of 250 fF/s of this accelerated fast endocytosis (20 ms x 15 times at 1 Hz) to ∼ 50 % (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, Table S1). In another stimulation protocol (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), 10 command pulses (20 ms duration) applied at 10 Hz induced a fast endocytosis with a decay rate (350 fF/s) by more than 10 times faster than the slow endocytosis elicited by a 5 ms pulse (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Dynasore or Pitstop-2 significantly inhibited the rate of this fast endocytosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, Table S1) too. The potencies of bath-applied Dynasore or Pitstop-2 for blocking slow and fast forms of endocytosis were comparable to that of dynamin-1 proline-rich domain peptide (Dyn-1 PRD peptide) directly loaded in calyceal terminals (1mM; Figure S1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, at calyces of Held, bath-application of Dynasore or Pitstop-2 can block both fast and slow endocytosis to a similar extent as direct presynaptic whole-cell loading of Dyn-1 PRD peptide without perturbing presynaptic intracellular milieu.</p>

<title>Effects of endocytic blockers on synaptic depression and recovery from depression at brainstem calyceal synapses</title>
<p>Using Dynasore or Pitstop-2, we investigated the effect of blocking endocytosis on synaptic transmission at the calyx of Held in brainstem slices from post-hearing mice (P13-15). At PT (37°) in physiological aCSF (1.3mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]), EPSCs were evoked by a train of afferent fiber stimulations (30x at 10 and 100 Hz; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Neither Dynasore nor Pitstop-2 (in the perfusate, within 10-60 min of application) affected the first EPSC amplitude in the train (Figure S2A). During a train of stimulations at 10 Hz, in the presence of Dynasore (100 <italic>μ</italic>M), synaptic depression was marginally enhanced (from 45% to 52%, with no significant difference), but Pitstop-2 had no effect (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>1). At 100-Hz stimulations, however, both Dynasore and Pitstop-2 markedly and equally enhanced synaptic depression starting at 10 ms (2<sup>nd</sup> stimulation) from the stimulus onset, increasing the magnitude of steady state STD (averaged from #26-30 EPSCs) from 58% to 75% (1.3 times; p &lt; 0.001, t-test; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>1). These results suggest that endocytosis-dependent rapid SV replenishment operates during high-frequency transmission at the mammalian central synapses like at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kawasaki et al., 2000</xref>). Since glutamate released during action potential evoked EPSCs does not desensitize or saturate postsynaptic receptors at post-hearing calyces of Held (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Ishikawa et al, 2002</xref>) unlike at pre-hearing calyces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Yamashita et al, 2009</xref>), enhanced synaptic depression in the presence of endocytic blockers during repetitive fiber stimulations is most likely caused by presynaptic mechanisms. In fact, the results of the endocytic block were essentially the same in the absence (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) or presence (Figure S3) of the low-affinity glutamate receptor ligand kynurenic acid (1 mM), which reduces postsynaptic receptor occupancy with glutamate.</p>

<p>At pre-hearing calyces of Held at room temperature (RT) and in 2.0 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], the recovery from STD of EPSCs evoked by paired long (50 ms) command pulse stimulations was markedly prolonged by dynamin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Hosoi et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, at post-hearing calyces in 1.3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] and at PT (37°C), the endocytic blockers did not prolong the recovery of EPSCs from STD (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>2, 2B2, Table S2). Conversely, the recovery from STD caused by 100-Hz stimulation was significantly accelerated at both fast and slow recovery components (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>2, Table S2). To explore the reason for these different results, we raised Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in aCSF to 2.0 mM at PT (Figure S4A), RT (Figure S4B) or raised stimulation frequency to 200 Hz at PT (Figure S4C). However, none of these manipulations caused significant change in the kinetics of recovery from STD (Figure S4). Remaining differences between previous and present results include the species-and/or age-differences of animals (pre-hearing rats <italic>vs</italic> post-hearing mice), with or without whole-cell perturbation, and strength of stimulation intensity, which is much stronger in the voltage-clamp protocol with a long (50 ms) command pulse compared to AP. The reason for the slight recovery acceleration in our protocol remains unknown. Since the acceleration was absent in 2.0 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (Figure S4) in the presence of Dynasore or Pitstop-2 as previously observed in dynamin-1 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Mahapatra et al, 2016</xref>), there might be a low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]-dependent recovery acceleration mechanism distinct from that enhanced by high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (CDR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wang and Kaczmarek, 1998</xref>).</p>

<title>Effects of scaffold protein cascade inhibitors on vesicle endocytosis, synaptic depression, and recovery from depression at brainstem calyceal synapses</title>
<p>Among presynaptic scaffold proteins, F-actin is assembled by the Rho-GTPase CDC42 activated by the scaffold protein intersectin, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Hussain et al., 2001</xref>; Marie et al., 2004).

<title>Kinetic comparison of synaptic depression enhanced by endocytic blockers and scaffold cascade inhibitors and evaluation of their combined effect</title>
<p>During 100-Hz stimulation, enhancement of synaptic depression by endocytic blockers or scaffold cascade inhibitors are prominent already in the second EPSCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>1, 4B1). Exponential curve fits to the data points of STD time-course (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>) indicated that the EPSCs underwent a single exponential depression in controls with a mean time constant of 37 ms (n = 11), whereas in the presence of endocytic blockers or scaffold cascade inhibitors, EPSCs amplitude underwent double exponential decay with a fast time constant of 5-10 ms and a slow time constant of 24-40 ms, the latter of which was similar to the time constant in control (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). These data indicate that endocytic and scaffold mechanisms for vesicle replenishment operate predominantly at the beginning of synaptic depression. This is consistent with a lack of prolongation in the recovery from STD by endocytic blockers or scaffold cascade inhibitors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>2, 2B2; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>2, 4B2).</p>

</fig>
<p>Since the enhancement of synaptic depression by endocytic blockers or scaffold cascade inhibitors occurred mostly at the early phase of synaptic depression, endocytosis-and scaffold-dependent synaptic strengthening likely operate simultaneously during high-frequency transmission. To clarify whether these mechanisms are additive or complementary, we co-applied Dynasore and Latrunculin-B during 100 Hz stimulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). The magnitude of EPSC depression by the co-application was the same as that by single Latrunculin-B application (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>), suggesting that endocytosis and scaffold mechanisms complementarily maintain synaptic strength during high-frequency transmission.</p>
<p>The F-actin depolymerizers Latrunculin A and Latrunculin B are widely utilized to examine presynaptic roles of F-actin. However, the results of STD and recovery from STD can vary according to the application methods and experimental conditions (Figure S5A). At the calyx of Held, in 2.0 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] aCSF at PT, Latrunculin A perfusion (20 <italic>μ</italic>M, 1h, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>1) showed a significant enhancement of STD at 100 Hz within 10-60 min of drug application (Figure S5B1, S5D), as previously reported for Latrunculin B perfusion at RT and 200 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Mahapatra et al, 2016</xref>). However, 1h preincubation of slices with Latrunculin A (20 <italic>μ</italic>M) followed by perfusion with standard aCSF (∼1h, Figure S5A2) had no significant effect on STD induced by a train of 30 stimuli at 100 Hz (Figure S5B2, S5D), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Babu et al, 2020</xref>). In 1.3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] aCSF at PT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>), marked STD enhancement was observed by continuous perfusion of either Latrunculin B (15 <italic>μ</italic>M, Figure S5C, Figure S5D) or Latrunculin A (20 <italic>μ</italic>M, Figure S5C, Figure S5D). Thus, Latrunculin A (20 <italic>μ</italic>M) and Latrunculin B (15 <italic>μ</italic>M) are equipotent for STD enhancement in these experiments (Figure S5C, S5D).</p>
<p>When the data are compared between 1.3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] and 2.0 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], STD levels after Latrunculin A perfusion are not different (<italic>p &gt;</italic> 0.05, Figure S5D), whereas control STD level in 1.3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (∼0.4) was significantly less than 2.0 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (∼0.3; <italic>p =</italic> 0.002, t-test; Figure S5D). Thus, physiological 1.3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] revealed a robust STD-counteracting function of F-actin.</p>
<p>Regarding the recovery from STD, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent recovery (CDR) component of tens of ms time constant is produced by strong stimulation at the calyx of Held at RT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wang and Kaczmarek, 1998</xref>) and inhibited by Latrunculin B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Lee et al, 2013</xref>). CDR is also observed after STD induced by 100 Hz stimulation at PT and blocked by Latrunculin A pretreatment (20 <italic>μ</italic>M) in 2 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Babu et al, 2020</xref>). However, such Latrunculin-sensitive fast recovery component was absent in 1.3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>2, Table S2). Thus, CDR may operate only when excessive Ca<sup>2+</sup> enters during massive presynaptic activation.</p>

<title>Possible role of endocytosis and scaffold machineries at hippocampal synapses</title>
<p>Counteraction of synaptic depression by endocytosis or scaffold mechanism is highlighted at fast synapses of large structure such as neuromuscular junction or the calyx of Held. However, it remains open whether these mechanisms are conserved at other type of synapses. Hence, we recorded EPSCs from bouton-type hippocampal synapses at CA1 pyramidal neurons evoked by SC stimulation at 10 Hz or 25 Hz at 37°C and in aCSF containing 1.3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). In this physiologically optimized experimental condition, EPSCs underwent a prominent facilitation and reached a peak at the 7<sup>th</sup> stimulation at 10 Hz and at the 12<sup>th</sup> stimulation at 25 Hz (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). In the presence of Dynasore (100 <italic>μ</italic>M, within 10-60 min of application in perfusate), synaptic facilitation was much less than control, which was noticeable within 500 ms (6<sup>th</sup> stimulation) at 10 Hz stimulation or within 80 ms (3<sup>rd</sup> stimulation) at 25 Hz stimulation from the onset (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, 6B). Unexpectedly, Dynasore significantly enhanced the basal EPSC amplitude (Figure S2B), whereas Pitstop-2 had no such effect (Figure S2B). Although less potent than Dynasore, Pitstop-2 significantly attenuated synaptic facilitation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, 6B). Thus, at these relatively slow bouton-type hippocampal synapses, endocytosis enhanced synaptic strength like at fast calyceal synapses to boost short-term synaptic facilitation.</p>

<p>Strikingly, unlike endocytic blockers, neither ML141 nor Latrunculin-B affected the hippocampal short-term facilitation during stimulations at 10 Hz or 25 Hz (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, 6D). Thus, the presynaptic scaffold cascade proteins F-actin or CDC42 unlikely plays a regulatory role on short-term synaptic plasticity at hippocampal synapses. At the hippocampal CA1 synapse in slices at RT, block of vesicle acidification is reported to enhance synaptic depression at 10-30-Hz stimulation possibly due to a rapid recruitment of unfilled vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ertunc et al., 2007</xref>), whereas the same treatment in hippocampal culture shows no such effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Hua et al., 2013</xref>). To determine whether the vesicle acidification blockers might enhance STD like endocytic blockers in physiologically optimized condition, we tested the effect of Bafilomycin and Folimycin on hippocampal EPSCs. Unlike in 2.0 mM [Ca <sup>2+</sup>] aCSF at RT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ertunc et al., 2007</xref>), in 1.3-mM [Ca <sup>2+</sup>] aCSF at PT, EPSCs showed a prominent facilitation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, Figure S6), and neither Folimicin (67 nM) nor Bafilomycin A1 (5 <italic>μ</italic>M) significantly affected the short-term facilitation (Figure S6). Thus, physiologically, the vesicle acidification mechanism is not involved in the short-term synaptic efficacy at hippocampal CA1 synapses.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>At the calyx of Held in slices under physiologically optimized conditions, blocking endocytosis by bath-application of Dynasore or Pitstop-2 enhanced activity dependent short-term depression of EPSCs evoked by high-frequency afferent fiber stimulations. This enhancement of synaptic depression was significant already at the 2<sup>nd</sup> EPSC (10 ms) after the stimulation onset and proceeded bi-exponentially with a fast (5-6 ms) and slow (24-35 ms) time constant (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). These slow time constants were comparable to control time constant (37 ms) undergoing mono-exponential depression. Thus, the depression-counteracting effect of endocytosis was restricted to the early epoch of high-frequency transmission when many vesicles occupy the release sites. As number of vesicles undergoing exocytosis during repetitive stimulation gradually reduces, the site-clearance likely becomes less demanding.</p>
<p>At the calyx of Held, Dynasore or Pitstop-2 blocked both fast and slow endocytosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The fast endocytosis is characterized with a rate of ∼350 fF/s, which was slowed by endocytic blockers to ∼150 fF/s (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, Table S1). This reduction of endocytic rate (200 fF/s) corresponds to 2.54 vesicles/ms (1 fF = 12.7 vesicles; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Yamashita et al., 2010</xref>; 200 fF/s x 12.7 vesicles x 1/1000 ms). Since the mean amplitude of miniature EPSCs, representing a single vesicle response, was ∼55 pA in 1.3 mM [Ca <sup>2+</sup>] at PT (data not shown), endocytic block is estimated to reduce EPSC amplitude by ∼1.4 nA in 10 ms (2.54 vesicles/ms x 55 pA x 10 ms x 1/1000 nA). This is close to the average amplitude difference between control and endocytic blockers (1.6 nA) at the 2<sup>nd</sup> EPSC (10 ms after the 1<sup>st</sup> EPSC) under 100-Hz stimulation. Therefore, during high-frequency transmission, the site-clearance by fast endocytosis can fully compensate the initial strong depression. However, the rate of slow endocytosis (29 fF/s) is ∼10 times slower than fast endocytosis (250-350 fF/s; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, Table S1), therefore slow endocytosis unlikely contributes to the millisecond-order site-clearance. However, without slow endocytosis, vesicular membrane remaining after spontaneous exocytosis would accumulate and congest release sites. Thus, slow endocytosis may play a house-keeping role in release site-clearance.</p>
<p>At the calyx of Held, scaffold protein inhibitors significantly enhanced the early phase of synaptic depression (starting at the 2<sup>nd</sup> stimulation at 100 Hz; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>1) like endocytic blockers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>1, 5A, 5B), despite that they do not block endocytosis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). In contrast to the endocytic blockers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), the STD-enhancing effect of scaffold protein inhibitors was stronger and independent of stimulation frequency (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Co-application of endocytic and scaffold protein cascade inhibitors revealed that the synaptic strengthening effects of endocytosis and scaffold machinery are complementary rather than additive (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). These results together suggest that fast endocytosis quickly clears vesicle residues, whereas scaffold machinery simultaneously mobilizes and replenishes transmitter-filled vesicles to release sites during high frequency transmission (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Through these combinatory mechanisms, synaptic strength and high-fidelity neurotransmission (up to 500 Hz; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Sonntag et al., 2009</xref>) can be maintained at fast synapses such as the calyx of Held auditory relay synapse.</p>

<caption><title>Hypothetical vesicle replenishment scheme by endocytosis and scaffold-machineries during repetitive transmission at fast-signaling calyx and slow-plastic hippocampal CA1 synapses.</title>
<p>During high-frequency transmission, endocytosis driven site-clearance allows activity-dependent replenishment of new vesicles to release sites. This endocytic function counteracts synaptic depression caused by vesicle depletion, thereby maintain synaptic strength, enabling high-fidelity fast neurotransmission at sensory relay synapses, like at the calyx of Held. This endocytosis driven synaptic strengthening function augments synaptic facilitation at slow-plastic synapses like hippocampal CA1 synapses that exhibit long-term plasticity, thereby boosting its induction capability for memory formation. Whereas, the presynaptic scaffold machinery plays a powerful direct vesicle replenishment role, independent of endocytosis and activity, thereby rapidly translocating new vesicles to open release sites including those just opened by endocytic site-clearance. This scaffold function is specifically devoted to fast-signaling synapses, with high release probability but not to plastic synapses, where vesicle depletion is minimal due to low release probability.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>At hippocampal CA1 synapses the roles of endocytosis and scaffold machineries in fast vesicle replenishment were different from those at the calyx of Held. Under physiological conditions in slices, short-term plasticity at hippocampal CA1 synapses was facilitatory, in contrast to depression at calyceal synapses. Endocytic blockers attenuated the synaptic facilitation, suggesting that endocytosis boosts synaptic facilitation at this synapse (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Since synaptic strength at facilitatory synapses is determined by a sum of facilitation and depression mechanisms, attenuation of synaptic depression by endocytosis can boost synaptic facilitation. At hippocampal excitatory synapses, short-term increase in glutamate release induces long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory transmission. Thus, from physiological viewpoints, endocytosis-dependent site clearance may play a critical role in the induction of LTP underlying memory formation.</p>
<p>In clear contrast to fast calyceal synapses, the scaffold protein inhibitor ML141 or Latrunculin B had no effect on EPSC facilitation at relatively slow hippocampal CA1 synapses (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, 6D). This was somewhat unexpected since in hippocampal culture Latrunculin-A blocks ultra-fast endocytosis (UFE, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Watanabe et al. 2013</xref>), which occurs preferentially at physiological temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Watanabe et al., 2014</xref>). Since Latrunculin A and B are equipotent in enhancing STD at calyceal synapses in 1.3 mM [Ca <sup>2+</sup>] aCSF at PT (Fig S5C, S5D), the physiological role of UFE in hippocampal synaptic transmission remains unclear. Latrunculin-B reportedly inhibits vesicular docking by limiting replacement pool filling during high-frequency inputs at parallel fiber (PF)-molecular layer interneuron synapses in cerebellar slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Miki et al., 2016</xref>). This synapse is adapted to respond to high-frequency inputs, like other cerebellar synapses (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Ritzau-Jost et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that the actin-dependent scaffold-machinery operates for rapid vesicular replenishment predominantly at fast synapses, whereas it is non-functional at relatively slow synapses. In contrast, the endocytosis-dependent site-clearance mechanism seems to be a universal phenomenon supporting vesicular replenishment among fast and slow mammalian central synapses.</p>

<title>Slice preparation (brainstem and hippocampal) and electrophysiology</title>
<p>Following decapitation of C57BL/6J mice under isoflurane anesthesia, brains were isolated and transverse slices (200 <italic>μ</italic>m thick) containing the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) or parasagittal slices (300 <italic>μ</italic>m) containing the hippocampus were cut using a vibratome (VT1200S, Leica) in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF, see below) with reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> (0.1 mM) and increased Mg<sup>2+</sup> (2.9 mM) concentrations and with NaCl replaced by 200 mM sucrose. Slices were incubated for 1h at 37°C in standard aCSF containing (in mM); 115 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.3 or 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 glucose, 3 myo-inositol, 2 sodium pyruvate, and 0.4 sodium ascorbate (pH 7.3-7.4 when bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 285-290 mOsm). Unless otherwise noted, EPSCs were recorded in 1.3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] aCSF at 37°C. During recording, a brain slice in a temperature-controlled chamber (RC-26GLP, PM-1; Warner instruments) was continuously perfused with aCSF solutions without (control) or with the pharmacological blockers using a peristaltic pump (5-6 µl/s). Recordings with or without the blockers were made from separate cells in different slices from a minimum of 3-4 animals for each set of experiment. In experiments at PT, solutions kept in a water bath (37°C) and passed through an in-line heater (SH-27B, Warner instruments) placed immediately before the recording chamber and maintained at 37°C (± 0.2°C) by a controller (TC-344C, Warner instruments). For RT experiments, no heating was used, and the temperature was within 22-24°C. Recordings in the presence of pharmacological blockers were made within 10-60 min of drug application and for control experiments a slice was kept in the recording chamber no longer than 1 h.</p>
<p>Whole-cell recordings were made using a patch-clamp amplifier (EPC-10 USB, HEKA Elektronik, Germany) from the calyx of Held presynaptic terminals, postsynaptic MNTB principal neurons, or hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons visually identified with a 60X water immersion objective (LUMPlanFL, Olympus) attached to an upright microscope (BX51WI, Olympus, Japan). Data were acquired at a sampling rate of 50 kHz using Patchmaster software (for EPC-10 USB) after online filtering at 5 kHz. The patch pipettes were pulled using a vertical puller (PIP6, HEKA) and had a resistance of 3-4 M<italic>Ω.</italic></p>

<title>Membrane capacitance recordings from presynaptic calyx terminal (at PT)</title>
<p>The patch pipettes for presynaptic capacitance recording were wax coated to reduce stray capacitance and had a series resistance of 6-15 M<italic>Ω</italic>, which was compensated by up to 60% for its final value to be 6 M<italic>Ω</italic>. To isolate presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents (I<sub>Ca</sub>) during membrane capacitance measurements (C<sub>m</sub>), tetrodotoxin (1 µM) and tetra-ethyl-ammonium chloride (TEA, 5 mM) were routinely added to block Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels, respectively. Calyx terminals were voltage clamped at a holding potential of-70 mV and a sine wave (peak to peak = 60 mV at 1kHz) was applied. A single pulse (5 ms) or a train of 20 ms pulses (15 stimuli at 1 Hz or 10 stimuli at 10 Hz) to +10 mV were given to induce slow, fast-accelerating, and fast endocytosis. The capacitance trace within 450 ms after the stimulation pulse was excluded from analysis to avoid capacitance artifacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>). The exocytic capacitance jump (ΔC<sub>m</sub>) in response to a stimulation pulse was measured as difference between baseline and mean C<sub>m</sub> at 450-460 ms after the pulse onset. The endocytic rate was measured from the C<sub>m</sub> decay phase 0.45-5.45 s from the end of 5 ms stimulation pulse, 0.45-0.95 s for 1 Hz train stimulation and 0.45-1.45 s after the last (10<sup>th</sup>) pulse for 10 Hz train stimulation. The average C<sub>m</sub> traces were calculated from individual C<sub>m</sub> traces, and error bars were analyzed from resampled individual C<sub>m</sub> traces in low frequency for clarity (every 10 ms for 10 Hz train stimulation and every 20 ms for both 5 ms single and 1 Hz train stimulations).</p>

<title>EPSC recordings from brainstem and hippocampus</title>
<p>For EPSC recordings, brainstem MNTB principal neurons or hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells were voltage-clamped at the holding potential of-80 mV. To evoke EPSCs a bipolar electrode was placed on afferent fibers between MNTB and midline in brainstem slices or on the Schaffer collateral fibers in the stratum radiatum near the CA1 border in hippocampal slices.</p>
<p>The patch pipettes had a series resistance of 5-15 M<italic>Ω</italic> (less than 10 M<italic>Ω</italic> in most cells) that was compensated up to 80% for a final value of ∼3 M<italic>Ω</italic> for EPSC recording from MNTB neurons. For EPSC recording from hippocampal pyramidal cells, no compensation was made, and capacitance artifacts were manually corrected. Stimulation pulses were applied through an isolator (Model 2100, A-M Systems) controlled by EPC10 amplifier (HEKA).</p>
<p>During EPSC recordings, strychnine-HCl (Sigma, 2 µM), bicuculline-methiodide (Sigma, 10 µM) and D-(-)-2-Amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (D-AP5, Tocris, 50 µM) were added to isolate AMPA receptor-mediated EPSCs. In some experiments, to minimize AMPA receptor saturation and desensitization, kynurenic acid (Sigma, 1 mM) was added to aCSF. Unless otherwise specified, the internal pipette solution for presynaptic capacitance measurements contained (in mM): 125 Cs gluconate, 10 HEPES, 20 TEA-Cl, 5 sodium phosphocreatine, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP and 0.5 EGTA (pH 7.2-7.3, adjusted with CsOH, adjusted to 305-315 mOsm by varying Cs-gluconate concentration). For EPSC recording, the internal pipette solution contained QX-314 bromide (2 mM) and EGTA, either 5 mM (for MNTB cells) or 0.5 mM (for pyramidal cells), but otherwise identical to the presynaptic pipette solution. Dynasore (100 µM), Pitstop-2 (25 µM), ML 141 (10 µM), Folimycin (also known as Concanamycin A; 67 nM), Latrunculin-A (20 µM), Latrunculin B (15 µM), and Bafilomycin A1 (5 µM) were dissolved in DMSO (final concentration 0.1%, except for Latrunculin-A, 0.2%). Since Latrunculin A, Latrunculin-B and Folimycin are light sensitive, precautions were taken to minimize light exposure during handling and recording. Dynamin 1 proline-rich domain (PRD) peptide (sequence: PQVPSRPNRAP; GenScript) was dissolved in presynaptic pipette solution (1 mM). Membrane capacitance (C<sub>m</sub>) recordings in the presence of Dyn-1 PRD peptide were initiated 4-5 min after whole-cell membrane rupture to allow its time of diffusion inside presynaptic terminals.</p>

<p>Mahapatra and Takahashi report on the physiological consequences of pharmacologically blocking either clathrin and dynamin function during compensatory endocytosis or of the cortical actin scaffold both in the calyx of Held synapse and hippocampal boutons in acute slice preparations.</p>
<p>Although many aspects of these pharmacological interventions have been studied in detail during the past decades, this is a comprehensive and comparative study, which reveals some interesting differences between a fast synapse (Calyx of Held) tuned to reliably transmit at several 100 Hz and a more slow hippocampal CA1 synapse. In particular the authors find that acute disturbance of the synaptic actin network leads to a marked frequency-dependent enhancement of synaptic depression in the Calyx, but not in the hippocampal synapse. This striking difference between both preparations is the most interesting finding.</p>
<p>Comments on latest version:</p>
<p>The authors have done a great job revising the paper and only minor revisions are suggested to the Discussion of the paper.</p>
<p>Two quite relevant and recent papers should be cited and briefly discussed because they relate directly to Pitstop2 effects and actin-myosin-scaffold proteins in the calyx of Held synapse.</p>
<p>One is: Paksoy A et al, (2022) &quot;Effects of the clathrin inhibitor Pitstop-2 on synaptic vesicle recycling at a central synapse in vivo.&quot; Front. Synaptic Neurosci. 14:1056308. doi: 10.3389/fnsyn.2022.1056308. This paper shows with EM that changes caused by PitStop2 perturbation of &quot;clathrin function suggest that clathrin plays a role in SV recycling from both, the plasma membrane and large endosomes, under physiological activity patterns, in vivo.&quot;</p>
<p>Second: A role for actin-myosin and MLCK in short-term plasticity has been shown by Srinivasan G., et al. (2008) &quot;The Pool of Fast Releasing Vesicles Is Augmented by Myosin Light Chain Kinase Inhibition at the Calyx of Held Synapse.&quot; J Neurophysiol 99: 1810-1824, 2008. The data here suggests that MLCK plays a crucial role in determining the size of the pool of synaptic vesicles that undergo fast release but not the Pr of the synapse. In other words, MLCK inhibition augments super-priming of vesicles at the calyx of Held synapse.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study examines the role of release site clearance in synaptic transmission during repetitive activity under physiological conditions in two types of central synapses, calyx of Held and hippocampal CA1 synapses. After acute block of endocytosis by pharmacology, deeper synaptic depression or less facilitation was observed in two types of synapses. Acute block of CDC42 and actin polymerization, which possibly inhibits the activity of Intersectin, affected synaptic depression at the calyx synapse, but not at CA1 synapses. The data suggest an unexpected, fast role of the site clearance in counteracting synaptic depression.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study uses acute block of the molecular targets with pharmacology together with precise electrophysiology. The experimental results are clear cut and convincing. The study also examines the physiological roles of the site clearance using action potential-evoked transmission at physiological Ca and physiological temperature at mature animals. This condition has not been examined.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Pharmacology may have some off-target effects, though acute manipulation should be appreciated and the authors have tried several reagents to verify the overall conclusions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Mahapatra and Takahashi report on the physiological consequences of pharmacologically blocking either clathrin and dynamin function during compensatory endocytosis or of the cortical actin scaffold both in the calyx of Held synapse and hippocampal boutons in acute slice preparations</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Although many aspects of these pharmacological interventions have been studied in detail during the past decades, this is a nice comprehensive and comparative study, which reveals some interesting differences between a fast synapse (Calyx of Held) tuned to reliably transmit at several 100 Hz and a more slow hippocampal CA1 synapse. In particular the authors find that acute disturbance of the synaptic actin network leads to a marked frequency-dependent enhancement of synaptic depression in the Calyx, but not in the hippocampal synapse This striking difference between both preparations is the most interesting and novel finding.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, these findings concerning the different consequences of actin depolymerization are not sufficiently discussed in comparison to the literature. My only criticism concerns the interpretation of the ML 141 and Lat B data. With respect to the Calyx data, I am missing a detailed discussion of the effects observed here in light of the different RRP subpools SRP and FRP. This is very important since Lee at al. (2012, PNAS 109 (13) E765-E774) showed earlier that disruption of actin inhibits the rapid transition of SRP SVs to the FRP at the AZ. The whole literature on this important concept is missing. Likewise, the role of actin for the replacement pool at a cerebellar synapse (Miki et al., 2016) is only mentioned in half a sentence. There is quite some evidence that actin is important both at the AZ (SRP to FRP transition, activation of replacement pool) and at the peri-active zone for compensatory endocytosis and release site clearance. Both possible underlying mechanisms (SRP to FRP transition or release site clearance) should be better dissected.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The manuscript by Mahapatra and Takahashi addresses the role of presynaptic release site clearance during sustained synaptic activity. The authors characterize the effects of pharmacologically interfering with SV endocytosis (pre-incubation with Dynasore or Pitstop-2) on synaptic short-term plasticity (STP) at two different CNS synapses (calyx of Held synapses and hippocampal SC to CA1 synapses) using patch-clamp recordings in acute slices under experimental conditions designed to closely mimic a physiological situation (37{degree sign}C and 1.3 mM external [Ca2+]). Endocytosis blocker-induced changes in STP and in the recovery from short-term depression (STD) are compared to those seen after pharmacologically inhibiting actin filament assembly (pre-incubation with Latrunculin-B or the selective Cdc42 GTPase inhibitor ML-141). Presynaptic capacitance (Cm) recordings in calyx terminals were used to establish the effects of the pharmacological maneuvers on SV endocytosis.</p>
<p>Latrunculin-B and ML-141 neither affect SV endocytosis (assayed by Cm recordings) nor EPSC recovery following conditioning trains, but strongly enhances STD at calyx synapses. No changes in STP were observed at Latrunculin-B- or ML-141-treated SC to CA1 synapses.</p>
<p>Dynasore and Pitstop-2 slow down endocytosis, limit the total amount of exocytosis in response to long stimuli, enhance STD in response to 100 Hz stimulation, but profoundly accelerate EPSC recovery following conditioning 100 Hz trains at calyx synapses. At SC to CA1 synapses, Dynasore and Pitstop-2 reduce the extend of facilitation and lower relative steady-state EPSCs suggesting a change in the facilitation-depression balance in favor of the latter.</p>
<p>The authors use state-of-the art techniques and their data, which is clearly presented, leads to authors to conclude that endocytosis is universally important for clearance of release sites while the importance of scaffold protein-mediated site clearance is limited to 'fast synapses'.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, and perhaps not completely unexpected in view of the pharmacological tools chosen, there are several observations which remain difficult to understand:</p>
<p>(1) Blocking site clearance affects release sites that have previously been used, i.e. sites at which SV fusion has occurred and which therefore need to be cleared. Calyces use at most 20% of all release sites during a single AP, likely fewer at 1.3 mM external [Ca2+]. Even if all those 20% of release sites become completely unavailable due to a block of release site clearance, the 2nd EPSC in a train should not be reduced by &gt;20% because ~80% of the sites cannot be affected. However,
~50% EPSC reduction was observed (Fig. 2B1, lower right panel) raising the possibility that
Dynasore does more than specifically interfering with SVs endocytosis (and possibly Pitstop as well). Non-specific effects are also suggested by the observed two-fold increase in initial EPSC size in SC to CA1 synapses after Dynasore pre-incubation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This study compares different experimental conditions to conclude the physiological role of endocytosis on rapid neurotransmission at the large calyceal synapse in mice. A related study at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (Kawasaki et al., Nat. Neuroscience 2000) reported similar findings in comparable experimental settings (physiological conditions and acute block of endocytosis).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) More severe depression was observed at calyx synapses after blocking endocytosis which the authors attribute to a presynaptic mechanism affecting pool replenishment. When probing EPSC recovery after conditioning 100 Hz trains, a speed up was observed mediated by an &quot;unknown mechanism&quot; which is &quot;masked in 2 mM [Ca2+]&quot;. These two observations, deeper synaptic depression during 100 Hz but faster recovery from depression following 100 Hz, are difficult to align and no attempt was made to find an explanation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>By varying temperature (PT vs RT), calcium concentration (1.3 mM vs 2.0 mM), and stimulation frequency (10, 100, and 200 Hz; some data are not shown), the effect of endocytosis block on EPSC STD and recovery from STD kinetics at the post-hearing calyx were compared in these settings: (PT, 1.3 mM [Ca2+]), (PT, 2.0 mM Ca2+), and (RT, 2.0 mM [Ca2+]), to dissect their respective role.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) To reconcile previous data reporting a block of Ca2+-dependent recovery (CDR) by Dynasore or Latrunculin (measured at 2 mM external [Ca2+]) with the data presented here (using 1.3 mM external [Ca2+]) reporting no effect or a speed up of recovery from depression, the authors postulate that &quot;CDR may operate only when excessive Ca2+ enters during massive presynaptic activation&quot; (page 10 line 244). While that is possible, such explanation ignores plenty of calyx studies demonstrating fiber stimulation-induced CDR and elucidating molecular pathways mediating fiber stimulation-induced CDR, and it also completely dismisses the strong change in recovery time course after 10 Hz conditioning (single exponential) as compared to 100 Hz conditioning (double exponential with a pronounced fast component).</p>
<p>Strong presynaptic stimuli such as those illustrated in Figs. 1B,C induce massive exocytosis. The illustrated Cm increase of 2 to 2.5 pF represents fusion of 25,000 to 30,000 SVs (assuming a single SV capacitance of 80 aF) corresponding to a 12 to 15% increase in whole terminal membrane surface (assuming a mean terminal capacitance of ~16 pF). Capacitance measurements can only be considered reliable in the absence of marked changes in series and membrane conductance. Documentation of the corresponding conductance traces is therefore advisable for such massive Cm jumps and merely mentioning that the first 450 ms after stimulation were skipped during analysis or referring to previous publications showing conductance traces is insufficient.</p>
<p>All bar graphs in Figures 1 through 6 and Figures S3 through S6 compare three or even four (Fig. 5C) conditions, i.e. one control and at least two treatment data sets. It appears as if repeated t-tests were used to run multiple two-group comparisons (i.e. using the same control data twice for two different comparisons). Either a proper multiple comparison test should be used or a Bonferroni correction or similar multiple-comparison correction needs to be applied.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We updated the statistical analysis of all data using one-way ANOVA and t-test with BonferroniHolm method of p level correction and rectified one analysis in Fig 1 and 3, all major conclusions are unchanged.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Finally, the terminology of contrasting &quot;fast-signaling&quot; (calyx synapses) and &quot;slow-plastic&quot; (SC synapses) synapses seems to imply that calyx synapses lack plasticity, as does the wording &quot;conventional bouton-type synapses involved in synaptic plasticity&quot; (page 11, line 251). I assume, the authors primarily refer to the maximum frequencies these two synapse types typically transmit (fast-signaling vs slow-signaling)?</p>

<p>page 17, line 398 &quot;Cm traces were averaged at every 10 ms (for 10 Hz train stimulation) or 20 ms (for 5 ms single or 1 Hz train stimulation).&quot; Do you mean to say that Cm traces were smoothed with a moving average using a window size of 10 or 20 ms duration? Please clarify.</p>

<p>page 18, &quot;All values are given as mean {plus minus} SEM and significance of difference was evaluated by Student's unpaired t-test, unless otherwise noted.&quot; Please check. You cannot simply use repeated t-tests for multiple comparisons. Either a proper multiple comparison test should be used or a Bonferroni correction or similar multiple-comparison correction needs to be applied.</p>

<p>All statistical analysis are updated using one-way ANOVA and t-test, with Bonferroni-Holm method of p level correction and one analysis is rectified in Fig 1 and 3, with no change in major conclusions.</p>
