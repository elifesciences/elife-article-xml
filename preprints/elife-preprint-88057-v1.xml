<title>Abstract</title><p>The naked mole-rat (<italic>Heterocephalus glaber</italic>) is a mouse-sized rodent species, notable for its eusociality and long lifespan. Previously, we reported that demographic aging, i.e., the exponential increase of mortality hazard that accompanies advancing age in mammals and other organisms, does not occur in naked mole-rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ruby et al, 2018</xref>). The demographic data supporting that conclusion had taken over three decades to accumulate, starting with the original rearing of <italic>H.glaber</italic> in captivity. In the five years following that study, we ∼doubled our quantity of demographic data. Here, we re-evaluated our prior conclusions in light of these new data and found them to be supported and indeed strengthened. We additionally provided insight into the social dynamics of captive <italic>H.glaber</italic> with data and analyses of body weight and colony size versus mortality. Finally, we provide a phylogenetically-proximal comparator in the form of lifespan data from our Damaraland mole-rat (<italic>Fukomys damarensis</italic>) colony and demographic meta-analysis of those data along with published data from Ansell’s mole-rat (<italic>Fukomys anselli</italic>). We found <italic>Fukomys</italic> mortality hazard to increase gradually with age, an observation with implications on the evolution of exceptional lifespan among mole-rats and the ecological factors that may have accompanied that evolution.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The species <italic>Heterocephalus glaber</italic>, commonly known as the naked mole-rat, is a eusocial mammal endemic to the arid and semi-arid regions of northeast Africa. In the wild, naked mole-rats live an almost completely subterranean lifestyle, in colonies of up to 295 animals (average size is 60 animals/colony; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brett, 1991</xref>) that cohabitate a network of tunnels that the mole-rats dig themselves with their large, ever-growing incisors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Buffenstein et al, 2021</xref>). Each colony is usually led by a single, socially-dominant queen (breeding female), living with a small number of breeding males and a large number of non-breeding progeny. New breeding females arise either through conflict following the death of a queen or isolation of part of the colony, e.g. through tunnel collapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brett, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Jarvis, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Buffenstein et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Naked mole-rats are notable for their extreme lifespans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Buffenstein 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lewis and Buffenstein 2016</xref>), living longer than any other documented rodent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Buffenstein and Jarvis, 2002</xref>), with the longest previously-reported lifespan of 37 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lee et al.,2020</xref>) and many animals living beyond 30 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lewis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Can et al., 2022</xref>). These values are notable in the context of this species’ small body size due to the strong correlation across species between that value and mammalian lifespan: maximum lifespan potential (MLSP) increases by 16% for each doubling of average species body mass (Hulbert et al., 2007). Notably, naked mole-rats live approximately five times longer than their size-corrected, allometric expectation using the equations of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">de Magalhães et al., 2007</xref>). For most mammalian species, lifespan is limited by an exponential increase in the per-day risk of death (i.e. mortality hazard) with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gavrilova &amp; Gavrilov, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Cohen, 2018</xref>) in accord with a statistical distribution first defined by Gompertz based on human mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Gompertz, 1825</xref>). The increase in mortality hazard with age is referred to as “demographic aging”. We have previously shown <italic>H.glaber</italic> to achieve its exceptional longevity through defiance of this trend, exhibiting ∼constant mortality hazard across the full spectrum of observed lifespans, with no hazard increase evident even many-fold beyond their expected MLSP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ruby et al, 2018</xref> &amp; 2019).</p>
<p>Naked mole-rats are members of the the African mole-rat superfamily, Bathyergidae, that includes more than 30 species of subterranean rodents and appeared to split from the other bathyergids ∼26 million years ago (MYA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Fang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Visser et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Patterson and Upham, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Faulkes and Bennett 2021</xref>). Bathyergid species span the spectrum of social behavior, from solitary (e.g., <italic>Georychus, Heliophobus</italic> and <italic>Bathyergus</italic>) to the only other known eusocial mammals, members of the genus <italic>Fukomys</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Jarvis and Bennett, 1993</xref>). Along with eusociality, <italic>H.glaber</italic> also share above-expected longevity with members of the <italic>Fukomys</italic> genus, namely <italic>Fukomys damarensis</italic> and <italic>Fukomys anselli,</italic> living ∼twice as long as their size-corrected, allometric expectations (see Methods for details). The co-occurrence of these unusual properties in divergent mole-rat clades motivates a question about the similarity of age-related hazard patterns.</p>
<p>For naked mole-rats, the lack of demographic aging is accompanied by seemingly-indefinite maintenance of many physiological characteristics that typically change with age. Naked mole-rats are resistant to age-related diseases such as cancer, neurodegeneration, and cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Edrey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hadi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Can et al., 2022</xref>) and show signs of tissue regeneration and remodeling preventing the deterioration of age-associated physiological function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Buffenstein et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Can et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">O’Connor et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Buffenstein and Craft, 2021</xref>). However, controversy regarding the perpetual neoteny of <italic>H.glaber</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Orr et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Grimes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Skulachev et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Buffenstein et al., 2020</xref> remains, supported by evidence for chronological aging of the epigenetic (DNA methylation) clock, albeit showing that breeders maintain a more youthful methyl clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kerepesi et al., 2022</xref>). This is further stoked by a commentary on our original demographic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ruby et al, 2018</xref>) by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dammann et al, 2019</xref>), asserting that loss of records from our early years of our vivarium rearing of <italic>H.glaber</italic> could have confounded our analysis of aging demographics. The concern of that critique has been addressed using left-censorship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Ruby et al, 2019</xref>). However, the critique also highlights the unique nature of our collection as a resource for powered demographic analysis of naked mole-rats, extending out to advanced ages. The lack of other collections of a similar scale, worldwide, presents a practical challenge to the reproducibility of our results. To that end, we were motivated to re-evaluate our original conclusions, using demographic data for <italic>H.glaber</italic> collected over a five-year period since the data freeze from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ruby et al, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we re-visited the demographic analysis of our naked mole-rat collection, with husbandry data now extended by five years across an expanded set of animals. We found our original conclusions of naked mole-rat mortality hazard being age-independent to be reproduced, using either the total sum of all historical data or only those data collected after our previous study - the latter qualifying as a replication study. We further conducted an analysis of naked mole-rat mortality hazard versus colony size which suggested that social competition was greater for non-breeders in smaller colonies. Finally, we provide demographic data for Damaraland mole-rats: combining those data with other publicly available data for <italic>Fukomys</italic> species, we analyzed age-specific mortality hazard and showed it to increase, in contrast to the naked mole-rats.</p>

<title>The expanded data set revealed that the hazard of naked mole-rat mortality did not increase as a function of age</title>
<p>Our expanded data set drew from 7,536 historically catalogued naked mole-rats from our own collection; of these, 6,957 had sufficiently high (single-day) resolution records for date-of-birth and date-of-death/censorship to be included (see Methods for details). Our analyses of survival and mortality hazard began at T<sub>sex</sub> for naked mole-rats: 6 months (183 days; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Edrey et al., 2011</xref>); 6893 animals had aged up to T<sub>sex</sub> and therefore were included in our downstream analyses. Of those, 755 had recorded deaths and 6138 were right-censored (see Methods for censorship criteria). Kaplan-Meier survival, along with death and censorship distributions, are plotted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>. The last recorded death was at 11,281 days-of-life (30.9 years), at which point 10 animals remained alive; the last of those was censored at 12,873 days-of-life (35.2 years). At that event, Kaplan-Meier survival remained at 55.5%.</p>

As in the prior analysis, mortality hazard estimates remained consistently low across the ∼35 years of age encompassed by the observations, never exceeding a per-day probability of 1/10,000.</p>

<title>Analysis of only data collected after our prior survey independently confirmed constant-hazard demography</title>
<p>The large size of our naked mole-rat collection across the five years of additional observation time since our previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ruby et al, 2018</xref>) provided substantial additional power in the form of number of animals observed at most ages (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). For many age groups, the amount of lifespan observation time since our previous snapshot matched or exceeded that prior to it. This allowed us to use left-censorship at a date after our original dates of record aggregation to perform an independent analysis of naked mole-rat lifespan demographics and critically re-evaluate our original conclusions.</p>

<p>For our previous report, lifespan records were aggregated in three batches: on April 14, 2016; April 20, 2016; and May 17, 2016 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ruby et al, 2018</xref>). Animal counts as a function of age, Kaplan-Meier survival, and age bin-specific hazard are shown for that data set in magenta in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, B, and</xref> C, respectively. The possibility that incomplete record survival during the earliest years of our keeping naked mole-rats in captivity could have skewed mortality hazard trends was raised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dammann et al (2019)</xref>, and we previously addressed that concern by excluding data from those early years of naked mole-rat captivity, via left-censorship on January 1, 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Ruby et al, 2019</xref>). No additional data were provided at that time. The scale, Kaplan-Meier survival, and age-specific hazard from that left-censored version of our original data set are shown in orange in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, B, and</xref> C, respectively.</p>
<p>The scale, Kaplan-Meier survival, and age-specific hazard from our current, full data set – also depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> – are shown in green in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A, 2B</xref>, and 2C, respectively. These data were aggregated on March 15, 2021 and encapsulated all historical data. In order to perform an analysis of naked mole-rat lifespan demographics that would be independent of our original analysis, we left-censored these data on May 17, 2016. The scale, Kaplan-Meier survival, and age-specific hazard from this left-censored data set are shown in blue in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, B, and</xref> C, respectively. For each age bin, the new, left-censored hazards were either lower or statistically indistinguishable from the original data set, either full or left-censored (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). We therefore maintain our original conclusion: that naked mole-rat mortality hazard does not increase with age, with that assertion being statistically robust to the beginning of our final estimate bin (6,529 days, or ∼18 years).</p>

<title>Non-increasing mortality hazard was exhibited by breeders and non-breeders of both sexes</title>
<p>The analyses described above were performed on our full population of animals. Sub-populations defined by sex and breeding-status were analyzed individually for Kaplan-Meier survival (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). As previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ruby et al, 2018</xref>), there was a notable survival difference between breeding versus non-breeding status, with breeders enjoying longer survival than non-breeders. As with the aggregate population, mortality hazard remained consistent with age, for both non-breeders (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>) and breeders (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), with the mortality hazard of breeders only ∼20% that of non-breeders. As previously observed, male non-breeders exhibited enhanced survival (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) and reduced mortality hazard (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>) at ages beyond 2000 days. This concurred with the expectations of our model that multiple males can enjoy breeder status in a colony despite not being labeled as such (only the founding breeders are so labeled; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ruby et al, 2018</xref>).</p>

<title>Non-breeder mortality hazard was influenced by colony size</title>
<p>Some of the mortality hazard difference between breeders and non-breeders may derive from social struggle between these hierarchies within the colony. To explore the potential effects of intra-colony social dynamics on mortality hazard, we performed analyses of the relationships between body weight or colony size on the mortality of non-breeders.</p>
<p>For body weights, we analyzed a data set that had been aggregated to accompany our originally published demographic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ruby et al, 2018</xref>; Supplementary Table 2). These data included 19,118 individual body weight estimates from 1,940 animals, captured longitudinally for animals of a variety of ages, with data becoming sparse after ∼3500 days of age (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). These data are provided in Supplemental Data File 2. A great deal of variation existed across both the breeder and non-breeder populations, in both males and females, though the age-specific averages were similar and stable after ∼500 days of age (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>

<p>For the analysis of mortality hazard versus body weight, only non-breeding animals were included. The last available body weight measurement was used, requiring that measurement was taken after 500 days of age, to avoid confounding with the social status of animals that were not yet fully grown. There were 6,785 qualifying measurements, derived from 942 animals. For each animal, mortality hazard was analyzed across one year following that final measurement. Non-breeding animals of each sex were grouped into quartiles based on body weight, and the aggregate mortality hazard of each quartile is plotted, along with the aggregate body weight values, in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>. There was a general trend of lighter/smaller animals having greater mortality hazard, especially in males, though the data set was insufficiently powered to statistically support this conclusion.</p>
<p>For colony sizes, we used our records’ annotations of “colony ID” to determine the number of non-breeding animals of each sex in each colony, at each analytical time point (see Methods). As for body weight, animals were separated into quartiles based on the number of non-breeders of the same sex in the colony, and each quartile for each sex was cumulatively evaluated for mortality hazard across one year following the analytical time point. This method allowed independent analysis of non-overlapping time periods: we performed five such analyses using our new data set and four using our prior data set, from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ruby et al, 2018</xref> (examples in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>; all results shown in Supplemental Figure S2). Analyses of individual time blocks were statistically inconclusive, but there was a general trend of greater mortality hazard for non-breeders in smaller colonies. Meta-analysis of the results from across all nine time-block analyses supported this trend to a statistically significant degree, for both males (p-value: 9.9 * 10<sup>-4</sup>) and, to a lesser degree, females (p-value: 1.8 * 10<sup>-2</sup>).</p>

<title>The mortality hazard of mole-rats of the Fukomys genus increased substantially with age</title>
<p>We have previously placed the mortality demographics of naked mole-rats into the context of demographic data from other mammals, which highlights the unique absence of an exponential increase in hazard with age in naked mole-rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ruby et al, 2018</xref>). To provide a more phylogenetically-proximal comparator, we performed a demographic analysis of mole-rats from the <italic>Fukomys</italic> genus. For those species, survival analyses all began at an estimated T<sub>sex</sub> of 270 days of age, based upon our unpublished data and personal communication from Nigel C. Bennett (MRI, University of Pretoria) and Christopher G. Faulkes (Queen Mary University of London).</p>
<p>In their response to our previous publication, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dammann et al (2019)</xref> provide lifespan data for 339 <italic>Fukomys anselli</italic> individuals, of which 332 aged past T<sub>sex</sub> and therefore were included in our downstream analyses (Supplemental Figure S2A: yellow). In their analyses of lifespan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dammann et al (2019)</xref> censor accidental deaths and deaths from fighting: in that case, 170 animals’ lifespans are censored and 162 died. Here and previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ruby et al 2018</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">2019</xref>), we treat such instances as non-censored deaths: in that case, 145 animals’ lifespans are censored and 187 had died. Comparing Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, the death versus censorship of these 25 individuals had a small effect (Supplemental Figure S2B: yellow versus orange), only reducing the median lifespan from 3,141 to 2,830 days; nor were any statistical differences observed for age-specific mortality hazard estimates effect (Supplemental Figure S2C: yellow versus orange). For downstream analyses, we considered those 25 individuals to be dead rather than censored.</p>
<p>We provide additional demographic data for another mole-rat species within the <italic>Fukomys</italic> genus (<italic>Fukomys damarensis</italic>). These data were compiled on March 15, 2021 and included lifespans for 702 animals, of which 634 aged past T<sub>sex</sub> and therefore were included in downstream analyses (Supplemental Figure S2A: cyan). These included 502 animals’ lifespans that were censored and 132 deaths. Versus the <italic>F.anselli</italic> data set, these data for <italic>F.damarensis</italic> were richer for young and sparser for old ages (Supplemental Figure S2A). Nonetheless, these two species exhibited similar demographic properties, both in terms of Kaplan-Meier (Supplemental Figure S2B) and age-specific mortality hazard (Supplemental Figure S2C). For additional downstream analyses, we combined the data from <italic>F.anselli</italic> and <italic>F.damarensis</italic> into a single data set, representing the <italic>Fukomys</italic> genus (Supplemental Figure S2A: green). The combined <italic>Fukomys</italic> data set included lifespan data from 1041 animals, 966 of which survived past T<sub>sex</sub> (270 days) so were included in downstream analyses; these included 319 deaths and 647 censorships.</p>
<p>Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a <italic>Fukomys</italic> median lifespan of 3,622 days (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Unlike the survival curve for <italic>H.glaber</italic>, the <italic>Fukomys</italic> survival curve approached zero before being depleted of animals, allowing for calculation of a maximal lifespan, as previously defined (95th percentile; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ruby et al, 2018</xref>) of 7,369 days (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), or 20.2 years. Age-specific mortality hazard was calculated for <italic>Fukomys</italic>, and again unlike <italic>H.glaber</italic>, substantial increase was observed with age (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Though less statistically robust, this trend was consistent with estimates taken from either the <italic>F.damarensis</italic> data alone, or from the <italic>F.anselli</italic> data alone, with or without accidental/fighting death censored (Supplemental Figure S2C).</p>

<p>Here, we added <italic>Fukomys</italic> mole-rat mortality hazard, age normalized to a T<sub>sex</sub> of 270 days, to our comparative mammalian hazard plot (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). <italic>Fukomys</italic> diverged from <italic>H.glaber</italic> 26 MYA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Fang et al, 2014</xref>) and displayed an intermediate rate of hazard increase between the non-increasing hazard of <italic>H.glaber</italic> and the exponentially-increasing hazard of other mammals. <italic>Fukomys</italic> mortality hazard appeared to increase linearly, rather than with a Gompertzian exponential. The sparsity of late-life data for that genus made conclusions tentative.

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>The elusion of demographic aging by <italic>H.glaber</italic> was replicated in an additional 5 years of new data</title>
<p>In this study, we re-visited our analyses and conclusions from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ruby et al, 2018</xref>), bringing five years’ worth of additional data collection to bear. That period represented a period of unprecedented scale and stability for our collection: while animals continued to be killed for research (KFR) purposes, there were fewer constraints on husbandry resources to require culling of the population. Animals remained at the same institutional vivarium across that period (Calico Life Sciences, LLC), thus avoiding the potentially confounding husbandry challenges of institutional and geographic relocation. Especially given the mature status of the collection across this period (i.e., many animals of advanced age already present), these conditions facilitated an approximate doubling of the available observation numbers for demographic analysis across most age categories (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>
<p>These additional data provided two opportunities: first, to repeat our original analyses on the full, updated historical data, which added resolution and statistical confidence to our original claims (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Second: the scale of data collected since our last study facilitated an independent analysis of <italic>H.glaber</italic> lifespan demography, performed entirely on data collected after the completion of data collection for our prior study (navy in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Importantly, that independent analysis validated our original claims about naked mole-rat demography.</p>

<title>Elevated hazard for non-breeders in small colonies</title>
<p>We previously reported that breeders of both sexes of naked mole-rats have substantially lower mortality hazards than non-breeders at all ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ruby et al, 2018</xref>), and that result was reproduced here (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). This result was not limited to <italic>H.glaber</italic>: our analysis of <italic>F.damarensis</italic> survival also revealed an advantage for breeders over non-breeders. This trait is shared with many cooperative breeding mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Sharp and Clutton-Brock, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dammann et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Cram et al., 2018</xref>). These observations conflict with the disposable soma theory of aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kirkwood, 1977</xref>) but do not negate it: there are also multiple biological and sociological explanations for the survival advantage of socially-dominant individuals (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Clarke and Faulkes, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Medger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Sahm et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Coen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Berger et al., 2018</xref>) that may confound one another and variably contribute to the fates of breeders versus non-breeders.</p>
<p>In order to gain deeper insight into the health consequences of naked mole-rat social hierarchy amongst non-breeders, we analyzed historical records of body weight and colony membership in terms of their impacts on mortality hazard (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Dominance in naked mole-rat colonies is largely determined by aggressive pushing, tail-tugging, and shoving behaviors, so smaller animals are generally lower in the social hierarchy than larger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Clarke and Faulkes 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Toor et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Holmes and Goldman, 2021</xref>). It was therefore unsurprising to observe that smaller adult animals had higher mortality hazard than bigger animals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), though that trend did not attain statistical significance in our analysis.</p>
<p>More surprising was the observation that non-breeders who were members of large colonies had lower mortality hazard than non-breeders who were members of small colonies, an observation that was statistically significant for both sexes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). One might have expected fewer colony members to result in less aggressive competition for, and therefore better access to, limited resources, e.g., food and heating pads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Clarke and Faulkes, 2001</xref>). However, such concerns may have been less relevant to our captive colonies than in the wild: animal husbandry rules necessitate the scaling up of all resources in parallel with colony growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Smith &amp; Buffenstein, 2021</xref>). Further, even in the wild, intra-group competition is often trumped by cooperative advantages to produce overall survival advantages for members of larger social groups across a variety of species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jarvis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Silk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Broom et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Clutton-Brock, 2021</xref>). Larger colonies can also provide greater stability, with a well-established successfully breeding female and a cohort of older siblings having already resolved their dominance status and keeping the younger animals in check (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Smith &amp; Buffenstein, 2021</xref>).</p>

<title>The mortality hazard of <italic>Fukomys</italic> mole-rats increased gradually with age</title>
<p>We sought to provide new evolutionary context for the exceptional longevity of naked mole-rats through demographic analysis of mole-rats from the <italic>Fukomys</italic> genus. Though substantially diverged from <italic>H.glaber</italic> 26 MYA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Fang et al., 2014</xref>), <italic>Fukomys</italic> mole-rats offered a phylogenitically closer comparator versus other mammals for which data are available (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Further, <italic>Fukomys</italic> mole-rats share the property of eusociality with naked mole-rats, which is thought to be connected to exceptional lifespan by evolutionary pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Fang et al., 2014</xref>). Demographic data were published for Ansell’s mole-rat, <italic>F.anselli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dammann et al., 2019</xref>); we supplemented those data with lifespan data from the closely-related Damaraland mole-rat, <italic>F.damarensis</italic>. Those two species are estimated to have diverged ∼1-1.5 MYA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Van Daele et al, 2007</xref>), and they shared a similar ecological niche in the wild and statistically consistent life history patterns in captivity (Supp Figure S2). We combined the data from these species for a <italic>Fukomys</italic> genus-wide demography analysis and observed hazard to increase with age (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>
<p>While the increase of mortality hazard with age among <italic>Fukomys</italic> mole-rats contrasted with the age-independent hazard of <italic>H.glaber</italic>, it was gradual versus the Gompertzian (i.e. exponential) increase typically exhibited by mammals (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Various evolutionary theories highlight multiple aspects of mole-rat biology and lifestyle that could either drive or derive from the evolution of such extended longevity. Subterranean rodents, regardless of clade or whether they are solitary or social, live longer than expected for their size, with environmental protection from extrinsic mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Buffenstein 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Healy et al., 2014</xref>). Similar protection from extrinsic mortality is also provided by herd protection/social lifestyle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Buffenstein 2005</xref>;Healy et al., 2015). Low extrinsic hazards give evolutionary tinkering with aging rates the opportunity to manifest selective advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jacob, 1977</xref>), a premise backed up by several cross-species studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gaillard &amp; Lemaître 2017</xref>). In the context of eusociality, kin selection and the maintenance of stable social hierarchies can provide further selective advantages to the extension of lifespan for breeders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Clarke and Faulkes, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Medger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Sahm et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Coen et al 2021</xref>). The converse may also be true, with enhanced longevity facilitating a eusocial lifestyle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Ross et al., 2015</xref>): increased longevity may facilitate the cohabiting of parents and multiple litters of offspring to form a eusocial colony, enhancing mutual beneficial opportunities for cooperative living and overall fitness of the social group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Carey, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lucas and Keller, 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Regardless of which evolutionary theory best applies to the natural history of <italic>H.glaber</italic> and <italic>Fukomys</italic> mole-rats, their shared (though unequal) defiance of Gompertzian aging demonstrates that exponentially-increasing hazard with advancing age is not a fixed property of mammalian biology. While it seems to be the default, evolutionary mechanisms have managed to dampen or eliminate it when provided with the right selective incentives. It is not clear the extent to which both <italic>H.glaber</italic> and <italic>Fukomys</italic> benefit from longevity genes that arose in their common ancestor, versus evolved independent longevity-promoting mechanisms in the 26 million years since their divergence. However, their unequal successes suggest that multiple mechanisms are needed to counteract Gompertzian aging, and that not all mechanisms are at play in both lineages. The perspective that some age-slowing mechanisms are likely to be conserved between <italic>H.glaber</italic> and <italic>Fukomys</italic>, and that others are likely to be specific to <italic>H.glaber</italic>, should help the comparative biology community make maximal use of these two valuable natural resources for the science of aging.</p>

A similar husbandry protocol was used for the Damaraland mole-rats. The original progenitors of our Damaraland mole-rat colony were trapped near the town of Hotazel, South Africa (27°58′S, 17°41′E), and near the town of Dordabis in Namibia (22°58′S, 17°41′E). Like the naked mole-rat, all animals were microchipped at 90 days with a unique RFID number. Similarly, Damaraland mole-rats were group-housed in interconnected transparent multi-cage systems, joined together by plexiglass clear tubing in a climatically controlled room maintained at 26-28°C, 21% oxygen and with RH ranging between 20-50% and with a 12L:12D light cycle. Animals were fed daily a variety of fresh fruit and vegetables, including apples, yams, carrots, pumpkin, and other seasonal vegetables, replacing the natural geophytes upon which they feed. No water was provided as the animals meet all their water requirements through their diet or metabolic water production.</p>

<title><italic>H.glaber</italic> demographic data</title>
<p>Demographic analysis of <italic>H.glaber</italic> was performed on a newly-compiled aggregation of lifespan data, from across the collection of naked mole-rats described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ruby et al, 2018</xref>), which had been maintained and expanded under the same husbandry conditions described there. For this study, a snapshot of records was compiled on March 15, 2021, at which point they contained information for 7,536 animals from across the full history of the collection. Of those, complete birth and death/right-censorship information (single-day resolution), were available for 6,949 animals. For those animals, and versus our prior snapshot of records from this collection – provided as “Supplementary file 1” in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ruby et al, 2018</xref>) – 3,329 could be matched to the prior records. Of those, 2,806 had perfect matches to RFID tags, birth dates, sex, breeder status, colony name, and logically consistent death/censorship data (for animals alive at the prior snapshot, new death/censorship dates from after those dates; otherwise, perfect matches). For an additional 94 animals, all data listed above were identical except for either colony name or breeding status: both of these parameters are expected to change for animals moved out of a colony to establish a new colony as a founding breeder. Combined, 3,222 animals matched for all vital data (RFID, birth date, sex, and consistent death/censorship). For an additional 94 animals, one of the four vital data had been updated: 11 for RFID (consistent with occasional replacement of RFID chips, or placement of RFID chips in previously un-chipped animals); 32 for sex (consistent with inaccurate initial sex determination for young animals); 40 for date of birth (consistent with review of birth data at the time of RFID implantation); and 11 with updated and inconsistent death/censorship dates. For all 94 of those animals, the updated values were used for analysis. For an additional five animals, two pieces of vital data differed: one had inconsistent death/censorship and sex; one had inconsistent death/censorship and date of birth; and three had different dates of birth and sexes. For those animals as well, the updated values were used for analysis. For an additional eight animals, exact dates of death/censorship were missing from current records but found in the prior snapshots, with all other vital data matching. For those animals, the death/censorship values and dates from the (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ruby et al, 2018</xref>) snapshot were used. An additional 26 animals had RFID matches to animals that had missing or low-resolution birth and/or death/censorship data in the (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ruby et al, 2018</xref>) snapshot; those animals were assigned their original table ID’s and current data values. In total, 3,355 animals were paired to individuals cataloged in “Supplementary file 1” of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ruby et al, 2018</xref>): all of those are presented in Supplemental Data File 1 using their original ID’s (e.g. “Hg-02241”).</p>

Those animals were all assigned ID numbers ≥5000 (e.g. “Hg-05072”). The vast majority of those animals were born after (3,244) or during (33) the prior data consolidation period (April 14 – May 17, 2016). Of the remaining 325 animals, the large majority (285) were born within a year prior to April 14, 2016, reflecting a normal lag for husbandry records to be entered into our database.</p>
<p>In summary: 6,949 naked mole-rats were cataloged with day-resolution birth and death/censorship data, 3,355 of which could be matched to animals from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ruby et al, 2018</xref>).

For still-surviving animals, right censorship was applied at the date of record aggregation: March 15, 2021.</p>

<title>Analysis of lifespan and age-specific mortality hazard</title>
<p>Except as otherwise specified in the text, right censorship status was applied to animal lifespans in three cases: if the animal was (1) transferred to another collection, with the date of transfer considered as the censorship event; (2) euthanized for research purposes when still healthy, with the date of sacrifice as the censorship event; or (3) still alive when the process of compiling records was completed, with the date of completion as the censorship event. Left censorship was applied to entire data sets as specified in the text, generally at specific historical dates in order to exclude data collected prior to that date.</p>
<p>Kaplan-Meier survival was calculated using their method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kaplan and Meier, 1958</xref>). Mortality hazards were calculated for each specified age bin/group of animals as the number of observed death events (i.e., number of days on which a naked mole-rat was observed to have died) divided by the total number of days that naked mole-rats were under observation, limited to that age bin/population. Confidence intervals were calculated using the Wilson score interval with continuity correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Newcombe, 1998</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>H.glaber</italic> body weight analysis</title>
<p>Historical records of body weights, collected in the course of animal health checks, were aggregated concurrently with the lifespan data from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ruby et al, 2018</xref>). These records were less complete than the demographic data, but nonetheless included 19,118 measurements taken from 1,940 animals with complete lifespan data. For most analyses, only weights taken after 500 years of age were used: there were 6,785 such measurements, taken from 942 animals. The demographic data used for these analyses was as compiled for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ruby et al, 2018</xref>), and it is provided along with colony membership and body weight data in Supplemental Data File 2. Animals from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ruby et al, 2018</xref>) with full demographic data but no body weight data are also included in that file. Animal ID’s in that file are matched to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ruby et al, 2018</xref>) and Supplemental Data File 1.</p>
<p>For mortality versus body weight, analysis was performed for survival across a single year. For each animal with body weight(s) measured after 500 days of age, survival data were analyzed starting from the date of the last recorded body weight (i.e. left-censored on that date). If the animal survived uncensored for over a year, then right-censorship was applied one year after the weight measurement. Animals with qualifying body weight values were sorted into quartiles based on those final measurements, and mortality hazard was estimated across all of the animals in each quartile. Confidence intervals were calculated using the Wilson score interval with continuity correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Newcombe, 1998</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>H.glaber</italic> colony size analysis</title>
<p>For mortality versus colony size, analyses were performed of survival across a single year. The results for each year are shown in Supplemental Figure S1: for years 2012-2015, demographic records from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ruby et al, 2018</xref>; also provided in Supplemental Data File 2) were used, and April 14 was used as the cut-off date; for years 2016-2020, the updated demographic records from this manuscript were used (Supplemental Data File 1), and March 15 was used as the cut-off date. Cut-off dates were selected to match the data compilation date for each data set, ensuring a full year’s worth of data availability for each year’s analysis. The shift to an older record compilation for earlier-year analyses was to minimize the effect of movement out of colonies as a confounder: colony affiliations for each compiled data set reflected colony membership at the time of compilation and did not include prior membership history. Importantly, this caveat should have had minimal impact: due to violence against intruders, animals are never introduced into existing colonies, only removed from colonies in order to establish new colonies as breeders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Smith and Buffenstein, 2021</xref>), and breeders were excluded from these analyses.</p>
<p>For analysis of colony sizes, only animals at least 500 days old by each cut-off date were considered. This decision was justified by animals younger than that age being not fully grown and therefore potentially presenting less competitive rivalry; and by the inconsistent integration of animals much younger than one year (pre-chipped) old into our demography database. But it may have added variance in the form of colony-size error in the cases of colonies with highly skewed age distributions. Analyses were also conducted in a sex-specific manner, i.e., considering only the counts of same-sex, non-breeding animals for colony size. This decision was justified under the assumption that competition and hierarchy may be different between the two sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Reeve &amp; Sherman, 1991</xref>), but may have added variance in cases where the sex ratio was skewed in a colony, to the extent that social hierarchy among non-breeders is sex-independent.</p>
<p>For each cut-off date, for each sex, all qualifying animals were used to generate a census (animal count) for each represented colony name. Individual animals were sorted into quartiles based on the sizes of the colonies of which they were members; tied animals were assigned to adjacent quartiles arbitrarily. For members of each quartile, the mean and standard deviation of colony sizes for each animal were calculated, and the mortality hazard for those animals was calculated across one year, beginning at the cut-off date (i.e. left-censored on the cut-off date, and right censored one year after the cut-off date for animals that were not deceased or otherwise censored during the year). Confidence intervals were calculated using the Wilson score interval with continuity correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Newcombe, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>For regression of mean colony size versus mortality hazard, for each sex: for all quartiles across all years shown in Supplemental Figure S1, mean colony sizes were treated as x-axis values and mortality hazard estimates as y-axis values, and linear regression was performed using the “scipy.stats.linregress” function from Scipy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Virtanen et al., 2020</xref>), which in addition to slope and intercept returns Pearson R and regression p-value.</p>

<p>This <bold>useful</bold> study aims to characterize patterns of demographic aging in naked mole rats by quantifying mortality rates in a captive colony, up to approximately the median age of death. The study system is a fascinating case of unusual longevity and physiology in mammals, but because of limited sampling at older ages and missing analyses, the evidence for the main conclusion – that naked mole rats do not experience actuarial senescence – is <bold>incomplete</bold> for younger animals and <bold>inadequate</bold> for older animals. The work nevertheless provides data of interest to biodemographers and biomedical researchers interested in naked mole rats as a model for aging.</p>

<p>Ruby et al. have investigated patterns of age-specific mortality in the exceptionally long-lived naked mole-rat (NMR), under captive conditions. The authors first visited this topic five years previously with an unprecedently large data set and concluded that naked mole-rats are 'non-aging': because analyses of their survival did not detect an increasing mortality hazard with age. This result has obvious applied interest in humans because of its implications for maintaining health into later life. One criticism directed at this previous work was that a limited number 'old-aged' individuals in their data set (individuals in what might be expected to be the latter half of the life course) reduced the power with which to detect an age-related increase in mortality - or to convincingly demonstrate its absence. The current study revisits this topic with a larger sample across the life course. The authors also provide additional analyses that explore various predictors of mortality, including breeding status, body weight and colony size, and now also make direct comparisons to mortality patterns in other species of African mole-rat from the Fukomys clade (which share many convergent social and life history features). I found the analyses of Fukomys mortality particularly illuminating. However, while these additional analyses provide some useful context and can generate interesting discussion points about ageing patterns in an extremely unusual species, the principal issue at hand whether the absence of Gompertzian mortality in NMR is a robust pattern.</p>
<p>In this respect, a major limitation of the current study is that only 11% of the animals (n = 755) had died at the point of its conclusion- the remaining 89% being right-censored (n = 6138). This means that, as in the previous analysis, there are still relatively small numbers of individuals that have died in the older age classes (see Fig 1 for the high level of right-censoring between 15-20 years and the low numbers of deaths after this point, also Supp 1 for the raw data): the part of the life course where one would predict mortality rates to increase from an evolutionary perspective. Thus, while the authors claim very generally that the &quot;demographic data has doubled&quot;, this in no way reflects whether the new data is informative to the question at hand, which relies on an ability to estimate death rates in older individuals accurately. If one looks more closely at the numbers which do matter, then one can see that the number of deaths in the data set has shifted from 447 in the former treatment (Ruby et al. 2018) to 755 currently, but that the number of later-stage deaths remains somewhat modest (and that this is probably reflected in the large confidence intervals for the mortality hazards at this time). I therefore remain unconvinced that the current study can rule out an exponential increase in hazard in older individuals.</p>
<p>The authors have also not provided any statistical evidence that the mortality hazard changes with age (or not), instead relying on visual comparisons of aggregated data. This is a fundamental problem and demands a more thorough treatment that compares survival models with different shape profiles. If anything, it seems that the hazard rate is declining with age - see Figures 1B &amp; 2C, and while this may strengthen the authors argument if supported statistically, I would still wonder whether the higher mortality in early life - say 6 months to 3 years of age - is a consequence of the costs of early life development and that this is not a useful baseline against which to compare 'adult' mortality. It would also not overcome the data limitations identified above.</p>
<p>An additional concern is that the paper is selective in its presentation of previous work, with the authors focussing on results which support their main interpretations and glossing over those that don't. For example, the study refers to the fact that NMRs are resistant to various age-related diseases and do not show many age-related declines in physiology. Yet, while this argument of negligible senescence might hold generally, the literature contains various reports of later life declines in NMR physiology (Andziak et al. 2006; Edrey et al., 2011). Referring to work from your own group, Braude et al. (2021) write &quot;several typical mammalian age-related lesions of muscles, bone, heart, liver, and eye, including sarcopenia, osteoarthritis, a decline in articular cartilage thickness of the condyles, lipofuscin accumulation in several organs, eye cataracts, and kidney fibrosis have been described in naked mole-rats older than 26 years (Edrey et al., 2011)&quot;. A more balanced treatment of physiology in extremely old individuals would prove constructive.</p>
<p>Another way in which the study fails to fully represent the literature is with respect to the divergence in ageing rates between breeders and non-breeders. This pattern has proved seductive for various mole-rat researchers because of its similarities to social insects and the suggestion that it is reproduction itself which delays ageing. While this is a clear possibility with some empirical support, it is important to also consider the question from the other way: which is to ask why non-breeders die at higher rates than breeders. For other cooperative breeders such as meerkats, the answer is clear: dominant, breeding individuals evict subordinates and once evicted from the group, the chances that these individuals will survive plummets (e.g. Cram et al. 2028). Is it possible that a similar form of dominance control might contribute the shorter life span of non-breeders in captivity? You reference Toor et al. (2020) elsewhere and this is relevant here again.</p>
<p>
Captivity also prevents non-breeders from dispersing when they would otherwise ordinarily do so (Braude 2000): is it possible that this also affects their mortality in captivity? Perhaps not being able to disperse induces chronic stress (see for example the discussion in Novikov et al. 2015). The idea that breeders show a lower intrinsic rate of aging is attractive, but many factors could contribute to this and alternatives should be considered unless they can be strongly refuted.</p>
<p>Lastly, it would be very beneficial to have more information on how individuals become breeders in the captive population/s. For the purposes of the analyses, individuals have been categorised as a breeder or a non-breeder based on whether they bred or not at some point in their life (i.e., they are a &quot;breeder&quot; for their whole life for the purposes of the Kaplan Meier curves and the estimation of mortality hazards). I think it is therefore important to rule out the possibility that only high-quality individuals become breeders and that this is what drives the contrast in breeder and non-breeder mortality. In short, is it the case that most breeders are created through the random pairing of a male and a female? Or do new breeders inherit the position once the old queen dies? The latter could lead to breeders being of generally higher quality, which might affect their mortality hazard independently of status.</p>
<p>Overall, I think that the authors can confidently conclude that any onset of actuarial senescence is heavily delayed in naked mole-rats, but the main conclusion that naked mole-rats &quot;defy Gompertzian mortality&quot; is based on inadequate evidence. It seems very possible that the inability to detect an increasing mortality hazard in such a long-lived species arises from data limitations. The central finding of the study should therefore be viewed very critically.</p>

<p>Ruby et al. investigated whether demographic aging was absent in the naked-mole rat (Heterocephalus glaber); an exceptionally long-lived small mammal that appears to challenge Gompertzian patterns of increased mortality hazard with age. In particular, this study replicates a previous one in which the authors show that the mortality hazard does not increase with age as it is expected for mammals, especially small ones. The main motivation of this replication is to address the current controversy surrounding the &quot;perpetual neoteny&quot; reported by the authors. The study also extends to the exploration of the role of social factors on the observed patterns in mortality hazard across age and to a meta-analysis comparing mortality hazards across species of mole-rats which highlights the unique pattern of demographic aging (or the absence of) in naked mole-rats. This study is of broad interest to readers in the field of demography, aging, and life history evolution. The key claims of the manuscript state that naked-mole rats avoid an increase in mortality hazard as they age. Although this work raises new evolutionary questions concerning the unexpected gradual (or fully absent) increase versus Gompertzian increase in hazard among mammals, I also identified weaknesses that I discuss below.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Sample sizes - The sample sizes across analyses are vast and the data curation described demonstrates careful thought during the data analysis processes.</p>
<p>Social factors - The analysis testing associations between body mass (as proxy for dominance) and colony size (as proxy for social competition) are novel and provide insights into potential evolutionary drivers for the observed lack of increase in mortality hazard.</p>
<p>Across species comparison - The analysis using Fukomys mole-rats offered a novel phylogenetic comparison of the mortality hazard across age and raises new evolutionary questions concerning the unexpected gradual versus Gompertzian increase in hazard. This study encourages new ones exploring alternative life histories among mammals.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Censored data - A significant number of individuals remained alive (~50%) at the end of the study, and thus I wonder how much can the authors say about increased hazard if the individuals have not reach old ages. Maybe the individuals do live long and show increased hazard are very old ages.</p>
<p>Independence between studies - The study provides the replication of a prior study using the same captive population, but I understand that many observations are not independent across studies given repeated measurements. Although this provides reliability, I wonder how independent the conclusions are. This represents a weakness to me because we still do not know whether this is a unique evolutionary trait of this particular captive population. If this is the case, I agree this makes the population a great model for aging studies but do the authors findings have further implications across populations or species? I wonder if populations raised under different conditions would present similar patterns of mortality hazard across age.</p>
<p>Analysis - Another weakness concerns the analysis used. Authors make the claims that social hierarchy may affect mortality hazards and decide to explore associations between body mass and hazard. I wonder if a Cox regression model is more appropriate for the available continuous data, relative to a Kaplan-Meir method. A Cox regression will allow the authors to control for several continuous variables simultaneously, without the limitation of categorical assumptions. A Cox model could also be extended to time-varying covariates allowing for the hazard to change over time (if that is the case). If the authors understand that their approach is equivalent, I suggest a discussion on it. This also applies to the analysis on colony size.</p>
<p>In summary, I see value in this study. There is vast evidence for the penalty of becoming old among mammals. Thus, studies like this one reporting novel patterns are of high impact. I agree that such findings must be replicated and validated. I also see a lot of potential for the use of the available data for more extensive meta-analyses comparing life histories across social mammals or across species with similar use of habitat (underground). Such analyses may allow the authors to move beyond descriptions and discuss why such life history traits may have evolved. Yet, I am not sure how much novelty this study brings, relative to prior studies. It seems the authors may need more than 5 years to allow their individuals to reach older ages.</p>

<p>As a follow up from a manuscript previously published (Ruby et al. 2018), the authors use basic survival analysis methods to estimate hazard rates on an extended dataset of naked mole rats. They conclude that naked mole rats do not show the common exponential increase in mortality that has been typified in most mammals.</p>
<p>In fact, this species has attracted great interest due to their extreme longevity, and the physiological mechanisms that have been associated with slower aging. As the authors show, this species shows unprecedented longevity, particularly considering their body size and phylogenetic location.</p>
<p>However, the data available and the methods used cannot support the conclusion of an absence of increase in mortality for adults. As the authors show, the survivorship curves, calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimators, do not reach below values of 0.5. In short, nothing can be said about hazard rates after the age of median life expectancy. What the authors show is that, up to a certain age (when at least 50% of the individuals are still alive), the hazard rate is relatively constant. Beyond that age, the authors cannot draw any conclusions.</p>
<p>In addition, here is a summary of the methodological limitations I could find based on their limited description: 1) their survivorships do not go below 0.5 and thus cannot make any statements about actuarial senescence; 2) ignoring this last, to test whether the hazards follow a Gompertz mortality it would be more appropriate to use maximum likelihood and test alternative models (e.g., exponential, Siler), and not visually as they show in fig 1; 3) they seem to be confusing left-censoring with left-truncation; 4) given the left-truncation, they should be using product limit estimators and not Kaplan-Meier estimators (which they might, but it's not possible to know based on the limited description of the methods); 5) their treatment of the effects of colony size, breeding status, and body weight should be at least by means of a proportional hazards, not a simple visual inspection on arbitrary age intervals.</p>
<p>In light of these limitations, I would rank the significance of the study as not more than useful, and the strength of evidence inadequate. Still, and as I've stated above, this species is of great interest for ageing research, and the extensive work that the authors have done maintaining this captive colony is to be commended.</p>

<p>We thank Dr. Carlos Isales and Dr. Jenny Tung as well as the peer Reviewers for their critiques and comments concerning this manuscript and respond here to their key concerns. Some of the Reviewers’ questions raised fascinating points about naked mole-rat biology and social habits, which we are also curious about, but which are too far afield from the central themes of the manuscript to warrant new work or revision. The Reviewers also raised some concerns about our methodological assessments and data interpretation which may warrant further discussion and explanation. We address those comments below.  In no case do we feel that the concerns raised undermine our conclusions, so we have not undertaken new analyses nor revised the manuscript.</p>
<p>Median survival and power.</p>
<p>A recurring theme in these reviews is that our conclusion that naked mole-rats do not experience actuarial senescence is spurious, as it is “incomplete for younger animals and inadequate for older animals” due to Kaplan-Meier survival failing to reach median lifespan.  We counter that premise, for median survival is an arbitrary threshold with no special bearing on when the Gompertzian hazard increase (onset of actuarial senescence) should become apparent.  This point is well illustrated in Figure 5 of our original manuscript (Ruby et al., 2018).  For demographic data from lab mice, humans, and horses (panels B, C, and D, respectively), the Gompertzian hazard increase is readily apparent by the time median survival (indicated by vertical dotted lines) is reached.</p>
<p>Another concern raised in the reviews is uncertainty about the true increase in power for these updated data since our 2018 report.  The Reviewers correctly point out that the distribution of those data, and not just their scale, are relevant to power.  The distribution of all data, old and new, are clearly illustrated as a function of age in Figure 2A.  The ~doubling of available observation data is consistent across age groups, with one exception: at ~8,000-10,000 days of age.  However, we do not agree that is a shortcoming of the new data’s power for hazard calculation among older animals, given that the animals that formerly occupied that age bin have continued to age, without greater hazard, across the next five years.  In other words, the lack of N increase in that particular age bin is balanced by the massive increase in available data at ~10,000-12,000 days of age - an advanced age bin that was previously almost empty.</p>
<p>More surprisingly is the insinuation that for an approximately 40 gram rodent species, median survival on an order of 30+ years, with no sign of an increase in age-related mortality hazard, is considered a reasonable expectation. Both here and in our 2018 manuscript, we have conservatively used Tsex (180 days) as our benchmark for allometric scaling. Alternatively, one could scale this to the predicted lifespan based on average body weight for the species. According to the equation of de Magalhaes et al. (2007), the maximum lifespan of H.glaber is expected to be merely six years. Here, the Reviewers suggest that we are under-powered to make any statements about demographic aging because we have not reached median lifespan - despite the fact that our observations extend out to seven times the expected maximum lifespan.  This is the precise nature of our argument that Gompertzian demographic aging is defied: that the onset of actuarial senescence is not apparent even at ages many-fold beyond when one would expect Gompertzian trends to have wiped out the entire population.</p>
<p>Ironically, the Reviewers seem to have focused on the most striking manifestations of Gompertzian defiance - not reaching median lifespan after decades of population observation, or having few death events after tens of thousands of days of individual lifespan observation - as reasons to doubt the conclusions. Even if we quadrupled the number of sample points and included data for another 35 years, if we still did not detect the onset of actuarial senescence, the same critiques would still apply - and would be similarly illogical.</p>
<p>The appropriateness of Kaplan-Meier, with left &amp; right censorship</p>
<p>Objections were raised about the appropriateness of Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for our data.  Reviewer #3 asserts that “a Kaplan-Meier estimator can only take right-censored and uncensored records”, which is incorrect.  This perhaps reflects a wider misunderstanding of Kaplan-Meier statistics that warrants further explanation.</p>
<p>Reviewer #3 asserts that “left-censoring occurs when your event can be repeated and some events occur before the start of the study”.  This is an oversimplified and far too-limited description of when left-censoring should be applied.  We will further explain how left-censorship is applied in various analyses of our data, but for further reading on how this practice can produce unbiased estimates, we recommend the Reviewers consult (Cain et al 2011).  We will discuss left and right truncation and censorship in terms of the diagram from Figure 2 of that manuscript, which illustrates a study in which the timing of event Y after event X in an individual’s life is being analyzed, given enrollment in a study at age A and exit from the study at age B.  We also remind the Reviewers that methods used previously by us are in the papers (Ruby et al, 2018 &amp; 2019) which were referenced and cited in our manuscript and should also be consulted for a full description.</p>
<p>For our study, ages A and B from (Cain et al 2011) are akin to the edges of our hazard estimation windows: appropriate application of censorship and truncation allows us to accurately, unbiasedly estimate hazard within each age bin, allowing fair evaluation of changes (or lack thereof) as a function of age.  For full Kaplan-Meier survival, age A is uniformly defined as Tsex (day 187), and B is not globally defined - rather, it is defined for each animal if observation ended due to exit from the collection (i.e., used in research studies (KFR), donated to another researcher, or continuing to be alive at the time of the study).  Since none of the Reviewers seemed confused or concerned about our use of right-censorship in these cases, we will focus this discussion on left-censorship.</p>
<p>In our original analysis (Ruby et al., 2018), we did not apply left-censorship because Dr. Buffenstein had maintained the animals since they were born, therefore no events occurred (i.e. observations of an animal being alive or dead on a day) prior to the beginning of the study.  In the parlance of (Cain et al, 2011): we knew when the initiating event X had occurred (Tsex), and the animals had been continuously observed thereafter, up until either their death or rightcensorship point.  Animals were right-censored if they were removed from the study, e.g. due to sacrifice for research or donation to other researchers.  Doing so reduced the population size moving forward (to the right) without modifying the survival value, allowing the impact of individual death events to be appropriately amplified (i.e. Kaplan-Meier analysis).</p>
<p>For left-censored data, the same operation occurs but in reverse order: for example, if an animal is left-censored at 457 days of age, then the population size is increased by one on that day, without modifying the survival value.  In Kaplan-Meier survival estimation, for each observation period, the current survival value is multiplied by the fraction of animals surviving at that time interval divided by the number of animals in the population in that interval.  Since the animal in question was not observed prior to 457 days of age, it would not be counted in the population size prior to that day: had it died, it would not have been in the study population at all.  However, once it has entered the population, each day-of-age on which it is observed to be alive is included in the population size tally, since each day it could also perish and thereby impact the survival curve.  If any of the Reviewers received animals from Dr. Buffenstein should they wish to extend this data set in the future using those animals, left-censoring them at their age when they were received (or after some acclimation period) would be the proper method to do so.</p>
<p>As stated above: in our original analysis (Ruby et al., 2018), we did not generally apply leftcensorship because Dr. Buffenstein had maintained the animals since they were born (although beginning the analysis at Tsex qualifies as population-wide left-censorship).  In their commentary, Dammann et al. (2019) pointed out that loss of records could modify the hazard distribution through bias towards longer-term survivors: in other words, counting long-lived animals as part of the population in early life is unfair because the death events from the truly larger population at that time had been lost (in that case: perhaps back in the 1980’s).  In the parlance of (Cain et al, 2011): loss of records would have been the equivalent of left truncation, which if unchecked could produce bias.  For our reply (Ruby et al., 2019), we address this problem by applying a drastic left-censoring of all animal data on a date where we could be highly confident that all records had been securely maintained, thus removing any potential bias introduced by old, lost records - as illustrated by (Cain et al, 2011).  That re-analysis does not change our results, negating loss of decades-old records as a confounder of our conclusions.  In this new manuscript, we used this technique again, only analyzing data collected since those data reported in our prior publications.  Again, our original conclusions were confirmed: quoting Reviewer #3, “the main figures are virtually the same, with some minor changes due to the extended dataset”.</p>
<p>Independence between studies</p>
<p>In this new manuscript, with substantially more data, we applied left-censorship again in order to conduct an analysis of just the newly-provided data.  Importantly, no datum - i.e. no day of observation of an animal being either alive or dead - overlapped between that analysis and those from our original reports (Ruby et al., 2018 &amp; 19), and data were collected across nonoverlapping periods of time.  Reviewer #2 questions the independence of this analysis from the original, correctly citing that it is still our own collection whose demographic data we are surveying.  We reply that it is as independent of a dataset as we could possibly provide: greater independence would require the publication of substantial demographic data from other members of the H.glaber research community, which we would be happy to see.  We also want to remind the Reviewers that Sherman and Jarvis (2002) also reported negligible demographic senescence for animals &gt;15 years of age under their care: a fully-independent observation that concurs with our conclusions, albeit with substantially fewer animals and less statistical power.</p>
<p>“Glossing over” reports of aging phenotypes</p>
<p>Reviewer #1 suggests that our review of our own prior publications in this manuscript has “glossed over data that don’t support our main interpretations”, specifically mentioning the papers by Edrey et al., (2011) and Andziak et al., (2006). However, this is not an accurate reflection of the content of those published papers. The reviewer highlights data pertaining to case studies of two animals, aged 29 and 30 years, exhibiting pathologies that are commonly associated with aging in the Edrey et al., (2011) paper that was entitled “Successful aging and sustained good health in the naked mole-rat……”.  But, as per the title of that paper, those were atypical cases. Indeed, we reported that the majority of animals maintained good health and activity well into their third decade. The Andziak et al., (2006) paper revealed that young (2y), healthy naked mole-rats have higher levels of oxidative damage to lipids, proteins and DNA than observed in young mice; but the follow up paper Andziak and Buffenstein (2006) reported that unlike that observed in mice, in naked mole-rats the levels of such damage do not further increase with advancing age, supporting the premise of sustained tissue homeostasis. Routine pathological assessments undertaken by our group and from zoological specimens in the 12 years since Edrey et al., (2011) have revealed many more instances of  “aging phenotype pathologies” - but again, with similar frequency across all age groups (Delaney et al., 2021). We have not “glossed over data that don’t support our main interpretations”: in fact, the data brought up by the Reviewer support our conclusions.  Like natural death, “age-associated disease phenotypes” occur stochastically across all age groups of H.glaber, rather than being exponentially enriched in elderly animals as in other species.</p>
<p>Breeding status</p>
<p>Reviewer #1 also states that “this study fails to fully represent the literature with respect to the divergence in aging rates between breeders and non-breeders”  This section of our discussion (lines 326-367) addresses the survival advantage in many cooperative breeding mammals in the wild and in captivity including other mole-rats and meerkats (Sharp and Clutton-Brock, 2010; Dammann et al., 2011, Cram et al., 2018).  The lower survival of subordinates in captivity may be due to chronic stress associated with bullying by the dominant animals and their inability to disperse and avoid such unpleasant activities; often being injured and dying after losing fights for a more dominant position in the social hierarchy. Braude et al., (2021) similarly report that compared to subordinates who undertake the more precarious activities of burrow extension, foraging or dispersal, the breeding females remain in their study site for far longer periods.</p>
<p>In captivity, subordinates have two paths to becoming a breeder: If the breeding female dies,  some subordinate females within the colony will fight to the death to establish breeding status and inherit the dominant role in the colony. This could imply that they are “higher-quality” individuals as suggested by Reviewer #1 with molecular and physiological mechanisms in place to outlive their “poorer- quality” conspecifics.  However, the  majority of breeding females in our colony arise through random pairing of a female and a male that has been isolated for a few days from their colony. As such there is no selection for “higher-quality” individuals with concomitant  inheritance of better somatic maintenance mechanisms.  Rather, breeding status appears to be accompanied by a phenoplastic switch, as suggested by the lower levels of DNA methylation in tissues of breeding females (Horvath et al., 2021) and altered growth patterns when a female changes her status to that of a breeder (O’Riain et al., 2000).  This is possibly linked to moving up the dominance hierarchy with concomitant changes in stress, somatotropic, and reproductive hormones as well as augmented tissue repair pathways for the maintenance of homeostasis.</p>
<p>We have not undertaken in depth studies on behavior and social habits and the effect of age, but agree these would be of interest in future studies.</p>
<p>Analysis initiation at 6 months</p>
<p>Mortality rates are highest in the first three months of life, in keeping with increased mortality during the developmental period. While it is true that in captivity most animals continue to grow for the first eighteen months to two years of life and some individuals may continue to gain weight well into their third decade, we and others have shown that animals can successfully breed at 6 months of age, if given the opportunity to do so.  Other demographic studies similarly use the age at which animals can reproduce as the starting point for their analyses. Nevertheless, even if we were to use 2 years as the starting point, the same trends will be evident for there was no increase in mortality risk even at ages beyond 30 years.</p>
<p>Colony size effects</p>
<p>It is intriguing that smaller colonies had higher mortality risk than larger colonies.  In many cases smaller colonies represent younger colonies with possibly less well established breeders and a higher degree of social instability.  In other cases, the breeding female may not be very successful in raising her young, and possibly is not producing “high-quality” offspring.  We agree with the Reviewer, behavioral assessments are needed to evaluate if there is more fighting and competition for dominance or if other social dynamics or ‘poorer-quality’ offspring are at play, nevertheless these findings are intriguing and we have speculated as to why this is the case.  Further work is needed to definitively tease out why this is indeed the case.</p>
