<title>Abstract</title><p>PIP<sub>3</sub>-dependent Rac exchanger 1 (P-Rex1) is abundantly expressed in neutrophils and plays central roles in chemotaxis and cancer metastasis by serving as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rac. The enzyme is synergistically activated by PIP<sub>3</sub> and the heterotrimeric Gβγ subunits, but mechanistic details remain poorly understood. While investigating the regulation of P-Rex1 by PIP<sub>3</sub>, we discovered that Ins(1,3,4,5)P<sub>4</sub> (IP<sub>4</sub>) inhibits P-Rex1 activity and induces large decreases in backbone dynamics in diverse regions of the protein. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis of the P-Rex1·IP<sub>4</sub> complex revealed a conformation wherein the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain occludes the active site of the Dbl homology (DH) domain. This configuration is stabilized by interactions between the first DEP domain (DEP1) and the DH domain and between the PH domain and a 4-helix bundle (4HB) subdomain that extends from the C-terminal domain of P-Rex1. Disruption of the DH–DEP1 interface in a DH/PH-DEP1 fragment enhanced activity and led to a more extended conformation in solution, whereas mutations that constrain the occluded conformation led to decreased GEF activity. Variants of full-length P-Rex1 in which the DH–DEP1 and PH–4HB interfaces were disturbed exhibited enhanced activity during chemokine-induced cell migration, confirming that the observed structure represents the autoinhibited state in living cells. Interactions with PIP<sub>3</sub>-containing liposomes led to disruption of these interfaces and increased dynamics protein-wide. Our results further suggest that inositol phosphates such as IP<sub>4</sub> help to inhibit basal P-Rex1 activity in neutrophils, similar to their inhibitory effects on phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Localized activation of signaling is required for proper cell migration. Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>)-dependent Rac exchanger 1 (P-Rex1) is a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF) abundantly expressed in neutrophils that mediates chemotaxis and the generation of reactive oxygen species via activation of Rac GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dorseuil et al., 1992</xref>). The protein is comprised of a catalytic Dbl homology (DH) domain followed by a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, two DEP domains (DEP1 and DEP2), two PDZ domains (PDZ1 and PDZ2), and a C-terminal inositol polyphosphate-4-phosphatase-like (IP4P) domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>P-Rex1 exhibits low basal activity until it becomes activated via direct interaction with membrane-bound regulators PIP<sub>3</sub> and Gβγ which act synergistically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cash et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Mayeenuddin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Welch et al., 2002</xref>), indicating that they use distinct modes of regulation. Although relatively little is known about how P-Rex1 transitions to an activated state, recent structural studies have defined their docking sites. Gβγ engages a scaffold composed of an amalgamation of the DEP2-PDZ1-PDZ2-IP4P domains and likely helps recruit P-Rex1 to the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cash et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, PIP<sub>3</sub> binds to the PH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hill et al., 2005</xref>) in a basic pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cash et al., 2016</xref>), but this is not necessary for its recruitment to the cell membrane, implying that PIP<sub>3</sub> instead induces a conformational change that activates the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cash et al., 2016</xref>). Because domains C-terminal to the catalytic DH domain are well known to be involved in autoinhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chávez-Vargas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hill et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ravala et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Urano et al., 2008</xref>), the allosteric change induced by PIP<sub>3</sub> must defeat interdomain contacts and render the catalytic DH domain accessible to its substrate.</p>
<p>Here, we used hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) single particle analysis (SPA), and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) along with functional studies and live cell experiments to show that activation of P-Rex1 involves disruption of two different inhibitory interfaces between domains across the length of the protein. Surprisingly, we found that the PIP<sub>3</sub> headgroup analog IP<sub>4</sub> can reduce P-Rex1 activity by stabilizing the autoinhibited conformation of the enzyme at physiologically relevant concentrations, suggesting a previously unknown, additional mechanism of regulation. Our experiments further suggest that P-Rex1 binding to PIP<sub>3</sub>-containing membranes induces conformational changes that unwind P-Rex1 into a fully active state.</p>

<title>IP<sub>4</sub> induces protection from deuterium incorporation on regions of P-Rex1 distal from the PIP<sub>3</sub>-binding site</title>
<p>Previous work suggested that PIP<sub>3</sub> binding to the PH domain activates P-Rex1 purely through an allosteric mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cash et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, we anticipated that binding of the soluble headgroup of PIP<sub>3</sub>, IP<sub>4</sub>, to full-length P-Rex1 could also lead to conformational changes characteristic of the activated state. To test this, we analyzed P-Rex1 in the presence and absence of IP<sub>4</sub> using HDX-MS. We observed strong protection from deuterium incorporation in the PIP<sub>3</sub>-binding site on the PH domain in the presence of IP<sub>4</sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A&amp;B</xref>, Sup. Data 1). However, we also observed strong protection in other regions of the protein: namely on the surface of the PH domain, particularly in the β5/β6 loop, and in several regions within an extension of the C-terminal IP4P domain that was not visualized in the P-Rex1–Gβγ complex (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A&amp;C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cash et al., 2019</xref>). We speculated that these diverse regions form more stable long-range interactions in the presence of IP<sub>4</sub>.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>IP<sub>4</sub> allosterically inhibits P-Rex1</title>
<p>Based on our HDX-MS data, we hypothesized that IP<sub>4</sub> could inhibit activity of full-length P-Rex1. Using an <italic>in vitro</italic> GEF activity assay on soluble Cdc42 in the presence of liposomes, we observed that IP<sub>4</sub> inhibits PIP<sub>3</sub>-mediated activation of P-Rex1 with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 1.4 μM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Competition was not observed with Ins(1,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, indicating that inhibition is dependent on the 3-phosphate, which is critical for PIP<sub>3</sub> binding to the P-Rex1 PH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cash et al., 2016</xref>). However, IP<sub>4</sub> did not affect the activity of the P-Rex1 DH/PH or DH/PH-DEP1 fragments (Sup. Fig. 1A&amp;B). Collectively, these results indicated that IP<sub>4</sub> inhibits P-Rex1 allosterically and that this inhibition is dependent on long range interactions between the regions shown to be protected by IP<sub>4</sub> in the Gβγ-binding scaffold (DEP2-PDZ1-PDZ2-IP4P) and in the DH/PH-DEP1 module.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>IP<sub>4</sub> stabilizes long-range interactions mediated by the P-Rex1 DEP1 and PH domains</title>
<p>To understand the molecular basis of IP<sub>4</sub>-mediated stabilization and inhibition, we analyzed full-length P-Rex1 with and without IP<sub>4</sub> using cryo-EM SPA (Sup. Fig. 2A). Initial datasets were collected using a Glacios transmission electron microscope and then processed through 2D classification (Sup. Fig. 2B-D). In both datasets, most classes showed only the Gβγ-binding core of P-Rex1 (Sup. Fig. 2C&amp;D). A few classes contained particles with additional mass to the side of the core, close to the PDZ or DEP domains (Sup. Fig. 2C, orange boxes). This mass could represent either the N-terminal domains or another P-Rex1 particle in proximity. Only in the sample containing IP<sub>4</sub> could we observe class averages with additional mass next to the core opposite the side that binds Gβγ (Sup. Fig. 2D, green boxes). Based on its size, location, our HDX-MS data (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), and low-resolution maps of P-Rex1 generated in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cash et al., 2019</xref>), this mass most likely corresponded to the N-terminal DH/PH-DEP1 domains interacting with an elongated subdomain extending from the IP4P domain.</p>
<p>We next collected much larger datasets on the P-Rex1·IP<sub>4</sub> complex using a Krios transmission electron microscope and determined the structure of this complex at an average resolution of 4.1 Å (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-B</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, and Sup. Fig. 3). Similar to the P-Rex1–Gβγ complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cash et al., 2019</xref>), this sample exhibited a preferred orientation on grids, necessitating the addition of data collected on a tilted sample (Sup. Fig. 3A, C). The resulting 3D reconstruction clearly shows the Gβγ-binding core, composed of DEP2, PDZ1, PDZ2, and the majority of the IP4P domain, from which there are two extensions of density that contact one another to form a loop-like structure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and Sup. Fig. 3D). One extension corresponds to a large insertion in the IP4P domain that contains IP<sub>4</sub>-stabilized regions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) and that was disordered in the P-Rex1– Gβγ complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cash et al., 2019</xref>). The ordered elements of the insertion form a long 4-helix bundle (4HB) most similar in fold to focal adhesion targeting (FAT) domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hayashi et al., 2002</xref>), which are found in other peripheral membrane proteins involved in cell adhesion and migration. The other extension corresponds to the DH/PH-DEP1 domains. Based on its distinct shape, the PH domain (Cash, 2016) was fit into density along the side of the 4HB. The position of the DH domain was also obvious, but individual helices of the DH domain were lower in resolution and more dynamic relative to the rest of the structure (Sup. Fig. 3D). The relative positions of the DH and PH domains mandate a severe bend in the helix connecting the DH and PH domains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A&amp;B</xref>), resulting in a jack-knifed configuration of the DH/PH module that blocks access to the GTPase binding site on the DH domain. The remaining mass, immediately adjacent to the end of the DH domain opposite its N-terminus, corresponds to DEP1. Using the required connectivity of its N- and C-termini to the PH and DEP2 domains, respectively, DEP1 was docked in a manner that complemented residues on the DH domain and corroborated the HDX-MS data (Sup. Fig. 4). Weak density corresponding to a long 5-turn extension of the αC helix of the PH domain connects to the N-terminus of DEP1, but its C-terminal connection to DEP2 is disordered, likely explaining lower local resolution in the DEP1 region (Sup. Fig. 3D). Overall, the conformation of the P-Rex1 Gβγ-binding core is essentially the same as in the P-Rex1–Gβγ complex (RMSD deviation of 1.1 Å for 701 Cα atoms).</p>

<p>The contact between the PH domain and the 4HB is primarily mediated via the β1 and β2 strands and β5/β6 loop of the PH domain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C&amp;D</xref>). In all previous crystal structures including the P-Rex1 PH domain, this same surface formed extensive protein-protein lattice contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cash et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lucato et al., 2015</xref>). The residues directly involved in the interface are among the most strongly protected in the presence of IP<sub>4</sub> as measured by HDX-MS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-C</xref>, Sup. Fig. 4). The PH domain β3/β4 loop, which we previously showed to be a nonspecific anionic membrane-binding loop, remains unstructured and is situated near a loop at the tip of the 4HB that is also unstructured (residues 1109-1209, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) and contains known phosphorylation sites, some of which regulate activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barber et al., 2012</xref>). At the interface, surface hydrophobic residues Leu279 and Ile286 on the PH β1 and β2 strands and Tyr353 on the β5/β6 loop interact with a surface of 4HB including Tyr1096 and His1224 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Charge complementarity is formed between Lys302 in the PH domain and Asp1216 in 4HB, and between the 1-phosphate of IP<sub>4</sub> and Lys1217. Otherwise, IP<sub>4</sub> does not make direct contact with the 4HB. However, because different PH domain ligands uniquely perturb the conformation of these regions in the PH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cash et al., 2016</xref>), IP<sub>4</sub> could indirectly stabilize this interface by trapping the β1 and β2 strands and β5/β6 loop in a conformation with higher affinity for 4HB.</p>
<p>The jack-knife in the helix between the DH and PH domains is required to allow the PH domain to interact with the 4HB and is stabilized by the DEP1 domain docking to the DH domain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). DH domain residues Leu173, Leu177, and Leu178 form a hydrophobic interface with DEP1 residues Ile409, Ile457, Leu466, and Ala469 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Leu173 and Leu177 were previously noted to be conspicuously exposed in structures of the DH/PH tandem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cash et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the DEP1 domain stabilizes an inactive DH/PH tandem that is further stabilized by interaction with the 4HB of the IP4P domain.</p>

Overall, the domain organization is very similar, but there is an ∼3° rotation of the Gβγ-binding core in the IP<sub>4</sub> complex relative to the PH–4HB interface such that DEP1 and DEP2 move closer together. It is possible that the binding of IP<sub>4</sub> at this interface drives this conformational change. A caveat is that the protein used for the 7SYF structure contained a T4 lysozyme domain inserted into the β3/β4 loop of the PH domain. Although this domain was not visible in the reconstruction, its proximity to the IP<sub>4</sub> binding site may influence the global conformation of P-Rex1. The similarities between P-Rex1±IP<sub>4</sub> also suggest that the IP<sub>4</sub>-binding site in the PH domain is freely accessible in the autoinhibited state. PIP<sub>3</sub> would, however, not have access because the 4HB domain would block binding to a membrane surface.</p>

<title>The DH–DEP1 interface contributes to autoinhibition in vitro</title>
<p>To test the contribution of the observed DH–DEP1 interface to autoinhibition, the interface was disrupted by site-directed mutagenesis in the context of the DH/PH-DEP1 fragment. This fragment is 5- to 10-fold less active (depending on assay conditions) than the DH/PH tandem alone (Sup. Fig. 1C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ravala et al., 2020</xref>), confirming a specific role for DEP1 in autoinhibition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Single point mutations in the interface profoundly affected GEF activity on soluble Cdc42. The L173A variant had ∼2.5-fold higher activity, whereas L177E and L178E exhibited 4- to 5-fold higher activity, similar to the activity of DH/PH without the DEP1 domain. In the DEP1 domain, I409A and L466A mutations resulted in ∼2- and 4-fold higher activity, respectively. The α1/α2 loop (residues 77-90) of the DH domain, although ordered in previous structures of DH/PH bound to GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cash et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lucato et al., 2015</xref>), is disordered in our structure (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). However, modeling the DH domain from previous DH/PH crystal structures suggests that Lys89 and Arg78 would be close enough to form a bipartite ionic interaction with Glu456 in the DEP1 domain. Consistent with this hypothesis, the E456K variant was ∼2.5-fold more active. Surprisingly, one of the intended disruptive mutations, A170K, instead inhibited GEF activity by ∼50% (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Based on our structure, Lys170 could form a salt bridge with DEP1 Glu411 in addition to forming non-polar interdomain contacts, stabilizing the DH–DEP1 interface (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>

<title>The DH—DEP1 interface stabilizes DH/PH-DEP1 and decreases flexibility</title>
<p>Because disruption of the DH–DEP1 interface led to increased activity, we predicted that these variants have a more extended DH/PH module that is likely more dynamic. To test this, wild-type (WT) DH/PH-DEP1 and its variants were assessed using a Thermofluor assay to determine their melting temperatures (T<sub>m</sub>). Indeed, variants with increased activity also had lower T<sub>m</sub> values (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Conversely, A170K, which was less active than WT, showed a higher T<sub>m</sub>. We also analyzed these variants using size exclusion chromatography coupled to small-angle X-ray scattering (SEC-SAXS) (Sup. Fig. 5A&amp;B). In previous SAXS analyses, we observed that DH/PH-DEP1 exhibited a more compact state with a smaller conformational landscape in solution relative to DH/PH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ravala et al., 2020</xref>). We hypothesized that mutations which disrupt the DH–DEP1 interface would likewise lead to more elongated ensembles. Compared to WT DH/PH-DEP1, which had a radius of gyration (R<sub>g</sub>) of 30 ± 0.3 Å, the L177E variant (the most active DH/PH-DEP1 variant tested) had an R<sub>g</sub> of 31 ± 0.2 Å, suggestive of expansion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref> and <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Variants A170K and I409A had R<sub>g</sub> values similar to that of WT. Kratky plots indicated that all the samples had heterogeneous conformations (Sup. Fig. 5C). The shapes of the P(r) functions were similar for all variants except a longer tail for L177E and I409A, consistent with a higher proportion of extended conformations in solution (Sup. Fig. 5D).</p>

<title>The kink in the α6-αN helix of the DH/PH module is important for autoinhibition</title>
<p>We hypothesized that the kink in the α6-αN linker of the DH/PH tandem is important for autoinhibition. If this is true, then introduction of disulfide bonds that lock this kinked configuration should reduce activity. To test this, we used the DH/PH-DEP1 A170K variant as the backbone and created the S235C/M244C and K207C/E251C double mutants. Single cysteine variants K207C and M244C were also generated as controls. Both S235C/M244C and K207C/E251C variants exhibited reduced GEF activity that was reversed upon addition of DTT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). However, the M244C variant displayed similar behavior, suggesting that disulfide bonds with cysteine(s) other than S235C were forming. Indeed, the side chains of Cys200 and Cys234 are in proximity to the M244C residue. The Lys207/Glu251 pair is interesting because these residues could form a salt bridge and stabilize the bent conformation. Mutating both residues to Cys had little effect on activity under non-reducing condition. However, under reducing conditions, K207C/E251C became ∼15-fold more active, likely because the 207/251 residue pair was no longer restrained by a disulfide bond or a salt bridge. In total, these data support the idea that a kinked α6-αN hinge is important for autoinhibition of P-Rex1.</p>

CXCL12-induced chemotaxis was dependent on the expression of P-Rex1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B&amp;C</xref> and Sup.

However, EGF-induced chemotaxis in HeLa cells, which is not dependent on P-Rex1, was unaffected by P-Rex1 expression.

<title>P-Rex1 binding to PIP<sub>3</sub>-containing model membranes induces a more open, dynamic conformation</title>
<p>Given the known binding site for Gβγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cash et al., 2019</xref>), the position of membrane-binding loops such as the β1/β2 loop of the DEP1 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ravala et al., 2020</xref>), and the position of the 4HB domain, it does not seem that the PH domain would be able to interact with PIP<sub>3</sub> in a cell membrane while P-Rex1 is in its autoinhibited conformation. To better understand the molecular consequences of PIP<sub>3</sub> binding, HDX-MS measurements were taken on P-Rex1 in the presence of liposomes ± PIP<sub>3</sub>. Without PIP<sub>3</sub>, the most notable changes in P-Rex1 in response to liposomes were increases in protection of the lipid binding elements of both DEP domains (primarily their β1/β2 loops; Sup. Fig. 7A, Sup. Data 2), which suggests that they directly interact with lipid bilayers. Indeed, the isolated DEP1 can independently bind negatively charged liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ravala et al., 2020</xref>). Within the PH domain, there was deprotection of the αC helix, but there was no deprotection at the PH–4HB interface, suggesting that it remained intact. In contrast, membranes with PIP<sub>3</sub> caused deprotection of the entire DH domain, the α6-αN linker and the helices at the DH–DEP1 interface (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, Sup. Fig. 6B, Sup. Data 2). Although the core of the PH domain showed, as expected, an increase in protection in the presence of PIP<sub>3</sub>, the structural elements contacting 4HB became deprotected, as did the PH-binding regions of 4HB. Collectively, these data are consistent with loosening of interdomain contacts and unraveling of at least some fraction of P-Rex1 onto the surface of the liposome.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we showed that IP<sub>4</sub> binding to the PIP<sub>3</sub>-binding site in full-length P-Rex1 stabilizes a closed, autoinhibited conformation of P-Rex1 by enhancing long-range contacts across the length of the protein. DH–DEP1 and PH–4HB interactions are relieved upon binding PIP<sub>3</sub>-containing liposomes, leading to activation of P-Rex1. Canonically, PIP<sub>3</sub> signaling is negatively regulated by PIP<sub>3</sub> phosphatases such as PTEN. Additionally, inositol phosphates, including IP<sub>7</sub> and IP<sub>4</sub>, can compete with PIP<sub>3</sub> binding to PH domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Jia et al., 2007</xref>), representing another form of negative regulation. Ins(1,3,4,5)P<sub>4</sub> is a major isoform of IP<sub>4</sub> in neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Stuart et al., 1994</xref>) where its concentration is estimated to be 4 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">French et al., 1991</xref>) and where P-Rex1 is highly expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Welch et al., 2002</xref>). Because we can measure significant inhibition of P-Rex1 by IP<sub>4</sub> at &gt; 1 µM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), IP<sub>4</sub> may exert biologically relevant control of Rac activation, at least in neutrophils. Since P-Rex1 can bind membranes in the absence of PIP<sub>3</sub> or Gβγ, IP<sub>4</sub> may serve to suppress P-Rex1 activity until a threshold concentration of PIP<sub>3</sub> is generated, allowing rapid activation of already cell membrane-associated P-Rex1. It is worth noting that this regulation by specific inositol phosphates may depend on the intracellular distribution of the enzymes responsible for their synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Gokhale et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Another key result of our study was to provide a molecular explanation for how the PH and DEP1 domains contribute to P-Rex1 regulation. Nearly two decades ago, it was first reported that domains located C-terminal to the DH domain contribute to P-Rex1 autoinhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hill et al., 2005</xref>). Deletion of the PH domain in P-Rex1 resulted in a large increase in activity in the context of the full-length enzyme. However, the DH/PH fragment has higher activity than DH/PH-DEP1 and larger P-Rex1 fragments, indicating that the PH domain itself is not intrinsically inhibitory, as it is in some other RhoGEF DH/PH tandems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bandekar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al., 2020</xref>)(Ravala and Tesmer, 2023). This apparent contradiction can now be explained by the fact that in DH/PH-DEP1 and larger fragments, the DH/PH module can jack-knife and position the PH domain in a manner that blocks GTPase binding. This model of regulation was corroborated by recent structural studies of P-Rex1 without IP<sub>4</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chang et al., 2022</xref>). The isolated DEP1 domain was also shown to play an autoinhibitory role based on the relatively low activity of DH/PH-DEP1 relative to DH/PH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ravala et al., 2020</xref>). This can now be explained by its interaction with the DH domain, which, consequently, positions the PH domain to block access of GTPases. Because the PH and DEP1 domains can mediate inhibition in the contexts of both DH/PH-DEP1 and the full-length enzyme, and because there is little GEF activity when DH–DEP1 interface is intact, the DH/PH-DEP1 module can be thought of as the core signaling circuit in P-Rex1. In support of this, our mutations in the DH–DEP1 interface were, in general, more activating than those in the PH–4HB interface in cells, although we note that our mutagenesis was not exhaustive (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>
<p>Using our functional data along with the known structures of P-Rex1, we assembled a model for the activation of P-Rex1 by PIP<sub>3</sub> and Gβγ (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). P-Rex1 in its basal state may be associated with IP<sub>4</sub> and exist in equilibrium at the membrane or in the cytosol. Indeed, in our HDX-MS studies, the DEP1 and DEP2 domains show protection in the presence of liposomes even without PIP<sub>3</sub> (Sup. Fig. 7, Sup. Data 2). In its autoinhibited configuration, the known membrane anchoring elements (the GTPase binding site of the DH domain, the PIP<sub>3</sub>-binding site of the PH domain, the β3/β4 loop of the PH domain, the β1/β2 loops of DEP1 and DEP2, and the Gβγ binding site in the C-terminal domains) cannot engage a common membrane plane (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). The clear outlier is the PH domain which would not be able to engage the membrane along with the other domains without unwrapping of the autoinhibited conformation. PIP<sub>3</sub> is not major driver of membrane anchoring on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Barber et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cash et al., 2016</xref>), and nor is Gβγ, but they do so synergistically in combination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Barber et al., 2007</xref>). In prior HDX-MS studies, Gβγ binding did not have a large effect on the regions now known to be involved in autoinhibition and only caused protection in regions of direct contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cash et al., 2019</xref>). This supports the idea that its role in activation may be primarily related to translocation. This is consistent with the observation that the ΔPH variant of P-Rex1 (which cannot form the DEP1–DH or PH–4HB interfaces or bind PIP<sub>3</sub>) is activated to the same extent by Gβγ as WT P-Rex1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hill et al., 2005</xref>). In autoinhibited P-Rex1, the Gβγ binding site is readily accessible whereas that of PIP<sub>3</sub> is sequestered.</p>
<p>We propose that, after stimulation of GPCRs in neutrophils, Gβγ likely binds first and, with the assistance of membrane binding elements in the DEP1 and 2 domains and possibly the β3/β4 loop of the PH domain, promotes loosening of the autoinhibited state (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). Generation of PIP<sub>3</sub> by PI3K then releases the DH/PH module from the 4HB and DEP1 domain, displacing any bound IP<sub>4</sub>. Because neither PIP<sub>3</sub> nor IP<sub>4</sub> can activate DH/PH-DEP1 GEF activity on a soluble GTPase (Sup. Fig. 1A&amp;B), we speculate that this unwrapping at the membrane with multiple points of engagement across the protein is necessary for full activation of P-Rex1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). Indeed, our HDX-MS and SAXS studies here support that fully activated P-Rex1 at the membrane will be more extended and dynamic, making the DH domain more accessible to Rac1. However, what remains unknown is the mechanism by which the PH domain is able to access PIP<sub>3</sub> at the membrane, even in a “loosened” autoinhibited state. Furthermore, additional layers of P-Rex1 regulation exist that remain underexplored. For example, phosphorylation of the lipid binding loop of DEP1 by PKA is known to inhibit P-Rex1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chávez-Vargas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ravala et al., 2020</xref>). Also, a potential interaction may occur between the basic β3/β4 loop of the PH domain and the loop at the end of the 4HB (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Both loops, consistent with their extended and dynamic nature, have predicted and confirmed phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barber et al., 2012</xref>) and thus could potentially modulate P-Rex1 activity if they interact. Phosphorylation of the basic β3/β4 loop might be expected to inhibit activity based on the fact that it binds and localizes the protein to the negatively charged plasma membrane, consistent with dephosphorylation of the loop leading to activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Montero et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">2013</xref>).</p>

The data was fit to the one-phase exponential decay model in GraphPad Prism with the span (Y<sub>o</sub>-plateau) shared among samples. For IP<sub>4</sub> competition curves, GEF assays were carried out in the presence of liposomes containing 2.5 µM PIP<sub>3</sub>, as indicated, and 200 µM each of POPC and POPS, prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cash et al., 2019</xref>).</p>

<title>Cryo-EM grid preparation and data collection</title>
<p>For cryo-EM sample preparation, P-Rex1 was used at a final concentration of 3 μM and <italic>n</italic>-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM) was added to a final concentration of 0.08 mM. For samples with IP<sub>4</sub>, a final concentration of 40 μM IP<sub>4</sub> was added. A sample of 4 μl was applied to a glow-discharged Quantifoil (1.2/1.3) 300-mesh grid which was then blotted with filter paper and plunge-frozen into liquid ethane cooled with liquid nitrogen using a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) set to 4 °C, 100% humidity, 4 second blot, and a force of 10. Micrographs were collected either using Leginon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Suloway et al., 2005</xref>) on a Glacios transmission electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operating at 200 keV and a K2 Summit direct electron detector (Gatan, Inc.) in counting mode (0.98 Å/pixel) at a nominal magnification of 45,000x or using EPU (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on a Titan Krios transmission electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operating at 300 keV and a K3 direct electron detector (Gatan, Inc.) in counting mode (1.054 Å/pixel) at a nominal magnification of 81,000x.

<title>Cryo-EM data processing</title>
<p>To overcome the severe preferred orientation problem of our sample on grids, we collected data on 0° and 30° tilted samples on a Krios electron microscope and processed these datasets separately up through 2D classification (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For each dataset, micrograph assessment, particle picking, and contrast transfer function estimation were performed using Warp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Tegunov and Cramer, 2019</xref>). Particle stacks were taken into CryoSPARC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Punjani et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">2017</xref>) and extensively cleaned using 2D classification. A final merged particle stack was used for <italic>ab initio</italic> reconstruction into one class followed by non-uniform refinement to obtain a map at an overall 4.1 Å resolution for the P-Rex1·IP<sub>4</sub> complex. For Glacios datasets, data were processed only through 2D classification.</p>

<title>Model building and refinement</title>
<p>Initial model building relied on docking existing atomic models for the DH and PH domains of P-Rex1 (PDB entries 5FL1 and 5D3Y) and the Gβγ-binding scaffold (PDB entry 6PCV). 5D3Y was used for the PH domain because the maps were consistent with IP<sub>4</sub> bound to the PIP<sub>3</sub> site of the PH domain. The DEP1 domain was placed using a non-domain swapped atomic model derived from PDB entry 6VSK. The linker between the PH and DEP1 domains and the 4HB domain were built by hand. A Dali search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Holm and Laakso, 2016</xref>) using backbone helices of 4HB revealed its topology to be similar to FAT domains, which was then used to adjust the register of each of its four helices. When Alphafold2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>) became available, it was used to further adjust the modeling of the 4HB domain and associated structural elements in the IP4P domain. Finally, when the cryo-EM structure of P-Rex1 (PDB entry 7SYF) and the crystal structure of the DH/PH-DEP1 module (PDB entry 7RX9) became available, they were used to confirm less certain regions. Final rounds of real space refinement iterating with manual building were performed in Phenix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Liebschner et al., 2019</xref>). Final structure statistics are given in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, and the structure and associated maps were deposited as PDB entry 8TUA and EMDB entry EMD-41621. Raw data were deposited as EMPIAR entry XXXX.</p>

<title>Size exclusion chromatography coupled to small-angle X-ray scattering (SEC-SAXS)</title>
<p>For in solution characterization of DH/PH-DEP1 and its variants, SEC-SAXS was conducted at the BioCAT beamline (Sector18) at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory using an AKTA Pure FPLC and a Pilatus3 X 1M detector. Purified proteins were injected onto a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 column at a final concentration of 3-5 mg/ml in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7, 300 mM NaCl, 2% glycerol, and elution from this column flowed into SAXS flow cell for X-ray scattering. Data were collected every 1 s with 0.5 s exposure times at room temperature using 12 KeV X-rays (1.033 Å wavelength) and a 3.67 m sample- to-detector distance. The achievable q range for this experimental setup was (0.0043-0.3546 Å).</p>

<title>SAXS Analysis</title>
<p>The scattering data were processed using BioXTAS RAW 1.6.3 software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hopkins et al., 2017</xref>) (Sup. Fig. 5A) and used to determine the forward scattering I(0) and the radius of gyration, R<sub>g</sub> via Guinier analysis (Sup. Fig. 5B). The Kratky plot showed proteins to be flexible (Sup. Fig. 5C) leading to unsuccessful rigid modeling efforts. However, use of the ensemble optimization method (EOM) within ATSAS/3.0.5-2 aided in generating ensembles representing distinct conformational states of the DH/PH-DEP1 fragment and its variants A170K, L177E, and I409A in solution at equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ravala et al., 2020</xref>). For EOM, the models were generated using crystallographic coordinates from their respective crystal structures: PDB 5FI1 and PDB 6VSK. EOM generated 50,000 possible profiles for the full pool using default settings and native-like structures. From these profiles, a sub ensemble that matches the experimental scattering data is selected by a genetic algorithm run 10 times using default settings to verify the stability of the results (results from 1 run are shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E&amp;F</xref>). The pair distance distribution function P(r), which provides maximum particle dimension of each protein, was calculated using GNOM (DI, 1992) from the ATSAS 2.8.4 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Franke et al., 2017</xref>) (Sup. Fig. 5D).</p>
<p>For quantitative analyses of the flexibility of the selected ensembles, R<sub>flex</sub> and R<sub>σ</sub> metrics were derived from EOM data. WT DH/PH-DEP1 and A170K show R<sub>flex</sub> values smaller than those of the pools, which indicates that these proteins do not exhibit a fully flexible conformation. L177E and I409A variants exhibit R<sub>flex</sub> values close to those of the pool, suggestive of being highly flexible. Since Guinier analyses and the normalized residual fits of the proteins show that SAXS data quality is good (Sup. Fig. 5B), the R<sub>σ</sub> value &gt;1 is due to flexibility in the protein, consistent with the EOM analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E&amp;F</xref>, Sup. Fig. 5A). Results of the SAXS analysis are presented in <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> in accordance with the revised guidelines for publishing SAXS data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Trewhella et al., 2017</xref>).

<p>Thermofluor experiments were performed on a QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR system in duplicate with n =3 independent experiments. Purified DH/PH-DEP1 and its variants were incubated at 1 mg/ml in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 300 mM NaCl, and 2 mM DTT with 2.5x Sypro Orange dye in a final volume of 10 μl in a 384-well PCR plate. Fluorescence was monitored as a function of temperature, and the T<sub>m</sub> was determined by fitting the fluorescence data to a sigmoidal curve and calculating the inflection point in GraphPad Prism.</p>

<title>Preparation of P-Rex1 KO in HeLa cells and cell migration assays</title>
<p>HeLa cells were lentiviral transduced with pLentiCRISPRv2 P-Rex1 guide RNA3 - AGGCATTCCTGCATCGCATC (Genscript SC1678). Forty-eight hours after transduction, HeLa cells were selected with puromycin [3 μg/mL] for 7 days. P-Rex1 KO was confirmed by western blot. Chemotactic migration was measured by transwell assays (Thermoscientific 140629). Inserts of 24-well plates were pre-treated with Fibronectin [50 μg/mL] for 3 hours at 37 °C. Subsequently, 5×10<sup>4</sup> HeLa cells prepared in serum-free DMEM were plated on the inserts at the upper chamber. Human CXCL12 [50 ng/mL] and EGF [50 ng/mL] (Sigma Aldrich SRP3276 and SRP6253) were prepared in serum-free DMEM and used as chemoattractant in the lower chamber. Serum-free DMEM was used as negative control. The plates with the inserts were incubated in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 6 h. After incubation, the cells at the upper surface of the membrane insert were carefully removed and the cells attached to the lower surface were gently washed with PBS and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. After fixation, the cells were gently washed with PBS followed by staining with 0.5% crystal violet for 20 min. Excess of crystal violet was removed by gentle PBS washes. Migrating cells were imaged using an inverted microscope. Quantification of particles corresponding to migrating cells was performed with FIJI software.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors perform a multidisciplinary approach to describe the conformational plasticity of P-Rex1 in various states (autoinhibited, IP4 bound, and PIP3 bound). Hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) is used to reveal how IP4 and PIP3 binding affect intramolecular interactions. While IP4 is found to stabilize autoinhibitory interactions, PIP3 does the opposite, leading to deprotection of autoinhibitory sites. Cryo-EM of IP4 bound P-Rex1 reveals a structure in the autoinhibited conformation, very similar to the unliganded structure reported previously (Chang et al. 2022). Mutations at observed autoinhibitory interfaces result in a more open structure (as shown by SAXS), reduced thermal stability, and increased GEF activity in biochemical and cellular assays. Together their work portrays a dynamic enzyme that undergoes long-range conformational changes upon activation on PIP3 membranes. The results are technically sound (apart from a few points mentioned below) and the conclusions are justified. The main drawback is the limited novelty due to the recently published structure of unliganded P-Rex1, which is virtually identical to the IP4 bound structure presented here. Novel aspects suggest a regulatory role for IP4, but the exact significance and mechanism of this regulation have not been explored.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors use a multitude of techniques to describe the dynamic nature and conformational changes of P-Rex1 upon binding to IP4 and PIP3 membranes. The different approaches together fit well with the overall conclusion that IP4 binding negatively regulates P-Rex1, while binding to PIP3 membranes leads to conformational opening and catalytic activation. The experiments are performed very thoroughly and are technically sound (apart from a few comments mentioned below). The results are clear and support the conclusions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. The novelty of the study is compromised due to the recently published structure of unliganded P-Rex1 (Chang et al. 2022). The unliganded and IP4-bound structure of P-Rex1 appear virtually identical, however, no clear comparison is presented in the manuscript. In the same paper, a very similar model of P-Rex1 activation upon binding to PIP3 membranes and Gbeta/gamma is presented.</p>
<p>2. The authors demonstrate that IP4 binding to P-Rex1 results in catalytic inhibition and increased protection of autoinhibitory interfaces, as judged by HDX. The relevance of this in a cellular setting is not clear and is not experimentally demonstrated. Further, mechanistically, it is not clear whether the biochemical inhibition by IP4 of PIP3 activated P-Rex1 is due to competition of IP4 with activating PIP3 binding to the PH domain of P-Rex1, or due to stabilizing the autoinhibited conformation, or both.</p>
<p>3. It is difficult to judge the error in the HDX experiments presented in Sup. data 1 and 2. In the method section, it is stated that the results represent the average from two samples. How is the SD error calculated in Fig.1B-C?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this new paper, the authors used biochemical, structural, and biophysical methods to elucidate the mechanisms by which IP4, the PIP3 headgroup, can induce an autoinhibit form of P-Rex1 and propose a model of how PIP3 can trigger long-range conformational changes of P-Rex1 to relieve this autoinhibition. The main findings of this study are that a new P-Rex1 autoinhibition is driven by an IP4-induced binding of the PH domain to the DH domain active site and that this autoinhibited form is stabilized by two key interactions between DEP1 and DH and between PH and IP4P 4-helix bundle (4HB) subdomain. Moreover, they found that the binding of phospholipid PIP3 to the PH domain can disrupt these interactions to relieve P-Rex1 autoinhibition.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The study provides good evidence that binding of IP4 to the P-Rex1 PH domain can make the two long-range interactions between the catalytic DH domain and the first DEP domain and between the PH domain and the C-terminal IP4P 4HB subdomain that generate a novel P-Rex1 autoinhibition mechanism. This valuable finding adds an extra layer of P-Rex1 regulation (perhaps in the cytoplasm) to the synergistic activation by phospholipid PIP3 and the heterotrimeric Gbeta/gamma subunits at the plasma membrane. Overall, this manuscript's goal sounds interesting, the experimental data were carried out carefully and reliably.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this report, Ravala et al demonstrate that IP4, the soluble head-group of phosphatiylinositol 3,4,5 - trisphosphate (PIP3), is an inhibitor of pREX-1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rac1 and related small G proteins that regulate cell migration. This finding is perhaps unexpected since pREX-1 activity is PIP3-dependent. By way of Cryo-EM (revealing the structure of the p-REX-1/IP4 complex at 4.2Å resolution), hydrogen-deuterium mass spectrometry, and small angle X-ray scattering, they deduce a mechanism for IP4 activation, and conduct mutagenic and cell-based signaling assays that support it. The major finding is that IP4 stabilizes two interdomain interfaces that block access to the DH domain, which conveys GEF activity towards small G protein substrates. One of these is the interface between the PH domain that binds to IP4 and a 4-helix bundle extension of the IP4 Phosphatase domain and the DEP1 domain. The two interfaces are connected by a long helix that extends from PH to DEP1. Although the structure of fully activated pREX-1 has not been determined, the authors propose a &quot;jackknife&quot; mechanism, similar to that described earlier by Chang et al (2022) (referenced in the author's manuscript) in which binding of IP3 relieves a kink in a helix that links the PH/DH modules and allows the DH-PH-DEP triad to assume an extended conformation in which the DH domain is accessible. While the structure of the activated pREX-1 has not been determined, cysteine mutagenesis that enforces the proposed kink is consistent with this hypothesis. SAXS and HDX-MS experiments suggest that IP4 acts by stiffening the inhibitory interfaces, rather than by reorganizing them. Indeed, the cryo-EM structure of ligand-free pREX-1 shows that interdomain contacts are largely retained in the absence of IP4.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The manuscript thus describes a novel regulatory role for IP4 and is thus of considerable significance to our understanding of regulatory mechanisms that control cell migration, particularly in immune cell populations. Specifically, they show how the inositol polyphosphate IP4 controls the activity of pREX-1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that controls the activity of small G proteins Rac and CDC42 . In their clearly written discussion, the authors explain how PIP3, the cell membrane, and the Gbeta-gamma subunits of heterotrimeric membranes together localize pREX-1 at the membrane and induce activation. The quality of experimental data is high and both in vitro and cell-based assays of site-directed mutants designed to test the author's hypotheses are confirmatory. The results strongly support the conclusions. The combination of cryo-EM data, that describe the static (if heterogeneous) structures with experiments (small angle x-ray scattering and hydrogen-deuterium exchange-mass spectrometry) that report on dynamics are well employed by the authors</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
There are a few weaknesses. While the resolution of the cryo-EM structure is modest, it is sufficient to identify the domain-domain interactions that are mechanistically important, since higher-resolution structures of various pREX-1 modules are available.</p>
