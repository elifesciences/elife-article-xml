<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Deregulated DNA replication causes human developmental disorders and cancer, but we know little about how DNA replication is coordinated with changes in transcription and chromatin structure. The initiation of replication forks follows a spatiotemporal pattern called the replication timing program. We have developed the zebrafish into a model system to study the mechanisms by which the replication timing program changes during the extensive changes in the cell cycle, transcription, chromatin organization, and nuclear structure that occur during development. Our previous studies identified changes in DNA replication timing patterns occurring from the onset of zygotic transcription through gastrulation in zebrafish embryos. Rif1 is required for DNA replication timing in a wide range of eukaryotes. The broader role of Rif1 in establishing the replication timing program and chromatin structure during early vertebrate development remains unknown. We have generated Rif1 mutant zebrafish and have performed RNA sequencing and whole-genome replication timing analyses on multiple developmental stages. Rif1 mutants were viable but had a defect in female sex determination. Surprisingly, Rif1 loss predominantly affected DNA replication timing after gastrulation, while its impacts on transcription were more substantial during zygotic genome activation. Our results indicate that Rif1 has distinct roles in DNA replication and transcription control that manifest at different stages of development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The initiation of DNA replication follows a pattern where different genomic regions replicate at distinct times throughout S-phase. This temporal pattern is known as the replication-timing program (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rhind and Gilbert, 2013</xref></bold></italic>). Replication timing (RT) correlates with chromatin organization and gene activity (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hiratani et al., 2010</xref></bold></italic>). In multicellular organisms, early replication often correlates with active transcription; whereas, late replication frequently coincides with transcriptionally silent genes (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hiratani et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">MacAlpine et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">SchÃ¼beler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">White et al., 2004</xref></bold></italic>). In mammals, pluripotent cells exhibit a replication-timing pattern that changes with cellular differentiation; in addition, the switch in RT is related to changes in epigenetic modifications, transcriptional activity and the three-dimensional (3D) organization of chromatin (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dixon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hiratani et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rhind and Gilbert, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zhou et al., 2002</xref></bold></italic>). The causal relationships between DNA replication and developmental changes, such as transcription, chromatin structure and 3D chromatin organization have been unclear.</p>
<p>The Rif1 (Rap1-interacting factor 1) protein is of particular interest because it has been impli-cated in the regulation of transcription, chromatin structure, 3D chromatin organization, DNA re-pair, and DNA replication timing. In fact, Rif1 is the single factor known to influence RT in all eu-karyotes (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cornacchia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hayano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hiraga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rhind and Gilbert, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Yamazaki et al., 2012</xref></bold></italic>). Through conserved motifs, Rif1 has been shown to interact physically with the PP1 phosphatase (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">DavÃ© et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hiraga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Mattarocci et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sreesankar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sukackaite et al., 2017</xref></bold></italic>). Rif1 controls RT by bringing PP1 to late-replicating regions of the genome, thereby causing de-phosphorylation of DNA replication factors during early S-phase and delaying initiation (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">DavÃ© et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Foti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hiraga et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Mattarocci et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sreesankar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Yamazaki et al., 2012</xref></bold></italic>).</p>
<p>Our understanding of how Rif1 affects RT during embryonic development is incomplete. RT is developmentally regulated through Rif1 in <italic>D. melanogaster (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Seller and OâFarrell, 2018</xref></bold></italic>). In early fly embryos, Rif1-activation initiates late replication of satellite repeats and causes the first lengthening of the cell cycle (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Seller and OâFarrell, 2018</xref></bold></italic>). In Xenopus laevis, Rif1 knockdown accelerates early embryonic cell cycles and disrupts RT patterns in retinal progenitor cells <italic><bold>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">MelÃ©ndez GarcÃ­a et al., 2022</xref></bold></italic>). Loss of Rif1 in mice is embryonic lethal with partial penetrance (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Buonomo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chapman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Daxinger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Enervald et al., 2021</xref></bold></italic>). Cell lines derived from Rif1 mutant mice display altered RT profiles, but the extent to which RT is disrupted in the developing embryo has not been shown. Although Rif1 loss causes RT changes in cell lines from a wide range of species, it is unknown whether Rif1 plays roles in the establishment or change of the RT program during vertebrate embryogenesis.</p>
<p>We have developed the zebrafish into a model system to study how modifications in RT coincide with extensive changes in cell cycle and transcription that occur in the developing embryo. The earliest stages of zebrafish development have been extensively studied, so it is possible to collect large numbers of synchronously developing embryos at developmental time points when cells are known to be pluripotent, specified or committed to particular cell fates (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ho and Kimmel, 1993</xref></bold></italic>). As a result, it is feasible to study how changes in RT accompany developmentally regulated changes during cellular differentiation in vertebrates. We previously mapped RT at various stages of early wild-type zebrafish development (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Siefert et al., 2017</xref></bold></italic>). We revealed that a weak RT pattern present at the onset of zygotic transcription becomes progressively more defined as the fish develop. In addition, during gastrulation, large genomic domains switch from early-to-late replication in the embryo. Finally, we observed that changes in epigenetic modifications involved in enhancer activity correlate with developmental changes in RT (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Siefert et al., 2017</xref></bold></italic>).</p>
<p>To reveal the function of Rif1 in gene expression and RT during vertebrate development, we have generated Rif1 mutant zebrafish, and we have performed RNA sequencing and whole-genome RT analyses before the first major wave of zygotic transcription and before and after gastrulation. We found that Rif1 is not essential for embryonic development, but its loss impairs female sex determination. Although the Rif1 mutants had altered RT at each stage, the effects of Rif1 loss on RT were minor compared to changes that naturally occur during development. DNA replication timing was most affected by Rif1 loss after gastrulation, while transcription was most affected early in development. Rif1 was required for normal expression of genes during the first wave of zygotic genome activation. Our results indicate that in zebrafish, Rif1 has distinct roles in DNA replication and transcription control that manifest at different stages of development.</p>

<title>Generation of a Rif1 loss zebrafish model</title>
<p>The zebrafish genome has a single copy of the <italic>rif1</italic> gene on chromosome 9 (GRCz11 22,780,90122,802,172). Similar to other vertebrates, the <italic>zrifl</italic> gene encodes a 2,347 amino acid protein with heat repeats and PP1 phosphatase interaction sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic><bold>Figure 1</bold>A,B</italic></xref>)(<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alavi et al., 2021</xref></italic></bold>). To determine the effects of Rif1 loss-of-function in the zebrafish, we mutated the gene using a transcription activator-like effector nuclease targeting exon 8 (TALEN; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic><bold>Figure 1</bold>A</italic></xref>). Frameshift mutations in exon eight would likely induce nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) of the mutant mRNA. If expressed, the mutant allele would produce a protein ending within the sequence encoding the heat repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic><bold>Figure 1A</bold></italic></xref>). We selected a stable line (<italic>rif1<sup>omf201</sup></italic>) with a seven base-pair frameshift mutation for further analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic><bold>Figure 1</bold></italic>A</xref>).</p>

<title>A TALEN-induced mutation abrogates <italic>rif1</italic> expression in zebrafish.</title>
<p>(A) Schematic illustration of the TALEN mutation in exon 8 of the zebrafish <italic>rif1</italic> gene. The DNA and protein sequences at the TALEN site are shown for the wild-type and a 7 bp deletion mutant. The deletion causes a frame shift and introduces a premature termination codon. The affected amino acids are in red. (B) Diagram of the Rif1 protein. The 7 bp frame shift mutation occurs in the conserved Rif1 N-terminal domain (Rif1-N), causing truncation of the Heat repeats and loss of the nuclear localization signal (NLS) and the PP1 phosphatase SILK and RVSF interaction motifs of the C-terminal domain (CTD). (C) Expression levels of <italic>rif1</italic> measured by quantitative RT-PCR analysis at pre-MBT (2.5 hours), dome (4.3 hours), shield (6 hours) and bud (10 hours) in wild-type (+/+), heterozygous (+/-) and homozygous (-/-) <italic>rif1</italic> zebrafish. Error bars represent standard deviation of the mean. (D) Rif1 and Smc3 protein expression levels were analyzed by immunoblotting at dome and shield in wild-type (+/+) and homozygous (-/-) <italic>rif1</italic> zebrafish.</p>

<p>We first tested whether zygotic <italic>rif1<sup>omf201</sup></italic> mutants developed normally and survived to sexual maturity. Most offspring from <italic>rif1<sup>omf201/+</sup></italic> crosses hatched and began free feeding by five days post-fertilization (dpf; data not shown). Therefore, we generated clutches of <italic>rif1<sup>+/+</sup></italic>, <italic>rif1<sup>omf201/+</sup></italic>, or <italic>rif1<sup>omf201/omf201</sup></italic> embryos spawning F2 mutant and wild-type fish. We then collected embryos of each genotype at 2.5, 4.3, 6, and 10 hours post-fertilization (hpf) and measured <italic>rif1</italic> mRNA by quantitative RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic><bold>Figure 1</bold></italic>C</xref>). These developmental time points span the start of zygotic transcription through gastrulation (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kimmel et al., 1995</xref></bold></italic>). Our data revealed that <italic>rif1</italic> expression in wild-type zebrafish embryos is developmentally regulated, with the highest expression level at 2.5 hpf and then a precipitous drop at all stages after that (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><bold><italic>Figure 1</italic></bold>C</xref>). The significance of this change in mRNA expression for development is unknown, but we also found that Rif1 protein also decreases in the embryo over these stages (data not shown). The expression level of <italic>rif1</italic> mRNA in heterozygous and homozygous mutant fish was lower than wild-types at all stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic><bold>Figure 1</bold></italic>C</xref>). In maternal-zygotic homozygous mutants, <italic>rif1</italic> mRNA was nearly undetectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic><bold>Figure 1</bold></italic>C</xref>). Therefore, we conclude the mutation causes a substantial decrease in <italic>rif1</italic> mRNA.</p>
<p>To determine if Rif1 protein levels were also affected by the mutation, we generated a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the N-terminus of the protein (amino acids 1-150). The antibodyâs antigen included the portion of the truncated protein that the mutant allele would express (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic><bold>Figure 1</bold>A</italic>, B</xref>). We did not detect any residual full-length Rif1 protein on immunoblots of nuclear lysates from maternal-zygotic homozygous mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic><bold>Figure 1</bold></italic>D</xref>). Furthermore, we have not found evidence on the immunoblots that the <italic>rif1<sup>omf201</sup></italic> mutants express truncated Rif1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic><bold>Figure 1</bold></italic>D</xref>). Altogether, these data suggest that the <italic>rif1<sup>omf201</sup></italic> mutation eliminates Rif1 protein expression in the embryo.</p>

<title>Rif1 is not essential in zebrafish but its loss affects early development and sex determination</title>
<p>Given that Rif1 loss in mice caused incompletely penetrant embryonic lethality, we decided to track the development and survival of a large cohort of <italic>rif1<sup>omf201</sup></italic> mutants (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Buonomo et al., 2009</xref></bold></italic>). We raised 766 offspring from <italic>rif1<sup>omf201/+</sup></italic> in-crosses and counted fish of each genotype when they reached sexual maturity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic><bold>Figure 2</bold>A</italic>, B</xref>). Zebrafish sex is determined by poorly defined genetic and environmental factors, so we also counted fish of each gender (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kossack and Draper, 2019</xref></bold></italic>). Although all genotypes were at their expected Mendelian proportions, the number of female heterozygous and homozygous mutants was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic><bold>Figure 2</bold></italic>B, C</xref>). We conclude that although the <italic>rif1<sup>omf201</sup></italic> mutation is not zygotic lethal, it does perturb sex determination.</p>

<p>Our qRT-PCR analysis suggested that zebrafish have substantial <italic>rif1</italic> mRNAat pre-MBT (midblastula transition), before full zygotic genome activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic><bold>Figure 1</bold>A</italic></xref>). Maternally supplied <italic>rif1</italic> mRNA or protein might mask critical functions during early development in zygotic mutants. Therefore, we carefully analyzed the maternal-zygotic <italic>rif1<sup>omf201/omf201</sup></italic> mutants, which lack maternally supplied <italic>rif1</italic>, for any overt morphological defects during development. Mutant fish development was delayed by approximately 1 hour at the end of gastrulation (10 hpf; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><bold><italic>Figure 2</italic></bold>D</xref>). Moreover, <italic>rif1<sup>omf201/omf201</sup></italic> mutants had fewer circulating blood cells relative to wild types at one dpf. Consistent with the blood cell deficiency, <italic>rif1<sup>omf201/omf201</sup></italic> mutants expressed lower levels of hematopoiesis markers <italic>Î²-globin</italic> and<italic>gata-1</italic>; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic><bold>Figure2</bold>E</italic></xref>).

<title>Rif1 loss impairs the establishment of the RT program genome-wide during zebrafish development</title>
<p>Given that late replication and S-phase lengthening requires Rif1 in Drosophila, we hypothesized that RT program establishment and change in vertebrates would also depend on Rif1 (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Seller and OâFarrell, 2018</xref>)</bold></italic>. We tested this hypothesis by profiling RT in wild-type and <italic>rif1<sup>omf201/omf201</sup></italic> mutant zebrafish embryos at multiple stages. We focused on early development because we had previously described changes in RT at multiple time points from the 256-cell through gastrulation in zebrafish (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Siefert et al., 2017</xref></bold></italic>). We showed that the 256-cell and shield stages in zebrafish are when the RT pattern shifts from being relatively weak to defined (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Siefert et al., 2017</xref></bold></italic>). Furthermore, the major wave of zygotic genome activation occurs around the 256-cell stage. Therefore, 256-to-shield is analogous to the stages in Drosophila development when Rif1 promotes the onset of late replication of satellite repeats (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Seller and OâFarrell, 2018</xref></bold></italic>). We also previously observed that the shield and bud stages are when numerous broad RT changes occur (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Siefert et al., 2017</xref></bold></italic>). Therefore, we used whole-genome sequencing to generate RT maps for wild-type and Rif1 mutant zebrafish embryos at 128-cell/pre-MBT (2.25 hours), shield (6 hours), bud (10 hours), and 24 hpf.</p>
<p>We first assessed overall differences in RT between all genotypes and stages with hierarchical clustering on Euclidean distances between samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic><bold>Figure 3</bold>A</italic></xref>). Using this approach, we found that samples clustered first by developmental stage and then genotype, demonstrating that the RT changes that occur during zebrafish development are more significant than those caused by Rif1 loss. The Euclidean distances between wild-type and <italic>rif1<sup>omf201/omf201</sup></italic> samples were minor at the pre-MBT stage and increased progressively through development, reaching their highest levels at 24 hpf. Importantly, biological replicates of the same developmental stage and genotype were most similar, demonstrating the reproducibility of our RT measurements.</p>

<p>The conclusions drawn from the PCA were the same as Euclidean distance analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic><bold>Figure 3</bold></italic>B</xref>). All biological replicates clustered together on the PC2 vs. PC1 plot, showing that the data is reproducible. Principal components 1 and 2 described RT differences caused by developmental stage and genotype, respectively. The first principal component, which explained 50% of the RT variance, separated samples by developmental stage; the second component, which explained 27% of the variance, separated samples by genotype. Therefore, the developmental stage affected RT more strongly than the genotype. There was no difference between wild-type and <italic>rif1<sup>omf201/omf201</sup></italic> samples in the first two principal components at the pre-MBT stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><bold><italic>Figure 3</italic></bold>B</xref>; blue points), supporting that Rif1-loss had little effect on RT early in development. As development proceeded, wild-type and <italic>rif1Â¤<sup>mf201/omf201</sup></italic> mutant samples progressively separated on the second principal component, supporting that RT changes caused by Rif1 loss were more pronounced later in development.</p>
<p>We previously showed that the RT pattern in zebrafish embryos gradually gained the hallmark peak-and-valley RT profile structure as development proceeded (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Siefert et al., 2017</xref></bold></italic>). We quantitatively assessed the structure of the timing program in wild-type and <italic>rif1<sup>omf201/omf201</sup></italic> embryos throughout development by calculating the autocorrelation of timing values along the lengths of the chromosomes at each time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><bold><italic>Figure 3</italic></bold>C</xref>). As we described previously, RT value autocorrelation increased between each stage in wild-type embryos (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Siefert et al., 2017</xref></bold></italic>). The autocorrelation of <italic>rif1<sup>omf201/omf201</sup></italic> RT values also increased during development, but the change lagged behind wildtype. For example, the autocorrelation of <italic>rif1<sup>omf201/omf201</sup></italic> RT values at the bud stage was like that of wild-type at shield. The autocorrelation analysis indicated that Rif1 loss delayed the gradual gain in RT profile structure during development.</p>
<p>Broad differences in RT were visually evident from plots of normalized (log2 S/G1) RT values at all stages after the MBT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic><bold>Figure 3</bold></italic>D</xref>). At the 128-cell stage (before the MBT), both <italic>rif1<sup>omf201/omf201</sup></italic> and wild-type RT profiles were flat compared to those at later stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic><bold>Figure 3</bold></italic>D</xref>). This was consistent with replication origin firing synchrony at the 128-cell stage in both the wild-type and <italic>rif1</italic> mutants. After the 128-cell stage, the RT profiles of <italic>rif1<sup>omf201/omf201</sup></italic> and wild-type embryos developed peak-and-valley structures, but the <italic>rif1<sup>omf201/omf201</sup></italic> profiles were less defined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic><bold>Figure 3</bold></italic>D</xref>; compare black lines to colored lines). At each stage after 128-cell, the amplitudes of peaks and valleys appeared lower in the <italic>rif1<sup>omf201/omf201</sup></italic> profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic><bold>Figure 3</bold></italic>D</xref>). Overall, the RT values (log2 S/G1) in <italic>rif1<sup>omf201/omf201</sup></italic> mutants at shield, bud, or 24 hpf were less dispersed from the median than the RT values of wild-type embryos at the same stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic><bold>Figure 3</bold></italic>E</xref>). Altogether our data show that Rif1 sharpens the genome-wide RT profile during zebrafish development.</p>

<title>Rif1 is not required for major changes in RT that occur during zebrafish development</title>
<p>We previously identified two significant changes in RT that occur during early zebrafish development (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Siefert et al., 2017</xref></bold></italic>). First, genomic domains spanning hundreds of kilobases underwent late-to-early changes in RT. Both coincided with H3K27 acetylation or DNA demethylation at putative enhancers within the domains. Second, ~40 million base-pairs of zebrafish chromosome 4q and a large chromosomal domain on chromosome 22 (5,749,848-10,129,684) both underwent early-to-late RT switches during gastrulation. The mechanisms underlying those changes are unknown.</p>
<p>To show whether RT changes that coincide with enhancer activation require Rif1, we calculated RT values at putative enhancers that become acetylated during early zebrafish development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic><bold>Figure 4A</bold></italic>-B</xref>) (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bogdanovic et al., 2012</xref></bold></italic>). The majority (1,768/2,498) of differentially acetylated regions (DARs) that become acetylated between 4.3â24 hpf changed to earlier replicating between the shield (6 hpf) and 24 hpf stages in both wild-type and <italic>rif1<sup>omf201/omf201</sup></italic> mutant embryos. Moreover, the shield-to-24 hpf changes in RT for wild-type and <italic>rif1<sup>omf201/omf201</sup></italic> DARs were strongly correlated (rs=0.76, p&lt;2.2e-16; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><bold><italic>Figure 4</italic></bold>A</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that Rif1-loss does not generally affect the changes in RT that coincide with enhancer activation during early zebrafish development.</p>

<p>To determine whether the early-to-late switches in RT that occur on chromosomes 4 and 22 require Rif1, we calculated RT values for Chr4q or Chr22:5,749,848-10,129,684 for both wild-type and <italic>rif1<sup>omf201/omf201</sup></italic> embryos at 128-cell, shield, bud, and 24 hpf stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic><bold>Figure 4</bold></italic>C-F</xref>). Unexpectedly, Chr4q was replicated earlier during S-phase in the <italic>rif1<sup>omf201/omf201</sup></italic> embryos than in wild-type embryos at the 128-cell stage, but that difference was minor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><bold><italic>Figure 4</italic></bold>C, D</xref>). As we previously described, early-to-late RT switches on Chr4q (ANOVA p=7.27e-05) and Chr22 (ANOVA p=7.27e-05) occurred between the shield and 24 hpf stages in wild-type embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic><bold>Figure 4</bold></italic>C-E</xref>). The early-to-late switches at Chr4q (ANOVA p=0.803) and Chr22 (ANOVA p=0.803) also occurred in the <italic>rif1<sup>omf201/omf201</sup></italic> mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic><bold>Figure 4</bold></italic>C-E</xref>). Although both Chr4q and Chr22:5,749,848-10,129,684 underwent early-to-late switches in the <italic>rif1<sup>omf201/omf201</sup></italic> mutant embryos, both were earlier replicating in the mutant compared to wild-types at 24 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic><bold>Figure 4</bold></italic>C-F</xref>). These differences might indicate that those specific timing switches were delayed or incomplete, or it could be due to the genome-wide flattening of the RT profiles. Indeed, when we compared all wild-type and <italic>rif1<sup>omf201/omf201</sup></italic> mutant RT values at 24 hpf, we observed that most late-replicating regions were earlier replicating in <italic>rif1<sup>omf201/omf201</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic><bold>Figure 3</bold></italic>D, E</xref>). These data have led us to conclude that although Rif1 promotes the establishment of the RT profile genome-wide, it does not generally affect specific RT switches during zebrafish development.</p>

<p>We determined the overall effects of Rif1 loss on the embryonic transcriptome by analyzing the RNAseq data using principle component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering based on Euclidean distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic><bold>Figure 5</bold>A</italic>, B</xref>). We found that biological replicates were highly similar, and as expected, the transcriptome changed significantly between developmental stages. Rif1 loss impacted the transcriptome at every stage evaluated but not all stages were equally affected, with the most significant effects on gene expression at the dome and shield stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><bold><italic>Figure 5</italic></bold>B</xref>). From this point forward, we will refer to differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with higher or lower expression in the maternal-zygotic <italic>rif1<sup>omf201/omf201</sup></italic> mutants as Up-DEGs or Down-DEGs, respectively (adjusted Wald test p value &lt; 0.05 and Log2-fold change &gt; 0.5 or &lt; â0.5). The number of Up-DEGs peaked at the dome stage, while the number of Down-DEGs peaked at the shield stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic><bold>Figure 5</bold></italic>C-D</xref>).</p>
<p>Zebrafish contribute most zygotic transcripts maternally, so the differences in transcript abundance in the <italic>rif1<sup>om</sup>f<sup>201/om</sup>f<sup>201</sup></italic> mutants could be due to changes in the supply or stability of maternal mRNA (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Harvey et al., 2013</xref></bold></italic>).

Therefore, the differential expression of mRNAs at later stages in the <italic>rif1<sup>om</sup>f<sup>201/om</sup>f<sup>201</sup></italic> mutants is not due to differential maternal contribution.</p>

<title>Rif1 broadly suppresses transcription during Zygotic Genome Activation</title>
<p>To learn more about the genes affected by Rif1 loss, we looked at when zebrafish embryos normally express the DEGs. White et al. profiled the zebrafish transcriptome at 18 developmental time points (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">White et al., 2017</xref></bold></italic>). We used this data set to categorize dome DEGs based on when their peak expression occurs in wild-type embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic><bold>Figure 6</bold></italic>A-D</xref>). We focused on dome DEGs because they were the most abundant. Dome Up-DEGs are enriched in the Blastula/Gastrula expression cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic><bold>Figure 6</bold>A</italic>, C</xref>). Since mRNAs that peak at the Blastula and Gastrula stages are likely to be transcribed during the major wave of zygotic genome activation at the MBT, our data suggests Rif1 loss stimulates the transcription of mRNAs at the first major wave of Zygotic Genome Activation (ZGA). Dome Down-DEGs are enriched in the pre-ZGA cluster, which suggests that Rif1 loss also enhances the destruction of maternal mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic><bold>Figure 6</bold></italic>B, D</xref>). The degradation of many maternal mRNAs in zebrafish is triggered by transcription of the <italic>mir-430</italic> microRNA cluster before the major wave of zygotic transcription (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Giraldez et al., 2006</xref></bold></italic>).</p>

<p>Using complementary approaches, Lee et al. and Heyn et al. defined âfirst waveâ genes that are transcribed immediately upon zygotic genome activation (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Heyn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lee et al., 2013</xref></bold></italic>). We used gene set enrichment analysis to determine the extent to which the <italic>rif1<sup>omf201/omf201</sup></italic> mutants overexpress first-wave genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic><bold>Figure 6</bold></italic>G</xref>). At the dome stage, 272 out of 383 first wave genes had a Log2FC &gt; 0 in mutants compared to wild-types. Furthermore, the first wave gene sets were located towards the top of the list of all genes ranked by the dome stage Log2FC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic><bold>Figure 4</bold>G</italic></xref>). Our data indicate that Rif1 loss generally increases the transcription of genes at the ZGA, but by including genes with substantial maternal contribution in our analysis, we might have underestimated that effect. Therefore, we used additional gene sets identified by Harvey et al. as being strictly zygotic or maternal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic><bold>Figure 6</bold></italic>H</xref>) (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Harvey et al., 2013</xref></bold></italic>). Like the âfirst waveâ genes, the majority of genes in the zygotic set were expressed at higher levels (72/98 Log2FC <italic>&gt;</italic> 0) in mutant embryos at the dome stage compared to wild-type, and most of the zygotic genes were towards the top of the list of genes ranked by dome Log2FC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic><bold>Figure 6</bold></italic>H</xref> top). In contrast, genes in the maternal set were often down in the mutants at dome and were found towards the bottom of the ranked gene list (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic><bold>Figure 6</bold></italic>H</xref> bottom). Altogether our data suggest that Rif1 loss enhances the destruction of maternal mRNAs and stimulates the expression of genes during zygotic genome activation.</p>
<p>To directly assess transcription during ZGA, we labeled nascent mRNAs in early embryos with 4-Thiouridine(S4U) (<italic><bold>Weumann et al., 2019</bold></italic>). By injecting the label into one-cell stage embryos we were able to identify mRNAs synthesized by the pre-MBT (2.5 hours) or dome (4.3 hours) stages. The incorporated label was mapped to mRNAs using thiol(SH)-linked alkylation for metabolic sequencing of RNA (SLAM-seq). SLAM-seq introduces T-to-C conversions at the sites of the incorporated S4U. Thus, each geneâs percentage of T-to-C conversions indicates the amount of its mRNA synthesized during the labeling period (zygotic) relative to pre-existing mRNA(maternal).</p>
<p>At the pre-MBT stage, there was very little difference in T-to-C conversion percentages between wild-type and <italic>rif1<sup>omf201/omf201</sup></italic> mutant embryos, and there were only 102 differentially labeled genes (DLGs) at preMBT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic><bold>Figure 7</bold></italic>A-C</xref>; fold-change in T-to-C conversion &gt; 1.5 and beta-binomial test FDR <italic>&gt;</italic> 0.1). Therefore, we conclude that zygotic genome activation is not occurring earlier than the MBT for most genes in the <italic>rif1<sup>omf201/omf201</sup></italic> mutants. In contrast, there were 1,872 DLGs with increased labeling in mutants at dome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic><bold>Figure 7</bold></italic>D, E</xref>; fold-change in T-to-C conversion &gt; 1.5 and beta-binomial test FDR <italic>&gt;</italic> 0.1). Furthermore, the T-to-C conversion rates at the dome stage were higher in the <italic>rif1<sup>omf201/omf201</sup></italic> mutants for all gene categories analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic><bold>Figure 7</bold></italic>F</xref>). The differences in T-to-C conversion were greatest for the genes we previously identified as being overexpressed in the mutants (256-Cell and dome Up-DEGs) and for the genes known to be transcribed during ZGA (First Wave and Zygotic). Notably, we detected a significant difference in mean T-to-C conversion calculated for all labeled genes. Overall, these data demonstrate that Rif1 has pervasive effects on transcription during zygotic genome activation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Previous studies of Rif1 in vertebrates have mainly been limited to cell culture models and have not addressed how its loss impacts RT establishment and change in the early embryo. We have developed a zebrafish model to study the developmental effects of Rif1 loss. Using this model, we have determined the impacts of Rif1 knockout on zebrafish embryonic development and survival, RT, and gene expression.</p>
<p>Our work adds to our understanding of the importance of Rif1 for vertebrate development. The extent to which Rif1 is essential for embryogenesis has been unclear. In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, Rif1 knockdown by RNA interference caused embryonic lethality, but its knockout by CRISPR-Cas9 caused only mild effects on hatching <italic>rates</italic>(<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Armstrong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Seller and OâFarrell, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sreesankar et al., 2015</xref></bold></italic>). Rif1 knockout phenotypes in mice depend on genetic background and sex. Rif1 is essential in female mice, which die between the blastula and early gastrula <italic>stages</italic>(<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Enervald et al., 2021</xref></bold></italic>). Male mice are less affected by Rif1 loss. Although most Rif1 mutant male mice die around mid-gestation, a fraction survives to sexual maturity (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Buonomo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chapman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Daxinger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Enervald et al., 2021</xref></bold></italic>). We observed only mild <italic>rif1</italic> phenotypes during em-bryonic development. Rif1 loss only slightly delayed epiboly completion. The reason for that delay is unknown, but it may be due to the transcriptional effects of Rif1 loss at the ZGA. The <italic>rif1</italic> mutants also showed a deficiency in primitive hematopoiesis. The first wave of hematopoiesis is not essential for zebrafish development, as it is in mice. Thus, defects in hematopoiesis could possibly contribute to the poor survival of Rif1 mutant mice.</p>
<p>The most evident phenotype in the <italic>rif1</italic> mutant zebrafish is the substantial reduction in the number of females. It is tempting to speculate that this phenotype is related to female-specific lethality in mice, but we suspect the underlying causes differ. In part, Rif1 mutant female mice die due to an X chromosome inactivation defect, but zebrafish lack sex chromosomes (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Enervald et al., 2021</xref></bold></italic>). Furthermore, since we showed that expected numbers of <italic>rif1</italic> mutant fish survive to sexual maturity, the skew in gender ratio must be due to the preferential development of male fish rather than female lethality. A reduction in the proliferation or survival of primordial germ cells (PGCs) causes transdifferentiation of zebrafish to males (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Tzung et al., 2015</xref></bold></italic>). To understand how Rif1 promotes female development, we must determine whether its loss affects PGC proliferation. Intriguingly, mouse PGCs exhibit increased replication-transcription conflicts and are sensitive to mutations in Fanconi anemia pathway genes required for replication stress survival (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Luo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Yang et al., 2022</xref></bold></italic>). Zebrafish PGCs exhibit high levels of intergenic transcription, which suggests that they may also have increased replication-transcription conflicts (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Redl et al., 2021</xref></bold></italic>). Furthermore, mutations in the Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway disrupt female zebrafish development (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Ramanagoudr-Bhojappa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">RodrÃ­guez-MarÃ­ et al., 2010</xref></bold></italic>). Therefore, the female development defect in the Rif1 mutant zebrafish could be due to deregulated replication fork initiation or impaired replication fork stability in PGCs.</p>
<p>Studies with flies and mammalian cells have shown situations where Rif1 becomes less critical for RT once constitutive heterochromatin forms. For example, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Rif1 delays the replication of specific satellite repeats before H3K9me3 and HP1a associate with them, but once constitutive heterochromatin forms, Rif1 is unnecessary (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Seller and OâFarrell, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yuan and OâFarrell, 2016</xref>)</bold></italic>. In human HCT116 cells, late replication of genomic domains with high levels of the heterochromatin mark H3K9me3 does not depend on Rif1 (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Klein et al., 2021</xref></bold></italic>). In contrast, Rif1 knockout nearly completely ablates the RT pattern in human embryonic stem cells, which have relatively little constitutive heterochromatin (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hawkins et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Klein et al., 2021</xref></bold></italic>). Pre-gastrula zebrafish embryos express high levels of Rif1 and substantially lack constitutive heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic><bold>Figure 1</bold>C</italic></xref> and (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Laue et al., 2019</xref></bold></italic>)). Thus, we were surprised that Rif1 loss had relatively little effect on RT in early embryos. Instead, we found that RT differences were more pronounced later in development. Understanding this paradox will likely reveal mechanisms that control Rif1 activity.</p>
<p>Although the effects of Rif1 loss on RT increased as zebrafish development proceeded, the significant developmental changes that shaped the RT profile of late-stage embryos were not affected. For example, <italic>rif1</italic> was not required for the early-to-late timing switches that occur over large segments of chromosomes 4 and 22 during gastrulation, nor was it required for the widespread late-to-early switches that coincided with enhancer activation. Much of the variance in RT between wild-type and mutant embryos was due to a general flattening of the timing profiles, and Rif1 loss did not disrupt the overall peak and valley profile structure. Therefore, our data suggest that instead of causing developmental RT switches in zebrafish, Rif1 sharpens RT caused by other unknown determinants.</p>
<p>If Rif1 is not required, what drives developmental changes in RT? Zebrafish embryos establish constitutive heterochromatin by the start of gastrulation, so the early-to-late RT switches that occur during and after that stage might be due to further maturation of heterochromatin (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Laue et al., 2019</xref>)</bold></italic>. The activation of enhancers might drive late-to-early RT changes throughout the zebrafish genome. Early replicating control elements (ERCEs), which have active epigenetic marks associated with enhancers, cause early replication of large domains in the mouse genome (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Sima et al., 2019</xref></bold></italic>). More work is needed to determine whether the formation of constitutive heterochromatin and activation of ERCEs drive developmental changes in RT in zebrafish.</p>
<p>We were particularly interested in whether RT changes in the embryo would lead to transcriptional changes. A long-standing hypothesis is that the RT of a gene can affect its transcriptional competence (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gottesfeld and Bloomer, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lande-Diner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Zhang et al., 2002</xref></bold></italic>). Recently, Klein et al. used human cell lines in which Rif1 could be conditionally depleted to show that its loss caused widespread and coordinated RT and epigenomic changes (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Klein et al., 2021</xref></bold></italic>). Furthermore, the epigenomic alterations caused by Rif1 loss were often associated with gene expression changes (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Klein et al., 2021</xref></bold></italic>). Although this work strongly supports the hypothesis that RT maintains the epigenome, the effects of Rif1 loss in a developing embryo where the RT program and the epigenome are established have not been examined. We used whole-genome RT and RNAseq analysis to determine whether Rif1 loss caused RT changes that led to deregulated gene expression. Unexpectedly, we found that when Rif1 had the most significant effect on RT during later development, there were few changes in mRNA levels. One limitation of the current work was that we did not directly measure alterations in the epigenome, which may have occurred without transcriptional changes. A second limitation was that we measured RT and gene expression for all cells in the embryo in bulk. Consequently, we were unable to detect cell-to-cell variability in either RT or gene expression. Indeed, RT deregulation could cause epigenetic variability. Nonetheless, our data show that RT changes caused by Rif1 loss do not substantially change overall gene expression later in development.</p>
<p>The most pronounced effects of Rif1 loss on transcription were during the earliest stages of development. We previously showed that RT patterns are detected around the MBT in zebrafish embryos, but those patterns are relatively weak compared to later development. In this work, we showed that there was almost no detectable RT pattern in wild-type or Rif1 mutants before the ZGA. Despite the lack of RT patterns, Rif1 loss affected the first major wave of transcription. Most genes affected by Rif1 loss at that stage increased slightly, but a significant fraction of all genes transcribed at the ZGA were upregulated. Thus, Rif1 loss had a strong overall effect on transcription at the ZGA.</p>
<p>Notably, the role for Rif1 in regulating ZGA transcription is evolutionarily conserved. As we show here for zebrafish, mouse pluripotent cells express Rif1 at high levels, and Rif1 expression decreases during cellular differentiation (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adams and McLaren, 2004</xref></bold></italic>). Multiple groups have reported that Rif1 loss in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) causes increased expression of twocell (2C) zygote-specific genes (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Li et al., 2022</xref>, 2017b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Yoshizawa-Sugata et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Zhang et al., 2022</xref></bold></italic>). Given that ZGA occurs through different transcription factors in zebrafish and mice, it is likely that Rif1 affects genes expressed at the ZGA in both species by regulating a common fundamental process rather than the activities of specific transcription factors. mESCs in the 2C state have increased histone marks associated with active transcription, and Rif1 loss is sufficient to cause these chromatin changes (<italic><bold>Li et al., 2017a; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Yoshizawa-Sugata et al., 2021</xref></bold></italic>). Mouse Rif1 co-immunoprecipitates with multiple repressive histone methyltransferases and with the non-canonical polycomb repressive complex PRC1.6, and Rif1 promotes the recruitment of chromatin regulators to several 2C genes in mESCs (<italic><bold>Li et al., 2017a</bold></italic>). We do not know how Rif1 affects the epigenome in the early zebrafish, and this is an important goal for future research. Given the striking similarity in Rif1 function in early zebrafish and mouse embryos, we anticipate the role of Rif1 in regulating transcription in the early embryo will be broadly conserved in vertebrates.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have described multiple phenotypic consequences of Rif1 loss in zebrafish. We found that Rif1 undergoes a functional switch during zebrafish development. When it is highly abundant during early development, Rif1 regulates transcription but does not affect RT. Later in development, Rif1 is important for RT but does not substantially affect gene expression. The zebrafish will be useful for understanding how Rif1 switches between these functional modes at different stages of development. Furthermore, we have identified a new function for Rif1 in sex determination. Thus, the <italic>rif1</italic> mutant zebrafish described here will serve as a valuable model for understanding PGC biology and sex determination.</p>

<p>Zebrafish were spawned as described previously (<italic><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Siefert et al., 2018</xref></bold></italic>). For SlamSeq, 2-cell embryos were injected with 50 pmoles of 4-Thiouridine (S4U). Embryos were incubated at 28.5Â°C. Before collection, clutches were visually inspected to ensure that all embryos were developing synchronously. Unfertilized or morphologically abnormal embryos were removed before collection.

Pools of <italic>&gt;</italic>100 whole embryos at preMBT, dome, or shield stage were treated as S-phase samples, since a high percentage cells at these stages are in S phase.

Whole genome sequencing reads were trimmed with fastp, aligned to the zebrafish genome (GRCz11) using BWA-MEM, and duplicate reads were marked with Picard MarkDuplicates. Properly-paired and non-duplicated reads with MapQ scores of at least 20 were filtered with Bamtools. Alignments were read into GenomicRanges for downstream analysis in R.

<p>This paper reports on the role of RIF1 during early stages of zebrafish embryonic development, with the <bold>important</bold> finding that Rif1 seems to be required predominantly to establish the correct embryonic transcriptional program first, followed by a switch to a more replication-timing centered later function. The evidence is <bold>convincing</bold>, with the major strength being the elegant system and the possibility to also address the problem of the maternal pool of Rif1. A weakness is that the study remains descriptive and the presentation slightly disconnected, with limited mechanistic insight. The work will be of interest for researchers both in the transcription and the replication field, especially for scientists investigating the interplay between the two processes.</p>

<p>In this manuscript authors examined the effect of rif1 knockout on replication timing and transcription in early embryos of zebrafish. Contrary to the expectation, genome-wide replication timing domains did not significantly change upon Rif1 knockout, although the replication timing became less dynamic in the mutant, meaning the entire genomes are replicated toward the mid S. In contrast, transcriptional profiles change by rif1 mutation throughout the embryo stage. These effects were more predominantly observed after gastrulation at the early stages of zebrafish development.</p>
<p>The results presented in this manuscript provide new information on the effects of rif1 mutation on early zebrafish development, although the underlying mechanism has not been explored. The information is useful for researchers in the field of early development, with specific focus on replication and transcription regulation.</p>
<p>The genome wide analyses of replication timing has been conducted and analyzed properly. The transcriptional analyses are conducted by RNA-seq and SLAM-seq (determining the nascent mRNA), and the results convincingly show the overall transcriptional patterns at different developmental stages.</p>
<p>This work shows that Rif1 regulates replication timing and transcription in zebrafish embryos, while the extents of the effects vary during the developmental process. Although the data convincingly illustrate the whole picture of Rif1 KO on replication and transcription during zebrafish development, the mechanistic insight is missing. Especially, how Rif1 may or may not coordinately regulate replication and transcription during the zebrafish development has not been addressed.</p>

<p>This study by Masser et al. analyzes global replication timing and gene expression in rif-1 null zebrafish. This work is an extension of their previous report on the normal replication timing pattern during wild-type zebrafish development. The major valuable finding here is that Rif1 is not essential for viability in zebrafish, and - counter to expectation from studies in cultured cells and other species - late replication does not strongly depend on Rif1. Instead, the data suggest that Rif1 subtly sharpens replication timing pattern during normal development rather than function generally to delay replication timing. In the absence of Rif1, the normal pattern establishment is somewhat delayed. The authors also document some changes in expression during development with more genes being repressed by Rif1 than activated at some early stages.</p>
<p>The study and analysis are generally rigorous, and the conclusions are supported by convincing data. The manuscript is well written, though there are aspects of the presentation that could be improved for a broader scientific audience. Given the strong link between replication timing and cell type/development, studying timing in a whole developing organism is important. The experimental approach is technically challenging, particularly the bioinformatic analysis. The scientific advance here is largely confined to documenting the timing of Rif1-affected transcription, the unanticipated effect of the rif1 deletion on replication timing and on sex determination, though the latter is not explored. The work is descriptive and feels like two relatively unconnected studies, transcription and replication plus a small bit of development, and the difference in timing of the transcription phenotypes and replication phenotypes suggests they may be very distinct Rif1 roles. There isn't a lot of new insight into the mechanism of how Rif1 affects either replication timing or gene expression. As such, the overall study is an useful set of findings and detailed data for future work, but it doesn't make a big step forward in understanding the role of Rif1 or the biological processes it affects.</p>
<p>Weaknesses worth addressing include the following:</p>
<p>1. Loss of Rif1 did not affect viability, but it did strongly influence sex determination, resulting in a lower population of females. This effect is the strongest organismal phenotype, but the study provides no explanation for the loss of females from the data gathered here.</p>
<p>
2. The approach to distinguish nascent zygotically expressed mRNAs from maternal mRNAs is a strength. Are the differentially expressed genes related at all to regions of the genome whose replication timing is most affected? Are any of them related to the sex determination or developmental phenotypes?</p>

<p>Using the zebrafish model system, this manuscript assessed the roles of Rif1 protein in replication timing control and transcription during early development, and successfully demonstrated the differential impact of Rif1 protein in replication timing control and transcription. Moreover, the comprehensive assessments of the impacts of mutating Rif1 on animal development (including animal survival and sexual development) were assessed. Although there are works that examined Rif1's implications in replication timing and transcription separately, this work is unique in assessing all these points at once.</p>
<p>The strength of this manuscript is the genomic analyses of replication timing and transcription being combined in a single model system. Consequently, this manuscript clearly demonstrates the differential impact of Rif1 in these processes during zebrafish development.</p>
<p>The weakness of this manuscript is, as the authors comment in the Discussion, analyses of replication timing and transcription were performed using bulk embryos. There is a possibility that tissue-specific changes could have been masked. Tissue-specific or single-cell analysis in the future will fill the gap in the knowledge.</p>
<p>Some of the findings presented in this manuscript are consistent with previous findings using different models such as Drosophila and mice, whereas other findings do not necessarily agree. I hope further studies will reveal more clearly what is common in these systems, and what is different.</p>
<p>Also, the suggestion that the Rif1 protein may be implicated in a function similar to Fanconi-Anemia genes/proteins is very intriguing.</p>
<p>Overall, the data presented in this manuscript sufficiently justify the authors' claims. Moreover, this manuscript provides interesting insights into Rif1's function, as well as how development could be controlled.</p>
