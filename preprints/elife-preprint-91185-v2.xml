<title>Abstract</title><p>Structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) complexes share conserved structures and serve a common role in maintaining chromosome architecture. In the bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, the SMC complex MukBEF is necessary for rapid growth and the accurate segregation and positioning of the chromosome, although the specific molecular mechanisms involved are still unknown. Here we used a number of <italic>in vivo</italic> assays to reveal how MukBEF controls chromosome conformation and how the MatP/<italic>matS</italic> system prevents MukBEF activity. Our results indicate that the loading of MukBEF occurs preferentially on newly replicated DNA, at multiple loci on the chromosome where it can promote long-range contacts in <italic>cis</italic> even though MukBEF can promote long-range contacts in the absence of replication. Using HiC and ChIP-seq analyses in strains with rearranged chromosomes, the prevention of MukBEF activity increases with the number of <italic>matS</italic> sites and this effect likely results from the unloading of MukBEF by MatP. Altogether, our results reveal how MukBEF operates to control chromosome folding and segregation in E. coli.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>SMC complexes play key roles in many processes involved in chromosome management, from genome maintenance, interphase chromatin organization, sister chromatids alignment, chromosome folding and condensing, to DNA recombination at specific stages of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Yatskevich et al., 2019</xref>). A general model for SMC complex activity relies on their properties to bridge DNA elements and by doing so build DNA loops in <italic>cis</italic> and hold together the sister chromatids in <italic>trans</italic>; to do that, they bind DNA and processively extrude a DNA loop in a ATPase-driven loop extrusion, thereby compacting and organizing DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Davidson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ganji et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kong et al., 2020</xref>). Yet many molecular features that determine the activity of the various SMC complexes are still unclear and it is not known whether they work using the same basal mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bürmann et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Davidson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Pradhan et al., 2022</xref>). For example, it is not yet clear whether i) the activity of SMC complexes is mediated by a single complex or if it involves cooperation between several complexes that organize into dimers or even oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Badrinarayanan et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hassler et al., 2018</xref>), ii) the DNA extrusion involves a topological or nontopological mechanism, i.e. does the DNA pass through the SMC ring topologically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bürmann et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Davidson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Pradhan et al., 2022</xref>), iii) the activity of SMC complexes relies on the folding capacities of the SMC coiled-coil arms facilitating large-scale conformational changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bürmann et al., 2019</xref>), and iv) multiple complexes that encounter one another on the same DNA in living cells bypass each other or collide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anchimiuk et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brandão et al., 2021</xref>). Cohesin and Condensin are the most characterized SMC complexes found in many eukaryotes. In bacteria, three different forms of SMC-like complexes defined as bacterial condensins have been identified, Smc-ScpAB, MukBEF, MksBEF; they are considered functionally related to condensins as they are thought to compact chromosomes and facilitate the segregation of sister chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lioy et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Marbouty et al., 2015</xref>). In bacteria, Smc-ScpAB represents the most highly conserved complex, while MukBEF and MksBEF represent diverged SMC complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cobbe and Heck, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Yoshinaga and Inagaki, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Eukaryotic and prokaryotic SMC complexes are composed of at least 5 subunits: two Smc subunits, a kleisin subunit, and two additional subunits (referred to as kite and hawk subunits, depending on the type of SMC complex). Smc proteins associate with the kleisin protein to form a ring-shaped ATPase assembly. Additional subunits associate with this tripartite complex: the “Kite” family associates with bacterial and archaeal SMC complexes and also with the eukaryotic SMC5/6 complex while the “Hawk” family interacts with condensin and cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Yatskevich et al., 2019</xref>). These additional subunits are thought to be required for the activity and to differentiate functions; for example, while condensin I and II share the same pair of Smc proteins, the difference in the subunit composition specifies their spatiotemporal dynamics and functional contributions to mitotic chromosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hirota et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kong et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>SMC function and dynamics on DNA requires additional auxiliary proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baxter et al., 2019</xref>). More specifically, its loading on DNA and unloading of the DNA may depend on specific factors, at specific sites. For example, in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, the segregation ParB protein bound to <italic>parS</italic> site directly bind the Smc subunit; the ParB clamp presumably present DNA to the SMC complex to initiate DNA loop extrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gruber and Errington, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Sullivan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wang et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">2017</xref>). Upon translocation, the site-specific recombinase XerD bound to its binding site unloads SMC complexes in the terminus region of the chromosome and this process is thought to involve specific interactions between the different components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Karaboja et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>MukBEF was the first SMC complex identified. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, MukBEF is thought to be required for chromosome segregation as <italic>muk</italic> mutants present many anucleate cells or mis-segregated chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Niki et al., 1991</xref>). How MukBEF may promote chromosome segregation and organization has remained elusive for a long time and is still not clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Nolivos and Sherratt, 2014</xref>). The effect of the MukBEF complex in <italic>E. coli</italic> appears to be radically different from that of SMC in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> or other bacteria. Instead of aligning the chromosome arms from a centromere-like locus, MukBEF promotes DNA contacts in the megabase range within each replication arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lioy et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">2020</xref>). MukBEF promotes long range interactions along the chromosome except in the 800-kb long terminal domain (Ter) where MatP prevents its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lioy et al., 2018</xref>). Under conditions of increased chromosome occupancy of MukBEF, the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome appears to be organized as a series of loops around a thin (&lt;130 nm) MukBEF axial core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Mäkelä and Sherratt, 2020</xref>). Whether MukBEF is loaded at a particular locus is still an open question. The complete atomic structure of MukBEF in complex with MatP and DNA has been determined by electron cryomicroscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bürmann et al., 2021</xref>); it contains also the MukBEF binding partner AcpP protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Prince et al., 2021</xref>). It revealed that the complex binds two distinct DNA double helices reminiscent of the arms of an extruded loop, MatP- bound DNA threads through the MukBEF ring, while the second DNA is clamped by MukF, MukE, and the MukB ATPase heads. The presence of MatP in the complex together with its ability to prevent MukBEF activity prompted authors to propose that MatP might be an unloader of MukBEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bürmann et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Here we have performed a number of experiments using different <italic>in vivo</italic> approaches to further characterize how MukBEF contributes to chromosome management in <italic>E. coli</italic>. We have used ChIP-seq and Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C-seq and HiC) experiments to study how MukBEF is loaded on the chromosome and promotes long range DNA contacts. By using strains with various chromosome configurations obtained by programmed genetic rearrangements, we have explored how MukBEF activity proceeds along the chromosome and how MatP bound to <italic>matS</italic> sites prevents its activity. Our results together with comparative genomics analyses allow us to address the biological significance of multiple <italic>matS</italic> sites in the Ter region of chromosomes in Enterobacteria and of the absence of MukBEF activity.</p>

<title>MukBEF activity does not initiate at a single locus</title>
<p>In order to characterize how MukBEF interacts with the chromosome and initiate its activity of long-range contacts, it was necessary to set-up a system to reveal using HiC the appearance and spread of long-range contacts along the chromosome upon MukBEF synthesis. The rationale was based on previous findings showing that long-range DNA contacts within replication arms, outside Ter, result from MukBEF activity. If MukBEF loads at a specific locus as observed for Smc-ScpAB at <italic>parS</italic> sites, we would expect to detect the appearance and spreading of long-range contacts from this site upon MukBEF synthesis. By contrast, if MukBEF loads stochastically or at multiple loci on the chromosome, long-range contacts should occur at multiple sites.</p>
<p>The analysis of MukBEF activity required an efficient system to control its activity. To conditionally synthesize MukBEF, the <italic>mukBEF</italic> operon was cloned onto a medium-copy number plasmid under control of a p<italic>Lac</italic> promoter and introduced in a <italic>mukF</italic> mutant. In the absence of inducer, as observed for a <italic>mukF</italic> mutant, no growth was detected at 37°C and the amount of anucleated cells at 22°C was similar to that of the <italic>mukF</italic> mutant (13% versus 15%). Induced expression of <italic>mukBEF</italic> functionally complemented the absence of MukF, restoring growth at 37°C in LB (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) and accurately segregating the chromosome at 22°C, as evidenced by the low amount of anucleate cells (less than 2%) observed in the presence of the inducer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine how MukBEF activity initiates in the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome, we induced the expression of <italic>mukBEF</italic> and monitored the appearance of long-range DNA contacts at different times after induction. MukBEF synthesis was monitored by western blot (Figure 1-figure supplement 1A, D). HiC contact maps were established 20 min, 40 min and 2 hours after induction and compared to that obtained in the absence of induction (Figure 1C – figure supplement 1B, C): long-range DNA contacts were hardly visible after 20 min (Figure 1C -figure supplement 1A), were readily observed after 40 min and reached after 2 hours a level similar to that observed in wild-type strains (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">figure supplement 1C</xref>). The ratio of normalized contact maps of the induced strain at different time points to the non-induced strain allowed to visualize the presence of long-range contacts all over the chromosome except in Ter (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>The range of DNA contacts along the chromosome was quantified by measuring the width of the diagonal perpendicular to it, using an adapted version of the quantification method developed before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Wang et al., 2017</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lioy et al., 2020</xref>). The plot obtained (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>) allows to estimate the effect of MukBEF activity on all loci of the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome. This confirmed the increase in the range of contacts following induction of MukBEF predicted from the ratio of normalized contact maps, with 40 minutes necessary to observe a significant effect and 2 hours to reach the maximum range of contact, as observed in the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lioy et al., 2020</xref>) (Figure1-Figure supplement 1). As expected, Ter region was not affected by the induction of MukBEF because of the presence of MatP bound to <italic>matS</italic> sites.</p>
<p>Altogether, the results indicate that the increase of contacts does not originate from a specific position on the chromosome but rather appears from numerous sites, suggesting that the activity of MukBEF does not initiate at a single locus but rather from multiple loci along the chromosome.</p>

<title>MukBEF activity initiates in different regions of the E. coli genome</title>
<p>The MatP/<italic>matS</italic> system has been shown to prevent MukBEF activity in Ter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lioy et al. 2018</xref>). We took advantage of this property to unravel mechanistic aspects of MukBEF activity and address the following issues: could MukBEF interacts with a region flanked by different Ter segments and could MukBEF operate from different regions of the chromosome. To answer these questions, we used bacteriophage λ site-specific recombination as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Thiel et al., 2012</xref>) to perform large transpositions of a segment of the right (“RiTer”) and left (“LiTer”) replichores at different loci (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">figure supplement 2A</xref>), in Ter, and analyze MukBEF activity in the resulting strain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>

<p>The transposition in the RiTer11 configuration results in a region of 450 kb devoid of <italic>matS,</italic> located between two Ter segments of 378 kb and 437 kb, which contain 11 <italic>matS</italic> and 17 <italic>matS</italic> respectively (Figure 2-figure supplement 2A). 3C-seq experiments were performed with this strain (“RiTer11”) and on the same strain deleted for <italic>matP</italic> or for <italic>mukF</italic> (Figure 2A- figure supplement 2B). The ratio of normalized contact maps of the RiTer11 strain to the RiTer11 <italic>ΔmatP</italic> allowed to visualize the reduction of long-range contacts in the two Ter segments in the presence of MatP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). On the other hand, the ratio of normalized contact maps of the RiTer11 strain to the RiTer11 <italic>ΔmukB</italic> allowed to visualize the increase of long-range contacts between and outside the two Ter segments in the presence of MukBEF. Remarkably, long-range DNA contacts specific of MukBEF activity were observed over the chromosome except in the two Ter segments. The range of DNA contacts along the chromosome were quantified by measuring the width of the diagonal in the two strains; these plots (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) allow to estimate the effect of MukBEF activity on all loci inside and outside Ter segments. These results indicated that MukBEF can operate to form long-range contacts between the two Ter segments and that MatP can prevent MukBEF activity when segments carrying <italic>matS</italic> sites are moved in different locations of the genome.</p>
<p>Similar experiments were performed with a strain carrying a transposed segment from the left replichore in the Ter MD (LiTer 15). In this configuration, a region of 1085 kb devoid of <italic>matS,</italic> is flanked by two Ter segments of 427 kb and 374 kb containing 13 <italic>matS</italic> and 15 <italic>matS</italic> respectively (Figure 2- Figure supplement 2A). HiC experiments were performed on this strain (“LiTer”) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). As observed with the RiTer11 strain, long-range DNA contacts specific of MukBEF activity were observed over the chromosome except in the two Ter segments. The ratio of normalized contact maps of the LiTer15 strain to the LiTer15 <italic>ΔmukB</italic> allowed to visualize the increase of long-range contacts outside the two Ter segments in the presence of MukBEF (Figure 2B and 2C- figure supplement 2C).</p>
<p>Altogether, these results demonstrate that MukBEF activity can be initiated from multiple regions of the chromosome, in the Right, Left or Ori regions, and that Ter segments cannot insulate DNA segments devoid of <italic>matS</italic> sites. They also reveal that MukBEF does not globally translocate from the Ori region to the terminus of the chromosome as observed with Smc-ScpAB in different bacteria. Furthermore, the results indicated that Ter segments carrying 17 and 11 <italic>matS</italic> can prevent MukBEF activity and restrict DNA contacts.</p>

<title>matS determinants to prevent MukBEF activity</title>
<p>The method described above, splitting Ter in two parts, revealed that two parts of Ter can prevent MukBEF activity. Thus, by varying the way Ter is split in two parts, one should be able to identify <italic>matS</italic> determinants required to affect MukBEF activity.</p>
<p>Two previous studies differ slightly in the prediction for the number and consensus sequence of <italic>matS</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Mercier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Nolivos et al., 2016</xref>).To clarify this, three independent ChIP-seq experiments were performed, revealing 28 <italic>matS</italic> and a newly derived consensus sequence (Figure 3- figure supplement 3). To examine the requirements for the inhibition of MukBEF by MatP, a 1 Mb region of the left replichore was transposed at different positions into the Ter domain, thus dividing Ter into two parts (referred to as Ter1 and Ter2, Ter1 comprising the <italic>dif</italic> site and the terminus of replication) of different sizes and carrying different number of <italic>matS</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Three transpositions were performed generating Ter2 domains of 253, 209 and 136 kb containing 9, 7 or 4 <italic>matS</italic>, respectively (strains LiTer9, LiTer7, LiTer4). We used Hi-C to test the ability of these Ter2 regions to inhibit MukBEF (LiTer9 in Figure 3-figure supplement 4A, LiTer7 and LiTer4 in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Long-range DNA interactions were readily observed on both regions flanking Ter2 in both three strains, and long-range contacts are affected in the Ter2 segment, even when only 4 <italic>matS</italic> were present (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Similar HiC experiments were performed with the same strains deleted for <italic>matP</italic> (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">figure supplement 4B</xref>). The ratio of normalized contact maps of the LiTer4 strains to the corresponding <italic>matP</italic> derivatives (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>) clearly revealed that long-range contacts were limited in Ter2 of the different strains. Remarkably, the 136 kb region carrying 4 <italic>matS</italic> sites in LiTer4 was sufficient to decrease long-range contacts promoted by MukBEF activity.</p>

<p>The ability of different Ter segments to inhibit the formation of long-range DNA contacts was quantified by measuring the range of contacts in the different Ter segments (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D and E</xref>). The median range of contact for Ter in the WT condition is 263 +/- 24kb. Remarkably, no significant differences in the range of contacts (275 +/- 9kb) were observed in strain Liter9 for the Ter2 segment carrying 9 <italic>matS</italic>; it is noteworthy that this region carrying 9 <italic>matS</italic> sites shows the same range of contacts (280 +/- 35kb) in the wt configuration. This result shows that a transposed 253-kb region carrying 9 <italic>matS</italic> prevent MukBEF activity as much as the same segment present in the 838-kb long Ter MD.</p>
<p>To further characterize how MatP/<italic>matS</italic> can prevent MukBEF activity, we measured the range of contacts in Ter2 segments carrying 7 or 4 <italic>matS</italic> sites. For the 209-kb segment carrying 7 <italic>matS</italic> sites, the range of contact was increased to 330 +/- 9kb while it increased to 352 +/- 12kb for the 136-kb segment with 4 <italic>matS</italic>. Values obtained for these segments when present as part of the WT Ter were slightly lower (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). These results indicate that segments carrying 7 or 4 <italic>matS</italic> affect MukBEF activity, even though at a lower level than a 250-kb segment with 9 <italic>matS</italic> sites.</p>
<p>The four <italic>matS</italic> sites present in the 136-kb Ter2 region of LiTer4 are not distributed regularly in that region (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). We took advantage of this irregular spacing to test the capacity of a segment carrying 3 <italic>matS</italic> sites to prevent MukBEF activity and to explore whether the density of <italic>matS</italic> sites can modulate MukBEF activity. To address these two questions, we deleted either <italic>matS<sup>26</sup></italic> or <italic>matS<sup>28</sup></italic>from strain LiTer4 and probed using HiC the long-range of contacts. In strain LiTer4 Δ<italic>matS<sup>26</sup></italic>, three <italic>matS</italic> sites are distant from 78 and 58 kb whereas the <italic>matS</italic> sites in LiTer4 <italic>ΔmatS<sup>28</sup></italic>strain are separated by 13 and 65 Kb. The ratio of normalized contact maps of the LiTer4 <italic>ΔmatS<sup>26</sup></italic> or LiTer4 <italic>ΔmatS<sup>28</sup></italic> strains to the corresponding <italic>ΔmatP</italic> derivative (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref> and <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">figure supplement 4C</xref>) revealed that long-range contacts were affected by the presence of only 3 <italic>matS</italic> sites in the 136-kb segment. By measuring the range of contacts in strains LiTer4 <italic>ΔmatS<sup>26</sup></italic> and LiTer4 <italic>ΔmatS<sup>28</sup></italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), the density of three <italic>matS</italic> sites ( <italic>matS25-matS26</italic> and <italic>matS27</italic>) in strain LiTer4 <italic>ΔmatS<sup>28</sup></italic> seems to be as efficient (range contact of 357 kb +/- 11 kb) as the four <italic>matS</italic> sites in strain LiTer4 (range contact of 352 +/- 12kb). By contrast, in LiTer4 <italic>ΔmatS<sup>26</sup></italic>, the range of contact is increased to 370 kb +/- 6 kb indicating a reduced ability to prevent MukBEF activity. Altogether, assuming that differences in the <italic>matS</italic> sequences do not modify MatP’s ability to bind to the chromosome and affect its capacity to inhibit MukBEF, these results suggested that the density of <italic>matS</italic> sites in a small chromosomal region has a greater impact than dispersion of the same number of <italic>matS</italic> sites over a larger segment.</p>

<title>MukBEF preferentially binds in newly replicated regions</title>
<p>Results presented above indicated that MukBEF activity can be initiated from multiple regions of the chromosome and that, unlike Smc-ScpAB, MukBEF does not initiate its activity in the Ori region and translocate linearly to the terminus of the chromosome. To further characterize the loading and translocation process of MukBEF, we performed ChIP-seq experiments using a Flag version of MukB on synchronized cells using a <italic>dnaC2</italic> thermosensitive allele that allows to control the timing of replication initiation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). The cells were grown at a permissive temperature, then shifted to 40°C for 2 hours to allow the ongoing round of replication to complete without being able to initiate a new round; the cells were then shifted back to 30°C and samples were taken for ChIP-seq analyses after 10, 20 and 40 minutes. At t0, there is no variation in the number of sequences along the chromosome indicating the absence of replication. In this condition, the ChIP-seq signals show a slight enrichment of signals outside Ter. After 10 minutes at the permissive temperature, a fraction of &gt;500 kb centered on <italic>oriC</italic> was replicated as revealed by an increase of sequencing reads in this region. After 20 minutes, a large zone of over 1.4 Mb was replicated, and after 40 minutes, the chromosome was fully replicated and the replication profile was similar to that of non-synchronized cells because of multiple new replication cycles initiated. Normalized ChIP-seq experiments were performed by normalizing the quantity of immuno-precipitated fragments to the input of MukB-Flag. This experiment showed a 2- to 4-fold enrichment in the regions that have been replicated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). After 10 min, the signal was increased over 500 kb on each side of <italic>oriC</italic>. At 20 min, the signal progressed and corresponded to the regions that have been replicated. At 40 min, when the chromosome has been fully replicated, the signals obtained in the ChIP-seq samples indicated an enrichment of MukBEF all along the chromosome except in a 1.5 Mb region centered on the Ter region. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, MukBEF enrichment drops to basal levels 250kb before Ter (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). This enrichment followed the progression of replication and spread from <italic>oriC</italic> towards Ter.</p>

<title>Ter segments prevent MukBEF binding</title>
<p>To further explore the ability of MatP to exclude MukBEF from the Ter region, we tested the ability of MatP to exclude MukBEF from chromosomal regions containing <italic>matS</italic> sequences. Chip-Seq experiments were performed on the Liter7 strain, which has a Ter2 segment closer to <italic>oriC</italic>. As in the wild-type background, MukBEF is preferentially associated with newly replicated sequences and shows a 2-fold increase following replication fork progression. However, a break in this enrichment profile is detected in the sequence corresponding to Ter2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>).

<title>MukBEF promotes long-range contacts in the absence of replication</title>
<p>Since MukBEF was shown to bind preferentially in newly replicated regions, we wanted to test if a preferential activity of MukBEF was detectable in those regions. To do this, we performed Hi-C on non-replicating cells lacking MukF, and induced <italic>mukBEF</italic> expression with or without restarting replication. In the absence of replication and of MukBEF, long-range contacts were constrained by barriers that delimit domains, called Chromosome-Interacting Domains (CIDs), previously detected in WT cells in growing conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lioy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">figure supplement 5</xref>). Remarkably, after two hours of MukBEF induction in non-replicating cells, long-range contacts were detected except in the Ter region, indicating that MukBEF activity does not require newly replicated DNA to promote long-range contacts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Figure Supplement 8</xref>). Finally, restarting replication for 40 minutes after 2 hours of MukBEF induction did not alter significantly the range and distribution of long-range DNA contacts observed in the absence of replication but in the presence of MukBEF outside Ter. As previously observed by microscopy in <italic>E. coli,</italic> replication does not appear to be an essential process for the activity of this SMC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Badrinarayanan et al., 2012a</xref>).

<title>Functional implications, comparative genomics of matS distribution</title>
<p>In <italic>E. coli</italic>, there are 28 <italic>matS</italic> sequences dispersed throughout the 1.03 Mb Ter domain.

<p>To determine if other species also possess a large Ter domain, we used the <italic>matS</italic> consensus sequence to identify the Ter domain in 16 bacteria from the enterobacterales, pasteurellales, and vibrionales groups with the higher number of sequenced genomes.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>SMC complexes play a fundamental role in the organization of genomes in all domains of life. Different models involving their loading, translocation or extrusion of DNA loops as well as their unloading have been proposed, based on results obtained with different complexes and in different models. Among the SMC complexes, MukBEF has specific features: MukBEF is only found in enterobacteria and some related bacterial genera where it is involved in chromosome segregation; the mukBEF genes belong to a group of genes co-occurring with the <italic>Dam</italic> methylase gene including also <italic>matP</italic> and other genes involved in DNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brezellec et al., 2006</xref>); MukBEF exists as dimers of dimers connected by the kleisin subunit MukF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Badrinarayanan et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Zawadzka et al., 2018</xref>); by its activity, MukBEF does not align the two arms of the chromosome like the canonical bacterial Smc-ScpAB complex but instead promotes long distance contacts in <italic>cis</italic> like a eukaryotic condensin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lioy et al., 2018</xref>). Remarkably, MukBEF activity is not detected within the specific chromosomal Ter domain, one-fifth of the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome, due to the presence of MatP associated with this region. Although details about MukBEF and its activity have been revealed in recent years, key steps in its function remain to be characterized, including loading onto the DNA molecule, its actual loop extrusion activity, and its unloading by MatP.</p>
<p>Altogether, our data provide an integrated view of MukBEF activity to organize the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome. By different ChIP-seq and HiC approaches performed in different strains, some of which have undergone programmed genetic rearrangements, we showed that MukBEF loading does not only involve the Ori region but also different regions of the chromosome. Our results also indicated that although MukBEF binds preferentially in newly replicated regions, its activity is detected even in the absence of replication and long-range contacts appear similarly throughout the genome, except in the Ter region. These results support a model in which MukBEF molecules are bound to the chromosome, molecules are removed or displaced by replication, MukBEF molecules readily reassociate in newly replicated regions except in Ter region in which the unloading of MukBEF is enhanced by MatP bound to <italic>matS</italic> sites. Our results are in agreement with the previous proposal that MukBEF may organize a series of loops around a thin MukBEF axial core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Mäkelä and Sherratt, 2020</xref>). Altogether, our results reveal a striking contrast with the way Smc-ScpAB loads on DNA by interacting with the ParB at <italic>parS</italic> sites and then translocates towards the ter region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Instead, long-distance contacts promoted by MukBEF did not occur as a wave from a specific region but rather initiate at different positions, in different regions of the genome. Thus, the activity of MukBEF appears to be more similar to that of eukaryotic condensins than to that of the Smc-ScpAB complex.</p>
<p>The fact that MukBEF is found associated with newly replicated DNA could also suggest preferential loading at the replication fork or behind. However, in the absence of replication, MukBEF is still able to load and form long-range DNA contacts, as well as segregated chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Badrinarayanan et al., 2012a</xref>). Interestingly, this situation is reminiscent to that of SMC-ScpAB. Smc-ScpAB is loaded onto the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> chromosome at the <italic>parS</italic> site in association with parB/SpoJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gruber and Errington, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Sullivan et al., 2009</xref>). Remarkably, in the absence of <italic>parB,</italic> Smc-ScpAB is still able to perform chromosome segregation almost perfectly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ireton et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). This demonstrates that, even with a strong preferential loading mechanism, the SMC complex can load on chromosomal DNA. A similar situation may occur in <italic>E. coli</italic>, where MukBEF is preferentially loaded depending on the progression of replication but can still bind to and act on the chromosome in the absence of replication.</p>
<p>Our results showed that MukBEF was not detected in regions containing <italic>matS</italic> sites and that these regions were devoid of contacts extending over 600 kb. By varying the number of <italic>matS</italic> sites at an ectopic position, we showed that MukBEF inhibition is graded with the number of <italic>matS</italic>; while an effect is already visible with 3 <italic>matS</italic> scattered over a 78 kb region, the maximal effect seems to be reached with 9 <italic>matS</italic> sites distributed over a 253 kb region. As proposed for Smc-ScpAB and its unloading XDS site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Karaboja et al., 2021</xref>), if the movement of DNA in the loop extrusion process involves large steps, it is conceivable that several <italic>matS</italic> sites are required for a complex to be trapped and discharged by MatP bound to a <italic>matS</italic> site. Accordingly, the density of <italic>matS</italic> sites seems to affect the inhibition efficiency supporting this assumption. Further experiments will be needed to analyze in details the optimal spacing of <italic>matS</italic> sites to inhibit MukBEF activity.</p>
<p>The structure of the MukBEF-AcpP-MatP/<italic>matS</italic> complex obtained by cryoEM revealed the entrapment of two topologically separated DNA segments in two distinct compartments called “ring” and “clamp”, with the <italic>matS</italic> site present in the ring compartment. The proposed model for MukBEF unloading stipulates that the unloading of the segment carrying <italic>matS</italic> site in the ring compartment is coupled to the unloading of the other segment in the clamp. One of the MatP monomers forms a contact with one of the MukE monomers while the joint binds and positions MatP between the MukB arms. The joint interface is much larger than the MukE-MatP bridge and likely provides the major binding energy for association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bürmann et al., 2021</xref>). Indeed, a change to alanine of the five residues between H38 and D42 in contact with MukE did not affect MatP’s ability to inhibit MukBEF activity (<xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">figure supplement 7</xref>). Refined experiments will be required to assess the outcome of mutating MatP residues involved in the interaction with the joint as mutations of those residues also affect <italic>matS</italic> binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dupaigne et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>MukBEF activity is detected by the appearance of contacts over a distance of approximately one megabase, spanning around 4 megabases of the chromosome (excluding the Ter domain). Even if the molecular details of this activity remain to be characterized, it is tempting to speculate that MukBEF molecules can be discharged from DNA in the absence of MatP, i.e. outside Ter. Furthermore, it can be noted that MukBEF activity does not appear to be significantly disrupted in a <italic>matP</italic> mutant suggesting that MukBEF can be discharged from DNA in the absence of MatP. As proposed by Bürmann and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bürmann et al., 2021</xref>), MatP would act as a structural element that ensures ideal positioning of DNA close to the exit gate in the MukBEF complex that might ensure an efficient unloading of MukBEF from the DNA. Altogether, the results would indicate that MatP is not the MukBEF unloader per se, but rather that its ability to prevent MukBEF activity has been selected to protect the Ter region from a condensin activity.</p>
<p>The distribution of <italic>matS</italic> sites over a large region of the chromosome in enterobacteria results in the inhibition of MukBEF in Ter. MatP has already been shown to confer another property to Ter, through an interaction of its C-terminus with the septum-associated protein ZapB and localizing Ter at midcell. Remarkably, these two properties are independent as inhibiting MukBEF does not require its anchoring of Ter at the septum of division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lioy et al., 2018</xref>). Given that the number of <italic>matS</italic> sites far exceeds the number required to prevent MukBEF activity and that the density of <italic>matS</italic> sites increases as we approach <italic>dif</italic>, we may speculate that MukBEF presence is mostly banished from the <italic>dif</italic> region. At least two activities of DNA metabolism occur in this region: resolution of chromosome dimers by XerC-XerD recombinases and the post-replicative decatenation of circular chromosomes. We may speculate, based on <italic>in vitro</italic> observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kumar et al., 2022</xref>), that MukBEF could interfere with TopIV activity and delay potential chromosome decatenation. Another possibility is that chromosome dimers resolved at the <italic>dif</italic> site may become trapped in loops formed by MukBEF, thus delaying segregation. However, none of these possible scenarios are supported by data yet, and a major challenge for the future will be to determine whether and how MukBEF may interfere with one or both of these processes.</p>
<p>In the absence of replication and of MukBEF activity, the contact map displayed a single strong diagonal composed of very well-defined CIDs (for Chromosomal Interacting Domains), ranging in size from 20 to 400 kb. The CIDs, clearly visible in populations of cells growing exponentially, were prominent in these conditions revealing the impact of transcription on the structuring of the genome. Upon replication, the CID organization is less apparent because of the new contacts that occur between loci belonging to different CIDs. The induction of MukBEF in the presence of replication further attenuates the patterning of CIDs. Altogether, these results highlight the respective contribution of these three processes, transcription, replication and condensin activity, on the organization of bacterial genomes.</p>

Formaldehyde was quenched with a final concentration of 0.25 M glycine for 20 min at 4°C. Fixed cells were collected by centrifugation and stored at −80°C until use. Frozen pellets consisting of approximately 1-2 x 10<sup>9</sup> cells were thawed and suspended in 600 μl of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 8) with 4 μl of lyzozyme (35 U/μl). The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes.

DNA was then precipitated with an equal volume of 3 M Na-Acetate (pH 5.2) and two volumes of iso-propanol. After 1 hour at −80°C, the DNA was pelleted and suspended in 500 μl of 1X TE buffer. The tubes were incubated directly with 50 μl of proteinase K (20 mg/mL) for an overnight period at 65°C. Subsequently, all tubes were transferred to 2 ml centrifuge tubes and extracted with 400 μl of phenol-chloroform pH 8.0. The DNA was then precipitated, washed with 1 ml of 70% cold ethanol, and resuspend in 30 μl of 1X TE buffer in the presence of RNase A (1 μg/ml). The tubes containing ligated DNA (3C libraries), digested DNA, and non-digested DNA were pooled into three separate tubes.

<title>Processing of libraries for Illumina sequencing</title>
<p>The samples were sonicated using a Covaris S220 instrument to obtain fragments ranging in size from 300 to 500 base pairs.

<title>Chip-seq analysis</title>
<p>Between 10 to 20 million reads were recovered for each sample. We used Bowtie2 software to perform mapping in local mode, and the mpileup software from Samtools to calculate coverage for each position in the genome. Normalized ChIP was then calculated by normalizing the number of reads at each position by the total number of reads, and dividing this number by the normalized input. A sliding window of 50 kb was applied to smooth the variations. Peaks for MatP ChIP-seq (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">figure supplement 3B</xref>) were identified by extracting positions where the number of reads was ten times higher than the background for at least 30 consecutive base pairs. The center of these distributions was considered the center of the peak. The sequences were then extracted and used on the MEME suite to identify a common motif.</p>

<title>Generation of contact maps</title>
<p>Contact maps were constructed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lioy et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, each read was assigned to a restriction fragment. Non-informative events such as self-circularized restriction fragments, or uncut co-linear restriction fragments were discarded, as in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cournac et al., 2012</xref>). The genome was then divided into 5 kb units, and the corresponding contact map was generated and normalized through the sequential component normalization procedure of <italic>SCN</italic> (based on the sequential component normalization; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/koszullab/E_coli_analysis">https://github.com/koszullab/E_coli_analysis</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lioy et al., 2018</xref>). Contact maps were visualized as logarithmic matrices to aid in visualization.</p>

<title>Ratio of contact maps</title>
<p>The comparison of contact maps was facilitated by displaying their ratio. The ratio was calculated for each point on the map by dividing the number of contacts in one condition by the number of contacts in the other condition. The Log2 of the ratio was then plotted using a Gaussian filter. The color code represented a decrease or increase in contacts in one condition relative to the other (a blue or red signal, respectively); a white signal indicated no change.</p>

<title>Quantification of the range of <italic>cis</italic> contacts along the chromosome</title>
<p>We used a three-step process adapted from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lioy et al., 2020</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Wang et al., 2017</xref>) to determine the width of the diagonal in contact maps. To improve the resolution of the Ter limit, we measured the width perpendicularly to the main diagonal.</p>
<p>First, we calculated the median of the contact map and estimated the standard deviation (σ) using a robust statistic, where σ = 1.4826 * mad (mad = median absolute deviation). Next, we used a point connecting algorithm to differentiate significant interactions from background noise. The size of each connected element identified by the “bwlabel” function of MATLAB was determined. We considered a connected element with a size greater than or equal to 30 points to be significant and used the “imclose()” function of MATLAB to fill in the empty points within the connected elements using a diamond shape with a size of 5.</p>
<p>Subsequently, we calculated the width of the primary diagonal for each 5-kb bin of the genome. The range of cis contact was estimated from the width of the primary diagonal by multiplying the number of measured bins by the bin size (5 kb) and dividing by two (since the range is symmetric on both sides of the chromosomal locus being considered). Finally, a boxplot was used to visualize the entire range of <italic>cis</italic> contacts for all the analyzed chromosome regions.</p>

<title>Directional Index analysis</title>
<p>Directional Index was calculate as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lioy et al., 2018</xref>). The directional index is a statistical metric that quantifies the level of upstream or downstream contact bias for a given genomic region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>). This metric is based on a t-test comparison of contact vectors to the left and right of each bin, up to a certain scale. The boundaries between topological domains often generate fluctuating signals that result in a transition in the directional preference. Specifically, for each 5 kb bin, we extracted the contact vector from the correlation matrix between that bin and neighboring bins at regular 5 kb intervals, up to 100 kb, in both left and right directions. At each step, the paired t- test was used to determine whether the strength of interactions was significantly stronger in one direction relative to the other. A threshold of 0.05 was used to assess statistical significance. The directional preferences for each bin along the chromosome were visualized as a bar plot, with positive and negative t-values shown as red and green bars, respectively. To improve the clarity of presentation, bars for bins with t-values below −2 or above 2 (corresponding to a p-value of 0.05) were truncated. Between two identified domains in the contact matrices, the directional preference of bins changed, which was indicated by alternating red and green colors.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Seba et al., investigate the mechanism of chromosome organization by the MukBEF complex in E. coli. They use a combination of Hi-C and ChIP analysis to understand the steps of MukBEF regulation: its unloading from DNA (how MukBEF activity is prevented in the terminus regions of the chromosome by MatP), and its loading onto DNA (how DNA replication influences MukBEF association with the chromosome). Seba et al., induce chromosomal rearrangements to flip the sections of the ter region, thus perturbing matS site numbers and position. They find that MukBEF activity is prevented around matS sites and that higher matS density has greater effect on MukBEF. Separately, using replication mutants and inducible MukBEF expression, they find that MukBEF can associate with the chromosome even in the absence of replication (as seen by the emergence of long-range contacts). However, ChIP data suggests that MukBEF binding to DNA is enriched on newly replicated DNA.</p>
<p>Altogether, this work provides a valuable and comprehensive view of MukBEF-mediated chromosome organization, with insights on the mechanism of the exclusion of MukBEF from the terminus region of the chromosome. The use of the programmed genetic rearrangements is powerful and allows the authors to provide clear and convincing evidence for MukBEF exclusion from ter by matS sites. It is particularly striking to see that MukBEF can promote long-range contacts even in chromosomal regions between two matS, but the complex is excluded from the matS 'zones'. Experiments using cells blocked for replication show that MukBEF can influence chromosome organization in the absence of replication as well. While previous studies have reported some evidences in support of both of the above conclusions, the experiments described here offer a clear and direct demonstration of the same.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Chromosome organization in E. coli and related species ('transversal') deviates starkly from the pattern more commonly found in bacteria ('longitudinal'). The underlying mechanisms and the physiological roles, however, are not well understood. This manuscript by Seba et al. investigates the activity and regulation of MukBEF in chromosome folding in E. coli. Using a construct for inducible expression of MukBEF, the authors first demonstrate that the initiation of long-range chromosome contacts (likely by loop extrusion) is not restricted to few positions on the chromosome and rather widely distributed but excluding the replication terminus region. Using ChIP-Seq, the authors show that the distribution of MukBEF over the chromosome is consistent with widely distributed loading and moreover indicate a connection of chromosome folding and DNA replication with newly replicated DNA shower an increased tendency for MukBEF binding. To dissect this further, they then redistribute matS sites on the chromosome by a clever strategy based on large-scale transpositions. The results reveal that matS-free DNA segments undergo MukBEF dependent folding regardless of their position relative to the origin of replication, being consistent with a broad distributed loading of MukBEF. By fine-mapping with smaller transposition events, they show that few matS sites are sufficient to impede MukBEF activity. Surprisingly, however, E. coli and most related genomes harbor many matS sites, which are particularly highly concentrated near the chromosome dimer resolution dif site (Fig. 5).</p>
<p>This is a well-executed and well-presented study. The findings show that the MatP/matS system acts locally and independent of DNA replication to restrict MukBEF in the replication terminus region. Few of the many matS sites are sufficient for MukBEF restriction. The main conclusions of the work are clear and well supported by the data.</p>

<p>Seba et al. investigate whether chromosomal recruitment of the E. coli SMC complex MukBEF is initiated at a single site, how MukBEF activity is excluded from the replication terminus region, and whether its recruitment and activity depend on DNA replication. Upon induction of MukBEF, the authors find that chromosomal long-range contacts increase globally rather than from a single site. Using large-scale chromosome rearrangements, they show that matS sites can insulate separate areas of high MukBEF activity from each other. This suggests that MukBEF loads at multiple sites in the genome. Finally, the authors propose that MukBEF associates preferentially with newly replicated DNA, based on ChIP-seq experiments after DNA replication arrest.</p>
<p>The conclusions of the paper are well supported by the data. The ratiometric contact analyses and range-of-contact analyses are compelling and nicely show the interplay between MukBEF and its proposed unloader MatP/matS. I particularly enjoyed the chromosome re-arrangement experiments, which lend strong support to the idea that MukBEF activity is independent of a centralized loading site.</p>
<p>
The enrichment of MukBEF in newly replicated regions is convincing, despite somewhat small effect sizes. The suggestion that matS density controls MukBEF activity is appealing, but will need additional support from more systematic studies. It is based on a comparison of only two strains (looking at different combinations of three matS sites), and the effect size is small. As it is, differences in matS sequence composition and genomic context cannot be factored out.</p>
<p>Overall, the work is an important advance in our understanding of bacterial chromosome organization. It will be of broad interest to chromosome biologists and bacterial cell biologists.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>1. Experiments regarding the inducible expression of MukBEF: The authors should provide western blots or rt-qPCR for MukBEF expression at 40 min and 2H.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We provide now a western blot of MukB in non-induced and induced conditions as Figure 1-figure supplement 1D.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Experiments with RiTer and LiTer constructs:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the matP mutant may help the reader to compare the effect of the translocation in different backgrounds and have added it to the figure. This strengthens the conclusion that longrange interactions in ter do increase in the absence of matP in a rearranged chromosome, as observed in the WT configuration (Lioy et al., 2018).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>b. Additionally, in Fig. 2C, it appears that there is some decrease in long-range interactions in the absence of mukB in ter1 (Riter). Is this a significant change?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The change observed is not significant. The results shown in Fig. 2C have been obtained using a 3C approach, which generated slightly more variability than Hi-C. Furthermore, we measured the range of contacts for the segment corresponding to Ter1 in RiTer (matS12-matS28), in different genetic contexts and different configurations. The results show that this level of variation is not significant (see graph below reporting two independent experiments).</p>

<p>1. Experiments with various matS organizations: These experiments are interesting and an important part of the paper. However, it is rather hard to visualize the chromosome conformations in the strains after transposition. To aid the reader (particularly with panel E), authors can provide schematics of the chromosome conformations and anticipated/ observed chromosomal interactions. Circular interaction plots would be useful here.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this interesting remark; we have tried in the past to represent these interactions using a circular representation (see for example the web site of Ivan Junier; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://treetimc.github.io/circhic/index.html">https://treetimc.github.io/circhic/index.html</ext-link>). However, this representation is not trivial to apprehend for nonspecialists, especially in strains with a rearranged chromosome configuration. Nonetheless, we have added graphical circular representations of the chromosome configurations to help the reader.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. ChIP experiments:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The basal value of the ChIP on the non-replicated sequences (between 0-3.5 Mb for 10 minutes and 0-3 Mb for 20 minutes) is 0.8 and 0.7, respectively, whereas the mean value of the replicated sequence is 1.6   and 1.45. So the enrichment observed for these two points is about 2-fold, not 1.1 and it is 4 fold for t40min.
These values were obtained by dividing the number of normalized reads in the ChIP (the number of reads at each position divided by the total number of reads) by the normalized reads of the input.  Therefore, the increase in copy number is considered in the calculation. Furthermore, we added a supplementary figure (Figure Sup9) in which we performed a ChIP without tags on synchronized cells, and in this case, we did not observe any enrichment triggered by replication.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>b. Authors make a conclusion that MukB loads behind the replication fork. However, the time resolution of the presented experiments is not sufficient to be certain of this. Authors would need to perform more time-resolved experiments for the same.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reviewer 1 is correct; we attempted to discriminate whether the observed enrichment is (i) associated with the replication fork since we observed a decrease in the center of the enrichment at oriC as the maximum enrichment moves away with the replication fork after 20 and 40 minutes, or (ii) associated with the newly replicated sequence. To investigate this, we attempted to induce a single round of replication by shifting the cells back to 40°C after 10 minutes at 30°C. Unfortunately, replication initiation is not immediately halted by shifting the cells to 40°C, and we were unable to induce a single round of replication. To clarify our conclusions, we modified our manuscript to</p>
<p>“Altogether, these findings indicate that MukBEF is loaded into regions newly replicated either at the replication fork or even further behind it, except in the Ter region from which it would be excluded.”</p>

<p>c. Authors conclude that in the LiTer7 strain, MukB signal is absent from Ter2. However, when compared with the ChIP profiles by eye across panels in A and B, this does not seem to be significant. In the same results sections, authors state that there is a 3-fold increase in MukB signal in other regions. The corresponding graph does not show the same.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Rather than relying solely on the enrichment levels, which can be challenging to compare across different strains due to slight variations in replication levels, we believe there is a clear disruption in this profile that corresponds to the Ter2 sequence. Furthermore, this discontinuity in enrichment relative to the replication profile is also observable in the WT configuration. At T40min, MukB ChIPseq signals halt at the Ter boundary, even though Ter is actively undergoing replication, as evidenced by observations in the input data.</p>
<p>Regarding the fold increase of MukB, Reviewer 1 is correct; we overestimated this enrichment in the text and have now corrected it.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The authors largely avoid speculation on what might be the physiological relevance of the exclusion of MukBEF (and Smc-ScpAB) from the replication termination region (and the coordination with DNA replication). At this stage it would be helpful to present possible scenarios even if not yet supported by data. The authors should for example consider the following scenario: loop extrusion of a dif site in a chromosome dimer followed by dimer resolution by dif recombination leads to two chromosomes that are linked together by MukBEF (equivalent to cohesin holding sister chromatids together in eukaryotes but without a separase). This configuration (while rare) will hamper chromosome segregation. Is MatP particularly important under conditions of elevated levels of chromosome dimers? Could this even be experimentally tested? Other scenarios might also be entertained.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Even though we prefer to avoid speculations, we agree that we may attempt to propose some hypotheses to the reader. To do so, we have added a few sentences at the end of our discussion. “We may speculate, based on in vitro observations (Kumar et al., 2022), that MukBEF could interfere with TopIV activity and delay potential chromosome decatenation. Another possibility is that chromosome dimers resolved at the dif site may become trapped in loops formed by MukBEF, thus delaying segregation. But none of these possible scenarios are supported by data yet, and a major challenge for the future is to determine whether and how MukBEF may interfere with one or both of these processes.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The manuscript text is well written. However, the labeling of strains in figures and text is sometimes inconsistent which can be confusing (LiTer Liter liter; e.g Riter Fig 2C). For consistency, always denote the number of matS sites in LiTer strains and also in the RiTer strain. The scheme denoting LiTer and RiTer strains should indicate the orientation of DNA segments so it is clear that the engineering does not involve inversion (correct?). Similarly: Use uniform labelling for time points: see T40mn vs 40mn vs T2H vs 2H</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have reviewed the manuscript to standardize our labeling. Additionally, we have included a schema in Figure 2, indicating the matS numbers at the Ter border to emphasize that the transposition events do not involve inversion.</p>

<p>matS sites do not have identical sequences and bind different levels of MatP (suppl fig 3). Does this possibly affect the interpretation of some of the findings (when altering few or only a single matS site). Maybe a comment on this possibility can be added.</p>

<p>We agree with the referee; we do not want to conclude too strongly about the impact of matS density, so we have added this sentence at the end of the section titled 'matS Determinants to Prevent MukBEF Activity':</p>
<p>“Altogether, assuming that differences in the matS sequences do not modify MatP's ability to bind to the chromosome and affect its capacity to inhibit MukBEF, these results suggested that the density of matS sites in a small chromosomal region has a greater impact than dispersion of the same number of matS sites over a larger segment”</p>

<p>We agree that the term 'background level' here could be confusing, so we have modified it to 'basal level' to refer to the non-replicating sequence. The background level can be observed in Supplementary Figure 9 in the ChIP without tags, and, on average, the background level is 1 throughout the entire chromosome in these control experiments.</p>

<p>We thank the referee for this pertinent observation. An error was made during the smoothing of the data in Figure 4A, which resulted in an underestimation of the input values.

<p>We have unified our notation and add more description on the legend to clarify this figure :</p>
<p>“Ter” corresponds to the range of contacts over the entire Ter region, in the WT strain (WT Ter) or in the ΔmatP strain (ΔmatP Ter). The column WT matSX-Y corresponds to the range of contacts between the designated matS sites in the WT configuration. This portion of the Ter can be compared with the same Ter segment in the transposed strain (Ter2). Additionally, the matS20-28 segment corresponds to Ter2 in LiTer9, just as matS22-28 corresponds to Ter2 in LiTer7, and matS25-28 to Ter2 in LiTer4. The range of contacts of this segment was also measured in a ΔmatP or ΔmatS background.”</p>

<p>1. Fig. 4 and p.9: &quot;Normalized ChIP-seq experiments were performed by normalizing the quantity of immuno-precipitated fragments to the input of MukB-Flag and then divide by the normalized ChIP signals at t0 to measure the enrichment trigger by replication.&quot;</p>
<p>This statement and the ChIP plots in Fig. 4A are somewhat puzzling. If the data were divided by the ChIP signal at t0, as stated in the text, then I would expect the first plot (t0) to be a flat line at value 1. This is not the case. I assume that normalized ChIP is shown without the division by t0, as stated in the figure legend.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The referee is right. This sentence has been corrected, and as described in the Methods section, Figure 4 shows the ChIP normalized by the input.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>If that's true and the numbers were obtained by dividing read-count adjusted immunoprecipitate by read-count adjusted input, then I would expect an average value of 1. This is also not the case. Why are the numbers so low? I think this needs some more details on how the data was prepared.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The referee is right; we thank him for this remark. Our data are processed using the following method: the value of each read is divided by the total number of reads. A sliding window of 50 kb is applied to these normalized values to smooth the data. Then, the resulting signal from the ChIP is divided by the resulting signal from the input. This is what is shown in Figure 4. Unfortunately, for some of our results, the sliding window was not correctly applied to the input data. This did not alter the ChIP profile but did affect the absolute values. We have resolved this issue and corrected the figure.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Another potential issue is that it's not clear what the background signal is and whether it is evenly distributed. The effect size is rather small. Negative controls (untagged MukB for each timepoint) would help to estimate the background distribution, and calibrator DNA could be used to estimate the signal-to-background ratio. There is the danger that the apparent enrichment of replicated DNA is due to increased &quot;stickiness&quot; rather than increased MukBEF binding. If any controls are available, I would strongly suggest to show them.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To address this remark, a ChIP experiment with a non-tagged strain under comparable synchronization conditions has been performed. The results are presented as Supplementary Figure 9; they reveal that the enrichment shown in Figure 4 is not attributed to nonspecific antibody binding or 'stickiness’.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Cell synchronization can be somewhat challenging, and we have observed that the timing of replication restart can vary depending on the genetic background of the cells. This delay is evident in the case of LiTer7. To address this, we compared LiTer7 after 60 minutes to the wild type strain (WT) after 40 minutes of replication. Even though the duration of replication is 20 minutes longer in LiTer7, the replication profiles of these two strains under these two different conditions (40 minutes and 60 minutes) are comparable and provide a better representation of similar replication progression.</p>

Although this conclusion is supported by the follow-up experiments, I felt it is perhaps a bit too strong at this point in the text. Perhaps MukBEF loads slowly at a single site, but then moves away quickly? Would that not also lead to a flat increase in the contact plots?

<p>At this point, our conclusion that MukBEF does not travel from the ori to Ter is global and refers to the results described in this section. However, the referee is correct in pointing out that we cannot exclude the possibility that in a WT configuration (without a Ter in the middle of the right replicore), a specific MukBEF complex can be loaded near Ori and travel all along the chromosome until the Ter. To clarify our statement, we have revised it to 'reveal that MukBEF does not globally translocate from the Ori region to the terminus of the chromosome.'
