<title>Abstract</title><p>Effective regulation of energy metabolism is critical for survival. Metabolic control involves various nuclei within the hypothalamus, which receive information about the body’s energy state and coordinate appropriate responses to maintain homeostasis, such as thermogenesis, pancreatic insulin secretion, and food-seeking behaviors. It has recently been found that the hippocampus, a brain region traditionally associated with memory and spatial navigation, is also involved in metabolic regulation. Specifically, hippocampal sharp wave ripples (SWRs), which are high-frequency neural oscillations supporting memory consolidation and foraging decisions, have been shown to influence peripheral glucose metabolism. However, whether SWRs are enhanced by recent feeding–when the need for glucose metabolism increases, and if so, whether feeding-dependent modulation of SWRs is communicated to other brain regions involved in metabolic regulation, remains unknown. To address these gaps, we recorded SWRs from the dorsal CA1 region of the hippocampus of mice during sleep sessions before and after consumption of meals of varying caloric values. We found that SWRs occurring during sleep are significantly enhanced following food intake, with the magnitude of enhancement being dependent on the caloric content of the meal. This pattern occurred under both food-deprived and <italic>ad libitum</italic> feeding conditions. Moreover, we demonstrate that GABAergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus, which are known to regulate food intake, exhibit a robust SWR-triggered increase in activity. These findings identify the satiety state as a factor modulating SWRs and suggest that hippocampal-lateral hypothalamic communication is a potential mechanism by which SWRs could modulate peripheral metabolism and food intake.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>For all organisms, from bacteria to humans, life is a continuous journey in search of resources to maintain the internal environment in a desirable state. To obtain these resources, organisms perform stimulus-seeking behaviors wherein actions that improve bodily states are repeated while others are not. While even bacteria exhibit such coordination of behaviors based on the consequences of earlier actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Keegstra et al., 2022</xref>), the evolution of the nervous system in more complex organisms has enabled the use of more sophisticated strategies to learn from the past, anticipate the future, and respond rapidly for efficient metabolic regulation.</p>
<p>In mammals, the hippocampus supports spatial navigation and the formation of episodic memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">O’Keefe &amp; Nadel, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Scoville &amp; Milner, 1957</xref>), which is crucial for finding and recalling the locations of food sources. At the neurophysiological level, the hippocampus encodes the trajectory leading to food via the sequential firing of hippocampal place cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">O’Keefe &amp; Nadel, 1978</xref>). During food consumption and subsequent resting periods, these same neurons replay the recent spatial trajectory in a temporally compressed manner during a highly synchronous oscillatory event called sharp wave-ripples (SWRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Buzsaki, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Diba &amp; Buzsaki, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Joo &amp; Frank, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Skaggs &amp; McNaughton, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wilson &amp; McNaughton, 1994</xref>). SWRs communicate hippocampal activity patterns to the neocortex, supporting systems-level consolidation of memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brodt et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Buzsaki, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Klinzing et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the neocortex, the hypothalamus, a master regulator of homeostasis, receives dense multi-synaptic hippocampal innervation via the lateral septum (LS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Risold &amp; Swanson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Tingley &amp; Buzsaki, 2020</xref>). Unlike the divergent hippocampo-cortical projections, the hippocampo-lateral septum projections are highly convergent, allowing the LS to detect only the magnitude of the SWR, but not the identity and temporal order of hippocampal neuronal spiking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Tingley &amp; Buzsaki, 2020</xref>). Thus, the propagation of SWRs to hypothalamic nuclei is better suited to serve homeostatic functions rather than memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Buzsaki &amp; Tingley, 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>While earlier lesion and stimulation studies provided evidence that the hippocampus influences peripheral physiology and homeostatic behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Clifton et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Seto et al., 1983</xref>), direct physiological evidence demonstrating that SWRs serve metabolic functions only emerged recently. By combining <italic>in vivo</italic> electrophysiology with continuous glucose monitoring in freely behaving rats, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tingley and colleagues (2021)</xref> found a negative relationship between SWR rates and subsequent peripheral glucose levels. Moreover, they showed that optogenetically induced SWRs effectively reduced peripheral glucose levels, while chemogenetic inhibition of the LS abolished the correlation between SWR rate and glucose levels. Thus, this study strongly suggests that hippocampal SWRs serve a metabolic function.</p>
<p>The hypothesis that hippocampal SWRs have a metabolic function raises testable predictions regarding the relationship between SWRs and food consumption. The levels of glucose, the body’s primary energy source, are tightly regulated by the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lopez-Gambero et al., 2019</xref>). Specifically, around meal times, neuronal systems involved in glucose metabolism proactively and reactively coordinate the bodily response to the postprandial spike in glucose levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Steculorum et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Woods et al., 2006</xref>). Given that SWRs reduce peripheral glucose levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tingley et al., 2021</xref>), we set out to test the hypothesis that SWRs are modulated following meal times as part of the systems-level response to changing metabolic needs.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>To determine whether food consumption modulates SWRs during subsequent sleep, we recorded the local field potential (LFP) from the dorsal CA1 region of the hippocampus, along with electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) signals, in food-restricted male and female mice during sleep sessions before and after food intake (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-B</xref>). Similar to previous studies investigating learning-dependent changes in hippocampal dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Grosmark &amp; Buzsaki, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Oliva et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Rothschild et al., 2017</xref>), our experimental procedure consisted of three sessions: a 2-hour sleep session (“Pre-sleep”), a subsequent food consumption session of roughly 1-hour (“Meal”), and an additional 2-hour sleep session (“Post-sleep”). During the Meal sessions, mice received varying amounts of chow (0.3-1.5 gr) in their home cage without being subjected to any instructive learning paradigm. Given that mice typically consume 4-5 gr of chow per day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bachmanov et al., 2002</xref>), the largest amount corresponded to about one-third of their daily food intake. In the control condition, the Meal session was replaced with a waking session of similar duration with no food delivery (“No-food”). Each mouse was tested in the Meal condition 3-12 times with varying amounts of chow and at least once in the No-food condition.</p>

</fig>
<p>To assess whether food intake modulates SWRs, we calculated the fold change in SWR statistics from Pre-sleep to Post-sleep in paired sessions. We found that consuming larger meals (0.5-1.5 gr) significantly increased the ripple power of SWRs in all 38 session pairs, whereas smaller meals and the No-food condition did not result in a similar effect (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). We observed a similar modulation in ripple rate, which was increased in 31 of 38 sessions following consumption of larger meals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref><bold>)</bold>, but not in ripple duration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Smaller meals and No-food condition did not induce a consistent change in ripple rate or duration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D<bold>-E</bold></xref>). We then examined whether there is a relationship between meal size and the magnitude of change in ripple attributes. We found that the magnitude of increase in ripple power and rate, but not duration, was positively correlated with meal size (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F<bold>-H</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. These findings suggest that the power and rate of SWRs increase following feeding in a dose-dependent manner.</p>
<p>Since the mice in the aforementioned experiments were food restricted, we wondered whether the observed increase in ripple power after large meals might be an indirect consequence of reduced sleep quality during hunger and its restoration following feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Goldstein et al., 2018</xref>). As a measure of non-rapid eye movements (NREM) sleep quality, we quantified cortical EEG delta power, which is also associated with SWR occurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Goldstein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Molle et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sirota et al., 2003</xref>). While delta power indeed increased after food intake in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>), and the change in delta power was correlated with the change in ripple power (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>), further mediation analysis revealed that the effect of meal size on ripple power remained significant even after accounting for changes in delta power (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1K</xref>). Thus, while food intake enhanced delta power during sleep, it also led to a significant increase in ripple power beyond this effect.</p>
<p>To further rule out the possibility that recovery from hunger accounts for the observed increased ripple power following feeding, we conducted an additional set of experiments under <italic>ad libitum</italic> feeding conditions to ensure that sleep quality in the Pre-sleep session was not affected by hunger. To encourage eating during the Meal session even under <italic>ad-libitum</italic> conditions, we replaced the standard chow with chocolate (0.1-1 gr) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Consistent with our previous findings, we found that chocolate consumption increased ripple power in subsequent sleep, with larger amounts of chocolate leading to greater increases in ripple power (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Moreover, the correlation between chocolate consumption and change in delta power was not significant, nor was the correlation with ripple rate or duration (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C<bold>-E</bold></xref>). Further mediation analysis revealed that the change in delta power did not significantly mediate the relationship between chocolate amount and the change in ripple power (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref><bold>)</bold>. Together, these results demonstrate that food intake enhances SWRs during sleep, even after accounting for the positive effect of food intake on sleep depth.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="617304v2_fig2.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>Next, we sought to uncover the mechanisms by which food intake modulates SWRs. Previous studies suggested that neural systems regulating food intake are responsive to both sensory and motor experiences related to feeding, such as food detection, chewing, and mechanical stretch of the gut, as well as humoral signals indicating energy availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Thanarajah et al., 2019</xref>). To disentangle the factors underlying the meal-enhancement of SWRs, we first tested the effects of the caloric content of meals on SWRs by comparing the effects of caloric (1 gr of regular Jello) and non-caloric (1 gr of sugar-free Jello) foods with similar sensory qualities <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref><bold>)</bold>. We reasoned that if their effects on SWRs differ, this would indicate a calorie-dependency in the meal-enhancement of SWRs, whereas no difference would suggest an experience-dependency. We found that consumption of regular Jello, but not sugar-free Jello, resulted in an increase in ripple power and ripple rate compared to the No-food condition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B<bold>-C</bold></xref>). Additionally, the increase in ripple power, but not rate, was higher following consumption of regular Jello compared to sugar-free Jello (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B<bold>-C</bold></xref>). No differences were found in ripple duration or cortical delta power across conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D<bold>-E</bold></xref>). These results suggest that the caloric content of meals, rather than the oro-/mechano-sensory experience of eating, underlies the post-meal enhancement in SWRs.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="617304v2_fig3.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>We next tested whether feeding-associated hormones contribute to the meal-enhancement of SWRs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Ghrelin, a prominent gut hormone, rises during fasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Toshinai et al., 2001</xref>) and promotes increases in glucose levels and food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Poher et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, meals trigger the release of insulin, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and leptin, which lower glucose levels and induce satiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gutzwiller et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Woods et al., 2006</xref>). To investigate whether changes in these hormone concentrations modulate SWRs, we administered GLP-1, leptin, insulin and ghrelin to mice at different doses under <italic>ad libitum</italic> and food restricted conditions. Administration of GLP-1, leptin and insulin did not produce a consistent dose-dependent effect on SWR attributes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B<bold>-F</bold></xref>), except for a reduction in ripple rate following insulin administration under food restricted conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). On the other hand, ghrelin administration resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in ripple rate under ad libitum conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>) and a decrease in ripple power under food-restricted conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I</xref>). While ghrelin administration also reduced cortical delta power, mediation analysis revealed that the effect of ghrelin on ripple power remained significant even after accounting for change in cortical delta power under food-restricted conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4Ii</xref><bold>-ii</bold>).</p>

<p>These results suggest that ghrelin has a dose-dependent negative effect on ripple rate and power, which exceeds its influence on sleep quality. In contrast, we did not find consistent modulation of SWRs following GLP-1, insulin, or leptin administration, despite their known effects on hippocampal memories and synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abbas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">McNay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Oomura et al., 2006</xref>). It is possible that specific aspects of our experimental design (e.g., focusing on the 2-hour Post-sleep period, administering only one hormone at a time, or using subcutaneous delivery) may have occluded potential effects of these hormones on SWRs.</p>
<p>Lastly, as our findings reveal that SWRs are modulated by food-related signals, we tested the hypothesis that SWRs can, in turn, influence brain regions involved in feeding regulation. Among the hypothalamic nuclei that participate in feeding regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Anand &amp; Brobeck, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Stuber &amp; Wise, 2016</xref>), the lateral hypothalamus (LH) receives the densest di-synaptic input from the dorsal hippocampus via the lateral septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Risold &amp; Swanson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Tingley &amp; Buzsaki, 2020</xref>). To test whether SWRs affect neuronal activity in the LH, we combined LFP recordings from the hippocampus with optical recordings from GABAergic neurons in the LH using fiber photometry. We used Vgat-IRES-Cre mice (n = 5) and transduced LH neurons with the pGP-AAV5-syn-FLEX-jGCaMP8f-WPRE vector <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A<bold>-B</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. We found that LH GABAergic neurons exhibit a robust and consistent increase in activity, peaking approximately 320 ms after SWR onset <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C<bold>-J</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. These findings strongly suggest that SWRs, which we found to be modulated by feeding, are also associated with a consistent and robust increase in population activity in the LH, a central brain region for metabolic regulation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Regulation of energy intake and expenditure is vital for animals. While food intake provides essential fuel for the organism, it can also elevate plasma glucose and other nutrient levels above optimal ranges for physiological functions. This elevation triggers coordinated neural and peripheral responses that lower glucose levels by promoting glucose uptake in peripheral tissues and inhibiting further food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lopez-Gambero et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Steculorum et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Woods et al., 2006</xref>). Here, we show that hippocampal SWRs, previously linked to reductions in peripheral glucose levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tingley et al., 2021</xref>), are enhanced after food intake. Specifically, we compared SWRs occurring during sleep before and after meals and found a calorie-dependent increase in the ripple power and SWR rate. This enhancement exceeded the increase in sleep quality and was evident under both <italic>ad libitum</italic> and food-restricted conditions. Our caloric vs. non-caloric Jello experiments further revealed that the enhancement in SWRs was driven by caloric intake rather than the experience of eating. Moreover, we found that GABAergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus, a region implicated in the regulation of both food intake and peripheral metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Anand &amp; Brobeck, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lopez-Gambero et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Shimazu, 1987</xref>), exhibit a robust and consistent SWR-triggered increase in activity.</p>
<p>We conducted our experiments during the light phase and focused our analyses on sleep because awake SWRs primarily occur during <italic>offline</italic> states (i.e., resting) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Buzsaki, 2015</xref>), which are reduced under food restriction due to increasing physical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chowdhury et al., 2015</xref>). However, a bidirectional relationship between hunger and sleep also exists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Danguir &amp; Nicolaidis, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Rechtschaffen &amp; Bergmann, 1995</xref>), where hunger increases arousal and impairs sleep quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Danguir &amp; Nicolaidis, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Goldstein et al., 2018</xref>). In line with this, we found that cortical delta power was enhanced following meals in previously food-restricted mice. Nonetheless, mediation analyses showed that food intake still had a significant effect on ripple power, even after accounting for the restoration of sleep quality. To further exclude the possibility that our results were a byproduct of impaired sleep caused by prior food restriction, we performed additional experiments under <italic>ad libitum</italic> food access. Although we did not observe a change in ripple rate in these experiments, we found a dose-dependent increase in ripple power following chocolate consumption, replicating our earlier findings under food restricted conditions. Notably, the extent of SWR modulation was weaker under <italic>ad libitum</italic> conditions, similar to the asymmetric hypothalamic response to food in sated versus fasted animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Conversely, a poor night’s sleep leads to increased appetite and impaired metabolic regulation the subsequent day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hogenkamp et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Klingenberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Schmid et al., 2015</xref>). Chronic sleep disturbances, on the other hand, elevate the risk of long-term conditions such as diabetes and metabolic syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Knutson et al., 2007</xref>). Although the neural mechanisms underlying these processes remain largely unknown, a recent study linked stronger coupling of sleep spindles and cortical slow-wave activity to improved glucose metabolism regulation the subsequent day in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Vallat et al., 2023</xref>). Given that about 75% of SWRs occur during NREM sleep in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tingley et al., 2021</xref>), and that SWRs are often triggered when slow waves and spindles are coupled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sirota et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Staresina et al., 2015</xref>), this suggests that SWRs can play a role in the connection between sleep and next-day metabolic regulation.</p>
<p>The hippocampus, which integrates environmental and interoceptive signals along with past experiences to support spatial navigation and memory, has also been shown to influence food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kanoski &amp; Grill, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Stevenson &amp; Francis, 2017</xref>). Notably, HM, a famous patient who lost the ability to form new memories after the removal of his hippocampi, also exhibited irregular eating habits and difficulties with interoceptive judgements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hebben et al., 1985</xref>). Earlier rodent studies similarly showed that hippocampal lesions increase meal frequency in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Clifton et al., 1998</xref>). More recently, optogenetic inhibition of the hippocampus following meals was shown to decrease the latency to the next meal and increase its size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hannapel et al., 2019</xref>). These findings suggest that hippocampal-dependent memories of recent meals may suppress appetite.</p>
<p>Another study identified dopamine-2 receptor neurons in the dorsal CA3 region of the hippocampus as being responsive to meals and food cues, with inhibition and activation of these neurons increasing and decreasing food intake, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Azevedo et al., 2019</xref>). Additional research has highlighted the role of the hippocampus in utilizing peripheral signals related to energy balance for meal regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Davidson &amp; Jarrard, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kanoski &amp; Grill, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wee et al., 2024</xref>). For example, the administration of leptin into both the ventral and dorsal hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kanoski et al., 2011</xref>), and exendin-4 (a GLP-1 agonist) into the ventral hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hsu et al., 2015</xref>), have been shown to reduce feeding. Conversely, ghrelin signaling in the ventral hippocampus has been shown to increase meal size through a descending lateral hypothalamus-hindbrain circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Suarez et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>While previous studies employing pharmacological and viral approaches have revealed the role of the hippocampus in the regulation of food intake, understanding at the physiological level has remained limited. Peripheral hormones that rise during the postprandial period, such as insulin, amylin and GLP-1, not only reduce plasma glucose levels but also act as satiety signals that inhibit food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Woods et al., 2006</xref>). Given this dual inhibitory effect of postprandial signals on both glucose levels and food intake, we propose that SWRs could also play an inhibitory role in regulating food intake.</p>
<p>Future studies could explore this possibility by using closed-loop suppression of SWRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Girardeau et al., 2009</xref>). This approach could also be used to test whether SWRs underlie the link between sleep loss and subsequent impairment in glucose metabolism and increase in appetite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hogenkamp et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Schmid et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Klingenberg et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>While our focus was on metabolic factors affecting SWRs, our results may also have implications for the interaction between memory and metabolism. It is widely recognized that memory tasks guided by food reward enhance SWRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Singer &amp; Frank, 2009</xref>). This modulation, thought to support the consolidation of memory for the correct trajectory leading to food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Singer &amp; Frank, 2009</xref>), could also be influenced by food intake and may modulate feeding-related processes. Our Jello experiments showed that the enhancement in SWRs following food intake is dependent on caloric content of meals rather than the experience of eating. However, one might argue that only salient experiences (i.e. consumption of food with calories, but not without) are consolidated, and thus the enhancement of SWRs following regular Jello consumption could reflect the memory consolidation of a salient experience. Previous studies have shown that animals can learn the nutrition content of different foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yamamoto &amp; Ueji, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Since our mice had been habituated to the Jello before the experiments, they might have anticipated that sugar-free Jello would not provide calories (i.e., a less salient experience) or raise glucose levels. However, the enhancement of SWRs for memory consolidation typically requires novel events. As our mice were well-habituated to both the experimental paradigm and the Jello, it is unlikely that the enhancement in SWRs reflects a memory consolidation process. One potential experiment to bypass mnemonic processes could involve direct gastric infusion of food. Further studies could also investigate whether food consumption after specific events enhances consolidation through the modulation of SWRs.</p>
<p>We propose that the temporal coordination between the onset of SWRs and the increase in LH population activity may represent a mechanism by which SWRs influence peripheral metabolism and food intake. GABAergic lateral septal neurons can facilitate the relay of SWRs to the LH by providing windows of disinhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Risold &amp; Swanson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tingley et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Wong et al., 2016</xref>). While our fiber-photometry recordings from the LH provided a population-level activity signal, future studies could utilize single-cell resolution imaging methods to uncover network-level organization and dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aharoni et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lee &amp; Rothschild, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Vivaldo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Vogt, 2022</xref>). Furthermore, the causal relationship between SWRs and LH activity, as well as the functional significance of these interactions, remain to be determined.</p>
<p>In summary, our study demonstrates that SWRs are sensitive to the body’s hunger state and are modulated by food intake. Whether SWRs can, in turn, influence food intake and the specific mechanisms underlying this potential modulation remain to be elucidated.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>All experimental procedures followed the US National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the University of Michigan’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. We used male and female C57BL/6 wild-type mice (n = 8) and Vgat-IRES-Cre (n = 9; The Jackson laboratory, #016962) heterozygous mice bred in-house. The mice were housed under a 12:12 light-dark cycle.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4b">
<title>Surgeries</title>
<p>Mice (7 to 16 weeks old) were anesthetized with a ketamine-xylazine mixture (100 and 10 mg/kg, respectively; administered via intraperitoneal injection, IP) and received lidocaine and carprofen (4 mg kg-1 and 5 mg kg-1, respectively) prior to being placed in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA, U.S.A.). During the surgery, the mice were kept under isoflurane anesthesia (∼1% in O2).</p>
<p>For hippocampal electrophysiology recordings, an array of four tungsten wires (50 micron, California Fine Wire Company) were implanted in the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus (AP: −2 mm, ML: 1.5 mm, DV: −1.4 mm). Additionally, an EMG wire was inserted into the neck muscle and an EEG and a ground screw were placed above the parietal cortex and the cerebellum, respectively.</p>
<p>Fiber photometry procedures were done as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Eban-Rothschild et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, 400 nl of pGP-AAV-syn-FLEX-jGCaMP8f-WPRE (Addgene) (2.6e<sup>12</sup> vg/mL) were injected into the LH (AP: −1.2 mm, ML: 1.15 mm, DV: −5 mm) and mono fiber optic probes (400 μm diameter, 0.48 NA, Doric Lenses, Inc., Quebec, Canada) were implanted just above the LH (AP: −1.5 mm, ML: 1.15 mm, DV: −4.6 mm).</p>
<p>Mice were given several days to recover from surgery. They were then habituated to handing and individually housed in custom Plexiglas recording cages (39.4 cm x 28.6 cm × 19.3 cm) with open tops to ensure that the LFP cable could reach the mice and allow them to be freely behaving without restricted movements. We recorded mice until 1 year of age.</p>

<title>Data processing, analyses and sleep scoring</title>
<p>Electrophysiological and optical recordings were conducted using the Tucker Davis Technology (TDT) system, sampled at 3 kHz and 1kHz respectively. Data was visualized with Synapse or SynapseLite software. Sleep scoring was done manually using the AccuSleep toolbox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/zekebarger/AccuSleep">https://github.com/zekebarger/AccuSleep</ext-link>). Sessions with less than 30 minutes of sleep were excluded from further analyses.</p>
<p>To detect SWRs we filtered the raw signal between 150-250 Hz, and took an envelope of the squared filtered signal. We identified SWRs by identifying the events that reached at least 5 standard deviations above the mean and that were above 1 standard deviation for at least 40 ms. In case two events occurred within 40 ms or less, we discarded the second event. Ripple power threshold calculations were done together for Pre-sleep and Post-sleep. We calculated the delta power by taking the envelope of the squared filtered signal between 0.5-4 Hz on the EEG channel during NREM sleep.</p>
<p>For Pre-sleep and Post-sleep comparisons, we calculated average ripple power, ripple rate, ripple duration and delta power for each pre and post session. Change from Pre-sleep to Post-sleep was calculated as change=mean(variable<sub>postsleep</sub>)/mean(variable<sub>presleep</sub>). Mediation analyses were done using the Mediation toolbox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/canlab/MediationToolbox">https://github.com/canlab/MediationToolbox</ext-link>).</p>
<p>For SWR-LH interaction analyses, we interpolated the fiber photometry signal to match its length to the length of the LFP. For each SWR, we extracted the surrounding 4-second windows of the fiber photometry signal and centered the fiber photometry signal at the ripple onset to zero. We detected the SWR-triggered peaks in fiber photometry signal within the 1 sece following SWRs. For statistical comparisons, we calculated the integrals of the 0.5 sec windows before and after each SWR and performed a paired t-test on these integrals. For the summary plots, we normalized each session by its own maximum value.</p>

<title>Food restriction and experimental procedures</title>
<p>All experiments were conducted during the light phase. Chow experiments were conducted under food restricted conditions in which animals did not have access to food for 20-24 hours preceding the experiments. Experimental steps were as follows: Mice were left to sleep for 2 hours (Pre-sleep). Then they were woken up and given a piece of regular chow (Meal). The amount of chow varied between 0.3-1.5 grams. To calculate the exact amount of consumption, we removed and weighed any remaining chow pieces before the start of the Post-sleep session which lasted for another 2 hours. Each gram of chow contained 4.1 kcals. For chocolate experiments, mice went through the same experimental procedure except that they had <italic>ad libitum</italic> food access throughout the experiment and received varying amounts (0.1-1 gr) of Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups instead of chow. Each gram of chocolate contained 5 kcals.</p>
<p>Jello experiments were performed under food-restricted conditions by using regular or sugar-free strawberry flavored Jello. Each 10 gr of Jell-O gelatin mix was dissolved in 13 ml water for regular Jello meals, and each 10 gr of sugar-free strawberry flavored Jell-o gelatin mix was dissolved in 111 ml water for sugar-free meals. The mixtures were refrigerated (4 Celsius) until firm. One gr of regular and sugar-free Jello meals contained 1.7 and 0 kcals, respectively. The Jello meals were given on plastic weighing boats and weighed before and after the trial to calculate the exact amount of consumption.</p>

<title>Hormone experiments</title>
<p>The experiments were conducted under 24-hour food restriction or <italic>ad libitum</italic> food access conditions. No food pieces were present in the cages during the recordings. Before Pre-sleep sessions, mice received a subcutaneous injection of 0.1 ml saline. Before Post-sleep sessions, they were administered with either 0.1 ml saline or various doses of hormones, including ghrelin (0.1, 0.167, or 0.5 mg/kg body weight, Genscript), leptin (0.3, 3, 6.67 mg/kg, Peprotech), insulin (0.5, 1 or 2 u/kg body weight, Sigma Aldrich, I5500), or GLP-1 (0.33, 0.67, 1.67 or 2.67 mg/kg body weight, Tocris, Cat. No. 2082), all dissolved in 0.1 ml saline.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript by Kaya et al. studies the effect of food consumption on hippocampal sharp wave ripples (SWRs) in mice. The authors use multiple foods and forms of food delivery to show that the frequency and power of SWRs increase following food intake, and that this effect depends on the caloric content of food. The authors also studied the effects of the administration of various food-intake-related hormones on SWRs during sleep, demonstrating that ghrelin negatively affects SWR rate and power, but not GLP-1, insulin, or leptin. Finally, the authors use fiber photometry to show that GABAergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus, increase activity during a SWR event.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The experiments in this study seem to be well performed, and the data are well presented, visually. The data support the main conclusions of the manuscript that food intake enhances hippocampal SWRs. Taken together, this study is likely to be impactful to the study of the impact of feeding on sleep behavior, as well as the phenomena of hippocampal SWRs in metabolism.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Details of experiments are missing in the text and figure legends. Additionally, the writing of the manuscript could be improved.</p>

<p>Some of the relationships observed in this paper are highly significant. In particular, the inverse relationship between GLP1/Leptin and Insulin/Ghrelin are particularly compelling as this aligns well with opposing hormone functions on satiety.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Kaya et al. explores the effects of feeding on sharp wave-ripples (SWRs) in the hippocampus, which could reveal a better understanding of how metabolism is regulated by neural processes. Expanding on prior work that showed that SWRs trigger a decrease in peripheral glucose levels, the authors further tested the relationship between SWRs and meal consumption by recording LFPs from the dorsal CA1 region of the hippocampus before and after meal consumption. They found an increase in SWR magnitude during sleep after food intake, in both food restricted and ad libitum fed conditions. Using fiber photometry to detect GABAergic neuron activity in the lateral hypothalamus, they found increased activity locked to the onset of SWRs. They conclude that the animal's satiety state modulates the amplitude and rate of SWRs, and that SWRs modulate downstream circuits involved in regulating feeding. These experiments provide an important step forward in understanding how metabolism is regulated in the brain. However, currently, the paper lacks sufficient analyses to control for factors related to sleep quality and duration; adding these analyses would further support the claim that food intake itself, as opposed to sleep quality, is primarily responsible for changes in SWR activity. Adding this, along with some minor clarifications and edits, would lead to a compelling case for SWRs being modulated by a satiety state. The study will likely be of great interest in the field of learning and memory while carrying broader implications for understanding brain-body physiology.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The paper makes an innovative foray into the emerging field of brain-body research, asking how sharp wave-ripples are affected by metabolism and hunger. The authors use a variety of advanced techniques including LFP recordings and fiber photometry to answer this question. Additionally, they perform comprehensive and logical follow-up experiments to the initial food-restricted paradigm to account for deeper sleep following meal times and the difference between consumption of calories versus the experience of eating. These experiments lay the groundwork for future studies in this field, as the authors pose several follow-up questions regarding the role of metabolic hormones and downstream brain regions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>(1) The authors conclude that food intake regulates SWR power during sleep beyond the effect of food intake on sleep quality. Specifically, they made an attempt to control for the confounding effect of delta power on SWRs through a mediation analysis. However, a similar analysis is not presented for SWR rate. Moreover, this does not seem to be a sufficient control. One alternative way to address this confound would be to subsample the sleep data from the ad lib and food restricted conditions (or high calorie and low calorie, etc), to match the delta power in each condition. When periods of similar mean delta power (i.e. similar sleep quality) are matched between datasets, the authors can then determine if a significant effect on SWR amplitude and rate remains in the subsampled data.</p>
<p>(2) Relatedly, are the animals spending the same amount of time sleeping in the ad lib vs. food restricted conditions? The amount of time spent sleeping could affect the probability of entering certain stages of sleep and thus affect SWR properties. A recent paper (Giri et al., Nature, 2024) demonstrated that sleep deprivation can alter the magnitude and frequency of SWRs. Could the authors quantify sleep quantity and control for the amount of time spent sleeping by subsampling the data, similar to the suggestion above?</p>
<p>(3) Plot 5I only reports significance but does not clearly show the underlying quantification of LH GABAergic activity. Upon reading the methods for how this analysis was conducted, it would be informative to see a plot of the pre-SWR and post-SWR integral values used for the paired t-test whose p-values are currently shown. For example, these values could be displayed as individual points overlaid on a pair of box-and-whisker plots of the pre- and post-distribution within the session (perhaps for one example session per mouse with the p-value reported, to supplement a plot of the distribution of p-values across sessions and mice). If these data are non-normal, the authors should also use a non-parametric statistical test.</p>
<p>Minor comments:</p>
<p>(4) A brief explanation (perhaps in the discussion) of what each change in SWR property (magnitude, rate, duration) could indicate in the context of the hypothesis may be helpful in bridging the fields of metabolism and memory. For example, by describing the hypothesized mechanistic consequence of each change, could the authors speculate on why ripple rate may not increase in all the instances where ripple power increases after feeding? Why do the authors speculate that ripple duration does not increase, given that prior work (Fernandez-Ruiz et al. 2019) has shown that prolonged ripples support enhanced memory?</p>
<p>(5) The authors suggest that &quot;SWRs could modulate peripheral metabolism&quot; as a future implication of their work. However, the lack of clear effects from GLP-1, leptin and insulin complicates this interpretation. It might be informative for readers if the authors expanded their discussion of what specific role they speculate that SWRs could play in regulating metabolism, given these negative results.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for their favorable assessment of the work and its contribution to our understanding of non-mnemonic hippocampal function. Whether there are behavioral differences that occur following administration of the different hormones is a great question, yet unfortunately our study design did not include fine behavioral monitoring to the degree that would allow answering it. While some previous studies have partially addressed the behavioral consequences of the delivery of these hormones (we will include a reference to these studies in the revised manuscript), how these changes may interact with the hippocampal and hypothalamic effects we observe is a very interesting next step.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>This is an important point that we believe we addressed in a few complementary ways. First, the mediation analysis we implemented measures the magnitude and significance of the contribution of food on SWR power after accounting for the effects of delta power, showing a highly significant food-SWR contribution. While the objective of subsampling is similar, mediation is a more statistically robust approach as it models the relationship between food, SWR power, and delta power in a way that explicitly accounts for the interdependence of these variables. Further, subsampling introduces the risk of losing statistical power by reducing the sample size, due to exclusion of data that might contain relevant and valuable information. Mediation analysis, on the other hand, uses the full dataset and retains statistical power while modeling the relationships between variables more holistically. However, as we were not satisfied with a purely analytical approach to test this issue, we carried out a new set of experiments in ad-libitum fed mice, where there is no potential issue of food restriction impairing sleep quality in the pre-sleep session. In these conditions food amount also significantly correlated with, and showed significant mediation of, the SWR power change. Finally, we acknowledge and discuss this point in the Discussion, highlighting that given the known relationship between cortical delta and SWRs, it is challenging to fully disentangle these signals.</p>

<p>We will include a comparison of sleep amount in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Additionally, we will add details to the Methods section that were missing in the original submission that are relevant to this point. Specifically, within the sleep sessions, the ongoing sleep states were scored using the AccuSleep toolbox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/zekebarger/AccuSleep">https://github.com/zekebarger/AccuSleep</ext-link>) using the EEG and EMG signals. NREM periods were detected based on high EEG delta power and low EMG power, REM periods were detected based on high EEG theta power and low EMG power, and Wake periods were detected based on high EMG power. Importantly, only NREM periods were included for subsequent SWR detection, quantification and analyses (in particular, reported SWR rates reflect the number of SWRs per second of NREM sleep).</p>
