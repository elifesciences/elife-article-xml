<abstract>
<p>In social behavior research, the focus often remains on animal dyads, limiting the understanding of complex interactions. Recent trends favor naturalistic setups, offering unique insights into intricate social behaviors. Social behavior stems from chance, individual preferences, and group dynamics, necessitating high-resolution quantitative measurements and statistical modeling. This study leverages the Eco-HAB system, an automated experimental setup which employs RFID tracking to observe naturally formed mouse cohorts in a controlled yet naturalistic setting, and uses statistical inference models to decipher rules governing the collective dynamics of groups of 10-15 individuals. Applying maximum entropy models unveils social rules in mouse hordes, quantifying sociability through pairwise interactions within groups, exploring how social structure evolves, the impact of individual versus social preferences, and the effects of considering interaction structures among three animals instead of two. Reproducing co-localization patterns of individual mice reveals stability over time, with the inferred interaction strength capturing social structure. By separating interactions from individual preferences, the study demonstrates that altering neuronal plasticity in the prelimbic cortex – the brain structure crucial for sociability – does not eliminate social interactions, but makes the transmission of social information between mice more challenging. The study demonstrates how the joint probability distribution of the mice positions can be used to quantify sociability.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Social behavior is fundamental for numerous animal species, encompassing human societies. From the dynamic spectacle of Mexican waves in a football stadium to the intricate waggle dance of bees, the diverse manifestations of social interaction raise a pivotal question: How do these social behaviors come to fruition, and what roles do individuals play in their emergence?</p>
<p>In recent decades, the exploration of social behavior has predominantly centered around studying animal dyads in controlled laboratory conditions. However, these experimental paradigms inherently impose limitations on investigating intricate social behaviors that often involve more than two interacting individuals. Studies on social interactions frequently employ tests with brief observation periods, during which animals are evaluated in novel environments, accompanied by the presence of an experimenter that induces stress, influencing social behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Recently, there has been a notable shift towards conducting experiments in natural settings, involving animal groups such as flocks of birds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] or swarms of midges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Additionally, semi-naturalistic environments, exemplified by fish in tanks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], marching locusts in arenas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], flocks of sheep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>], and hordes of rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], are increasingly being utilized. These approaches present unique opportunities for the comprehensive quantification of complex social interactions and sociability.</p>
<p>Mice stand out as a valuable model system for delving into the complexities of social behavior, given their intricate manifestation of various social behaviors. They tend to form cohesive groups, showcasing both amicable and agonistic behaviors. Depending on the environmental context, mice demonstrate territoriality and dynamic social hierarchies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Communication among mice is extensive, primarily mediated through odors, allowing them to convey emotional states such as stress, fear, and preferences in food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Additionally, mice exhibit prosocial behaviors, actively assisting distressed fellow mice in need [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Decades of research have extensively explored social interactions between pairs of mice, while the study of mouse groups has only recently become feasible with advancements in high-throughput technologies, particularly radiofrequency identification (RFID) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. The Eco-HAB system, utilized in this study, leverages RFID tracking to observe naturally-formed cohorts of mice in a controlled yet naturalistic environment, enabling longitudinal experiments on sociability with minimal human interference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Social behavior arises from chance, individual preferences, group structure, and the transmission of preferences and interactions among group members. To unravel these elements and understand the establishment of social networks and hierarchies, we need high-resolution quantitative measurements of behavior over extended periods and statistical modeling to capture natural variability. In this study, we integrate Eco-HAB recordings with statistical inference to construct models of collective behavior, focusing on the statistics of system states to identify interaction structures within the group.</p>
<p>The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a crucial role in processing social information, understanding others’ emotions, maintaining social hierarchy, and transmitting information about food safety in both rodents and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Neuronal activity of the PFC is correlated with proximity to conspecifics, and studies in mice reveal distinct PFC responses to social and non-social olfactory stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. The PFC integrates existing knowledge with new information about self and others, demonstrating dynamic neuronal plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. In cognitive tasks involving the PFC and subcortical areas, neuronal connectivity refines more rapidly in the former, highlighting its adaptability to changing environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), particularly TIMP-1, influence synaptic plasticity by inhibiting matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), especially MMP-9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. TIMP-1 is involved in long-term potentiation (LTP), a crucial process for cellular-level memory formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. This sustained release impedes the updating of neuronal connectivity in the prelimbic part of the PFC (PL), crucial for maintaining social structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Our study employs nanoparticles for gradual TIMP-1 release over several days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>] to impact plasticity in the PL on the changes in group behavior.</p>
<p>Maximum entropy models successfully explain social rules governing collective behavior in bird flocks and mouse hordes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. These models help distinguish observed correlations, like the clustering of mice in a specific location, from direct interactions or individual preferences. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>] pioneered the use of these models in studying mouse group behavior, revealing the significance of higher-order interactions in co-localization patterns. While [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>] utilized video tracking of groups of four mice, our Eco-HAB setup employs RFID technology for tracking groups of 10-15 mice, providing more compact data with longer recording times but lower spatial resolution. Our focus is on quantifying sociability in mouse hordes through pairwise interactions within groups, ensuring statistical power. We explore whether interactions between pairs can explain collective behavior and examine how social structure evolves over time. We analyze the effects of individual versus social preferences and investigate the impact of considering three animals instead of two. Using a data analysis approach based on wild type C57BL6/J male and female mice, we discuss social structure and sociability changes in mice with temporary prefrontal cortex plasticity modification.</p>

<title>Recording of mice location in naturalistic environment</title>
<p>Eco-HAB is an automated, ethologically-relevant experimental apparatus that tracts voluntary behavior in group-housed mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Constructed to simulate notable characteristics of natural murine environment, it consists of four connected large compartments, two of which contain food and water (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Cohorts of 10 to 15 mice are introduced into the Eco-HAB, where they behave freely while their locations are tracked over time. The details of used mouse strains and cohorts’ compositions can be found in <bold>Material and Methods</bold>. The compartments are connected with tube-shaped corridors resembling underground tunnels, on whose ends there are 125kHz antennas recording every time a mouse crosses with an accuracy of over 20Hz. Each mouse is tagged with a unique RFID tag. The mice are recorded for 10 days with alternating 12-hour-long light-dark phases that simulate the day-night cycle.</p>

</fig>
<p>The location of each mouse at each time is reconstructed using the time stamps, reducing the data to a discrete time series, <italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> at time <italic>t</italic> = 1, 2, …, <italic>T</italic>, with possible values of the locations <italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> = 1, 2, 3, 4 corresponding to the four compartments. The time resolution for the discretization is set to 2 seconds. As shown by the color-coded location traces in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, the majority of mice are often found in the same compartment, especially in the non-active light phases: this corresponds to the ethological behavior – mice tend to sleep in a pile to keep each other warm (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]). This suggests that the behavior depends on latent variables, i.a. the circadian clock.</p>
<p>To ensure the relative consistency of the analyzed data, we used the observed rate of transitions to measure the activity of each mouse, and choose an analysis window of 6 hours covering the first half of the dark phase (13:00 - 19:00), which corresponds to the most active time on each day for the entire duration of the experiment. The variability of activity across individuals is larger than the day-to-day variability for a single mouse, suggesting that the level of locomotor activity is a well-defined individual characteristic (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>
<sec id="s2a1">
<title>Pairwise interaction model explains the statistics of social behavior</title>
<p>We first establish a quantification of sociability by building probabilistic interaction models for groups of mice. Following previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], we use the in-cohort sociability, which measures the excess probability of two mice being found in the same compartment compared to the case where they are independent. Mathematically, in-cohort sociability is defined as:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="550619v3_eqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="550619v3_inline1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>(<italic>r, r</italic>′) are respectively the empirical frequencies of finding a mouse <italic>i</italic> in compartment <italic>r</italic>, and a pair of mice (<italic>i, j</italic>) in compartments <italic>r, r</italic>′.</p>
<p>As schematically explained in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, in-cohort sociability is due to pairwise interactions between each pair of mice, and modifies how likely they are to be found in each compartment with respect to the mice’s innate preference for that compartment. However, considering the presence of more than two animals, in-cohort sociability is not an effective measure of social structure of the group: two animals with zero attraction to one another can still be found to have a high in-cohort sociability, if a third animal has a strong social bond with both of them, since they all will be spending time with one another.</p>

<caption><title>Mice in Eco-HAB interact pairwisely.</title>
<p>(A, B) The schematics showing pairwise interactions: two mice are more likely to be found in the same compartment than the sum of their individual preference implies (A); also, the probability for three mice being in the same compartment can be predicted from the pairwise interactions (B). (C) From pairwise correlation <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>, defined as the probability for mouse <italic>i</italic> and mouse <italic>j</italic> being in the same compartment (subtracted by the prediction of the independent model), and the probability for mouse <italic>i</italic> to be found in compartment <italic>r</italic> (subtracted by the model where each mouse spends equal amount of time in each of the four compartments), <italic>m</italic><sub><italic>ir</italic></sub> <italic>−</italic> 1<italic>/</italic>4, pairwise maximum entropy model learns the interaction strength between a pair of mice, <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>, and the local field <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="550619v3_inline15.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, which gives the tendency for each mouse in each compartment. The data shown is the aggregated 5-day data from day 1 to day 5 of the C57 males (cohort M1). The pairwise maximum entropy model can predict higher order statistical structures of the data (schematics in panel B), such as the probability for triplets of mice being in the same compartment (subtracted by the prediction of the independent model, mathematically <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>ijk</italic></sub>(<italic>r, r, r</italic>) <italic>− f</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>r</italic>)<italic>f</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>(<italic>r</italic>)<italic>f</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>(<italic>r</italic>)) (D), and the probability of <italic>K</italic> mice being found in the same compartment (E). (F) Conditional log-likelihood of mouse locations, predicted by the pairwise model (<italic>l</italic><sup>(1,2)</sup>), the independent model (<italic>l</italic><sup>(1)</sup>), and the null model assuming no compartment preference or interactions (<italic>l</italic><sup>(0)</sup>, the yellow line), for each mice (cohort M1 before TIMP-1 treatment, <italic>N</italic> = 15).</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="550619v3_fig2.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>Since measurements of location preference, and the incohort sociability, together with the dynamical observables such as the rate of activity, are stable over time (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">SI Fig. S1</xref>) it invites a quantitative modeling of the joint-probability distribution of the co-localization of mice.</p>
<p>To distinguish social structure interactions from the effective correlations that define in-cohort sociability, we build a maximum entropy model with pairwise interactions. This approach constrains the joint probability distribution of all the possible co-localization patterns of all mice to reproduce the empirical occupation frequencies <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="550619v3_inline2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and the in-cohort sociability <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="550619v3_inline3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, while otherwise remaining as random as possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. With these assumptions, the joint probability distribution of the mice co-localization patterns can be written as
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="550619v3_eqn2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>h</italic><sub><italic>ir</italic></sub> is the individual preference of mouse <italic>i</italic> to be in compartment <italic>r</italic>, and <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> is the interaction between mouse <italic>i</italic> and mouse <italic>j</italic>. The set of parameters (<italic>{h</italic><sub><italic>ir</italic></sub>, <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub><italic>}</italic>) is learned through gradient descent (see <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">SI Fig. S2</xref> and <bold>Materials and Methods</bold> for details). The interactions <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> may be positive or negative. We see that although the structure of the interactions <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> follows that of incohort sociability <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>, they are not identical (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">SI Fig. S3</xref>). Likewise, individual mice preferences <italic>h</italic><sub><italic>ir</italic></sub> are not equal to the occupation probability <italic>m</italic><sub><italic>ir</italic></sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Thus, this approach allows us to distinguish direct interactions from indirect ones.</p>
<p>To validate the model, we tested that it is able to predict higher order features of the data, such as the probability of a specific combination of triplets of mice being in the same compartment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2BD</xref>), and the probability of observing <italic>K</italic> mice in the same compartment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>), with the overestimation at large <italic>K</italic> possibly due to the limit of finite data. Although the model assumes the strength of interaction does not depend on which compartment the mice are in, our minimal model can predict probability of <italic>K</italic> mice in certain compartments (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">SI Fig. S4</xref>, compartments 1 and 3). We call in-state probability the distribution of box occupancy of each mouse given the position of all other mice (see <bold>Material and Methods</bold>). The model prediction for in-state probabilities match the observed one, showing that the model gives an unbiased estimate of individual mouse positions <xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">SI Fig. S5</xref>). Moreover, models with triplet interactions show signs of overfitting under cross-validation, which is mitigated when the triplet interactions are suppressed close to zero using L2 regularization (see <bold>Material and Methods</bold> and <xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">SI Fig. S6</xref>). These results show that pairwise interaction among mice are sufficient to assess the observed collective behavior.</p>

<sec id="s2a2">
<title>Choosing timescales for analysis</title>
<p>To construct an interaction model based on the steady state distribution, we first need to consider the proper timescales for which we average over the observables, i.e. mean and correlation of the mice co-localization patterns. If the timescale is too short, then the error of estimation may be large. More severely, the system may not have enough time to equilibrate, and the time average will not result in the steady state distribution. On the other hand, if the timescale is too long, we loose biologically meaningful information about the temporal evolution of the system, such as the adaptation of the mice in a new environment and evolution of the social interaction strength.</p>
<p>To identify the proper timescale, we systematically conduct cross-validation for pairwise maximum entropy models constructed using <italic>K</italic> days of data, where <italic>K</italic> = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, and each day of the data contains the 6 hours when the mice are most active. The data is then separated into training sets that consist of 5-hours of the data from each day and test sets that consist of 1-hour of the data each day. Pairwise maximum entropy models with L2 regularization with strength <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>J</italic></sub> imposed on the pairwise interactions are learned from the training set, and the training- and the test-set likelihoods are computed. As shown in <xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">SI Fig. S7</xref>, the test-set likelihood decreases as the regularization strength increases for cumulate data with number of days <italic>K≥</italic> 4, indicating that the pairwise model generalizes well. We choose <italic>K</italic> = 5 for subsequent analysis, as it does not overfit, and it gives us temporal information about how the interaction structures may change over the 10-day experiment.</p>

<p>As shown in <xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">SI Fig. S8</xref>, for all four cohorts, the box preference tendency is consistent, with a Pearson’s correlation coefficient between models learned from the first and the last five days being 0.6 <italic>±</italic> 0.1. For cohort M1, M3 and M4, the distribution of the individual chamber preferences is consistent over time, with the two-sample <italic>F</italic> - test for equal variance being non-significant, and the two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test for equal mean being either non-significant or with a <italic>p</italic>-value of 0.04 for cohort M1. For cohort M2, both the mean and the variance of the chamber preferences significantly changed between the first and the last 5 days of the experiment. Nonetheless, the Pearson’s correlation between the two data segments remain large at <italic>p</italic> = 0.57, indicating a consistency over time for the same cohort. Different cohorts exhibit different distributions of chamber preferences.</p>
<p>For the inferred interaction parameters <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>, the distribution is consistent between the first 5 days and the last 5 days of the data. Specifically, for all four cohorts, the standard deviations of the interactions do not change between the first 5 days and the last 5 days of the data, as shown by two-sample <italic>F</italic> -test for equal variance. The mean of the inferred interactions does not change for cohort M1 and M3, however for cohort M2 and M4, two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test for equal mean returns a <italic>p</italic> = 0.0034 and <italic>p</italic> = 0.0073 respectively for the interactions. Notably, across from the four different cohorts, two-sample <italic>F</italic> -test with Bonferroni correction shows that the variance of all eight 5-day modeling are not significantly different. In contrast, cross-cohort comparison between male (cohort M1 before drug injection) and female (cohort F1 before drug injection) shows significantly different variance (<italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.01 between the last 5 days of F1 and the first 5 days or the last 5 days of M1) and mean (<italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001) of the inferred interaction strength, which shows that these measures of sociability can be used to distinguish strains or genders. Nonetheless, the strengths of the individual interactions in the specific pairs of mice <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j, J</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>, vary more notably, as given by Pearson’s correlation coefficient 0.015 <italic>±</italic> 0.165 (see <xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">SI Fig. S8C</xref>). This implies that the maximum entropy model does not infer a social structure that is stable over time.</p>

<title>Quantifying the influence of social versus individual preferences</title>
<p>Further, we ask how important social interactions are for determining mice behavior, by measuring how much the data can be explained by the individual preferences for specific spaces within the territory vs. the interactions with other mice. Mice are social animals, yet they perform many behaviors based on their individual moment-to-moment needs, and it is unclear <italic>a priori</italic> how much the social interactions influence mice behavior in comparison to their individual preference.</p>
<p>For each mouse <italic>i</italic>, we consider three nested models with increasing descriptive power: first, the null model assuming each mouse has the same probability of being found in each compartment, <italic>P</italic> <sup>(0)</sup>(<italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) = 1<italic>/</italic>4; second, the independent model that assumes no interactions among mice, and the probability of finding each mouse in each compartment is solely determined by their individual preferences, <italic>P</italic> <sup>(1)</sup>(<italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) = <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>); third, the inferred pairwise interaction model based on voluntarily spending time with other mice considered, <italic>P</italic> <sup>(2)</sup>(<italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> |<italic>{σ</italic><sub><italic>j≠i</italic></sub> <italic>}</italic>), using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. 2</xref>.</p>
<p>We then quantified how well each model explains the data by comparing the mean log-likelihoods of finding a mouse in a given compartment, conditioned on the location of all other mice. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>, including information on pairwise interactions increases the log-likelihood of the data by as much as including information on individual compartment preferences, as shown by the similar values of the probability ratios <italic>P</italic> <sup>(2)</sup><italic>/P</italic> <sup>(1)</sup> and <italic>P</italic> <sup>(1)</sup><italic>/P</italic> <sup>(0)</sup>. The likelihood is consistent between the first five days and the last five days of the experiment, but exhibits variability across different cohorts of animals within the same strain (<xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">SI Fig. S9</xref>).</p>
<p>Another possible measure of sociability is the mutual information between a single mouse’s location within the territory and the location of the rest of the cohort, which tells us how accurately the position of a single mouse can be predicted if the positions of all other mice are known (see details in <bold>Material and Methods</bold>). The possible values of the mutual information is between 0 and 2 bits, where 0 bits means no predictability, and 2 bits means perfect predictability. In our Eco-HAB data, the average mutual information for each mouse is 0.0323<italic>±</italic> 0.0151(SD) bits for cohort M1, with the largest value being 0.06 bits, indicating that despite non-zero sociability, the precise mouse position at any single moment is difficult to predict from the network.</p>

<title>Effect of impairing neuronal plasticity in the PL on subterritory preferences and sociability</title>
<p>As a next step we investigate the effects of impairing neuronal plasticity in the prelimbic cortex (PL), the brain structure containing neural circuits indispensable for both maintaining proper social interactions and encoding individual preferences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. To that end, we inject animals with a Tissue Inhibitor of MetalloProteinases (TIMP-1), an enzyme regulating the activity of synaptic plasticity proteins. Changing its physiological levels was previously shown to disrupt the neuronal plasticity in various brain structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>], including the prefrontal cortex (PFC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. Now, we ask if we can identify changes in behavioral patterns after the mice have been injected with nanoparticles (NP) gradually releasing TIMP-1 (NP-TIMP-1) into the PL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. It has been demonstrated in the Eco-HAB that it can reduce the mice’s interest in chasing other animals (a proxy for their social ranks), and diminish persistence in seeking reward related to social olfactory cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. Here, we measure the behavior of a cohort of <italic>N</italic> = 15 C57BL6/J mice, before and after the injection of NP-TIMP-1. A cohort of mice is introduced into the Eco-HAB and their free behavior is measured for 10 days (see schematics in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Then, neuronal activity in the PL of the subjects is impaired by injecting nanoparticles releasing TIMP-1 into the PL. After recovery animals are re-introduced into the Eco-HAB, and their behavior is measured for another 10 days. As a control we also have a cohort (male cohort M4, <italic>N</italic> = 9) that is injected with nanoparticles loaded with bovine serum albumin, a physiologically neutral substance having no impact on neuronal plasticity (BSA, vehicle). The detailed experimental procedure can be found in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. To provide a perspective on both sexes, a female cohort is also included in this study (female cohort F1, <italic>N</italic> = 13); it was processed identically to the experimental group of males described above. For each five days of the experiment, we infer a pairwise model (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">eq. 2</xref>) and study the changes of the inferred interactions, as well as individual preferences for specific spaces within the territory. The choice of five-day aggregated data for analysis is in line both with the proper timescales needed for the pairwise maximum entropy model to not overfit, and with the literature that TIMP-1 release from the TIMP-1-loaded nanoparticles is stable for 7-10 days after injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>] (i.e. 2-5 days after the mice are reintroduced to Eco-HAB).</p>

<p>We can assess the change in both the interaction strength <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> and the individual preferences for the compartments containing food Δ<italic>h</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> following the prolonged release of TIMP-1. The individual preferences for compartment containing food shows an increase in both its mean and its variance across all mice following treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>), with a return to pre-treatment levels after five days, consistent with the time course of TIMP-1 release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. In comparison, the control cohort M4 shows the increase in preference for the compartments containing food after injection of the BSA-loaded nanoparticles, which does not return to base level after 5 days (<xref rid="figS10" ref-type="fig">SI Fig. S10C</xref>). For the interaction strength, as shown by <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, the variability of interactions <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> is not significantly different before and after the TIMP-1 injection for the male cohort M1 (two-samples <italic>F</italic> -test for equal variance with Bonferroni correction; see <bold>Materials and Methods</bold>), although there exists a few outliers with strong interactions, which again returns to base level after 5 days of TIMP-1 injection. The increase of interaction variability is significant in the female cohort, when comparing the first 5 days after treatment with the first 5 days before treatment (<xref rid="figS11" ref-type="fig">SI Fig. S11</xref>), and is not observed for the male BSA cohort M4 (<xref rid="figS10" ref-type="fig">SI Fig. S10</xref>). We can also ask how TIMP-1 induced modification of PL plasticity affects individual mice, by comparing the pairwise specific interactions <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> before and after drug treatment. However, we cannot conclude much as Pearson’s correlation coefficient between <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> shows almost no significant correlation across the four time periods in the above datasets for both the TIMP-1 treated cohort and the BSA-treated control cohort (<xref rid="figS12" ref-type="fig">SI Fig. S12</xref>).</p>
<p>To quantify the sociability of the entire cohort, we compute conditional likelihoods as introduced in the previous paragraphs, as it measures how much the pairwise model explains the observed data compared to a model where mice behave independently. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref> shows that for cohort M1, the model’s likelihoods sharply increase following treatment, meaning that the behavior is more predictable. Represented by the independent model, the individual compartment preferences explain most of this increase, suggesting that TIMP-1 treatment reorganizes preferences for specific subterritories. These differences decay back to pre-treatment levels after 5 days, following the time course of drug release. A slightly smaller increase in model’s likelihood is observed in the control cohort M4 after BSA injection (<xref rid="figS10" ref-type="fig">SI Fig. S10D</xref>), suggesting that at least part of the change in compartment preferences can be due to the injection procedure rather than change in the neuronal plasticity itself. In contrast, the increasing model likelihood is not found in the female cohort F1, where the conditional likelihood remains constant after TIMP-1 treatment. However, the contribution of the pairwise interaction is increased (<xref rid="figS11" ref-type="fig">SI Fig. S11E</xref>), which points to a sex specificity of observed effects.</p>
<p>This observation is further confirmed by the sociability measure of mutual information between single mouse location and the positions of the rest of the cohort, which was introduced in previous paragraphs. The mutual information either does not change (for the male cohort M1, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>), or increases (for the female cohort F1, <xref rid="figS11" ref-type="fig">SI Fig. S11</xref>) after the injection of TIMP-1.</p>

<title>Impaired neuronal plasticity in the PL affects the structure of social interactions</title>
<p>The increasing variability of pairwise interactions and the non-decreasing mutual information between single mouse location and the location of the rest of the group upon TIMP-1 requires further investigation in the face of previous results showing that injecting TIMP-1 to the PL of wide type animals reduces their sociability. Thus, we examined the detailed group structure of pairwise interactions. We define the dissatisfaction triplet index (DTI) among a triplet of mice as <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>ijk</italic></sub> <italic>≡ − J</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub><italic>J</italic><sub><italic>jk</italic></sub><italic>J</italic><sub><italic>ki</italic></sub> if and only if among the three pairwise interactions among mice <italic>i, j</italic> and <italic>k</italic>, exactly one of them is negative (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> for schematics), and otherwise zero. Notice that DTI is analogous to the concept of “frustration” in physics of disordered systems. A positive DTI means a triplet of pairwise interactions where all of them cannot be satisfied simultaneously – for instance, if mouse <italic>i</italic> likes to be with <italic>j</italic> and <italic>k</italic>, but <italic>j</italic> and <italic>k</italic> do not like to be together. We define the global DTI by averaging the local DTI’s across all possible triplets of mice. The larger the global DTI is for a cohort, the more difficult it is for the cohort to form cliques with multiple mice where the interactions among each possible pairs are positive, which may suggest possible difficulty in transmitting information between mice.</p>

<p>As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, PL-targeted plasticity disruption with TIMP-1 significantly increases the global DTI for the male mice cohort M1 and the female cohort F1 (two-sample Welch’s <italic>t</italic>-test, variability from random halves of the data; see <bold>Materials and Methods</bold> for details of the significant test). In contrast, in the control cohort M4, injecting male mice with BSA either does not significantly change the global DTI or decreases it. Notably, the difference of the DTI is not due to the control group M4 has less mice, as subsampling both on the level of the inferred interactions (<xref rid="figS13" ref-type="fig">SI Fig. S13</xref>) and on the level of the mice locations (<xref rid="figS14" ref-type="fig">SI Fig. S14</xref>) give the same DTI for cohorts M1 and F1. This increase of the global DTI is due to the increasing variance of the interaction <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>, which is related to more of the negative interactions. Randomly shuffling <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> does not change the global DTI, indicating that no network structure was found that contributes to this global DTI (<xref rid="figS15" ref-type="fig">SI Fig. S15</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We demonstrate how the joint probability distribution of the mice positions in the Eco-HAB can be used to quantify sociability. By building a pairwise interaction model whose parameters are learned directly from the data, we quantify how much the combined activities of all mice in the cohort are influenced by their individual preferences and how much by the social context. This approach shows that pairwise interactions between mice are sufficient to describe the statistics of collective behavior in larger groups. Additionally, the pairwise interaction model can capture changes in the social interactions of the network induced by alterations in the neuronal plasticity of the prelimbic cortex (PL) in the tested subjects. The Eco-HAB, combined with this analytical approach, provides a toolbox to quantify sociability in mice, which can be applied generally to different mouse strains to study various behavioral phenotypes, including characteristics associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. Compared to traditional experimental methods like the three-chamber test, our study combines the advantages of an ecologically relevant and automatic experimental apparatus with the powerful tools of statistical inference. This disentangles the effects of individual preferences versus pairwise social interactions in generating the patterns of mouse positions within their territory.</p>
<p>The challenge in studying social behavior lies in finding a balance between being specific enough to capture the properties of sociability while avoiding the loss of generalizability. Including excessive details, such as the classification of precise social behavior among mice, may lead to a more accurate description of the specific mice cohort studied, such as the construction of a precise social network. However, it is difficult to assess comparability across different cohorts of mice. Alternatively, as used in this paper, one can construct minimal models and use the ensemble statistics of the models to quantify social properties of a mouse strain without explicitly constructing social networks for each cohort. For example, our study found that the inferred interaction has similar ensemble statistics across four different male cohorts of the same strain but differs across different sexes. This provides evidence to support our argument for a coarse-grained description of mouse social behavior.</p>
<p>Another challenge in studying social behavior lies in the interplay of timescales. We found in this paper that in order to gather enough statistics and to avoid over-fitting, we need to construct probabilistic models using aggregated five-day data, which poses a challenge to balance model construction with enough data versus studying the temporal evolution of sociability. Is the variability of the social network a true property of the social interaction of the mice cohort, or is it due to variabilities of the inferred model caused by the finite data? To address this question, one needs to consider various timescales. For example, mice-mice interactions occur at a much shorter timescale compared to the timescale of changes in the social network, while in between, there are the timescales of adaptation to the new environment and the circadian cycle. These issues need to be addressed using a combination of theoretical tools and experimental validation methods in future works.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have simplified our analysis by focusing on a 6-hour time window each day, during which the rate of locomotor activity is most stable. This approach allowed us to circumvent issues related to individual or strain differences in the circadian cycle, such as the observed “lunch hour” in C57 male mice. One avenue for future research involves reintroducing the circadian cycle as a latent variable to better explain the system. However, caution must be exercised to differentiate between group behavior influenced by the circadian cycle of individual mice and emergent behavior resulting from interactions.</p>
<p>We will now discuss the relationship between our study and that of Shemesh et al., wherein the authors applied a similar approach, investigating the social behavior of groups of 4 mice in a complex experimental environment using statistical modeling of the joint probability distribution of mice locations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. They found that triplet interactions are necessary to describe collective behavior, while we found that triplet interactions can be predicted by the pairwise model. We suspect the difference in our results could arise from three factors. First, the experimental arena is quite different between the Eco-HAB and what was used in Shemesh et al. – while the Eco-HAB mimics a naturalistic environment with tubes and connected chambers, the experimental arena in Shemesh et al. contains only one chamber, which could cause a difference in how mice interact. Second, even if the interaction patterns do not change, the nature of the data is different: our data is more coarse-grained spatially, as the state of each mouse is determined by the large compartment it is in, whereas in Shemesh et al., the location is more precise (e.g., a door, a pillar, etc.). As suggested by a comparison to renormalization theory in physics, at coarser spatial scales, the importance of higher-order interactions is likely to decrease. Finally, our studies include more mice (10 to 15) compared to Shemesh et al. (4 mice), which may also influence the importance of higher-order interactions. Larger group size also means that including triplet interactions in our model causes overfitting, which restricts the models we have access to to pairwise interactions. To further investigate these effects, future experiments in Eco-HAB could include mice cohorts of smaller sizes.</p>
<p>How do we move forward, and what is the ideal experiment to study social behaviors? We believe that Eco-HAB offers a balance between a semi-natural environment and controllability, which works well in studying social behavior. One direction for future experimental studies is to focus on the biological function of social interactions. For example, how do mouse cohorts respond to novel odors and transmit information among the cohort? What is the speed of information transmission related to sociability? The current configuration of the Eco-HAB already allows for the introduction of novel odors accessible to all mice, while the next generation of experiments will localize the introduction of information to individuals. From the analysis perspective, as presented in this manuscript, our current model is purely static. Our model describes the joint probability distribution of mice positions within the territory at concurrent time points and does not model the dynamics of the cohort. To take into account the dynamic aspect of social behaviors, such as dominant mice actively chasing others, one will need to build dynamical models of interaction. For example, this can be done by modeling the probability of transitioning to another compartment of each mouse as a function of the history of its previous location and the locations of all other mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>].</p>

<p>The raw data consists of time points when mice cross an antenna, as well as the identity of the specific antenna, which are placed at the ends of the four tunnels. The location of a mouse at any given time point is deduced from the most recent time stamps before and after the current time point. For simplicity, for the time points when a mouse is in the tunnel, the location of the mouse is set to be the compartment it will enter. The time resolution is set to 2 seconds, as two adjacent time stamps with separation less than 2 seconds are likely an artifact of mice sniffing the tunnel and returning to the previous compartment.</p>

<title>Pseudocounts</title>
<p>Observing the mice for a finite amount of time means sometimes we have the situation where the mice is stuck in the same compartment for the entire 6 hours of observation. This is not common, but this messes up our statistical inference or model building procedure. To avoid this situation, we use pseudocounts that smoothen the observed statistics. We define

where <italic>q</italic> = 4 is the number of possible states, <italic>T</italic> is the total number of time points in the data, and <italic>λ</italic> is the parameter for the pseudocount.

<title>Compute mutual information between single mouse position and the rest of the network</title>
<p>The mutual information between single mouse position and the rest of the network is a measure of collectiveness. For Eco-HAB with 4 compartments, the mutual information is between 0 and 2 bits. If the mutual information is close to 2 bits, knowing where other mice are is a perfect predictor for the position of single mouse. If the mutual information is close to 0 bits, knowing where other mice are do not help predicting the position of the singled-out mouse. The mutual information can be computed as the difference of the entropy of mouse <italic>i</italic> and the conditional entropy of mouse <italic>i</italic> with respect to the state of all other mice. Mathematically,

<title>Maximum entropy model with triplet interactions</title>
<p>To model the joint probability distribution of mice colocalization pattern, one could in principle increase the number of constrains when constructing the maximum entropy model.

The corresponding maximum entropy model has the probability distribution

For a cohort with <italic>N</italic> mice, the numbers of parameters for triplet interactions is <italic>N</italic> (<italic>N−</italic> 1)(<italic>N−</italic> 2)<italic>/</italic>6. To avoid overfitting, we applied a L2 regularization on the triplet interaction strength, where we now minimize the objective function
<disp-formula id="ueqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="550619v3_ueqn2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
This is naturally translated to learning steps: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="550619v3_inline13.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="550619v3_inline14.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. The stopping condition is the same as before, focusing on the difference between the model predicted correlation and magnetization being less than the data variability, and that the mean and variation of the inferred pairwise interaction reach a stable value.</p>
<p>To test the validity of a triplet interaction model, we varied the regularization strength <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub>. For our largest dataset, the cumulative data consist of all 10 days of the experiment on cohort M1 (<italic>N</italic> = 15), we performed cross-validation by splitting the 6-hour data into 6 different training-test set combo (5 hours of data in training set, and 1 hour in the test set). As shown by <xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">SI Fig. S6</xref>, the test set likelihood is found to be maximized when the regularization parameter <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub> is large, which corresponds to close to zero triplet interactions. This indicates that even for our largest datasets, including the triplet interactions in the model have increased the model complexity beyond what the data allows, and the best way to avoid overfitting is for us to not consider triplet interactions. Hence, the interaction models we choose to study in this manuscript is restricted to pairwise interaction models.</p>

<p>The authors have constructively responded to previous referee comments and I believe that the manuscript is a useful addition to the literature. I particularly appreciate the quantitative approach to social behavior, but have two cautionary comments.</p>
<p>(1) Conceptually it is important to further justify why this particular maximum entropy model is appropriate. Maximum entropy models have been applied across a dizzying array of biological systems, including genes, neurons, the immune system, as well as animal behavior, so would seem quite beneficial to explain the particular benefits here, for mouse social behavior as coarse-grained through the eco-hab chamber occupancy. This would be an excellent chance to amplify what the models can offer for biological understanding, particularly in the realm of social behavior</p>
<p>(2) Maximum entropy models of even intermediate size systems involve a large number of parameters. The authors are transparent about that limitation here, but I still worry that the conclusion of the sufficiency of pairwise interactions is simply not general, and this may also relate to the differences from previous work. If, as the authors suggest in the discussion, this difference is one of a choice of variables, then that point could be emphasized. The suggestion of a follow up study with a smaller number of mice is excellent.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Chen et al. present a thorough statistical analysis of social interactions, more precisely, co-occupying the same chamber in the Eco-HAB measurement system. They also test the effect of manipulating the prelimbic cortex by using TIMP-1 that inhibits the MMP-9 matrix metalloproteinase. They conclude that altering neural plasticity in the prelimbic cortex does not eliminate social interactions, but it strongly impacts social information transmission.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The quantitative approach to analyzing social interactions is laudable and the study is interesting. It demonstrates that the Eco-HAB can be used for high throughput, standardized and automated tests of the effects of brain manipulations on social structure in large groups of mice.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A demonstration of TIMP-1 impairing neural plasticity specifically in the prelimbic cortex of the treated animals would greatly strengthen the biological conclusions. The Eco-HAB provides coarser spatial information compared to some other approaches, which may influence the conclusions.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Chen et al. investigate the statistical structure of social interactions among mice living together in the ECO-Hab. They use maximum entropy models (MEM) from statistical physics that include individual preferences and pair-wise interactions among mice to describe their collective behavior. They also use this model to track the evolution of these preferences and interactions across time and in one group of mice injected with TIMP-1, an enzyme regulating synaptic plasticity. The main result is that they can explain group behavior (the probability of being together in one compartment) by a MEM that only includes pair-wise interactions. Moreover, the impact of TIMP-1 is to increase the variance of the couplings J_ij, the preference for the compartment containing food, as well as the dissatisfaction triplet index (DTI).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The ECO-Hab is a really nice system to ask questions about the sociability of mice and to tease apart sociability from individual preference. Moreover, combining the ECO-Hab with the use of MEM is a powerful and elegant approach that can help statistically characterize complex interactions between groups of mice -- an important question that requires fine quantitative analysis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, there is a risk in interpreting these models. In my view, several of the comparisons established in the current study would require finer and more in-depth analysis to be able to establish firmer conclusions (see below). Also, the current study, which closely resembles previous work by Shemesh et al., finds a different result but does not provide the same quantitative model comparison included there, nor a conclusive explanation of why their results are different. In total, I felt that some of the results required more solid statistical testing and that some of the conclusions of the paper were not entirely justified. In particular, the results from TIMP-1 require proper interaction tests (group x drug) which I couldn't find. This is particularly important when the control group has a smaller N than the drug groups.</p>

<p>We would like to thank the reviewer and the editor for carefully reading our manuscript, and acknowledging the strength of combining quantitative analysis with semi-naturalistic experiments on mice social behavior. Thanks to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have improved our manuscript by</p>
<p>(1) A proper comparison with Shemesh et al., especially to include maximum entropy models with triplet interactions. We show that triplet models overfit even given the entire 10 day dataset, which limits our study to look at pairwise interactions.</p>
<p>(2) Results on cross-validation for both triplet interaction models and pairwise interaction models, completed on aggregates of various length of days. This analysis showed that pairwise models overfit for single-day data, and led us to learn pairwise models only on 5day aggregation of data. We have updated the manuscript (both the text and the figures) to present these results.</p>
<p>(3) New results that subsample the drug groups to the same size as the control group. The conclusions about TIMP-1 treated mice hordes hold when we compare groups of the same size.</p>

The comparison with the cited previous work of Shemesh et al. 2013 rests novelty to the use of ME models in characterizing social interactions between groups of mice as well as sheds doubts on the main claim of the manuscript, namely that second-order correlations are sufficient to describe the joint distribution of occupancies of all mice (in particular triplets; there is no quantification of the variance explained by model in panel Fig. 2D). In my view, to make the claim &quot;These results show that pairwise interaction among mice are sufficient to assess the observed collective behavior&quot;, the authors should compare models with 2nd and 3rd order interactions and quantify how much of the total correlation can be explained by pair-wise interactions, triplet interactions, and so on. Without a proper model comparison, it is unclear how the authors can make such a claim. One thing observed by Shemesh et al. is that, on average, J_ij are negative. This does not seem to be the case in the current study and the authors should discuss why.</p>
<p>Finally, the explanation provided in the Discussion about this discrepancy (spatial resolution and different group size) are not completely satisfactory. With more animals, one would imagine that the impact of higher order correlations would increase (and not decrease) as the number of terms of 3rd, 4th, ... order will be very big. I would also think that the same could be true for the spatial scale: assessing interactions with a coarser spatial grid (whole cages in the case of the ECO-Hab) would allow for simultaneous interactions among more mice to happen compared with a situation in which the spatial grid is so small that only a few animals can fit in each subdivision.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the recommendation. In the updated version of the manuscript, we explicitly learn the triplet interaction model. We show that because the number of mice in our experiment is much larger than Shemesh et al., a triplet model runs into the problem of overfitting.</p>
<p>In particular, we found that the test set likelihood increases monotonically when the L2 regularization strength increases, which corresponds to a suppression of the triplet interaction strength (see additional supplementary figure, now Figure 2 - figure supplement 5). More specifically, for the range of regularization strength (β<sub>G</sub>) we tested (10<sup>-1</sup> &lt; β<sub>G</sub> &lt; 10<sup>1</sup>), the maximum test set likelihood is achieved at β<sub>G</sub> = 10<sup>1</sup>, which corresponds to <inline-formula id="sa3equ1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-94999-sa3-equ1.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula>. Notice that those learned triplet interactions are very close to zero. This means we should select a model with pairwise interactions over a model with triplet interactions.</p>
<p>We have added the above reasoning in page 5, line 166-169 of the Results section with the sentence “Moreover, models with triplet interactions show signs of overfitting under crossvalidation, which is mitigated when the triplet interactions are suppressed close to zero using L2 regularization”,  a new subsection “Maximum entropy model with triplet interactions” in Materials and Methods (page 16-17, line 548 - 563) to describe the protocols of learning and crossvalidation for these triplet interaction models.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we extended the discussion about the difference between Shemesh et al. and our results in the Discussion section. In addition to the difference of spatial scales (chamber vs. location in the chamber), and the difference of group size and its impact on data analysis (N = 15 in our largest cohort and N = 4 in theirs), we added a discussion about the difference of experimental arena, which in Eco-HAB contains connected chambers that mimic the naturalistic environment, and in Shemesh et al. contains a single chamber. The change in the text is on page 12, between line 390 and line 394.</p>
<p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out that the mean 2nd order interaction in Shemesh et al. is negative. One possibility is that the labeled areas in Shemesh et al. are much smaller than in our Eco-HAB setup, which could suggest that mice do have the space to stay in the same area, which will lead to a negative mean 2nd order interaction.</p>

<p>(2) ASSESSMENT OF THE TEMPORAL EVOLUTION OF THE INTERACTIONS. The analysis of the stability of the social structure is not conclusive. First, I don't think the authors can conclude that &quot;These results suggest that the structure of social interactions in a cohort as a whole is consistent across all days.&quot; If anything is preserved, they would be the statistics of that structure but not the structure itself (i.e., there is no evidence for that). The comparison of the stability of the mean &lt;h_i&gt; and the mean &lt;J_ik&gt; would also require a statistical test to be able to state that &quot;Delta h_i changed more strongly from day to day (Fig. 3D, top panel) relative to the interaction measured as the Jij's.&quot; The same is true for the assessment of the TIMP: the differences found in the variability in J_ij and in the mean and variance of the h_i's, look noisy and would require a proper statistical test. The traces look quite variable across days in the control condition, so assessing differences may be difficult. Finally, it would be good to know if the variability in individual J_ij is because they truly vary from day to day or because estimating them within one day is difficult (statistical error). If the reason is the latter, one could decrease the temporal resolution to 2-3 days and see whether the estimated J_ijs are more stable. Perhaps, also for that reason, the summed interaction strength J_i is also more stable, simply because it aggregates more data and has a smaller statistical error.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the necessity of assessing the temporal evolution of the interactions. The problem of shorter data duration leads to more noise in the estimation, together with the reviewer’s Comment 4 about the risk of overfitting, led us to add a new Results subsection “Choosing timescales for analysis” (page 6, line 171 to line 189). Specifically, we assess whether the pairwise maximum entropy model overfits using data from _K-_day aggregates, by computing the log-likelihood of both the training sets and the test sets,which is chosen to be 1 hour from the 6 hour data window of each day. We found that for single day data, the pairwise maximum entropy model overfits. In contrast, for data with aggregates of more or equal to 4 days of data, the pairwise model does not overfit. This new result is supported by an additional supplementary figure, now Figure 2 - figure supplement 6.</p>
<p>To be consistent with later approaches in the manuscript where we consider the effects of TIMP1, we choose the analysis windows to be data aggregates from 5 days. This means for the experiment that collects a total of 10 days of data, there are only two time points, thus a study of the temporal evolution is limited to comparison between the first 5 days and the last 5 days of the experiment. We describe these results in the Results subsection “Stability of sociability over time” (page 6, line 190 - 220). An additional supplementary figure, now Figure 2 - figure supplement 7, shows in details the comparison of the inferred interaction strength J and the chamber preference between the first 5 days and the last 5 days for the 4 cohorts of male C57BL6/J mice, which shows the inferred interactions have a consistent variability across first and last 5 days, and across all cohorts. The small value of Pearsons’ correlation coefficient shows that the exact structure (pairspecific J<sub>ij</sub>) is not stable. At the end of the Results subsection “Stability of sociability over time”, we explicitly say that “This implies that the maximum entropy model does not infer a social structure that is stable over time.”</p>

<p>(3) EFFECT OF TIMP-1. The reported effects of TIMP-1 on the variance of the J_ij seem very small and possibly caused by a few outlier J_ijs (perhaps from one or two animals) which</p>
<p>are not present in the control group which seems to have fewer animals (N = 9 minus two mice that died after the surgery vs. N = 14 in the drug group), so the lack of a significant difference in the sigma[J_ij] could simply be due to a smaller N (a test for the interaction group x drug was not done).</p>
<p>The clearest effect of TIMP-1 seems to be a change in place preference (h_i) and not the interaction terms (J_ij) (Fig. 3F bottom). But this could be explained by a number of factors that have nothing to do with sociability such as that recovery from surgery makes them eat more/less. The fact that it seems to be present, as recognized by the authors, in the control group with no TIMP-1 and that this effect was not observed in the female group F1, puts into question the specificity and reproducibility of the result.</p>
<p>Finally, the effect of TIMP-1 in the DTI would require more statistics (testing the interaction group x drug). The fact that the control group has fewer animals (N = 9 vs. 15 and 13 in the drug groups), and that there is a weaker trend in the DTI of the control group to start high and then decrease, makes this test necessary.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Now, after we select a proper timescale to learn the pairwise maximum entropy model, we update the manuscript to present results only on 5-day aggregation of data (see updated Figure 3, updated supplementary figures, Figure 3 - figure supplement 1 and 2). For the variance of the J<sub>ij</sub>, the F-test between different 5-day aggregates before and after TIMP for the male drug group now shows a nonsignificant p-value after applying the Bonferroni correction. For the female drug group, the difference of the J<sub>ij</sub> variance is still significant.</p>
<p>To test the effect of different group size on DTI, we subsampled the drug groups by 1) subsampling the inferred interactions learned from the original N = 15 or N = 13 data, or 2) subsampling the mice colocalization data and then inferring the pairwise interactions.  In both cases, the resulting DTI for the subsampled drug group still exhibits the same global pattern as before, i.e. after TIMP-1 injection, DTI significantly increases, which after 5 days falls back to the baseline level. The results are supported by two additional supplementary figures, Figure 4 - figure supplement 1 and 2. This result is referred to in the text in the Results subsection “Impaired neuronal plasticity in the PL affects the structure of social interactions” (page 10, line 333 - 336): “Notably, the difference of the DTI is not due to the control group M4 has less mice, as subsampling both on the level of the inferred interactions (Figure 4 - figure supplement 1) and on the level of the mice locations (Figure 4 - figure supplement 2) give the same DTI for cohorts M1 and F1.”</p>

<p>(4) MODEL COMPARISON. Any quantitative measure of &quot;goodness&quot; of the model , (i.e., comparison of the predictions of the model with triplet frequency as well as the distribution of p(K)) should be cross-validated. In particular, Fig. S2 needs to be cross-validated for the goodness of fit to be properly quantified. Is the analysis shown in Fig. 3F crossvalidated? Because otherwise, there is an expected increase in the likelihood simply explained by an increase in the number of parameters of the model (i.e., adding the J_ij's).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As discussed in our responses to Comment 1 and 2, we have added results about cross-validation in the new supplementary figures, Figure 2 – figure supplement 5 and 6 , for which we computed the test-set and training-set likelihood for maximum entropy models with pairwise interactions and also for models with triplet interactions. Figure 2 - figure supplement 6 shows the pairwise model does not overfit when we consider the aggregated data from more or equal to 4 days.</p>

<p>(5) EFFECT OF SLEEP. The comparison of p(K) between the data and the model requires a bit more investigation: the model underestimates instances in which almost all mice were in the same compartment (i.e., for K &gt;= 13. p(K)_data &gt;&gt; p(K)_MEM; btw where is the pairwise point p(15) in Fig. 2E and Fig. S4?). Could this be because there were still short periods during the dark cycle in which all mice were asleep in one of the cages? As explained by the authors, sleep introduces very strong higher order correlations between animals as they like sleeping altogether. Knowing whether removing light periods was enough to remove this &quot;sleep contamination&quot; or not, would be important in order to interpret discrepancies between the pairwise model and the data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figure 2E shows that the pairwise maximum entropy model (in black) overestimates the data (in blue circles) for P(K) at large K (and not underestimates). In the data, we never observe all 15 mice being in the same box; hence P<sub>data</sub>(15) = 0, and does not show up in the log-scaled figure (same for Figure 2 - figure supplement 3). A possible explanation for the pairwise model overestimating P(K) at large K is that the finite-sized box limits the total number of mice that are comfortably staying in the same box. It can also be due to the fact that the number of time points at which K &gt;= 13 is small and hence causes an underestimation due to finite data. We have added this interpretation of the discrepancy of P(K) to Section “Pairwise interaction model explains the statistics of social behavior” in page 6, line 160.</p>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for raising the point of “sleep contamination”. Indeed, Eco-HAB data, as do data from other 24h-testing behavioral systems, demonstrate distinct differences in activity levels during the light and dark phases of the light-dark cycle (Rydzanicz et al., <italic>EMBO Mol. Med.</italic>, 2024). During the light phases, mice primarily sleep and, as noted, they huddle, so many individuals within the cohort tend to remain in close proximity for extended periods. We acknowledge that including such periods in the analysis could potentially introduce confounding effects to the model due to limited movement and interactions, and this is why we decided not to use this data. However, during the dark phases, mice are highly active, with individuals rarely staying in the same compartment for long periods. Specifically, in the dark phases, while there are occasional instances where a few mice may remain in the same compartment for over 1 hour, the majority exhibit considerable mobility, actively exploring and transitioning between compartments. We see no compelling reason to exclude these periods from our analysis, as such activity aligns with the natural behavioral repertoire of the mice and provides robust data for our model. Furthermore, it is well-established that mammals, including nocturnal species such as mice, are most active shortly after waking, typically at the onset of their active phase (i.e., the beginning of the dark phase). To ensure a conservative approach, we specifically analyzed the first 6 hours of the dark phase when the cumulative number of box visits is at its peak, indicating heightened activity levels. In our view, this period offers an optimal window for studying natural behaviors, including social interactions.</p>
<p>Additionally, prior studies using the Eco-HAB system have consistently demonstrated that mice engage in social interactions both within the compartments and in the connecting tubes during the dark phase (Puścian et al., <italic>eLife</italic>, 2016, Winiarski et al. in press). Given this evidence and the observed behavioral dynamics in our data, the likelihood of mice being asleep during the analyzed periods of the dark phase is very low.</p>
<p>We hope this clarification addresses the reviewer’s concerns and highlights the rationale underpinning our analysis choices. Thank you for raising this important point, which allowed us to provide additional context for our approach.</p>

<p>(6) COMPARTMENT PREFERENCES. The differences between p(K) across compartments also would require a bit more attention: of a MEM with non-spatially dependent pair-wise interactions shows differences across compartments, it must be because of the terms h_{i,r} terms which contain a compartment index, right? Wouldn't this imply that the independence model, which always underrepresents data events with large K, already contains the difference in goodness of fit between compartments (1, 3) and (2, 4)? In the plots, it does not look like the goodness of the independent model depends on the compartment (the authors could compare directly the models' predictions between compartments). Moreover, when looking at Fig. 2C, it does not look like the value of h_{i,r} in compartments (1,3) is higher than in (2,4) (if anything, it would be the other way around). How can this be explained? It would be good to know if the difference across compartments comes from differences in the empirical p(K) or in the models' prediction? If the difference is in the data p(K), could it be that the compartments 2-4 showing higher p(K=15) (i.e., larger difference with the pairwise MEM prediction) are those chosen by mice to sleep during the light cycle? If not, what could explain these differences across compartments? Could the presence of food and water explain this difference?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is correct, in the pairwise MEM, the difference across compartments enter in the box preference <italic>h<sub>ir</sub></italic>. Greater <italic>h<sub>ir</sub></italic> means compartment <italic>r</italic> is more attractive to mouse <italic>i</italic>. Because box 2 and 4 contain food and water, we expect that mice are more attracted to box 2 and 4, and this is what we see in Figure 2C, bottom subpanels. To reduce the number of parameters to look at, we introduce an index <italic>Δh<sub>i</sub></italic> <italic>=</italic> <italic>h<sub>i2</sub></italic> <italic>+</italic> <italic>h<sub>i4</sub></italic> <italic>-</italic> <italic>h<sub>i1</sub></italic> <italic>-</italic> <italic>h<sub>i3</sub></italic>. This index <italic>Δh<sub>i</sub></italic> is found to be mostly positive (see updated Figure 3C), which makes sense because mice are attracted to food and water.</p>
<p>Next we analyze the difference of <italic>P(K)</italic> across compartments (Figure 2 - figure supplement 3). There is already a difference in the <italic>P(K)</italic> calculated from empirical data. For example, <italic>P(K)</italic> in compartment 2 has a maximum at <italic>K = 5</italic> while <italic>P(K)</italic> in compartment 1 has a maximum at <italic>K = 3</italic>.</p>
<p>One interesting observation is that it seems from Figure 2 - figure supplement 3 that the pairwise model explains <italic>P(K)</italic> in compartment 1 and compartment 3 better than in compartment 2 and in compartment 4. In compartment 2 and 4, the pairwise MEM overestimates <italic>P(K)</italic> for large <italic>K</italic>. An alternative MEM could include compartment-specific interaction strength, but it will also introduce 315 new parameters for a mice cohort with size <italic>N = 15</italic>.</p>

<p>MINOR</p>
<p>(1) A more quantitative comparison between in-cohort sociability and couplings J_ij as œwell as mean rates and parameters h_i is required. The matrices in Fig. 2C do look similar. So it is not clear how the comparison between these values is contributing to characterizing the correlation structure of the data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The comparison between in-cohort sociability and coupling J<sub>ij</sub> is given by supplementary Figure 2 - figure supplement 2.  The key point for the model with the learned J<sub>ij</sub> reproducing the in-cohort sociability is given by Figure 2 - figure supplement 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Analysis of &quot;in-state&quot; probability is not explained. To me, it wasn't obvious what Fig. S5 is showing. I was assuming that this analysis was comparing the prediction of the MEM about the position of each animal at each time point, given its preference (h), pairwise interactions (J_ij), and the position of all other animals and the true position of the animal. But it seems like it is comparing the shape of the distribution of this prob across time between the data and the model (I guess the data had to be temporally binned in coarser temporal periods to yield prob values other than 0s and 1s). Also, not clear whether this analysis was done for each compartment separately and then averaged. This needs explanation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The in-state probability is comparing the prediction of the MEM about the position of each animal at each time point, given its preference (h), pairwise interactions (J<sub>ij</sub>), and the position of all other animals and the true position of the animal. To achieve values between 0s and 1s, we bin the data temporally according to the model-predicted in-state probability.</p>
<p>We have added the explanation of in-state probability on page 6, line 163-166. We have also improved the description of in-state probability in Materials and Methods (subsection “Comparing in-state probability between model prediction and data”, line 493 - 503, page 15), and added a pointer from the main text to it.</p>

<p>(4) The authors say that &quot;TIMP-1 release from the TIMP-1-loaded nanoparticles diminishes after 5 days.&quot; Does that mean from the day of the injection (4-5 days before the &quot;After Day 1&quot;) or five days after reintroduced in the ECO-Hab?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It means five days after the mice were re-introduced in the ECO-Hab. We have updated the text in Results/Effects of impairing neuronal plasticity in the PL on subterritory preferences and sociability (the end of the first paragraph of this subsection) to</p>
<p>“The choice of five-day aggregated data for analysis is in line both with the proper timescales needed for the pairwise maximum entropy model to not overfit, and with the literature that TIMP-1 release from the TIMP-1-loaded nanoparticles is stable for 7-10 days after injection (Chaturvedi et al., 2014)  (i.e. 2-5 days after the mice are reintroduced to Eco-HAB).” (line 272 - 276, page 9)</p>

<p>(5) In Methods, the authors should report the final N of each of the three groups.</p>
