<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The picornavirus Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is an important pathogen associated with acute flaccid myelitis (AFM). The pathogenesis of AFM involves infection of spinal motor neurons and motor neuron death, however the mechanisms linking EV-D68 infection to selective neurotoxicity are not well understood. Dysfunction of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) has been implicated in motor neuron injury in neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and the NPC is also modified by picornavirus proteases during the course of infection. We therefore sought to determine the impact of EV-D68 proteases on NPC composition and function and their role in motor neuron toxicity. We demonstrate widespread disruption of NPC composition by EV-D68 2A and 3C proteases via the direct cleavage of a relatively small number of nucleoporins, notably Nup98 and POM121 by 2A<sup>pro</sup>. Using reporter systems, we demonstrate that 2A<sup>pro</sup> inhibits nuclear import and export of protein cargoes and also disrupts the permeability barrier of the NPC, while having no apparent effect on RNA export. We further show that 2A<sup>pro</sup> is toxic to induced pluripotent stem cell derived motor neurons by demonstrating a rescue of toxicity with 2A<sup>pro</sup> inhibitor telaprevir at concentrations that are insufficient to inhibit viral replication. This study expands our understanding of EV-D68 neuropathogenesis and provides a rationale for targeting the NPC or 2A<sup>pro</sup> therapeutically in AFM.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) has caused multiple outbreaks of severe respiratory disease and the polio-like disorder acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) during the past decade. Though much work has been done to demonstrate the association between EV-D68 and AFM and to characterize the molecular evolution of EV-D68 leading to the increased virulence of contemporary strains, the mechanisms underlying its neuropathogenesis remain poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Elrick et al. 2021</xref>). EV-D68 has been shown to infect spinal motor neurons in mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hixon et al. 2017</xref>) and human autopsy tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Vogt et al. 2022</xref>), and the dysfunction or death of motor neurons is thought to be the proximate cause of paralysis in AFM.</p>
<p>EV-D68 is a member of the family <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>, which have a non-enveloped icosahedral capsid and a single-stranded positive sense RNA genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Oberste et al. 2004</xref>). Picornaviruses alter the composition and function of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) during the course of their life cycle (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lizcano-Perret and Michiels 2021</xref>). The purpose for this is felt to be twofold. First, it allows for the redistribution of nuclear proteins such as Sam68 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">McBride et al. 1996</xref>), polypyrimidine tract binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Back et al. 2002</xref>), and the La protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Meerovitch et al. 1993</xref>) to the cytoplasm, where they participate in the translation or replication of viral RNA. Second, it may disrupt nuclear translocation of transcription factors that mediate innate immunity, including interferon response factor 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Delhaye et al. 2004</xref>) and nuclear factor ÎºB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Watters et al. 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>The NPC is a macromolecular structure greater than 100 MDa in size constructed in 8-fold symmetry from subunits known as nucleoporins (Nups). The NPC includes a symmetric core that is comprised of transmembrane Nups that anchor the NPC to the nuclear envelope, inner and outer rings, and a central channel. The central channel consists primarily of phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeat domains contributed by multiple Nups that confer an intrinsically disordered structure. The central channel creates a permeability barrier against passive diffusion of macromolecules 40 kDa and larger. The central channel also permits active nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT). NCT is mediated by transport adapters known as importins and exportins which interact with FG-repeats and require a Ran-GTP/Ran-GDP gradient across the nuclear envelope. On the nuclear face of the NPC resides the nuclear basket, which has roles in chromatin organization and RNA quality control, while the cytoplasmic face is adorned with cytoplasmic filaments that are important for transport receptor docking and remodeling of ribonucleoproteins during their export. (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lin and Hoelz 2019</xref>)</p>
<p>Disruptions of nuclear import by picornaviruses were first reported in cells infected with poliovirus (PV) and coxsackievirus B3 (CV-B3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Belov et al. 2000</xref>). These deficits were later correlated to cleavage of Nup153 and Nup62 during infection with PV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gustin and Sarnow 2001</xref>) or human rhinovirus 14 (HRV14) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gustin and Sarnow 2002</xref>), implicating viral proteases in disruption of the NPC. PV 2A protease (2A<sup>pro</sup>) was shown to disrupt the permeability barrier of the NPC, allowing passive diffusion across the nuclear lamina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Belov et al. 2004</xref>). HRV 3C and 3CD proteases were found to impair nuclear import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ghildyal et al. 2009</xref>). There have been conflicting reports as to whether or not PV 2A<sup>pro</sup> activity also impairs RNA export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Park et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Castello et al. 2009</xref>). The list of Nups targeted by enterovirus proteases was expanded to include Nup98 by PV 2A<sup>pro</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Park et al. 2008</xref>); and RanBP2, Nup214, and Nup153 by HRV 3C<sup>pro</sup> and 3CD<sup>pro</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ghildyal et al. 2009</xref>). A further study in PV-infected cells demonstrated cleavage of Nup98, Nup153, TPR, Nup96, Nup58, Nup35, RanBP2, Nup214, and POM121, without attributing cleavage events to specific proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Krull et al. 2010</xref>). The cleavage of Nup62 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Park et al. 2010</xref>) and Nup98 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Park et al. 2015</xref>) by HRV2 were found to selectively remove the FG-repeat domain, signifying a potential mechanism for the disruption of transport functions or of the NPC permeability barrier.</p>
<p>Interestingly, though all picornaviruses studied to date alter the NPC, the specific Nup targets and functional outcomes vary between strains. Amongst several HRV strains, there were differential kinetics for the degradation of Nup98, Nup153, and Nup62 by 2A<sup>pro</sup>. Most strikingly, some strains showed little or no cleavage of Nup62 while it was efficiently degraded by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Watters and Palmenberg 2011</xref>). Further, the consequences of Nup degradation vary amongst HRV strains, showing differential effects on trafficking mediated by various transport receptors including importin-Î±Î², transportin 1, transportin 3, or Crm1/exportin 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Watters et al. 2017</xref>). This suggests that the impact of infection by specific picornavirus strains have unique effects on which cargoes are mislocalized, and on the relative balance of import vs export deficits. These differences may have implications for the efficiency of viral replication as well as the potential deleterious effects on host cells.</p>
<p>Few studies have attempted to comprehensively survey of the impact of a picornavirus infection on the NPC. A proteomic analysis in cells overexpressing CVB3 2A<sup>pro</sup> identified several interacting partners of 2A<sup>pro</sup> and showed that eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) and Nup98 were the most rapidly cleaved host proteins. This was associated with bidirectional deficits of nucleocytoplasmic transport and redistribution of nuclear mRNA into cytoplasmic stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Serganov et al. 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Disruption of the nuclear pore complex has been implicated in degenerative disorders of the motor neuron. In <italic>C9orf72</italic>-related amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), three independent screens identified deficits of nucleocytoplasmic transport contributing to neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Freibaum et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Jovicic et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Zhang et al. 2015</xref>). These results have since been extended to sporadic ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Coyne et al. 2021</xref>) and other neurodegenerative disorders including Huntington, Alzheimer, and Parkinson diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Grima et al. 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Eftekharzadeh et al. 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Shani et al. 2019</xref>). Furthermore, mutations in multiple Nup genes are sufficient to cause neurodegeneration, including several motor neuron diseases of childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Juhlen and Fahrenkrog 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the well-established role of NPC dysfunction in both picornavirus infection and neurotoxicity, and the similarity of disrupted nucleocytoplasmic transport dysfunction in these settings, we wondered whether NPC dysfunction may be a mechanistic link between EV-D68 infection and neurotoxicity. We therefore sought to comprehensively characterize the impact of EV-D68 proteases on NPC composition and function and their contribution to motor neuron toxicity in models of AFM. Here, we characterize the disruption of NPC composition and function by EV-D68 proteases. We show that 2A<sup>pro</sup> is primarily responsible for wide-ranging deficits of nucleocytoplasmic transport of protein cargoes via cleavage of a small number of Nups, and is neurotoxic in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived human spinal motor neurons.</p>

<title>Enterovirus D68 proteases disrupt nuclear pore complex composition</title>
<p>We screened for disruption of the nuclear pore complex by expressing in HEK293T cells the 2A<sup>pro</sup> and 3C<sup>pro</sup> proteases from US/MO/2014-18947, a well-characterized neuropathogenic strain of EV-D68 that has been studied in animal and cell culture models of AFM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Liu et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brown et al. 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hixon et al. 2019</xref>). We measured the levels of 30 nucleoporins in whole cell lysates by Western blot. As positive controls, we used the homologous proteases from poliovirus 1 Mahoney strain. To confirm protease activity, we also measured the levels of EIF4G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ventoso et al. 1998</xref>) and CREB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Yalamanchili et al. 1997</xref>), well-established non-Nup substrates of 2A<sup>pro</sup> and 3C<sup>pro</sup>, respectively. After correction for multiple comparisons, we identified 14 Nups whose levels were decreased after expression of EV-D68 2A<sup>pro</sup> and four Nups whose levels were decreased after expression of 3C<sup>pro</sup>, revealing a widespread disruption of NPC composition following EV-D68 protease expression. In addition, Western blots showed putative cleavage products of three Nups for each protease that were detectable only in the presence of protease (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-B</xref>). Including these proteins, our total list of candidate Nup substrates of EV-D68 proteases numbered 15 for 2A<sup>pro</sup> (RanBP2, Nup214, Nup88, Aladin, Gle1, Nup43, Nup96, Nup188, Nup35, POM121, Nup62, Nup54, Nup98, TPR, Nup153) and 6 for 3C<sup>pro</sup> (RanBP2, Nup214, Nup188, Nup35, NDC1, Nup50).</p>

<p>We considered that alterations in the level of each Nup may be either a direct result of proteolytic cleavage, or a secondary effect such as loss of a binding partner in the complex. We therefore sought to determine which of the candidate Nups are substrates of their respective EV-D68 protease. We performed <italic>in vitro</italic> assays of proteolytic cleavage for each Nup of interest by incubating HEK293T cell nuclear-fractionated lysates with recombinant 2A<sup>pro</sup> or 3C<sup>pro</sup> and quantifying Nup levels over time by Western blot. All candidate Nups were detectable by this method with the exception of Nup43, which was excluded from further analysis. Surprisingly, of the 14 remaining candidate substrates of 2A<sup>pro</sup>, only Nup98 and POM121 were significantly proteolyzed in these nuclear preparations. For 3C<sup>pro</sup>, four out of six candidates demonstrated significant evidence of proteolysis, including Nup35, NDC1, Nup214, and RanBP2.</p>

<title>2A protease alters nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of protein substrates</title>
<p>We next sought to understand the functional impacts of Nup cleavage and altered NPC composition on nucleocytoplasmic transport. We began by screening for steady state alterations of nucleocytoplasmic localization using a reporter system based on the previously reported Shuttle-tdTomato (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Zhang et al. 2015</xref>). We expressed NLS-tdTomato, tdTomato-NES, or Shuttle-tdTomato (which we will refer to henceforth as NLS-tdTomato-NES) in HeLa cells, followed by GFP-labeled versions of each of the EV-D68 proteases or an empty vector GFP control. GFP-2A<sup>pro</sup>-expressing cells demonstrated significant alterations, wherein the NLS-tdTomato and tdTomato-NES reporters were significantly less partitioned into the nucleus or cytoplasm, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-C</xref>; Supplementary Figure 2).</p>

<p>The above findings have two potential explanations which are not mutually exclusive: (1) 2A<sup>pro</sup> impairs receptor-mediated nuclear import and export, or (2) 2A<sup>pro</sup> disrupts the permeability barrier of the NPC, allowing for passive diffusion of macromolecules across the nuclear envelope. To test the first of these possibilities, we utilized a photoinducible reporter system to measure the kinetics of nucleocytoplasmic transport. We used pDB22 (mCherry-LINus) for nuclear import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Niopek et al. 2014</xref>) and pDN122 (NLS-mCherry-LEXY) for nuclear export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Niopek et al. 2016</xref>).

<title>2A protease disrupts the permeability barrier of the nuclear pore complex</title>
<p>To assess the integrity of the nuclear permeability barrier we measured the exclusion of a high molecular weight fluorescently labeled dextran from the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lenart and Ellenberg 2006</xref>) following selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane with digitonin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adam et al. 1990</xref>). As expected, in digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells expressing an empty vector control or 3C<sup>pro</sup>, FITC-dextran diffused rapidly into the cytoplasm but was excluded from the nucleus. By contrast, in 2A<sup>pro</sup>-expressing cells FITC-dextran accumulated in the nucleus, indicating a disruption of the permeability barrier against diffusion of macromolecules (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F-G</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, the above data indicate that disruption of the nuclear pore complex specifically by 2A<sup>pro</sup> leads to deficits in bidirectional nucleocytoplasmic transport of protein cargoes as well as disruption of the NPC permeability barrier against passive diffusion. To exclude the possibility that these phenomena are simply non-specific sequelae of cell death, we measured the uptake of propidium iodide in GFP+ HeLa cells transfected with IRES-GFP, IRES-GFP-2A<sup>pro</sup>, or IRES-GFP-3C<sup>pro</sup>, imaged and analyzed identically to those in the tdTomato and LINus/LEXY reporter assays, and found no significant increase in nuclear propidium iodide uptake between control and protease-expressing cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>).</p>

In the case of the latter experiment, we also used combinations of RNA polymerase inhibitors actinomycin D, Î±-amanitin, and CAS 577784-91-9 to selectively label the products of RNA polymerase I, II, or III.

<title>Inhibition of 2A protease rescues the toxicity of Enterovirus D68 to spinal motor neurons out of proportion to its potential antiviral effect</title>
<p>In the above experiments, we demonstrated that EV-D68 2A<sup>pro</sup> disrupts the composition of the nuclear pore complex with deleterious consequences on the maintenance of the NPC permeability barrier and nuclear transport of protein cargoes in cell lines and human spinal motor neurons. Because similar deficits have been reported to contribute to neurotoxicity in neurodegenerative disease, we next sought to determine the extent to which 2A<sup>pro</sup> activity contributes to motor neuron injury during EV-D68 infection. GFP-labeled diMNs were infected with EV-D68 and imaged daily by high content imaging with automated cell counting. To control for the inherent variability of iPSCs and potential viral strain differences, we utilized diMNs derived from three independent iPSC lines and infected them with EV-D68 strains from two different subclades and outbreak years, US/MO/2014-18947 (clade B1, year 2014) and US/MD/2018-23209 (clade B3, year 2018). These diMNs demonstrated gradual yet robust cell death in culture, with an approximately 95% reduction in diMN numbers four days after infection. The EV-D68 2A<sup>pro</sup> inhibitor telaprevir led to a dose-dependent reduction in cell death, with statistically significant neuroprotection occurring at concentrations of 3ÂµM and above (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E-F</xref>). We considered the possibility that the rescue of nucleocytoplasmic transport deficits and motor neuron toxicity may simply be due to an antiviral effect of telaprevir. However, the growth curve of EV-D68 in diMNs showed only a trend toward inhibition by telaprevir at a concentration of 10ÂµM, and none at 3 ÂµM or less (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). We therefore infer that the neuroprotective effect of telaprevir is primarily through inhibiting the effects of 2A<sup>pro</sup> activity on host targets.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we have presented a detailed evaluation of the effects of EV-D68 proteases on the composition and function of the NPC and their relationship to motor neuron toxicity. Our findings on Nup cleavage are compatible with previous findings in other picornaviruses, and extend the literature by presenting one of the most comprehensive evaluations of Nups to date. Interestingly, we found widespread disruption of the NPC by EV-D68 proteases. The levels of up to 16 Nups were decreased by one or both proteases. By contrast, only 6 Nups were found to be direct proteolytic substrates of 2A<sup>pro</sup> or 3C<sup>pro</sup>. This finding suggests that the remaining Nup alterations may be a secondary effect. For example, some of the altered Nups may be anchored to the NPC by other Nups which are themselves targets for proteolysis.</p>
<p>Our study also provides a mechanistic explanation for disrupted localization nucleocytoplasmic cargoes. By using several complementary reporter systems to detect abnormalities of nucleocytoplasmic transport dynamically and at steady state we showed that the deficits are multifactorial, resulting from both disruption of the NPCâs permeability barrier against passive diffusion of macromolecules and from loss of receptor-mediated nuclear import and export.</p>
<p>It is striking that functional deficits in the NPC were entirely attributable to 2A<sup>pro</sup>. This is even though we only observed two definitive substrates of 2A<sup>pro</sup>: Nup98 and POM121. Nup98 has been well-studied as a target of picornavirus 2A proteases, though studies have drawn differing conclusions regarding the extent and nature of the impact of Nup98 cleavage on NPC function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Park et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Castello et al. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Serganov et al. 2022</xref>). The finding that 2A<sup>pro</sup> also cleaves POM121 is especially interesting because of its role in motor neuron degeneration in ALS. POM121 appears to function as a âkeystoneâ for the NPC. In models of ALS, removal of POM121 from the NPC is sufficient to cause loss of multiple Nups including Nup98, Nup107, Nup50, TPR, Nup133, GP210, and NDC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Coyne et al. 2020</xref>), a list that overlaps with what we observed following 2A<sup>pro</sup> expression. In these ALS models, overexpression of POM121 is sufficient to reverse NPC deficits, and the mechanism of POM121 removal appears to be inappropriate activation of the ESCRT III pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Coyne et al. 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Coyne and Rothstein 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baskerville et al. 2024</xref>). In the context of EV-D68 infection, it remains to be determined whether POM121 is the sole driver of NPC pathology, if the mechanism of POM121 loss involves the ESCRT pathway or is solely due to its cleavage by 2A<sup>pro</sup>, and whether deficits of NPC function can be reversed via repair of POM121 or prevention of its cleavage. These questions will be a focus of future studies.</p>
<p>We have further demonstrated that 2A<sup>pro</sup> activity contributes to nucleocytoplasmic transport dysfunction and cell death in motor neurons infected with EV-D68. Our approach was motivated by the fact that similar deficits have been shown to be toxic in neurodegenerative disorders of the motor neuron. We therefore expect that the 2A<sup>pro</sup>-dependent toxicity that we witnessed in diMNs is at least partially due to these deficits of NPC function. Concordant with our results, a recent study demonstrated amelioration of the AFM phenotype in EV-D68-infected mice treated with telaprevir. The protection of spinal motor neurons in these mice occurred despite minimal effects on viral replication in the spinal cord, providing further support for a model in which telaprevirâs mechanism of action is primarily neuroprotective rather than antiviral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Frost et al. 2023</xref>). A significant limitation of our study, however, is that we cannot exclude potentially toxic effects of 2A<sup>pro</sup> on aspects of host neuronal biology aside from the NPC. For example, 2A<sup>pro</sup> impairs 5â-cap-dependent RNA translation via eIF4G cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ventoso et al. 1998</xref>) and inhibits stress granule formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Visser et al. 2019</xref>) which could also contribute to toxicity in EV-D68-infected neurons. Further work will be required to disentangle the relative contributions of these pathways to motor neuron injury.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We have built upon prior observations in several picornaviruses to show that EV-D68 proteases cause broad disruption of the composition and function of the nuclear pore complex, and that these phenomena are attributable to the cleavage of a relatively small number of Nups by 2A<sup>pro</sup>. Further, 2A<sup>pro</sup> contributes to motor neuron death in a model of EV-D68 infection. These findings motivate future work to evaluate the NPC or 2A<sup>pro</sup> as potential therapeutic targets to treat or prevent paralysis in AFM.</p>

<p>Plasmids were constructed from the components listed in the Key Reagents table using In-Fusion Snap Assembly (Takara Bio) or T4 DNA Ligase (New England Biolabs) following the manufacturersâ protocol. The products of restriction digests and PCR reactions were purified using 1% agarose gel electrophoresis.

Of note, expression of EV-D68 proteases using a CMV promoter and a Kozak sequence as the ribosome binding site, while sufficient to introduce measurable protease activity (Figure S1), did not allow a sufficiently bright signal for imaging assays using fluorescently tagged proteases. This is a commonly encountered problem, owing to the inhibition of transcription and 5â-cap-dependent translation by enterovirus proteases, which we resolved by incorporating an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in front of the fusion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Castello et al. 2006</xref>).</p>

Motor neuron differentiation was performed following the direct-induced motor neurons (diMN) protocol reported previously (NeuroLINCS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Consortium et al. 2021</xref>). In brief, iPSCs were grown to 30-40% confluency and then fed daily with S1 media for 6 days for neuroepithelial induction.

On day 2, they were transfected with the protease-containing vector or empty vector control, or infected with EV-D68 mock-infected. Imaging was completed at the indicated number of hours after the second transfection or infection on a Molecular Devices ImageXpress Confocal high content imaging system. For photoinducible reporters (mCherry-LINus and NLS-mCherry-LEXY), images were acquired every 15 seconds, each beginning with a 1-second pulse of the 488nm laser at maximum intensity to maintain the reporter in its activated state. Image analysis was performed in automated fashion using MetaXpress software (Molecular Devices). A custom analysis protocol was developed to select only GFP<sup>+</sup> cells with size and morphology typical of live cells, to define the area of the nucleus using the H2A-iRFP670 signal, exclude nuclei with a condensed or mitotic morphology, and to define the perinuclear cytoplasm as a concentric ring outside of the nucleus.</p>
<p>The average intensity of the reporter signal in the nucleus and perinuclear cytoplasm were measured and reported as Log<sub>2</sub> of the nucleus/cytoplasm ratio. Cells were excluded from the analysis when the intensity of the reporter signal was too low to be distinguished from background or high enough to create shine-through artefact in the green channel, up to a maximum of 50% of the pixel depth of the image to ensure signal in the linear range. Due to inherent variability in signal intensity, these minimum and maximum intensity values were determined empirically for each independent biological replicate.</p>

To permeabilize, cells were kept on ice and washed with ice-cold PBS for 5 minutes. Digitonin was added at varying concentrations for 10 minutes in permeabilization buffer (PB; 20 mM HEPES, 110 mM KOAc, 5 mM Mg(OAc)2, 0.5 mM EGTA, 250 mM sucrose) to identify the concentration that permeabilized the plasma membrane while leaving the nuclear envelope intact. The optimized digitonin concentration varied depending on the cell density, but the same concentration was used across each biological replicate, with 30-40 Âµg/mL being used for analysis.

Images were acquired every 30 seconds for 5 minutes. For each field, cells were analyzed only if the nuclei expressed H2A-iRFP670, had intact and visible nuclear membranes, were regularly shaped, and had clear and sharp boundaries between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Images were excluded if a majority of the cells in the field were permeabilized regardless of transfection status, indicating general over-permeabilization. Cells were also excluded if they were impermeabilized (indicated by the absence of a visible nuclear membrane), if nuclei were not completely within the plane of imaging, or if there was drift of the focal plane during time course imaging. Data were reported as the average FITC intensity in the nucleus divided by the average FITC intensity of the extracellular background.</p>

<title>Propidium iodide viability assay</title>
<p>HeLa cells were transfected as in the nucleocytoplasmic transport assays, except omitting the reporter construct. Staurosporine 2 ÂµM was added to the positive control group two hours before propidium iodide as a positive control. Propidium iodide 100Âµg/mL was added to all groups 20 hours post-transfection and 15 minutes prior to imaging. Image acquisition and analysis was the same as for the nucleocytoplasmic transport assays, selecting only GFP+ cells with normal size and morphology. Instead of calculating the nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio of signal in the red channel, the intensity of signal in the nucleus was recorded. To determine the minimum intensity cutoff for propidium iodide positivity, histograms were plotted for signal intensity in the staurosporine-treated group, and a cutoff for positive cells was determined by identifying the inflection point in the biphasic distribution.</p>

<title>Poly-A FISH</title>
<p>HeLa cells were plated on UltiMatrix-coated 96-well glass-bottom plates (Cellvis) and transfected with pLenti-IRES-GFP, pLenti-IRES-GFP-2A<sup>pro</sup>, or pLenti-IRES-GFP-3C<sup>pro</sup>. Twenty hours later, they were washed with PBS, fixed for 30 minutes in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed two more times with PBS, then incubated 10 min each with ice-cold 100% methanol followed by 100% ethanol. Cells were incubated with 1ng/ÂµL of Cy3-oligo-dT (Genelink) in hybridization buffer (30ÂµM sodium citrate, 300ÂµM sodium chloride, 10% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 50Âµg yeast tRNA (Millipore Sigma) in DEPC-treated water for 1 hour at 37Â°C. To enhance the GFP signal, the cells were then immunofluorescently stained for GFP. Cells were washed with PBS and then blocked in blocking solution (5% goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for one hour at room temperature and then incubated in primary antibody against GFP diluted 1:200 in 1/4x blocking solution overnight at 4Â°C. The cells were then washed twice with PBS and then incubated with AlexaFluor488-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hour in 1/4x blocking solution. Finally, the cells were washed with PBS, counterstained with Hoechst 33342 nuclear stain (Cell Signaling) at 5Âµg/mL for 15 minutes, and then mounted with PBS glycerol for imaging. Imaging was performed and analyzed on a Molecular Devices ImageXpress Confocal high content imaging system as described above for NCT assays.</p>

<title>5-Ethinyl Uridine pulse-chase</title>
<p>HEK293T cells were plated on UltiMatrix-coated 96-well glass-bottom plates (Cellvis) and transfected with pLenti-IRES-GFP, pLenti-IRES-GFP-2A<sup>pro</sup>, or pLenti-IRES-GFP-3C<sup>pro</sup>. Twenty hours after transfection, the cell culture medium was replaced with fresh media containing 1mM 5-ethinyl uridine (EU; Vector Laboratories) for a 1-hour pulse to label nascent RNA. To preferentially label the products of each RNA polymerase, inhibitors of the other two RNA polymerases were included during the EU pulse. These were 0.05ng/mL actinomycin D, 0.05 ng/ml Î±-amanitin, and 50 ÂµM CAS 577784-91-9 to inhibit RNA polymerases I, II, and III, respectively. The EU-containing media was aspirated off, washed once with PBS, and then chased with fresh Complete Media for 0, 2, 4, or 8 hours. Cells were collected by fixation with 3% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes, washed twice with PBS, and then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton-X100 for 15 minutes. EU was fluorescently labeled with AZDye594-azide via click chemistry using the Click&amp;Go cell reaction kit following the manufacturerâs instructions (Vector Laboratories). The cells were immunofluorescently co-stained for GFP and counterstained with Hoechst 33342 as described above for the poly-A-FISH assay. Imaging and analysis was likewise performed as above, except nuclear signal intensity of the EU stain was reported instead of nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, as the cytoplasmic signal was not consistently distinguishable from background. Intensities were normalized such that the intensity at t=0 was considered 100%.</p>

<title>Motor neuron toxicity</title>
<p>Day 12 diMN precursors were transfected with hMAP2-pGreenZero using a Lonza Nucleofector 4D X unit, with the P3 primary cell kit on program DC-104. Cells were replated into UltiMatrix-coated 96-well glass bottom plates at a density of 100,000 cells/well in S3 media with 20ÂµM Y-27632. After 24 hours, the cells were re-fed without Y-27632 and maintained in S3 media until day 32 of differentiation. These diMNs were infected with EV-D68 at MOI 5 in Infection Media for one hour at 37Â°C with rocking every 15 minutes, then fed with S3 media. diMNs were imaged on a Molecular Devices ImageXpress Confocal high content imaging system immediately following infection (considered t=0) and then once daily for four additional days. GFP<sup>+</sup> neurons were counted via automated image analysis in MetaXpress software.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Zinn and colleagues investigated the role of proteases 2A and 3C of enterovirus D68 (EVD68), an emerging pathogen associated with outbreaks of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a polio-like disease, on the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking in different systems, including human neurons derived from pluripotent cells. They found that 2A specifically cleaved Nup98 and POM121. Using reporter proteins and RNA synthesis and trafficking assays in cells expressing viral proteases, they showed that 2A induces broad loss of the nuclear pore barrier function, but, surprisingly, the RNA export appears to be minimally affected. Since nucleocytoplasmic trafficking defects are known to be associated with neuropatologies, they propose a hypothesis that 2A-dependent cleavage of nucleoporins in motoneurons underlies the development of EVD68-induced AFM. They further show that a 2A-specific inhibitor increases the survival of human neurons differentiated from stem cells upon EVD68 infection.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Use of multiple methods to investigate the effect of 2A and 3C expression on nucleoporin cleavage and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Overall, the paper follows multiple others that extensively investigated the cleavage of nucleoporins by enterovirus 2As, so the results are of limited novelty. The hypothesis that infection of motoneurons is the cause of EVD68-induced neurological complications so far is supported by only one autopsy report. Other data suggest that infection of other cell types, such as astrocytes, and/or inflammatory cell infiltration in the CNS, are likely to be responsible for the symptoms. In any case, the claim that EVD68 is specifically neurotoxic because of the 2A-dependent cleavage of nucleoporins in neurons is unfounded, as the virus will be just as &quot;toxic&quot; for other infected cell types.</p>
<p>The paper also requires a more convincing presentation of the data.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript investigates the role of EV-D68 proteases 2A and 3C in nuclear pore complex (NPC) dysfunction and their contribution to motor neuron toxicity. The authors demonstrate that both proteases cleave only a limited number of nucleoporins, with 2A^pro showing the strongest impact by inhibiting nuclear import and export of proteins and disrupting NPC permeability without affecting RNA export. Importantly, treatment with the 2A^pro inhibitor telaprevir reduced neuronal cell death in a dose-dependent manner, achieving neuroprotection at concentrations below those required to inhibit viral replication. The study addresses a relevant mechanism underlying EV-D68-induced neuropathology and explores a potential therapeutic intervention.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Provides significant mechanistic insight into how EV-D68 proteases alter NPC function and contribute to neuronal toxicity.</p>
<p>(2) The use of recombinant 2A and 3C proteins allows clear dissection of the specific contribution of each protease.</p>
<p>(3) Demonstrates a therapeutic effect of telaprevir, with neuroprotection independent of viral replication inhibition, adding translational value to the findings.</p>
<p>(4) The topic is highly relevant given the association of EV-D68 with acute flaccid myelitis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Most experiments were performed with recombinant proteases, lacking validation in the context of viral infection, where both proteases act simultaneously.</p>
<p>(2) The conclusion that RNA export is unaffected requires confirmation during actual infection.</p>
<p>(3) The reduction of neurotoxicity by telaprevir does not fully demonstrate that the protective effect is solely mediated through NPC preservation; additional analyses of eIF4G cleavage, nucleoporin integrity, and stress granules are needed.</p>
<p>(4) The study would be strengthened by including another 2A inhibitor (e.g., boceprevir) to confirm the specificity of telaprevir's protective effects.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The author showed expression of the viral proteases 2Apro and 3Cpro of EV-D68, which cleaved specific components of the nuclear pore complex (Nup98 and POM121 by 2Apro), and 2A but not 3C expression altered nuclear import and export. Similar nucleocytoplasmic transport deficits are observed in EV-D68-infected RD cells and iPSC-derived motor neurons (diMNs). 2A inhibitor telaprevir partially rescued the nucleocytoplasmic transport deficits and suppressed neuronal cell death after infection. While it's clear that 2A can cleave NPC proteins and affect nuclear transport, the link to neurotoxicity after EV-D68 infection is less convincing.</p>
<p>This study opens up a very intriguing hypothesis: that EV-D68 2Apro could be directly responsible for motor neuron cell death, mediated by POM121 and possibly Nup98 cleavage, that ultimately results in paralysis known as acute flaccid myelitis. This hypothesis notably does run counter to other published data showing that human neuronal organoids derived from iPSCs can support productive EV-D68 infection for weeks without cell death and that EV-D68-infected mice can have paralysis prevented by depletion of CD8 T cells, still with EV-D68 infection of the spinal cord. However, even if 2Apro is not ultimately responsible for motor neurons dying in human infections, that does not exclude the possibility that cleavage of nups could still disrupt motor neuron function. Notably, most children with AFM have some amount of motor function return after their acute period of paralysis, but most still have some residual paralysis for years to life. It is possible that 2A pro could mediate the acute onset of weakness, while T cells killing neurons could determine the amount of long-term, residual paralysis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The characterization of nuclear pore complex components that appear to be targets of both poliovirus and EV-D68 proteases is quite thorough and expansive, so this data set alone will be useful for reference to the field. And the process by which the authors narrowed their focus to EV-D68 2Apro reducing Nup98 and POM121 as consequential to both import and export of nuclear cargo but not RNA was technically impressive, thorough, and convincing. As will be detailed below, when the authors move from studying over-expressed proteases in transformed cell lines to studying actual virus infection in both transformed cell lines and iPSC-derived neurons, some of the data only indirectly support their conclusions; however, the quality of the experiments performed is still high. So even if the claim that 2Apro causes neurotoxicity is circumstantial, the data certainly are intriguing and certainly justify further study of the effects of EV-D68 2Apro on the NPC and how this impacts pathogenesis. This is a convincing start to an intriguing line of inquiry.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This study falls a bit shy of actually showing that 2Apro effects are causing motor neuron toxicity because the evidence of this is fairly indirect. At points, the authors do admit these limitations, but at other times, they claim to have shown the link directly. The following are reasons why these claims are only indirectly supported:</p>
<p>(1) Cleavage of Nup98 and POM121 after EV-D68 infection in RD cells and diMNs is never demonstrated.</p>
<p>(2) Telaprevir was able to rescue nucleocytoplasmic transport in RD cells at low concentrations (Figure 4A). It is not shown if this correlates with its antiviral effect in RD cells, or could this correlate with inhibition of 2A cleavage of Nup98 or POM121, which is never measured.</p>
<p>(3) Building off of the prior point, the authors' claim that the neuroprotective effect of telaprevir is independent of its antiviral effect is not well-founded. Figure 4E (neuroprotection) was done with MOI 5, and Figure 4G (virus growth) was MOI 0.5. Telaprevir neuroprotection is not shown at MOI 0.5, nor is the neuroprotective effect correlated with inhibition of 2A cleavage of Nup98 or POM121.</p>
<p>(4) The use of mixed virus isolates only in the diMNs is problematic because different EV-D68 isolates are known to have drastically different effects on pathogenesis in mice. Since all initial data were generated with the MO isolate, adding the additional MD isolate to the diMN experiments actually adds uncertainty to the conclusions. It is not clear if the authors infected different cultures with the different isolates and combined the data or infected all cultures with a mixture of the two isolates. If the former, then the data should be reported separately to see the effect of each individual strain, which would be interesting to EV-D68 virologists. If the latter, then there is no way to know from these data whether one of the two isolates had increased fitness over the other and exerted a dominant effect. If the MD isolate overtook the MO isolate, from which all other data in this manuscript are derived, then we have much less of an idea how much the data from the first three figures supports the final figure.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewers for their detailed and thoughtful comments on the manuscript.  In general, the reviewers found the data supporting the role of Enterovirus D68 proteases in disrupting the composition of the nuclear pore complex, the 2A protease disrupting nucleocytoplasmic transport of protein cargoes, and the mechanistic dissection of this process to be convincing and potentially relevant to the pathogenesis of AFM.  Reviewers requested additional experiments evaluating our observation that RNA export was not similarly impaired, particularly in the context of viral infection rather than solely expression of recombinant proteases.  They also requested that cleavage of POM121 and Nup98 by 2A protease, which was demonstrated in 2A<sup>pro</sup> transfected cells and in biochemical assays, also be demonstrated in motor neurons infected by EV-D68.  Finally, reviewers noted that while suggestive, the evidence falls short of demonstrating that the toxicity of 2A<sup>pro</sup> is mediated through nuclear pore complex dysfunction.</p>
<p>To address these critiques, we aim to do the following:</p>
<p>(1) Determine the impact of live virus infection on RNA export by repeating the ethinyl uridine pulse-chase assay in the setting of live virus infection.  We will also provide representative images for these data and the previously reported data from transfection with GFP-2A<sup>pro</sup> and GFP-3C<sup>pro</sup>.</p>
<p>(2) Evaluate cleavage of POM121 and Nup98 in EV-D68-infected diMNs and inhibition of cleavage by telaprevir by Western blot.</p>
<p>(3) Present motor neuron survival data in figure 4 as separate graphs for each of the viral strains tested, rather than pooling the data.  To clarify reviewer #3âs concern, these were not mixed cultures.</p>
<p>We agree that we have not demonstrated conclusively that the mechanism by which 2A<sup>pro</sup> is toxic to motor neurons is via NPC dysfunction.  Future work will determine the extent to which NPC dysfunction contributes to 2A<sup>pro</sup>-mediated motor neuron toxicity versus other potential targets of 2A<sup>pro</sup>.  We feel that the additional experiments required to achieve this will be extensive and are beyond the scope of the present manuscript, which represents a key first step in this line of inquiry.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, there were several points of disagreement between reviewers.  We would like to respond to those as follows:</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Reviewer #1: âThe hypothesis that infection of motoneurons is the cause of EVD68-induced neurological complications so far is supported by only one autopsy report.  Other data suggest that infection of other cell types, such as astrocytes, and/or inflammatory cell infiltration in the CNS, are likely to be responsible for the symptoms.â</p>
<p>Reviewer #3: âThis study opens up a very intriguing hypothesis: that EV-D68 2Apro could be directly responsible for motor neuron cell death, mediated by POM121 and possibly Nup98 cleavage, that ultimately results in paralysis known as acute flaccid myelitis.

<p>The infection of motor neurons is strongly supported not only by the aforementioned autopsy data[1], but also by mouse model data demonstrating replication of EV-D68 within motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord.[2 ] There are also extensive reports of electromyography and nerve conduction studies from human AFM patients demonstrating that the site of pathology is the spinal motor neuron.[3-10]. By contrast, infection of astrocytes has been demonstrated only in primary murine astrocyte cultures in which no neurons were present.[11] .Therefore, while the available data suggest that EV-D68 infection of astrocytes is possible, in the in vivo context of human and mouse spinal cord, tropism to motor neurons appears to be preferential.  The relative contributions to toxicity of neuron-autonomous vs non-autonomous processes such as glial dysfunction and inflammatory cell infiltration remain to be elucidated, and are not mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>Our working hypothesis is more in line with that of Reviewer #3.  Motor neuron dysfunction and motor neuron death may ultimately prove to have dissociable causes, each of which may be neuron-autonomous, non-neuron-autonomous, or a mixture thereof.  The infection of motor neurons is likely the initiating event, with multiple downstream consequences.  Much additional work will be required to resolve this controversy.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Reviewer #1: âDemonstrates a therapeutic effect of telaprevir, with neuroprotection independent of viral replication inhibition, adding translational value to the findings.â</p>
<p>Reviewer #3: âThe authors' claim that the neuroprotective effect of telaprevir is independent of its antiviral effect is not well-founded. Figure 4E (neuroprotection) was done with MOI 5, and Figure 4G (virus growth) was MOI 0.5. Telaprevir neuroprotection is not shown at MOI 0.5, nor is the neuroprotective effect correlated with inhibition of 2A cleavage of Nup98 or POM121.â</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The selection of MOIs for these two experiments was limited by technical considerations.  If the viral growth curve were to be performed at MOI 5, it would be confounded by cell death.  Further, a low MOI is required in order to allow multiple rounds of infection, replication, and spread within the culture, and is therefore more sensitive for assaying the effect of telaprevir on viral replication.  On the other hand, at MOI 0.5 diMN death is very gradual, and in the neuroprotection assay we would have lacked the statistical power to determine whether a rescue of this small magnitude of toxicity is significant.  The EC<sub>50</sub> of telaprevir is not expected to vary significantly at different MOIs.</p>
