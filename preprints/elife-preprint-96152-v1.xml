<title>Abstract</title>
<p>In mammals, olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) are born throughout life, presumably solely to replace neurons lost <italic>via</italic> turnover or injury. This assumption follows from the hypothesis that olfactory neurogenesis is strictly stochastic with respect to neuron subtype, as defined by the single odorant receptor allele that each neural precursor stochastically chooses out of hundreds of possibilities. This hypothesis is challenged by recent findings that the birthrates of a fraction of subtypes are selectively diminished by olfactory deprivation. These findings raise questions about how, and why, olfactory stimuli are required to promote the neurogenesis of some OSN subtypes, including whether the stimuli are generic (e.g., broadly activating odors or mechanical stimuli) or specific (e.g., discrete odorants). Based on RNA-seq and scRNA-seq analyses, we hypothesized that the neurogenic stimuli are specific odorants that selectively activate the same OSN subtypes whose birthrates are accelerated. In support of this, we have found, using subtype-specific OSN birthdating, that exposure to male and musk odors can accelerate the birthrates of responsive OSNs. Collectively, our findings reveal that certain odor experiences can selectively “amplify” specific OSN subtypes, and that persistent OSN neurogenesis may serve, in part, an adaptive function.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mammalian olfactory epithelia (OE) contain hundreds of distinct olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) subtypes, each of which expresses a single odorant receptor (OR) and thereby detects a distinct set of odorant molecules <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. The olfactory epithelium is one of a few regions of the mammalian nervous system where neurogenesis occurs throughout life <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. In the hippocampus and olfactory bulb, persistent neurogenesis plays vital roles in learning and memory <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. By contrast, life-long neurogenesis within the mammalian OE is generally assumed to function solely to replace OSNs that are lost due to normal turnover or environmentally induced damage. This assumption follows logically from the prevailing hypothesis that OSN neurogenesis is strictly stochastic with respect to subtype since it is based on the evidently stochastic process of OR choice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Multiple studies have found that the relative quantities of distinct OSN subtypes can be altered by olfactory experience <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Olfactory deprivation <italic>via</italic> unilateral naris occlusion (UNO), for example, causes changes that include reductions in the representations of a fraction of OSN subtypes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Moreover, olfactory enrichment <italic>via</italic> exposure to discrete odors causes changes that include increases in the representations of specific OSN subtypes in mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, as well as dramatic increases in sensitivity to specific odors in both rodents and humans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Experience-induced changes in the representations of specific OSNs have long been attributed solely to altered OSN lifespan <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, in accordance with the hypothesis that OSN neurogenesis is stochastic with respect to subtype, which predicts that the relative birthrates of distinct OSN subtypes should not be affected by olfactory experience. However, a recent study that directly tested this hypothesis by quantifying newborn OSNs of specific subtypes in UNO-treated mice, found that, surprisingly, a fraction of OSN subtypes exhibit selectively reduced birthrates following naris occlusion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Moreover, the subtypes whose birthrates are diminished by naris occlusion do not show unusual levels of baseline activity compared to subtypes whose birthrates are unaffected, demonstrating that reduced OSN activity alone is insufficient to diminish the birthrates of specific subtypes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Rather, a fraction of OSN subtypes appear to have a special capacity to undergo changes in birthrates in accordance with the level of olfactory stimulation. Because naris occlusion reduces exposure to potentially thousands of odors, as well as mechanical stimuli, and may cause additional physiological changes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, these findings raise questions about the nature of the stimuli that affect neurogenesis. Addressing these questions is crucial for understanding the mechanism and function of stimulation-dependent neurogenesis.</p>
<p>Here we sought to identify the stimuli that are required to promote the neurogenesis of specific OSN subtypes. We envisioned that these could be either non-specific stimuli unrelated to the subtypes whose birthrates are reduced by deprivation (e.g., generic odors, mechanical stimuli, or other physiological effects of UNO) or, alternatively, discrete odorants that selectively stimulate the same subtypes whose birthrates are affected. We envisioned that distinguishing between these possibilities would provide insights into the mechanism and function of this process. If the neurogenic stimuli are non-specific, this would imply a generic mechanism and, perhaps, a homeostatic function. By contrast, if the stimuli are discrete odorants that selectively stimulate the same OSN subtypes whose birthrates are affected, this would imply a highly specific mechanism in which exposure to certain odors can “amplify” OSN subtypes responsive to those odors. The latter outcome would also suggest that OE neurogenesis serves, in part, an adaptive function.</p>
<p>Findings from previous studies led us to favor the hypothesis that the neurogenic stimuli comprise discrete odorants that selectively activate the same OSN subtypes whose birthrates are accelerated. One prediction of this hypothesis is that the extent to which naris occlusion reduces the birthrates of specific OSN subtypes should vary depending on the odor environment to which animals are exposed. In support of this, open-side biases in the birthrates of specific OSN subtypes were found to vary depending on whether a mouse was in the nursing (P14) or post-weaning stage (P28) at the time of birthrate assessment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. A second prediction is that exposure of non-occluded mice to specific odors should selectively increase the representation of subtypes responsive to those odors within the OE. Consistent with this, a previous study identified several OSN subtypes that exhibit greater representation in mice housed in the presence of sex-specific odors, compared to the absence, until six months of age <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. These findings were corroborated by a complementary study from a different group <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Interestingly, several of the affected OSN subtypes were also found to be selectively responsive to male or female odors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, suggesting that exposure to components of sex-specific odors results in greater representations of these OSNs. These changes had been hypothesized to be caused by subtype-selective lengthening of the lifespans of OSNs of specific subtypes in the presence of sex-specific odors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. However, in light of recent findings that naris occlusion selectively reduces the birthrates of specific OSN subtypes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, we considered the alternative explanation that sex-specific odor-dependent increases in the representations of specific OSN subtypes are caused by altered rates of neurogenesis. Here we present evidence that discrete odors can selectively accelerate the birthrates of OSN subtypes that they stimulate. These findings support the hypothesis that the function of lifelong OSN neurogenesis is not strictly homeostatic, but also enables adaptive changes to the composition of the OSN population. These findings may also have mechanistic relevance to intriguing and unexplained observations in both rodents and humans that exposure to specific odors can dramatically increase sensitivity to them <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Bulk and single-cell RNA-seq analyses reveal that exposure to male odors is associated with increased quantities of newborn OSNs of musk-responsive subtypes</title>
<p>To investigate whether discrete odorants can selectively accelerate the birthrates of OSN subtypes that they stimulate, we sought to identify subtypes that show evidence of a capacity for stimulation-dependent neurogenesis and for which stimulating odors have been identified. A challenge of this approach is that odorant ligands remain unidentified for most OSN subtypes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, including all subtypes previously found to undergo stimulation-dependent neurogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. To overcome this, we wondered whether candidate subtypes might be identified among those previously found to be more highly represented in mice exposed to odors emitted by a particular sex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Of these subtypes, Olfr235 <italic>(Or5an11)</italic> appeared especially intriguing, as it was observed to be more highly represented in mice exposed to male conspecifics (sex-separated males; sex-combined males and females) compared to mice isolated from them (sex-separated females) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Moreover, Olfr235 OSNs showed selective responsivity to male-specific odors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggested that exposure of mice to male odors leads to an increase in the representation of subtype Olfr235 within the OE. Intriguingly, Olfr235 belongs to a group of related ORs that include Olfr1440 <italic>(Or5an6)</italic>, Olfr1437 <italic>(Or5an1b)</italic>, Olfr1431 <italic>(Or5an9)</italic>, and Olfr1434 <italic>(Or5an1)</italic>, members of which detect musk-like odors with varying levels of sensitivity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Notably, like Olfr235, all other musk responsive ORs were found to exhibit higher transcript levels in the OEs of mice exposed to males compared to mice isolated from males (except Olfr1434, whose transcript levels were too low to be accurately assessed) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Accordingly, fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) analyses of a subset of these ORs, Olfr235 and Olfr1437, confirmed that the elevated transcript levels observed in mice exposed to male conspecifics reflected greater OSN quantities <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. By contrast, Olfr912 <italic>(Or8b48)</italic> and Olfr1295 (<italic>Or4k45)</italic>, which detect the male-specific non-musk odors 2-sec-butyl-4,5-dihydrothiazole (SBT) and (methylthio)methanethiol (MTMT), respectively <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, exhibited lower representation and/or transcript levels in mice exposed to male odors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), possibly reflecting reduced survival due to overstimulation. Taken together, these findings indicate that OSN subtypes responsive to musk odors are selectively increased in their representation upon exposure to male mice, conceivably due to accelerated neurogenesis in mice exposed to male odors.</p>
<p>To begin to investigate whether musk-responsive OSN subtypes undergo accelerated neurogenesis in the presence of male odors, we used an scRNA-seq dataset comprising the transcriptomes of single cells dissociated from the open and closed sides of an olfactory epithelium (OE) of a male mouse that had been UNO-treated at P14 and dissected at P28 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Within this dataset, newborn (<italic>Gap43</italic>+) OSNs of subtypes that undergo stimulation-dependent neurogenesis were previously found to be more highly represented on the open side of the OE compared to the closed side <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Interestingly, our identification of newborn OSNs of five known musk-responsive subtypes within this dataset revealed a 2.5-fold greater representation in the open-side scRNA-seq library compared to the closed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B, C</xref>-<italic>left</italic>; <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2A</xref>). We observed a similar open-side bias for newborn Olfr1419 (<italic>Or10q3</italic>) OSNs (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2B</xref>-<italic>left</italic>), a subtype with unknown odor responsivity that was also previously found to have a higher overall representation in mice exposed to male odors (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1B</xref>) and a reduced representation following olfactory deprivation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. By contrast, we observed that newborn OSNs of 14 randomly chosen subtypes located in the same region of the OE where musk-responsive subtypes reside (canonical zones 2 and 3) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> comprise a nearly equal proportion of cells on the open side relative to the closed (1.07-fold difference) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>-<italic>right</italic>), as do newborn OSNs of 7 known stimulation-independent subtypes (0.73-fold difference) (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2B</xref>-<italic>right</italic>). Differences in the representation of newborn and mature OSNs of subtypes Olfr235, Olfr1440, Olfr1431, and Olfr1434 on the open versus the closed sides are observable in the t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) plots of the corresponding cell populations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Taken together, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that subtypes of OSNs responsive to musk odors undergo stimulation-dependent neurogenesis.</p>

<title>Olfactory deprivation reduces quantities of newborn OSNs of musk-responsive subtypes in male mice</title>
<p>To confirm that musk-responsive subtypes undergo stimulation-dependent changes in newborn OSN quantities, we employed an established histological assay in which EdU-birthdated OSNs of specific subtypes are quantified in UNO-treated mice <italic>via</italic> EdU staining and OR-specific FISH <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>.

Consistent with our findings <italic>via</italic> scRNA-seq, histological analyses revealed that newborn OSNs of subtypes Olfr235, Olfr1440, and Olfr1431 are 2.3-fold (<italic>p</italic> = 0.003), 1.8-fold (<italic>p</italic> = 0.03), and 2.5-fold (<italic>p</italic> = 0.009) more abundant on the open side of the OE compared to the closed in juvenile male mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-D</xref>). Moreover, all three subtypes exhibited open-side biases in total OSN quantities (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.003) (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3A-C</xref>, <italic>left</italic>). Also consistent with the scRNA-seq data, subtype Olfr1437 exhibited no significant open-side biases in either newborn (1.01-fold; <italic>p</italic> = 0.99) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>) or total OSN quantities (1.2-fold; <italic>p</italic> = 0.09) (not shown). Likewise, two non-musk-responsive control subtypes, Olfr912 and Olfr1463 (<italic>Or5b109</italic>), showed no significant open-side biases in newborn OSN quantities (1.05-fold for both; <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.6) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F, G</xref>). However, consistent with previous findings <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, subtype Olfr912 exhibited a 1.5-fold higher abundance of total OSNs on the closed side (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0002) (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3D</xref>, <italic>left</italic>), likely reflecting a lengthening of OSN lifespan for this subtype due to protection from overstimulation following olfactory deprivation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. By contrast, total OSNs of subtype Olfr1463 exhibited no significant bias (<italic>p</italic> = 0.99) (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3E</xref>, <italic>left</italic>).

<title>Olfactory deprivation-induced reductions in quantities of newborn Olfr235 OSNs depend on exposure to male odors</title>
<p>Having determined that subtypes Olfr235, Olfr1440, and Olfr1431 exhibit open-side biases in the quantities of newborn OSNs in UNO-treated male mice, we next investigated whether these biases require exposure to odors emitted specifically by male mice. If so, we predicted that open-side biases would be attenuated in mice isolated from male odors. To test this, we quantified newborn OSNs of the three subtypes in UNO-treated <italic>female</italic> mice that were separated from their male littermates at weaning (P21) and thus exposed only to female littermates at the time of EdU treatment (P28) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A, B</xref>). Strikingly, unlike their male counterparts, sex-separated female mice exhibited no significant bias in newborn Olfr235 OSN quantities (1.1-fold; <italic>p</italic> = 0.8) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C, E</xref>-<italic>left</italic>), a result also observed for total OSN quantities of this subtype (1.2-fold; <italic>p</italic> = 0.1) (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3A</xref>-<italic>left</italic>). To compare the effects of UNO between experimental groups, we defined a UNO effect size as the log<sub>2</sub> (open/closed) ratio for the quantity of OSNs of a specific subtype and category (newborn or total). Using this definition, we found that the average UNO effect size for quantities of newborn Olfr235 OSNs was 14-fold larger (<italic>p</italic> = 0.014) in sex-separated males compared to females (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>-<italic>right</italic>), and 2.6-fold larger for total Olfr235 OSNs (<italic>p</italic> = 0.04; <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3A</xref>-<italic>right</italic>). These data indicate that open-side biases in newborn Olfr235 OSN quantities either require exposure to a male-emitted odor or are intrinsic to males. If the observed biases are male-odor driven, we would expect female mice housed with males to exhibit open-side biases similar in magnitude to those observed in males. To test this, we quantified newborn and total Olfr235 OSNs in juvenile females housed with their male littermates at weaning (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A, B</xref>). Strikingly, females co-housed with males exhibited a 2.2-fold (<italic>p</italic> = 0.015) greater quantity of newborn Olfr235 OSNs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>-<italic>left</italic>) and a UNO effect size 11-fold greater (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.037) than that observed for sex-separated females but not significantly different than that observed for sex-separated males (0.8-fold difference; <italic>p</italic> = 0.21) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>-<italic>right</italic>). Analogous open-side biases and differences in UNO effect sizes were observed for total Olfr235 OSN quantities (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3A</xref>). These results indicate that stimulation-dependent changes in newborn Olfr235 OSN quantities require exposure to male-emitted odors.</p>

<p>In contrast to subtype Olfr235, subtypes Olfr1440 and Olfr1431 exhibited similar levels of open-side bias in newborn OSN quantities between experimental groups.

<p>Taken together, these findings indicate that open-side biases in quantities of newborn Olfr235 OSNs require exposure to an odor that is emitted specifically by male mice, at least at the juvenile stage.

<title>Exposure to adult mice intensifies deprivation-induced reductions in quantities of newborn Olfr1431 OSNs</title>
<p>Observations that exposure to male odors is required for stimulation-dependent changes in the quantities of newborn Olfr235 but not Olfr1440 or Olfr1431 OSNs were intriguing considering that ORs of all three subtypes show male-biased expression in mice housed sex-separated until 6 months of age (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.

If so, we predicted that the age and/or sex of mice contributing to the odor environment at the time of EdU labeling might differentially affect the degree to which quantities of newborn OSNs of these subtypes are affected by olfactory deprivation. To test this, we compared open-side biases in newborn OSN quantities within UNO-treated juvenile males exposed to littermates alone versus those exposed to both littermates and adult parents (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A, B</xref>).

<title>Exposure to muscone intensifies deprivation-induced reductions in quantities of newborn OSNs of musk-responsive subtypes</title>
<p>Findings that the quantities of newborn OSNs of the musk-responsive subtypes Olfr235, Olfr1440, and Olfr1431 depend on olfactory stimulation presented an opportunity to investigate whether exposure to a cognate odorant for these subtypes (e.g., muscone) can drive changes in the quantities of newborn OSNs of specific subtypes. Considering that high levels of chronic odor stimulation can reduce OSN quantities <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, presumably <italic>via</italic> reductions in OSN lifespan, we predicted the existence of a range of muscone concentrations sufficient to accelerate the birthrates of musk-responsive subtypes without adversely affecting their survival.

<p>Interestingly, the effects of deprivation on quantities of newborn OSNs of subtype Olfr235 were found to depend strongly on the concentration of muscone to which mice were exposed, with biases of 1.1- (<italic>p</italic> = 0.8), 2.4- (<italic>p</italic> = 0.007), 2.0- (<italic>p</italic> = 0.002), and 1.2-fold (<italic>p</italic> = 0.4) observed for 0, 0.1, 1, and 10% muscone, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B, C</xref>-<italic>left</italic>). Accordingly, the UNO effect size for quantities of newborn Olfr235 OSN was 13-fold higher in mice exposed to 0.1% muscone compared to 0% (<italic>p</italic> = 0.03), but not significantly increased compared to mice exposed to 10% (<italic>p</italic> = 0.4) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>-<italic>middle</italic>). Mean open-side biases in total Olfr235 OSN quantities were also affected by muscone concentration, peaking at 0.1%, and declining to a minimum at 10%, possibly reflecting reduced OSN survival in the presence of the higher muscone concentrations (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>-<italic>right</italic>; <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5A</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to subtype Olfr235, open-side biases in quantities of newborn OSNs of subtypes Olfr1440 and Olfr1431 were more subtly affected by the concentration of muscone to which mice were exposed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D, E</xref>; <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5B, C</xref>), likely because both subtypes exhibit robust deprivation-induced biases even in the absence of muscone exposure. Most notably, subtype Olfr1431 exhibited a 1.6-fold greater UNO effect size for quantities of newborn OSNs in mice exposed to 1% muscone compared to 0% (<italic>p</italic> = 0.02), but a 20-fold smaller effect size in mice exposed to 10% (<italic>p</italic> = 0.002). For both subtypes, UNO effect sizes for quantities of total OSNs were reduced with increasing muscone concentration, indicating that muscone exposure exerts complex effects on the birth and survival of OSNs of these subtypes. As expected, muscone exposure did not significantly affect open-side biases in newborn or total OSN quantities of control subtypes Olfr912 and Olfr1463 (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5D-G</xref>). Taken together, these findings indicate that the exposure of mice to muscone can potentiate deprivation-induced reductions in quantities of newborn OSNs of musk-responsive subtypes.</p>

<p>Findings that exposure to male odors or muscone enhances deprivation-induced reductions in quantities of newborn OSNs of musk-responsive subtypes are consistent with the hypothesis that musk-like odors can increase the quantity of newborn OSNs of these subtypes. However, because these observations were based on the use of UNO, a procedure that causes physiological and sensory changes beyond odor deprivation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, we sought to test this hypothesis using a more direct approach.

<title>Stimulation-dependent changes in newborn OSN quantities are observed immediately after neurogenesis, consistent with a mechanism involving altered birthrate</title>
<p>Stimulation-dependent increases in the quantities of newborn OSNs of musk-responsive subtypes could, in theory, be caused by a mechanism that selectively accelerates the rates with which these subtypes are generated or, alternatively, the rates with which they are selectively enriched following their generation (e.g., <italic>via</italic> enhanced survival or OR switching <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>). If differences in newborn OSN quantities are mediated by selective enrichment, we would expect them to become more pronounced over time following neurogenesis, as a subset of newborn OSNs exhibit enhanced survival or switch their OR identity in the presence of stimulation. By contrast, if changes are mediated by accelerated birthrates of specific OSN subtypes, increases in newborn OSN quantities should appear immediately upon neurogenesis and remain stable over time. To distinguish between these potential mechanisms, we compared stimulation-dependent changes in quantities of newborn musk-responsive OSNs at two timepoints: 4 days post-EdU, the earliest stage during OSN differentiation when OR transcripts can be consistently detected <italic>via</italic> FISH <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, and three days later (7 days post-EdU) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A, E</xref>).

<title>Muscone exposure-dependent increases in quantities of newborn OSNs of musk-responsive subtypes persist into adulthood</title>
<p>Findings that the exposure of juvenile mice to male or musk-like odors increases quantities of newborn OSNs of subtypes responsive to these odors raise the question of whether this phenomenon is limited to early life or, rather, persists into adulthood. To begin to address this question, we compared newborn OSN quantities in 9-week-old non-occluded female mice that were either exposed or unexposed to muscone following weaning (P21), and EdU-treated at ∼8 weeks of age (P56-P58) (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 7A</xref>). Strikingly, compared to unexposed controls, muscone-exposed adults exhibited robust increases in quantities of newborn OSNs of musk-responsive subtypes: 1.5-fold (<italic>p</italic> = 0.06) for subtype Olfr235, 2.2-fold (<italic>p</italic> = 0.02) for Olfr1440, and 1.9-fold (<italic>p</italic> = 0.04) for Olfr1431, although increases for subtype Olfr235 did not reach the statistical significance threshold of 0.05 (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 7B-D</xref>).

<title>The birthrates of some musk/male-odor-responsive OSN subtypes are accelerated by exposure to those odors</title>
<p>It is well established that UNO reduces the rate of neurogenesis on the closed side of the OE relative to the open <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Recently, these deprivation-induced reductions were found to reflect diminished birthrates of only a fraction of the ∼1200 OSN subtypes, suggesting that unknown olfactory stimuli sustain the birthrates of these subtypes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Here we have described experiments to elucidate the nature of the stimuli that promote the birthrates of specific OSN subtypes, and presented evidence that these stimuli include discrete odorants that selectively stimulate the same subtypes whose birthrates are accelerated. Our study took advantage of previous findings that a group of closely related musk-responsive OSN subtypes are more highly represented in the OEs of mice exposed to male odors compared to mice isolated from them, and that some of these subtypes are responsive to male-specific odors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). These data suggested that one or more components of male odors and, potentially, musk-like odors, might accelerate the birthrates of these OSN subtypes. Here, using both scRNA-seq-based and histological approaches, we have found that, indeed, olfactory deprivation in juvenile males reduces quantities of newborn OSNs of musk-responsive subtypes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). We further found that exposure to male odors and/or muscone: 1) intensifies deprivation-induced reductions in quantities of newborn Olfr235 OSNs in female mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), and 2) increases quantities of newborn Olfr235, Olfr1440, and Olfr1431 OSNs within the OEs of non-occluded females (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). These findings support the hypothesis that the stimuli that regulate the birthrates of specific subtypes are discrete cognate odors for those subtypes.</p>
<p>Findings that quantities of newborn OSNs of the musk-responsive subtype Olfr235 are increased in the presence of male mice suggest the possibility that one or more musk-like molecules to which Olfr235 OSNs selectively respond may be emitted by male but not female mice. This would explain previous findings that total Olfr235 OSNs are more highly represented in male mice and females housed with males compared to sex-separated females <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Curiously, two other musk-responsive subtypes that likewise displayed a higher representation in males and females housed with males, Olfr1440 and Olfr1431 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, showed stimulation-dependent changes in newborn OSN quantities in both male and female mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), while a third such subtype, Olfr1437, exhibited no stimulation-dependent changes in newborn OSN quantities in mice of either sex (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and not shown). Considering the close relationship of the ORs that define musk-responsive OSN subtypes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, the mechanism underlying these differences is intriguing. One hypothetical explanation is that musk-responsive OSN subtypes vary in their sensitivity to distinct musk-like odorant molecules <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, which may be differentially emitted by mice in an age- and sex-dependent manner. Indeed, mouse odor profiles are known to vary considerably as a function of age and sex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. In support of this hypothesis, we found that exposure of juvenile mice to adults intensifies deprivation-induced reductions in quantities of newborn Olfr1431 OSNs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Future identification of the natural odorants to which these subtypes respond will be important to enable further testing of this hypothesis.</p>

<title>Stimulation-dependent changes in quantities of newborn OSNs of male/musk-responsive subtypes reflect altered rates of neurogenesis</title>
<p>A previous study found evidence that reduced quantities of newborn OSNs of specific subtypes observed following naris occlusion are most consistent with a mechanism involving decreased OSN birthrates, not increased rates of newborn OSN apoptosis or subtype switching <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. This evidence included findings that UNO-induced open-side biases in the quantities of newborn OSNs of specific subtypes display a near-maximum shortly following the onset of OR expression (4 days post-EdU) and do not differ significantly thereafter. These results appear inconsistent with a mechanism involving the selective apoptosis or subtype switching of newborn OSNs, which would be expected to cause a gradual increase in open-side biases over time. Similarly, the present study finds that UNO-induced open-side biases in quantities of newborn OSNs of musk/male odor-responsive subtypes do not differ significantly between 4 and 7 days post-EdU (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B-D</xref>). Moreover, findings from the present study based on the exposure of non-occluded mice to male or musk odors (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) indicate that altered quantities of newborn OSNs of musk-responsive subtypes cannot be explained by hypothetical UNO-induced increases in the rates of newborn OSN death or subtype switching. Observations that the magnitude of muscone exposure-induced increases in newborn OSN quantities do not differ significantly between 4 and 7 days post-EdU (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F-I</xref>) reinforce that these changes are unlikely due to apoptosis or OR switching, although they do not strictly exclude the possibility that such mechanisms occur prior to 4 days post-EdU. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence that male/musk odor-dependent changes in the quantities of newborn OSNs reflect altered OSN birthrates.</p>

<title>How do discrete odors accelerate the birthrates of specific OSN subtypes?</title>
<p>Our findings that specific OSN subtypes exhibit accelerated birthrates following the exposure of mice to cognate odors for these subtypes indicate that this process occurs <italic>via</italic> a mechanism that is highly selective with respect to the stimulating odors and the subtypes whose birthrates are accelerated. Considering that horizontal basal cells (HBCs) and globose basal cells (GBCs), the stem and progenitor cells that give rise to new OSNs, lack ORs and signal transduction molecules needed to detect and respond to odors, we hypothesize the existence of a signaling pathway from mature OSNs to HBCs or GBCs that alters the rates at which OSNs of specific subtypes are born. Findings from the present study and a previous one <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> indicate that this signaling capacity may be limited to only a fraction of OSN subtypes, since a majority of subtypes do not exhibit accelerated neurogenesis upon stimulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Subtype Olfr912, for example, which detects the male-specific odor component 2-sec-butyl-4,5-dihydrothiazole (SBT) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, exhibits no increase in birthrate upon exposure of female mice to male odors, and was therefore employed in this study as a control subtype (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). We hypothesize that the receipt of odor-derived signals by HBCs or GBCs alters OR choices or amplifies choices that have already been made. Elucidating the nature of odor-dependent signals received by HBCs/GBCs, as well as the mechanism by which these signals accelerate the birthrates of specific OSN subtypes are important areas of future investigation.</p>

<title>What function does odor stimulation-dependent neurogenesis serve?</title>
<p>Because OSN differentiation entails the stochastic process of singular OR choice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, it has long been assumed that OSN neurogenesis is entirely stochastic with respect to OR identity. Thus, unlike other regions of the nervous system where persistent neurogenesis is known to play important adaptive roles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, life-long neurogenesis within the OE is generally assumed to serve the merely homeostatic function of replacing neurons lost to turnover and injury <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Results of the present study, together with those of a previous one <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, challenge these assumptions by demonstrating that neurogenesis is not entirely stochastic with respect to subtype, but rather that the birthrates of a fraction of OSN subtypes can be selectively and directionally regulated by discrete odor experiences (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). These findings suggest the possibility that persistent neurogenesis within the OE may serve an unknown adaptive function in addition to the known homeostatic one. It is conceivable, for example, that the acceleration of the birthrates of specific OSN subtypes could selectively enhance sensitivity to odors detected by those subtypes by increasing their representation within the OE <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Under this scenario, OSNs of affected subtypes might have baseline (unamplified) representations that lie within the dynamic range for signaling to projection neurons under physiological concentrations of cognate odors, such that amplification <italic>via</italic> neurogenesis could enhance their sensitivity. This effect could have relevance to observations in both rodents and humans that exposure to specific odors can dramatically increase sensitivity to them <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Alternatively, or in addition, OSNs produced <italic>via</italic> odor-dependent neurogenesis could conceivably enable the formation of new OB glomeruli and connections with projection neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Under this scenario, stimulation-dependent neurogenesis of specific subtypes could alter inputs to the olfactory cortex and thereby regulate the perception of, and behavioral responses to, specific odors.</p>

<caption><p>Model for the selective acceleration of the birthrates of specific OSN subtypes by discrete odors that stimulate them. A fraction of OSN subtypes (e.g., Olfr235), upon stimulation by discrete odors (e.g., muscone), undergo accelerated rates of neurogenesis. Other subtypes (e.g., Olfr912) do not exhibit altered rates of neurogenesis upon stimulation by discrete odors that stimulate them (e.g., SBT). A hypothetical mechanism involves selective stimulation-dependent signaling by mature OSNs of specific subtypes to neural progenitors.</p></caption>

<p>Results of the present study demonstrate that the birthrates of musk-responsive subtypes can be regulated by exposure to musk odors, a group of compounds that are naturally emitted by numerous mammalian species <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> and, in mice, activate a small number of related and evolutionarily conserved odorant receptors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. Findings that odors emitted by mice can also activate these subtypes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> suggest that musk-like compounds may contribute to the odors emitted by mice. For some mammals, musk odors are known to function in attracting mates, marking territory, and deterring predators <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Moreover, exposure to musk odors has been reported to cause physiological changes in some mammals, including humans, suggesting that they can function as semiochemicals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. In mice, the physiological functions of musk odors, if any, are unknown, although they have been found to be selectively attractive to male mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Results from the present study suggest that exposure to musk compounds may mediate adaptive changes within the mouse OE that reflect a special salience for these odors.</p>

Slide-mounted sections were warmed (37 °C, 5 min), equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2; 3 min, room temperature [RT]), fixed in paraformaldehyde (PFA; 4% in PBS; 10 min, RT), washed in PBS (3 min, RT), permeabilized with Triton-X-100 (0.5% in PBS; 10 min, RT) followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate (1% in PBS; 3 min, RT), washed in PBS (3 × 3 min, RT), incubated in acetylation solution (triethanolamine [0.1 M; pH 7.5], acetic anhydride [0.25%]; 10 min, RT), washed in PBS (3 × 3 min, RT), incubated in hybridization solution (formamide [50%], SSC [5×], Denhardts [5×], yeast tRNA [250 µg/mL], herring sperm DNA [500 µg/mL], heparin [50 µg/mL], EDTA [2.5 mM], Tween-20 [0.1%], CHAPS [0.25 %]; 30 min, RT), hybridized with a DIG-labeled antisense RNA probe (1:750 in hybridization solution; 16 hr, 65 °C), washed with SSC (5×; 1 × 5 min, 65 °C), washed with SSC (0.2×; 4 × 20 min, 65 °C), incubated in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (3% in TN [Tris-HCl (0.1 M; pH 7.5), 0.15 M NaCl]; 30 min, RT), washed in TNT (Tween-20 [0.05%] in TN; 5 × 3 min, RT), incubated in TNB (Blocking Reagent [Perkin Elmer; 0.05% in TN]; 30 min, RT), incubated with anti-DIG-POD antibody (Roche; 1:1000 in TNB; 12 hr, 4 °C), and washed in TNT (3 × 20 min, RT). Fluorescent signals corresponding to the target transcript were generated using the Tyramide Signal Amplification (TSA) Plus Fluorescein Kit (Perkin Elmer) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Slides were washed in 3% BSA in PBS (2 × 5 min, RT, with gentle rocking), incubated with EdU reaction solution (4 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub>, 4 µM Sulfo-Cyanine 3 Azide [Lumiprobe], 100 mM sodium ascorbate [prepared fresh], in PBS; 30 min, RT, in darkness), and washed with 3% BSA in PBS (2 × 3 min, RT). Slides were washed in TNT (2 × 3 min, RT), incubated in DAPI (300 nM in TN; 3 min, RT), washed in TNT (1 × 3 min, RT), and mounted using Vectashield (Vector Laboratories).

<list-item><p><underline>Image acquisition and processing</underline>. Images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 900 with Airyscan 2 microscope with an automated stage and Zen Blue software (Zeiss). Mosaic images were stitched, and each fluorescence channel was adjusted individually to enhance contrast and reduce background using Zen Blue software. Images were exported in jpg format, rotated and cropped using Adobe Photoshop, and labeled using Adobe Illustrator (Adobe Systems).

<list-item><p><underline>Quality criteria for sectioned OEs</underline>. For each mouse, UNO efficiency was determined by staining OE sections for <italic>S100a5</italic> mRNA <italic>via</italic> one-color RNA-FISH. For each section analyzed, <italic>S100a5</italic> mRNA intensities were evaluated within paired regions on the two sides of each OE section. OEs from UNO-treated mice were excluded from further analysis if the mean <italic>S100a5</italic> mRNA staining intensity on the open side of the OE was not clearly greater than that on the closed side. All sections were also assessed for left-right symmetry and for intactness. Individual OE sections were excluded if they were not visually symmetrical or were less than 90% intact. No data were otherwise excluded. For additional details, see <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>.</p></list-item>

<list-item><p><underline>scRNA-seq-based analysis of UNO-induced changes in subtype-specific OSN quantities</underline>. OSNs were quantified within scRNA-seq datasets generated from the open and closed sides of the OE of a male mouse that had been UNO-treated at P14 and euthanized at P28 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE157119">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE157119</ext-link>). OSNs of interest were quantified from the open and closed datasets using the Loupe Cell Browser (10X Genomics). Newborn OSNs of specific subtypes were identified by expression of <italic>Gap43</italic> (Log<sub>2</sub> UMI &gt; 1) and a specific OR gene (Log<sub>2</sub> UMI &gt; 3). Total OSNs of specific subtypes were identified by expression of <italic>Gap43</italic> (Log<sub>2</sub> UMI &gt; 1) and/or <italic>Omp</italic> (Log<sub>2</sub> UMI &gt; 3) and a specific OR gene (Log<sub>2</sub> UMI &gt; 3). The percentage of the total cell population represented by newborn and total OSNs of specific subtypes were determined from the total number of cells in each dataset.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><underline>Quantification of OR+ and OR+/EdU+ cellular abundance</underline>. Cell counts corresponding to each mouse were determined from images of a series of at least 5 stained coronal sections located ∼400 µm apart and spanning the anterior-posterior length of the OE. Counting was performed separately on the right and left side of each OE section, with the experimenter blinded to sample groups and section orientations. The open and closed sides of OEs from UNO-treated mice were determined after counting was complete using fluorescent signals corresponding to <italic>S100a5</italic> mRNA (on adjacent sections). Cells containing EdU+ nuclei (Cy3-signal) that were at least 50% overlapping with OR mRNA signals (FITC-signal) were considered EdU+/OR+ OSNs. For additional details, see <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><underline>Statistics</underline>. For all statistical analyses, a significance threshold of <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 was used. Statistical analyses of comparisons of OSN counts between the open and closed sides were performed using a two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic>-test, in which the two sides of an OE were paired. This enabled statistical analyses of differences between the two sides independent of OSN number and staining variance between sections. For comparisons of samples between different non-occluded animals, a two-tailed unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test was used. For comparisons of UNO effect sizes between 4 and 7 days post-EdU, a two-tailed unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test was used. For comparisons of differences in quantities of newborn OSNs of musk-responsive subtypes at 4 and 7 days post-EdU between non-occluded mice exposed and unexposed to muscone, a two sample ANOVA - fixed-test, using F distribution (right-tailed) was used. Data presented in figures represent mean +/- SEM. For additional details, see <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><underline>Sample-size estimation</underline>. Results from previous studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> were used to determine an appropriate sample size for comparing the number of OR+ and OR+/EdU+ OSNs on the open and closed sides of the OE. Previously, it was found that for an OR with a typical expression frequency (∼0.1%) and an effect size of ∼2-fold, 12 OE sections taken from four different animals were sufficient to find a highly statistically significant difference (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic> test). In the current study, the sample sizes used were typically larger than this. For comparisons between OE sections from different animals, results from previous analyses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> were again used to determine an appropriate sample size. Previously, we had found that for an OR with a typical expression frequency (∼0.1%) and an effect size of ∼2-fold, 20 OE sections taken from four different animals was sufficient to find a highly statistically significant difference between different animals (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; two-tailed unpaired <italic>t</italic> test).

First, the effects described could, in part, also be attributed to &quot;downregulation&quot; of OR subtype-specific neurogenesis upon sensory deprivation, instead of selectively increased neurogenesis.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in the olfactory epithelium detect myriads of environmental odors that signal essential cues for survival. OSNs are born throughout life and thus represent one of the few neurons that undergo life-long neurogenesis. Until recently, it was assumed that OSN neurogenesis is strictly stochastic with respect to subtype (i.e. the receptor the OSN chooses to express).</p>
<p>However, a recent study showed that olfactory deprivation via naris occlusion selectively reduced birthrates of only a fraction of OSN subtypes and indicated that these subtypes appear to have a special capacity to undergo changes in birthrates in accordance with the level of olfactory stimulation. These previous findings raised the interesting question of what type of stimulation influences neurogenesis, since naris occlusion does not only reduce the exposure to potentially thousands of odors but also to more generalized mechanical stimuli via preventing airflow.</p>
<p>In this study, the authors set out to identify the stimuli that are required to promote the neurogenesis of specific OSN subtypes. Specifically, they aim to test the hypothesis that discrete odorants selectively stimulate the same OSN subtypes whose birthrates are affected. This would imply a highly specific mechanism in which exposure to certain odors can &quot;amplify&quot; OSN subtypes responsive to those odors suggesting that OE neurogenesis serves, in part, an adaptive function.</p>
<p>To address this question, the authors focused on a family of OSN subtypes that had previously been identified to respond to musk-related odors and that exhibit higher transcript levels in the olfactory epithelium of mice exposed to males compared to mice isolated from males. First, the authors confirm via a previously established cell birth dating assay in unilateral naris occluded mice that this increase in transcript levels actually reflects a stimulus-dependent birthrate acceleration of this OSN subtype family. In a series of experiments using the same assay, they show that one specific subtype of this OSN family exhibits increased birthrates in response to juvenile male exposure while a different subtype shows increased birthrates to adult mouse exposure. In the core experiment of the study, they finally exposed naris occluded mice to a discrete odor (muscone) to test if this odor specifically accelerates the birth rates of OSN types that are responsive to this odor. This experiment reveals a complex relationship between birth rate acceleration and odor concentrations showing that some muscone concentrations affect birth rates of some members of this family and do not affect two unrelated OSN subtypes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The scientific question is valid and opens an interesting direction. The previously established cell birth dating assay in naris occluded mice is well performed and accompanied by several control experiments addressing potential other interpretations of the data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The main research question of this study was to test if discrete odors specifically accelerate the birth rate of OSN subtypes they stimulate, i.e. does muscone only accelerate the birth rate of OSNs that express muscone-responsive ORs, or vice versa is the birthrate of muscone-responsive OSNs only accelerated by odors they respond to?</p>
<p>This question is only addressed in Figure 5 of the manuscript and the results only partially support the above claim. The authors test one specific odor (muscone) and find that this odor (only at certain concentrations) accelerates the birth rate of some musk-responsive OSN subtypes, but not two other unrelated control OSN subtypes. This does not at all show that musk-responsive OSN subtypes are only affected by odors that stimulate them and that muscone only affects the birthrate of musk-responsive OSNs, since first, only the odor muscone was tested and second, only two other OSN subtypes were tested as controls, that, importantly, are shown to be generally stimulus-independent OSN subtypes (see Figure 2 and S2).</p>
<p>As a minimum the authors should have a) tested if additional odors that do not activate the three musk-responsive subtypes affect their birthrate b) choose 2-3 additional control subtypes that are known to be stimulus-dependent (from their own 2020 study) and test if muscone affects their birthrates.</p>
<p>(2) The finding that Olfr1440 expressing OSNs do not show any increase in UNO effect size under any muscone concentration (Figure 5D, no significance in line graph for UNO effect sizes, middle) seems to contradict the main claim of this study that certain odors specifically increase birthrates of OSN subtypes they stimulate. It was shown in several studies that olfr1440 is seemingly the most sensitive OR for muscone, yet, in this study, muscone does not further increase birthrates of OSNs expressing olfr1440. The effect size on birthrate under muscone exposure is the same as without muscone exposure (0%).</p>
<p>In contrast, the supposedly second most sensitive muscone-responsive OR olfr235 shows a significant increase in UNO effect size between no muscone exposure (0%) and 0.1% as well as 1% muscone.</p>
<p>(3) The authors introduce their choice to study this particular family of OSN subtypes with first, the previous finding that transcripts for one of these musk-responsive subtypes (olfr235) are downregulated in mice that are deprived of male odors. Second, musk-related odors are found in the urine of different species. This gives the misleading impression that it is known that musk-related odors are indeed excreted into male mouse urine at certain concentrations. This should be stated more clearly in the introduction (or cited, if indeed data exist that show musk-related odors in male mouse urine) because this would be a very important point from an ethological and mechanistic point of view.</p>
<p>In addition, this would also be important information to assess if the chosen muscone concentrations fall at all into the natural range.</p>
<p>Related: If these are male-specific cues, it is interesting that changes in OR transcripts (Figure 1) can already be seen at the age of P28 where other male-specific cues are just starting to get expressed. This should be discussed.</p>
<p>(4) Figure 5: Under muscone exposure the number of newborn neurons on the closed sides fluctuates considerably. This doesn't seem to be the case in other experiments and raises some concerns about how reliable the naris occlusion works for strong exposure to monomolecular odors or what other potential mechanisms are at play.</p>
<p>(5) In contrast to all other musk-responsive OSN types, the number of newborn OSNs expressing olfr1437 increases on the closed side of the OE relative to the open in UNO-treated male mice (Figure 1). This seems to contradict the presented theory and also does not align with the bulk RNAseq data (Figure S1).</p>
<p>(6) The authors hypothesize in relation to the accelerated birthrate of musk-responsive OSN subtypes that &quot;the acceleration of the birthrates of specific OSN subtypes could selectively enhance sensitivity to odors detected by those subtypes by increasing their representation within the OE&quot;. However, for two other OSN subtypes that detect male-specific odors, they hypothesize the opposite &quot;By contrast, Olfr912 (Or8b48) and Olfr1295 (Or4k45), which detect the male-specific non-musk odors 2-sec-butyl-4,5-dihydrothiazole (SBT) and (methylthio)methanethiol (MTMT), respectively, exhibited lower representation and/or transcript levels in mice exposed to male odors, possibly reflecting reduced survival due to overstimulation.&quot;</p>
<p>Without any further explanation, it is hard to comprehend why exposure to male-derived odors should, on one hand, accelerate birthrates in some OSN subtypes to potentially increase sensitivity to male odors, but on the other hand, lower transcript levels and does not accelerate birth rates of other OSN subtypes due to overstimulation.</p>

<p>In their paper entitled &quot;In mice, discrete odors can selectively promote the neurogenesis of sensory neuron subtypes that they stimulate&quot; Hossain et al. address lifelong neurogenesis in the mouse main olfactory epithelium. The authors hypothesize that specific odorants act as neurogenic stimuli that selectively promote biased OR gene choice (and thus olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) identity). Hossain et al. employ RNA-seq and scRNA-seq analyses for subtype-specific OSN birthdating. The authors find that exposure to male and musk odors accelerates the birthrates of the respective responsive OSNs. Therefore, Hossain et al. suggest that odor experience promotes selective neurogenesis and, accordingly, OSN neurogenesis may act as a mechanism for long-term olfactory adaptation.</p>
<p>The authors follow a clear experimental logic, based on sensory deprivation by unilateral naris occlusion, EdU labeling of newborn neurons, and histological analysis via OR-specific RNA-FISH. The results reveal robust effects of deprivation on newborn OSN identity. However, the major weakness of the approach is that the results could, in (possibly large) parts, depend on &quot;downregulation&quot; of OR subtype-specific neurogenesis, rather than (only) &quot;upregulation&quot; based on odor exposure. While, in Figure 6, the authors show that the observed effects are, in part, mediated by odor stimulation, it remains unclear whether deprivation plays an &quot;active&quot; role as well. Moreover, as shown in Figure 1C, unilateral naris occlusion has both positive and negative effects in a random subtype sample.</p>
<p>Another weakness is that the authors build their model (Figure 8), specifically the concept of selectivity, on a receptor-ligand pair (Olfr912 that has been shown to respond, among other odors, to the male-specific non-musk odors 2-sec-butyl-4,5-dihydrothiazole (SBT)) that would require at least some independent experimental corroboration. At least, a control experiment that uses SBT instead of muscone exposure should be performed. In this context, it is somewhat concerning that some results, which appear counterintuitive (e.g., lower representation and/or transcript levels of Olfr912 and Olfr1295 in mice exposed to male odors) are brushed off as &quot;reflecting reduced survival due to overstimulation.&quot; The notion of &quot;reduced survival&quot; could be tested by, for example, a caspase3 assay.</p>
<p>
Important analyses that need to be done to better be able to interpret the findings are to present (i) the OR+/EdU+ population of olfactory sensory neurons not just as a count per hemisection, but rather as the ratio of OR+/EdU+ cells among all EdU+ cells; and (ii) to the ratio of EdU+ cells among all nuclei (UNO versus open naris). This way, data would be normalized to (i) the overall rate of neurogenesis and (ii) any broad deprivation-dependent epithelial degeneration.</p>
<p>Finally, the paper will benefit from improved data presentation and adequate statistical testing. Images in Figures 2 - 7, showing both EdU labeling of newborn neurons and OR-specific RNA-FISH, are hard to interpret. Moreover, t-tests should not be employed when data is not normally distributed (as is the case for most of their samples).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Neurogenesis in the mammalian olfactory epithelium persists throughout the life of the animal. The process replaces damaged or dying olfactory sensory neurons. It has been tacitly that replacement of the OR subtypes is stochastic, although anecdotal evidence has suggested that this may not be the case. In this study, Santoro and colleagues systematically test this hypothesis by answering three questions: is there enrichment of specific OR subtypes associated with neurogenesis? Is the enrichment dependent on sensory stimulus? Is the enrichment the result of differential generation of the OR type or from differential cell death regulated by neural activity? The authors provide some solid evidence indicating that musk odor stimulus selectively promotes the OR types expressing the musk receptors. The evidence argues against a random selection of ORs in the regenerating neurons.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strength of the study is a thorough and systematic investigation of the expression of multiple musk receptors with unilateral naris occlusion or under different stimulus conditions. The controls are properly performed. This study is the first to formulate the selective promotion hypothesis and the first systematic investigation to test it. The bulk of the study uses in situ hybridization and immunofluorescent staining to estimate the number of OR types. These results convincingly demonstrate the increased expression of musk receptors in response to male odor or muscone stimulation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A major weakness of the current study is the single-cell RNASeq result. The authors use this piece of data as a broad survey of receptor expression in response to unilateral nasal occlusion. However, several issues with this data raise serious concerns about the quality of the experiment and the conclusions. First, the proportion of OSNs, including both the immature and mature types, constitutes only a small fraction of the total cells. In previous studies of the OSNs using the scRNASeq approach, OSNs constitute the largest cell population. It is curious why this is the case. Second, the authors did not annotate the cell types, making it difficult to assess the potential cause of this discrepancy. Third, given the small number of OSNs, it is surprising to have multiple musk receptors detected in the open side of the olfactory epithelium whereas almost none in the closed side. Since each OR type only constitutes ~0.1% of OSNs on average, the number of detected musk receptors is too high to be consistent with our current understanding and the rest of the data in the manuscript. Finally, unlike the other experiments, the authors did not describe any method details, nor was there any description of quality controls associated with the experiment. The concerns over the scRNASeq data do not diminish the value of the data presented in the bulk of the study but could be used for further analysis.</p>
<p>A weakness of the experiment assessing musk receptor expression is that the authors do not distinguish immature from mature OSNs. Immature OSNs express multiple receptor types before they commit to the expression of a single type. The experiments do not reveal whether mature OSNs maintain an elevated expression level of musk receptors.</p>
<p>There are also two conceptual issues that are of concern. The first is the concept of selective neurogenesis. The data show an increased expression of musk receptors in response to male odor stimulation. The authors argue that this indicates selective neurogenesis of the musk receptor types. However, it is not clear what the distinction is between elevated receptor expression and a commitment to a specific fate at an early stage of development. As immature OSNs express multiple receptors, a likely scenario is that some newly differentiated immature OSNs have elevated expression of not only the musk receptors but also other receptors. The current experiments do not distinguish the two alternatives. Moreover, as pointed out above, it is not clear whether mature OSNs maintain the increased expression. Although a scRNASeq experiment can clarify it, the authors, unfortunately, did not perform an in-depth analysis to determine at which point of neurogenesis the cells commit to a specific musk receptor type. The quality of the scRNASeq data unfortunately also does not lend confidence for this type of analysis.</p>
<p>A second conceptual issue, the idea of homeostasis in regeneration, which the authors presented in the Introduction, needs clarification. In its current form, it is confusing. It could mean that a maintenance of the distribution of receptor types, or it could mean the proper replacement of a specific OR type upon the loss of this type. The authors seem to refer to the latter and should define it properly.</p>
