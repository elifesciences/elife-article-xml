<title>Abstract</title><p>SRSF2 plays a dual role, functioning both as a transcriptional regulator and a key player in alternative splicing. The absence of SRSF2 in MyoD+ progenitors resulted in perinatal mortality in mice, accompanied by severe skeletal muscle defects. SRSF2 deficiency disrupts the directional migration of MyoD progenitors, causing them to disperse into both muscle and non-muscle regions. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis revealed significant alterations in SRSF2-deficient myoblasts, including a reduction in extracellular matrix components, diminished expression of genes involved in ameboid-type cell migration and cytoskeleton organization, mitosis irregularities, and premature differentiation. Notably, one of the targets regulated by SRSF2 is the serine/threonine kinase Aurka. Knockdown of Aurka led to reduced cell proliferation, disrupted cytoskeleton, and impaired differentiation, reflecting the effects seen with SRSF2 knockdown. Crucially, the introduction of exogenous Aurka in SRSF2-knockdown cells markedly alleviated the differentiation defects caused by SRSF2 knockdown. Furthermore, our research unveiled the role of SRSF2 in controlling alternative splicing within genes associated with human skeletal muscle diseases, such as BIN1, DMPK, FHL1, and LDB3. Specifically, the precise knockdown of the Bin1 exon17-containing variant, which is excluded following SRSF2 depletion, profoundly disrupted C2C12 cell differentiation. In summary, our study offers valuable insights into the role of SRSF2 in governing MyoD progenitors to specific muscle regions, thereby controlling their differentiation through the regulation of targeted genes and alternative splicing during skeletal muscle development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Myogenic progenitors (MPCs) are a specialized type of precursor cell responsible for the formation of skeletal muscle cells during embryonic development. The process begins with the transformation of the dermomyotome into segmented structures known as somites, which serve as a reservoir for MPCs expressing essential transcription factors Pax3 and Pax7(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Relaix et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Relaix et al., 2005</xref>). These MPCs acquires their myogenic identity by activating specific myogenic regulatory factors, including Myf5, MyoD, Myog and Myf6(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Braun and Gautel, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Among these factors, Myf5+ progenitors are key players in expanding the myogenic progenitor pool through extensive proliferation, as well as in the initial migration from somites to muscle-forming regions and the establishment of early muscle primordia(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Tajbakhsh et al., 1996</xref>). The absence of Pax3 and Myf5 results in the inactivation of MyoD, ultimately leading to the absence of skeletal muscles in the body(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Tajbakhsh et al., 1997</xref>). This highlights the hierarchical relationship between Myf5 and MyoD, with Myf5 acting as an upstream regulator of MyoD. Myf5+ progenitors serve as a source for MyoD+ progenitors, these two populations collaborate in a coordinated manner to ensure the proper formation and growth of skeletal muscles during embryonic development(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Rodriguez-Outeirino et al., 2021</xref>). In the perinatal stages, MPCs play a crucial role in establishing the satellite cell (SC) pool, which serve as a reservoir of muscle stem cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Relaix <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). MyoD was not expressed in quiescent SCs but showed high levels of expression in activated and proliferative myoblasts, which are the progeny of SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Zammit et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The extracellular matrix (ECM) and cytoskeleton play vital roles in maintaining the structural integrity of cells and tissues, while also exerting a profound influence on cell behavior(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Csapo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">D’Urso and Kurniawan, 2020</xref>). Specifically, the ECM serves as a scaffold for cell adhesion and migration, playing a critical role in regulating signaling pathways that control cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Csapo <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). On the other hand, the cytoskeleton is responsible for maintaining cell shape and polarity, facilitating intracellular transport, and aiding in cell division(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">D’Urso and Kurniawan, 2020</xref>). In the context of skeletal muscle development, interactions of MPCs with the ECM, as well as the dynamic rearrangements of the cytoskeleton, are critical for guiding directional migration of MPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Choi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Yin et al., 2013</xref>). Actin filaments, a fundamental component of the cytoskeleton, undergo dynamic changes leading to the formation of protrusions like lamellipodia and filopodia, which assist in forward movement(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Lappalainen et al., 2022</xref>). Meanwhile, microtubules, another critical part of the cytoskeleton, contribute to cell polarity and play a role in establishing and maintaining direction during migration. The reduction of both ECM and cytoskeleton components has a significant impact on myoblast migration, cell division and differentiation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Osses et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>It’s noteworthy that splicing and transcription regulator SRSF2 emerges as a critical regulator that inhibits apoptosis in My5+progenitors and maintain their migratory capability during embryonic skeletal muscle development. The absence of SRSF2 in Myf5+ progenitors leads to a high rate of myoblasts apoptosis, as well as aberrant migration, ultimately resulting in the complete loss of mature myofibers(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Guo et al., 2022</xref>). This emphasizes the essential role of SRSF2 in promoting the survival of Myf5+ progenitors and its significance in ensuring the successful progression of skeletal muscle development.</p>
<p>In this study, we observed that the absence of SRSF2 in MyoD+ progenitors resulted in the perinatal mortality in mice, primarily due to respiratory failure. SRSF2 deficiency markedly disrupted the directional migration capacity of MyoD+ progenitors, causing them to disperse into both muscle and non-muscle regions. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis revealed notable changes in SRSF2- deficient myoblasts, including reduced ECM components, diminished expression of genes involved in ameboid-type cell migration and cytoskeleton organization, mitosis irregularities, and impaired differentiation. Significantly, SRSF2 regulates the expression of the serine/threonine kinase Aurka. Knockdown of Aurka resulted in decreased cell proliferation and impaired differentiation, resembling SRSF2 knockdown effects. Aurka overexpression in SRSF2-depleted cells significantly rescued the differentiation defects, underscoring the critical role of SRSF2-regulated Aurka expression in myoblast differentiation. Furthermore, our findings demonstrated the involvement of SRSF2 in alternative splicing of genes linked to human skeletal muscle diseases, including BIN1, DMPK, FHL1, and LDB3. Specifically, targeted knockdown of the Bin1 exon17-containing variant, skipped upon SRSF2 depletion, severely disrupted myoblast differentiation. In summary, our study provides valuable insights into SRSF2’s role in directing MyoD progenitors to distinct muscle regions, thereby regulating their differentiation through targeted gene regulation and alternative splicing during skeletal muscle development.</p>

<title>Inactivation of SRSF2 in MyoD+ progenitors led to significant differentiation defects in skeletal muscle, resulting in perinatal death in mice</title>
<p>The absence of SRSF2 in Myf5+ progenitors results in a significant increase in myoblasts apoptosis during embryonic development. This genetic condition leads to rib deformities and muscle loss in the limbs and body wall in mice, causing the demise of knockout pups immediately after birth(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Guo <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). To eliminate the potential influence of rib deformities on mouse mortality and to concentrate on SRSF2’s role on myogenesis, we employed a selective disruption of the <italic>Srsf2</italic> gene in MyoD+ myogenic progenitors through crossbreeding SRSF2<sup>f/f</sup> mice (WT) with MyoD<sup>Cre</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chen et al., 2005</xref>), leading to the generation of SRSF2<sup>f/f</sup>;Myod-cre mice (SRSF2-KO) (Fig.S1).</p>
<p>Newborn KO pups exhibited normal morphology but had empty stomachs without any milk and showed reduced body weight compared to their WT counterparts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). KO pups did not survive beyond the second day after birth (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1C</xref>), suggesting potential respiratory issues. This observation prompted us to examine the condition of their lungs. The lungs of KO pups appeared congested compared to those of WT pups, and they sank in water while WT lungs floated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). HE staining further revealed collapsed alveoli in the KO lungs at postnatal day 1 (P1) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1E</xref>).</p>

<p>Histological examination of various skeletal muscles regions revealed striking differentiation defects in P1 KO mice. Notably, the characteristic myofibers typically observed in the longitudinal sections of WT controls were conspicuously absent, instead replaced by shortened, irregular fibers in KO mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>, top panel). These muscle abnormalities were consistently observed in the tongue and diaphragm as well (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>, bottom panel). In transverse sections of the diaphragm from KO mice, there was a noticeable reduction in diaphragm thickness and the presence of cavities within the muscle fibers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). Desmin, a marker for myoblasts and newly formed fibers, exhibited significantly weaker staining in hindlimb sections of the KO group compared to the control group (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). Myh3, a marker for terminal differentiation, displayed an irregular and loosened staining pattern along with the presence of central nuclei features in intercostal muscle sections of the KO group (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>). In summary, the deficiency of SRSF2 had a profound and disruptive impact on the formation of skeletal muscles, resulting in dysfunction that rendered KO mice unable to suckle for milk and breathe effectively.</p>

<title>RNA-seq analysis and disrupted sarcomere structures in KO skeletal muscle</title>
<p>To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying SRSF2 deficiency in skeletal muscle differentiation, we conducted RNA-seq analysis on diaphragm muscle samples collected from P1 mice. Differential gene analysis identified 160 up-regulated genes and 244 down-regulated genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed that these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were significantly enriched in key cellular components, including mitochondria, myosin complex, contractile fibers, Z-disc, among others. Moreover, these DEGs displayed enrichment crucial molecular functions such as transmembrane transporter activity, integrin binding, cytoskeletal protein binding, among others (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To validate these findings, we selected several genes based on their functions. For example, Scn4b encodes a protein associated with voltage-gated sodium channels, while Stac2 is involved in the regulation of calcium ion influx in muscle cells. Symm plays a key role in the formation of sarcomeres, which are the contractile unites of muscle cells, and Tmod4 is responsible for maintaining the structural integrity of skeletal muscle by regulating the stability of actin filaments. Our qPCR analysis provided further confirmation by demonstrating a significant reduction in the expression levels of these selected genes in the KO group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>Actin is a major component of the thin filaments in the sarcomeres, and phalloidin is a fluorescent compound that selectively binds to and labels F-actin (filamentous actin). Phalloidin labeling in diaphragm sections revealed disarrangement of actin filaments in the KO group when compared to the WT group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). To gain deeper insights, we conducted transmission electron microscopy experiments to examine the sarcomere and Triad structures in the hindlimb sections. Sarcomeres are characterized by their highly organized structure, while Triads are specialized structures involved in the regulation of calcium ions required for muscle contraction. Our findings revealed well-organized sarcomere and Triad structures in the WT group. In contrast, these structures were substantially disrupted in the KO group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). This disruption could lead to impaired muscle functions, affecting their ability to contract ad relax efficiently.</p>

<p>We then developed a tracer mouse model through the crossbreeding of Rosa26-tdTomato mice with MyoD<sup>cre</sup> and SRSR2<sup>f/f</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>).

<p>In the analysis of embryo sections harvested from control mice at E14.5, the utilization of tdT staining, MHC staining, and the subsequent examination of the co-localization of tdT and MHC signals provided unequivocal evidence of the successful migration of MyoD-derived cells into the muscle region (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref> and Fig. S2). Subsequently, these cells underwent proliferation and differentiation, ultimately culminating in their significant contributions to the development of a highly organized muscle structure. In tdT/KO sections, MyoD-derived cells not only migrated into the intended muscle region but also dispersed widely into numerous non-muscular territories (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, white arrows). This intriguing pattern strongly suggests migration defects of MyoD-derived cells resulting from the loss of SRSF2 at this stage. Moreover, even within the confines of the muscle region, tdT/KO embryos displayed a marked reduction in the degree of cellular differentiation when compared to the control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). This impaired differentiation ultimately led to noticeable lack of precise co-localization between tdT and MHC signals (Fig. S2).</p>
<p>Consistent with the migratory defects observed in E14.5 KO sections, in the hindlimb sections of E15.5 KO mice, as well as the hindlimb and intercostal muscle sections of KO mice at the perinatal stage (P1), tdT staining also revealed a substantial presence of MyoD-derived cells distributed beyond the muscle regions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>, white arrows). These findings further confirmed that the deficiency in SRSF2 profoundly impacts the capacity of MyoD-derived cells to undergo directed migration specifically into the skeletal muscle region.</p>
<p>Moreover, we conducted immunostaining on both longitudinal and cross-sections of diaphragm in newborn mice (P1). In the control group, our examination of longitudinal sections revealed a remarkable co-localization between the tdT signals and the densely compacted muscle fibers stained with MHC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). Within the cross-sectional views, the tdT-stained regions exhibited a consistent and well-organized arrangement, surrounded by laminin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>). In contrast, the KO mice exhibited noticeable gaps between muscle fibers in the longitudinal sections of diaphragm, with only tdT signals present within these loosely arranged fibers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>, white arrows). Furthermore, the tdT-stained areas appeared disorganized within the cross-sectional views, characterized by numerous cavities within them (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>, white arrows). The presence of similar cavities was also observed in the hindlimb sections of P1 KO mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I</xref>, white arrows). These collective observations underscore the critical role of SRSF2 in regulating both the migration and differentiation processes of MyoD-derived cells during muscle development.</p>

<title>scRNA-seq analysis reveals distinct cell populations within the diaphragm</title>
<p>To further investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying effect of SRSF2 in myogenesis, we extracted diaphragms from newborn WT and SRSF2-KO mice, prepared single-cell suspensions, and conducted scRNA-seq using the 10X Genomics Chromium system (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). After rigorous quality control (Fig. S3), we obtained a final dataset consisting of 9506 WT cells and 11384 SRSF2-KO cells for downstream analysis. The resulting t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis revealed 23 distinct cell clusters (Fig. S4). Utilizing the top 10 marker genes in each cell cluster, correlation analysis between different cell clusters (Fig. S5), and previously reported marker gene analysis, we successfully categorized the various cell types present in the diaphragm. These included fibroblasts, endothelial cells, skeletal muscle cells (SKM), mesothelial cells, immune cells, smooth muscle cells, tendon tenocytes, and glial cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>).</p>

<p>Subsequently, we employed Monocle2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Trapnell et al., 2014</xref>) to investigate the dynamic cell transitions during myogenesis. Our analysis revealed that it organized the four subclusters into two major trajectories (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Cycling MBs (sC2) were positioned at the initiation of pseudotime trajectory, committed MB (sC3) and myocytes (sC4) were situated at the terminal phase of the differentiation branch, while non-cycling SCs (sC1) were positioned on the branch associated with quiescence. Our examination of dynamic gene expression profiles along the cycling to differentiation branch or the quiescence branch revealed distinct patterns (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Differentiation-related genes such as <italic>Acta1 Ckm, Myh8, Tnnt1,</italic> and <italic>Tnnt3,</italic> were highly expressed at the end of the differentiation branch (Module1). Proliferation marker<italic>s</italic> includin<italic>g Cdc20, Cdk1, Fbxo5, Mki67,</italic> and <italic>Prc1</italic> were predominantly observed at the starting point of cycling (Module 2). QSC markers like <italic>Gpx3</italic>, <italic>Myf5</italic>, <italic>Notch3, Hes1</italic> and <italic>Pax7</italic> were enriched at the end of the quiescence branch (Module 3). Genes such as <italic>Cdkn1a, Myog, Mymx, Mymk</italic> and <italic>Rb1</italic> were highly expressed during the middle stage transitioning from cycling to the differentiation branch (Module 4). Thus, cycling MBs during perinatal myogenesis have two potential pathways: differentiation or quiescence.</p>
<p>Through the examination of separate t-SNE plots of SKM subclusters (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>) and the analysis of proportions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>), several significant observations emerged. Firstly, the proportion of non-cycling SCs (sC1) was reduced in the SRSF2-KO group, and their distribution notably deviated from that of sC1 in the WT group. Furthermore, the proportion of committed MB (sC3) decreased, while the proportion of myocytes (sC4) increased in the KO group when compared to the control. Consistently, the expression of differentiation-related genes such as <italic>Acta1</italic>, <italic>Myh8</italic> and <italic>Ckm</italic> occurred earlier expression along the differentiation branch in the KO group as apposed to the WT group (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>, left panel). In contrast, proliferation-related genes like <italic>Mki67</italic>, <italic>Cdk1</italic> and <italic>Clspn</italic> showed no expression at the end of the quiescence branch in the WT group, whereas their expression remained relatively high in the KO group (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>, right panel). These findings collectively indicate a precocious differentiation process in the absence of SRSF2.</p>

<title>Decreased ECM/cytoskeleton-related components, mitotic abnormalities, and defective differentiation were observed in the KO group</title>
<p>To further investigate the mechanisms underlying the observed precocious differentiation in KO myoblasts, we conducted an analysis of DEGs within subclusters, followed by a GO enrichment analysis. This analysis unveiled a substantial reduction in components associated with both the ECM and the cytoskeleton in the sC1, sC2 and sC3 cells of the KO group, as shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>. Notably, significant alterations were also observed in terms related to “ameboidal-type cell migration” and “negative regulation of cell cycle” within in the sC2 cells of the KO group.

<p>The ECM architecture is composed of complex supramolecular fibrillar networks that define tissue specific cellular microenvironments. Genes encoding crucial collagen proteins for ECM structural integrity, such as Col1a2, Col6a2, and Col18a1, exhibited significant downregulation in sC1, sC2 and sC3 cells within the KO group (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). Moreover, other ECM-related genes, including Dpt (dermatopontin), Hmcn2 (hemicentin-2), Loxl1 and Loxl2 (lysyl oxidase-like 1 and 2), and Tnc (tenascin-C), all contributing to ECM composition and function, displayed significant downregulation in sC1, sC2 and sC3 of the KO group (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, genes associated with “ameboidal-type cell migration” such as Acta2 (actin alpha 2), Pfn1 (profilin-1), Ran (Ras-related nuclear protein), and Thbs1 (Thrombospondin-1) showed notable decreases in expression levels in sC1, sC2, and sC3 cells of the KO group. Genes related to cytoskeleton organization, such as Tmsb4x (thymosin beta-4) and Tmsb10 (thymosin beta-10), were significantly downregulated in the KO group as well. Moreover, integrins, a family of cell adhesion receptors, mediating interactions between cells and the ECM, experienced significant downregulation in the KO group, particularly the expression of Itga7 and Itgb1, integrin subunits (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). This collective downregulation of ECM and cytoskeleton-related genes underscores the disruption in the molecular and structural interactions between myoblasts and their microenvironment in the KO group, potentially affecting cell migration, cell proliferation and differentiation.</p>
<p>Indeed, as illustrated in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>, individual genes such as Aurka (Aurora kinase A), Birc5 (Survivin), Cetn3 (Centrin-3), Poc1a (POC1 centriolar protein A), Fbxo5 (F- box only protein 5), Nuf2 (NDC80 kinetochore complex component Nuf2), Mapre1 (Microtubule-associated protein RP/EB family member1), and Ttc28 (Tetratricopeptide repeat domain 28), play vital roles in regulating microtubule dynamics, spindle assembly, centriole and spindle pole formation, and mitotic progression control. These genes displayed decreased expression in proliferating myoblasts (sC2) of the KO group, indicating a disruption in normal cell division and spindle assembly processes. Mymk (myomaker) and Mymx (myomerge) are essential for myoblast fusion, resulting in multinucleated myotube formation. Interestingly, their expression, along with Myog, was significantly downregulated in committed myoblasts (sC3) of the KO group (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). On the other hand, Tcap (telethonin), involved in the assembly and maintenance of the Z-disc in skeletal muscle, showed increased expression in myocytes (sC4) of the KO group. This suggests the defective differentiation in the absence of SRSF1.</p>

<title>SRSF2 regulates Aurka expression to control differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts</title>
<p>Previous reports have demonstrated that SRSF2 functions as a potent transcription activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cheng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ji et al., 2013</xref>).

<p>Among these genes, Aurka, pivotal in regulating cell cycle progression and microtubule dynamics, exhibited strong SRSF2 binding signals in its promoter regions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). ChIP-qPCR analysis provided additional evidence that SRSF2 directly bind to its promoter regions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Moreover, knockdown of SRSF2 had a significant impact on the reduction of Aurka protein levels in C2C12 myoblasts (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>, left panel). In contrast, when Aurka was knocked down, it did not affect the protein levels of SRSF2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>, right panel), confirming that SRSF2 acts upstream of Aurka.</p>

<p>Intriguingly, both SRSF2 and Aurka knockdowns resulted in decreased protein levels of cell-cycle- and proliferation-related genes such as Cdk1, pRb, p-pRb, p-Akt, while simultaneously increasing the expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor p27 and autophagy p62 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). Further analysis using RT-qPCR revealed that both knockdowns led to reduced levels of mitosis-related genes like Fbxo5, Nuf2, Poc1a, Ranbp1 and Spdl1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7E</xref>). Immunostaining analysis with phalloidin staining revealed both knockdowns induced significant alterations in the cytoskeleton and resulted in the formation of elongated pseudopods in the cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we aimed to investigate whether knockdown of SRSF2 and Aurka affect C2C12 cell differentiation. Following transfection of C2C12 cells with indicated siRNAs for 48 hours, cells were switched from growth medium to differentiation medium. Immunostaining with differentiation markers Myog and MHC revealed that both SRSF2 and Aurka knockdowns significantly impeded myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells. While long multinucleated myotubes were observed in control cells, only short and unaligned myotubes were present following SRSF2 or Aurka knockdowns (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7H</xref>, lanes 1-6). Given that Aurka was an important target of SRSF2, we decided to test if Aurka overexpression could rescue differentiation defects seen in SRSF2 depletion. To this end, we co-transfected C2C12 cells with siSRSF2 and an Aurka-overexpressing plasmid for 48 hours and then differentiated the cells for 3 days (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7H</xref>, lanes 7-10). Overexpression of HA-tagged Aurka significantly rescued differentiation defects induced by downregulation of SRSF2, as evidenced by increased staining for Myog and MHC observed in Aurka-overexpressing cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7I</xref>).</p>

Our extensive analysis revealed a total of 23 AS events with significant changes in the KO muscle samples.

Notably, SRSF2 deficiency resulted in specific alterations in their splicing patterns, including exon 12 skipping in Nrap, exon 5 skipping in Pdlim3, exon4 skipping of Trim54, and inclusion of exon 5 in Pdlim7(<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>). Genes associated with apoptosis and mitochondria, such as Aamdc, Dap3 and Dnm1l(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Golden et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Tong et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Xiao et al., 2015</xref>) were found to be under the splicing regulation of SRSF2. This led to exon4 skipping in Aamdc and exon 11 skipping in Dap3, while exon 17 was include in Dnm1l in the KO group (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8D</xref>). Furthermore, Ppp3ca and Ppp3cb play vital roles in calcium handling in skeletal muscle cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Brinegar et al., 2017</xref>). In the absence of SRSF2, exon 13 of Ppp3ca and both exon 10a and exon13 of Ppp3cb were skipped (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8D</xref>). These findings strongly indicated that these dysregulate AS events play a contributing role in the effects of SRSF2 during skeletal muscle development.</p>
<p>Next, we aimed to analyze whether knockdown of SRSF2 affect these AS events in C2C12 cells. As illustrated in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>, SRSF2 knockdown resulted in similar exon changes in genes such as Bin1, Ldb3, Trim54, Dap3, Dnm1l in C2C12 cells as observed in KO skeletal muscles. Given that dysregulated splicing of BIN1 is associated with muscle weakness in myotonic dystrophy (DM)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fugier et al., 2011</xref>), we directed our focus towards Bin1 variants for further analysis. As shown, BIN1 contains 20 exons, with alternative exons regulated in different tissues (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F</xref>). Notably, exon7 and exons12-16 are excluded from human skeletal muscles, while exon 11 is excluded from normal brain tissues and DM skeletal muscles. However, we did not detect any alteration in exon 11 skipping in both SRSF2-knockdown cells and SRSF2-KO skeletal muscles (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8G</xref>). Instead, our data demonstrated that SRSF2 is responsible for exon 17 inclusion in both skeletal muscles and C2C12 cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8E</xref>). To investigate whether exon17 skipping of Bin1 is involved in C2C12 differentiation, we designed siRNAs specifically targeting against Bin1 exon17. Both siBin1-#1 and siBin1-#2 significantly decreased the levels of exon17-containing variants in C2C12 cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8H</xref>). The decreased staining for Myog and MHC strongly suggested impaired C2C12 differentiation following the specific knockdown of the Bin1-exon17 variant (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8I</xref>). These findings highlighted the critical role of SRSF2-regulated exon17 inclusion of Bin1 in C2C12 cell differentiation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>During embryonic skeletal muscle development, Myf5+ progenitors play a pivotal role in expanding the myogenic progenitor pool and migrating from somites to muscle-forming regions, establishing early muscle primordia [5b]. Notably, SRSF2 emerges as a critical regulator that inhibits apoptosis in My5+progenitors and maintain their migratory capability during embryonic skeletal muscle development. The absence of SRSF2 in Myf5+ progenitors leads to a high rate of myoblasts apoptosis at embryonic day E12.5, as well as aberrant migration, ultimately resulting in the complete loss of mature myofibers.</p>
<p>MyoD+ progenitors contribute to additional migration within muscle primordia, as they move to their final destinations within developing muscle tissues. They exhibit high efficiency in differentiation into myotubes and muscle fibers. Deletion of SRSF2 in MyoD+ progenitors markedly disrupts their ability to migrate in a specific direction and subsequently impairs their differentiation process.</p>
<p>scRNA-seq analysis revealed substantial diversity within the fetal skeletal muscle cell population in the diaphragm. This diversity included non-cycling SCs, activated myoblasts, cycling myoblasts, committed myoblasts and myocytes. Our findings aligned with the observed diversity in muscle progenitors derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Nalbandian et al., 2022</xref>). Notably, the deficiency of SRSF2 resulted in an increased number of myocytes while simultaneously reducing the population of committed myoblasts. In the context of skeletal muscle differentiation, Myh8, Ckm and Acta1 are critical for the formation of muscle fibers(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Nowak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Schiaffino et al., 2015</xref>). Both Myomaker and Myomerger proteins directly control the myogenic fusion process(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). However, the expression of Myh8, Ckm and Acta1 was significantly advanced at earlier stage in the differentiation process, while there was a concurrent downregulation of MyoK and Myox in the absence of SRSF2. This suggests that enhanced differentiation was defective in the KO group.</p>
<p>scRNA-seq analysis further revealed significant effects of SRSF2 on the downregulation of ECM components, genes associated with ameboid-type cell migration, and cytoskeleton organization. The reduction of both ECM and cytoskeleton components has a significant impact on myoblast migration, cell division and differentiation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Osses <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Notably, one of the targets regulated by SRSF2 is Aurka, a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in regulating cell division processes via regulation of mitosis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Du et al., 2021</xref>). The chromosome passenger complex, which includes Aurka, inhibits the shrinkage of microtubules, thereby promoting cell growth(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Namgoong and Kim, 2018</xref>). Our data revealed that knockdown of Aurka led to reduced cell proliferation, disrupted cytoskeleton, and impaired differentiation, which mirrored the effects observed with SRSF2 knockdown. Importantly, overexpression of HA-Aurka in SRSF2-knockdown cells substantially rescued the differentiation defects observed following SRSF2 knockdown. These findings provided evidence that SRSF2- regulated Aurka expression is critical for differentiation of C2C12 cells.</p>
<p>In addition to its role in transcription regulation, SRSF2 also has a significant impact on the alternative splicing regulation of genes related to human skeletal muscle diseases. Dysregulated alternative splicing of BIN1 has been linked to T-tubule alterations and muscle weakness in myotonic dystrophy(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fugier <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). BIN1 is involved in forming tubular of membrane invaginations and is critical for the development of muscle T-tubules, specialized membrane structures essential for excitation-contraction coupling. Mutations in the BIN1 gene can lead to centronuclear myopathy, a condition that shares some histopathological features with myotonic dystrophy. MBNL1 binds the BIN1 pre-mRNA and regulates its alternative splicing. Skipping of exon11 in BIN1 results in the expression of an inactive form of BIN1 lacking phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate-binding and membrane-tubulating activities. Notably, the deletion of SRSF2 resulted in centronuclear features in skeletal muscle, and induced exon17 skipping in Bin1, which resides within the Myc-binding domain of Bin1 protein. Targeted knockdown of the Bin1 exon17-containing variant significantly disrupted C2C12 cell differentiation. Further investigation is imperative to comprehend the involvement of SRSF2 and its regulation of exon17 inclusion in BIN1 in human skeletal muscle diseases.</p>
<p>In summary, our research provides valuable insights into the role of SRSF2 in governing MyoD progenitors to specific muscle regions, thereby controlling myogenic differentiation through the regulation of targeted gens and alternative splicing during skeletal muscle development.</p>

<title>HE staining and Immunofluorescence staining</title>
<p>Mouse skeletal muscle tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin or OCT. 7μm-thick sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin following standard protocols. For immunofluorescence on the paraffin-embedded tissues, 7μm-thick sections were deparaffinized in xylol for 30 minutes and rehydrated in a gradient of ethanol (100%, 95%, 75%, 50%) for 15 minutes, followed by antigen retrieval. The sections were then blocked with 5% normal goat serum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1hour and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4℃. Subsequently, the secondary antibody was applied for 1 hour, and DAPI staining was performed for 10 minutes. For immunofluorescence on the OCT-embedded tissues, 5μm-thick sections were washed in PBS for 15 minutes to remove the OCT, and then the sections were blocked and stained similarly to the paraffin sections.

<title>Transmission electron microscopy</title>
<p>Diaphragms from P1 WT and SRSF2-KO mice were fixed overnight at 4°C in a 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution, followed by four 15-minute PBS washes. Subsequently, they underwent dehydration in an ascending ethanol series (50%, 70%, 80%, and 90%) for 15 minutes each, with two rounds of 100% ethanol dehydration for 20 minutes each. The diaphragms were cleared twice with acetone for 15 minutes each and underwent a series of infiltrations. First, they were in an acetone:embedding medium (2:1 v/v) solution for 1 hour, followed by a solution of acetone:embedding medium (1:2 v/v) for 4 hours. Afterward, they were infiltrated twice with pure embedding medium for 20-24 hours each. After infiltration, the diaphragms were placed into a mold filled with pure embedding medium and polymerized at 65°C for over 48 hours. The embedded block was trimmed into a trapezoid shape to ensure a sample surface area less than 0.2mm x 0.2mm. Ultrathin sections with 70nm in thickness were cut and stained with uranyl acetate for 10 minutes, followed by lead citrate for another 10 minutes, with washing steps in between.

<title>scRNA-seq Data Preprocessing</title>
<p>The Cell Ranger software pipeline (10X Genomics, version5.0.0) was utilized to assess data quality statistics on the raw data and map reads to the reference genome, resulting in a matrix of gene counts versus cells. Cells of low quality, such as double capture cells, multiple capture cells, or cells with more than 10% of counts from mitochondrial genes, were filtered out based on the nUMI, nGene, and percent.mito criteria using the R package Seurat (version 3.1.1). After applying these quality control measures, a total of 12,592 cells from the WT group and 14,875 cells from the SRSF2-KO group were available for further analysis. The library size was normalized using the NormalizeData function in Seurat, and dimensionality reduction was performed using the RunPCA function. Cell clusters were identified using the FindCluster in Seurat, and visualized using a 2-dimensional t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) algorithm with the RunSNE function. Marker genes for each cluster were identified using the</p>

<title>Cell culture, Differentiation, Transfection, and Immunostaining</title>
<p>C2C12 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfection of C2C12 cells were performed using siRNA or plasmids. The Aurka overexpression plasmid was constructed using the longest NM isoform and inserted into the pCDNA3.0-HA plasmid vector. Myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells was activated by replacing the growth medium with a differentiation medium (DMEM supplemented with 2% horse serum). The transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX or Lipofectamine 200, both from Invitrogen, following the manufacturer’s protocol. After 48 hours of transfection, or induction into differentiation for 3 days, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes.

<p>Summary</p>
<p>The work by She et al. investigates the role of SRFS2 in the MyoD+ progenitor cells during development. Deletion of SRFS2 in MyoD+ progenitor cells resulted in a defect in the directional migration of these cells and resulted in the presence of myoD+ progenitor in both nonmuscle and muscle tissues. The authors showed a defect in gene program regulation ECM, cell migration, cytoskeletal organization, and skeletal muscle differentiation by scRNA-seq. The authors further showed that many of these processes are regulated by a downstream target of SRFS2, the serine-threonine kinase Aurka. Finally, the authors showed that SRFS2 acts as a splicing factor and could contribute to differentiation by controlling the splicing of muscle-specific transcripts. This study addresses an important question in skeletal muscle development by focusing on the pathways and factors that regulate the migration of myoD+ progenitors and the impact of this process in skeletal muscle differentiation. This work is interesting but requires experimental evidence to support the findings.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>The regulators of myod+progenitor migration during skeletal muscle development is not completely understood. This work demonstrates that SRFS2 and aura kinase are key players in the process. Combining knockout and reporter lines in mice, the authors perform a detailed analysis of skeletal muscle cells to demonstrate the specific defects in SRFS2 in skeletal muscle development.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>This work explores an interesting question on regulating myoD+ progenitors and the defects of this process in skeletal muscle differentiation by SRFS2 but spreads out in many directions rather than focusing on the key defects. A number of approaches are used, but they lack the robust mechanistic analysis of the defects that result in muscle differentiation. Specifically, the role of SRFS2 on splicing appears to be a misfit here and does not explain the primary defects in the migration of myoD+ progenitors. There are concerns about the scRNA-seq and many transcripts in muscle biology that are not expressed in muscle cells. Focusing on main defects and additional experimental evidence to clear the fusion vs. precocious differentiation vs. reduced differentiation will strengthen this work.</p>
<p>(1) The analysis of RNA-seq data (Figure 2) is limited, and it is unclear how it relates to the work presented in this MS. The Go enrichment analysis is combined for both up and down-regulated DEG, thus making it difficult to understand the impact differently in both directions. Stac2 is a predominant neuronal isoform (while Stac3 is the muscle), and the Symm gene is not found in the HGNC or other databases. Could the authors provide the approved name for this gene? The premise of this work is based on defects in ECM processes resulting in the mis-targeting of the muscle progenitors to the nonmuscle regions. Which ECM proteins are differentially expressed?</p>
<p>(2) Could authors quantify the muscle progenitors dispersed in nonmuscle regions before their differentiation? Which nonmuscle tissues MyoD+ progenitors are seen? Most of the tDT staining in the enlarged sections appears to be punctate without any nuclear staining seen in these cells (Figure 3 B, D E-F). Could authors provide high-resolution images? Also, in the diaphragm cross-sections in mutants, tdT labeling appears to be missing in some areas within the myofibers defined as cavities by the authors (marked by white arrows, Figure 3H). Could this polarized localization of tDT be contributing to specific defects?</p>
<p>(3) Is there a difference in the levels of tDT in the myoD&quot; muscle progenitors that are mis-targeted vs the others that are present in the muscle tissues?</p>
<p>(4) scRNA is unsuitable for myotubes and myofibers due to their size exclusion from microfluidics. Could authors explain the basis for scRNA-seq vs SnRNA-seq in this work? How are SKM defined in scRNA-data in Figure 4? As the myofibers are small in KO, could the increased level of late differentiation markers be due to the enrichment of these small myotubes/myofibers in scRNA? A different approach, such as ISH/IF with the myogenic markers at E9.5-10.5, may be able to resolve if these markers are prematurely induced.</p>
<p>(5) TNC is a marker for tenocytes and is absent in skeletal muscle cells. The authors mentioned a downregulation of TNC in the KO SKM derived clusters. This suggests a contamination of the tenocytes in the control cells. In spite of the downregulation of multiple ECM genes showed by scRNA-seq data, the ECM staining by laminin in KO in Figure 3 appears to be similar to controls.</p>
<p>(6) The expression of many fusion genes, such as myomaker and myomerger, is reduced in KO, suggesting a primary fusion defect vs a primary differentiation defect. Many mature myofiber proteins exhibit an increased expression in disease states, suggesting them as a compensatory mechanism. Authors need to provide additional experimental evidence supporting precocious differentiation as the primary defect.</p>
<p>(7) The fusion defects in KO are also evident in siRNA knockdown for SRSF2 and Aurka in C2C12, which mostly exhibits mononucleated myocytes in knockdowns. Also, a fusion index needs to be provided.</p>
<p>(8) The last section of the role of SRSF2 on splicing appears to be a misfit in this study. Authors describe the Bin1 isoforms in centronuclear myopathy, but exon17 is not involved in myopathy. Is exon17 exclusion seen in other diseases/ splicing studies?</p>

<p>
This study provides novel findings that SRSF2 controls the myogenic differentiation of MyoD+ progenitors, using transgenic mouse model and in vitro studies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although unbiased sequencing methods were used, their findings about SRSF2 served as a transcriptional regulator and functioned in alternative splicing events are not novel.</p>
<p>
The introductions and discussion is not clearly written. The authors did not raise clear scientific questions in the introduction part. The last paragraph is only copy-paste of the abstract. The discussion part is mainly the repeat of their results without clear discussion.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>The GO enrichment analysis (Figure 2B) indicates that genes involved in skeletal muscle construction and function were significantly dysregulated, with both up-regulated and down-regulated genes observed, consistent with the phenotype analysis presented in Figure 1.</p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer’s comments that Stac3 is the predominant muscle isoform with high expression in skeletal muscle tissues, while stac2 is expressed at low levels in these tissues. Therefore, we decided to delete the Stac2 data from the Figure 2C and will modify the text accordingly. We apologize for our errors.</p>
<p>In response to the reviewer's comment regarding the Symm gene not being found in the HGNC or other databases, we carefully re-examined the genes presented in Figure 2C. We discovered that one of the genes is actually Synm, which encodes synemin, an intermediate filament protein. We will correct this in the manuscript.</p>
<p>scRNA-seq analysis revealed defects in ECM processes in SRSF2-deficient myoblasts, which we believe likely resulted in the mis-targeting of muscle progenitors to non-muscle regions. However, comparing RNA-seq results from whole muscle tissues with scRNA-seq results is challenging.</p>

<p>tdT staining revealed a substantial presence of MyoD-derived cells distributed beyond the muscle regions, as shown in Figure 3B. Quantify the number of MyoD+ progenitors dispersed in non-muscle regions is not meaningful.</p>
<p>tdT+ cells also include those that previously expressed MyoD but have since differentiated into myotubes and myofibers, which is why many tdT+ staining is not nuclear.</p>
<p>MyoD+ cells deficient in SRSF2 either undergo apoptosis or premature differentiation. Consequently, tdT staining in SRSF2-KO muscles showed many irregularities in the muscle fibers.</p>

<p>tdT+ cells include those that previously expressed MyoD but have since differentiated into myotubes and myofibers, which are no longer MyoD+ cells. Additionally, tdT+ also include those currently expressing MyoD, which are MyoD+ cells.</p>
<p>The fiber differences between WT and SRSF2-KO mice are easily discernible through tdT staining (Figure 2D and 3D), however, comparing the levels of tdT staining between the two groups is not meaningful.</p>

<p>SRSF2 is highly expressed in proliferative myoblasts, but its levels declined once differentiation begins. In our study, we used Myod1-Cre to delete the SRSF2 gene and performed the scRNA-seq analysis to examine the effects of SRSF2 deletion on the proliferation and differentiation of MyoD cells. Our analysis revealed that SRSF2 deletion caused proliferation defects and premature differentiation of MyoD cells (Figure 5G), leading to myofiber abnormalities.</p>
<p>We determined that snRNA-seq analysis is not suitable for our study.</p>
<p>Additionally, skeletal muscle cells (SKM) were defined based on the expression of skeletal muscle markers, as shown in Figure 4C.</p>

<p>Tenascin-C (Tnc) is also part of the extracellular matrix (ECM) family. scRNA-seq analysis revealed that multiple ECM genes were downregulated in SRSF2-KO myoblasts, however, this did not indicate that laminin was downregulated in the SRSF2-KO muscles.</p>

<p>Our analysis revealed that the deletion of SRSF2 caused premature differentiation of MyoD cells (Figure 5G), leading to abnormalities of myofiber formation. SRSF2 is highly expressed in proliferative myoblasts, but its expression declines quickly in myotubes.

<p>SRSF2 knockdown and Aurka knockdown caused differentiation defects, including fusion defects. We quantified the percentages of both MyoG+ and MHC+ cells in the differentiation assay.</p>

<p>Our study is the first to report that exon 17 inclusion of Bin1 is regulated by SRSF2. Specifically, the knockdown of Bin1 exon 17 caused severe differentiation defects in C2C12 myoblasts. The involvement of Bin1 exon 17 in myopathy requires further validation using clinical samples.</p>

<p>While the role of SRSF2 as a transcriptional regulator involved in alternative splicing events is not novel, the specific SRSF2-regulated alternative splicing events and targeted genes in skeletal muscle have not been reported in other publications. We believe our interpretation of the data and comparison with related published studies are well presented in the Discussion section.</p>
