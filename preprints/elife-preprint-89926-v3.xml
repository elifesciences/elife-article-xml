<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>In a developing nervous system, axonal arbors often undergo complex rearrangements before neural circuits attain their final innervation topology. In the lateral line sensory system of the zebrafish, developing sensory axons reorganize their terminal arborization patterns to establish precise neural microcircuits around the mechanosensory hair cells. However, a quantitative understanding of the changes in the sensory arbor morphology and the regulators behind the microcircuit assembly remain enigmatic. Here, we report that Semaphorin7A (Sema7A) acts as an important mediator of these processes. Utilizing a semi-automated three-dimensional neurite tracing methodology and computational techniques, we have identified and quantitatively analyzed distinct topological features that shape the network in wild-type and Sema7A loss-of-function mutants. In contrast to those of wild-type animals, the sensory axons in Sema7A mutants display aberrant arborizations with disorganized network topology and diminished contacts to hair cells. Moreover, ectopic expression of a secreted form of Sema7A by non-hair cells induces chemotropic guidance of sensory axons. Our findings propose that Sema7A likely functions both as a juxtracrine and as a secreted cue to pattern neural circuitry during sensory organ development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pathfinding axons are directed to their appropriate synaptic targets by a variety of guidance cues. While approaching or traversing the target field, the growth cones of migrating axons encounter secreted or cell surface-attached ligands and respond by steering toward or away from their sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Fine-grained control of these factors is critical for the establishment of proper neural circuitry.</p>
<p>The zebrafish’s lateral line provides a tractable <italic>in vivo</italic> system for exploring the mechanisms that guide the assembly of neural circuits in a peripheral nervous system. In particular, it is possible to detect individual hair cells and the sensory axons that innervate them throughout the first week of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). The primary posterior lateral line on each side of the zebrafish’s tail consists of about seven neuromasts, which contain mechanoreceptive hair cells of opposing polarities—half sensitive to headward (rostrad) water motion and the complementary half to tailward (caudad) water motion—that cluster at their centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). The sensory axons of the lateral-line nerve branch, arborize, and consolidate around the basolateral surfaces of the hair cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). To aid in an animal’s swimming behavior, these hair cells sense water currents and relay signals to the brain through the sensory axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). The well-defined structure of the ramifications and synaptic contacts of the sensory axons highlight the need to determine the molecular signals behind the assembly of such precise microcircuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) A volumetric rendering of a PLL neuromast depicts the sensory axons (magenta) that branch from the lateral line nerve to arborize around the basolateral surface of the hair cell cluster (green). Additional cell types in the neuromast are not labeled. Larval age, 3 dpf. A=anterior, P=posterior, D=dorsal, V=ventral. (B) A schematic drawing of the two variants of the Sema7A protein molecule depicts the full-length GPI-anchored form and the smaller, potentially secreted form. Both the molecules include a signal sequence (green) and a conserved sema domain (orange). (C) <italic>Tg(myo6b:actb1-EGFP)</italic> larvae at 4 dpf were terminally anesthetized and their heads were removed with fine blades. The tails were then dissociated into the component cells, which were sorted by flow cytometry. Green cells represent GFP<sup>+</sup> hair cells. A cDNA library was prepared from the isolated RNA. (D) Gel-based RT-PCR analysis indicates the presence of both the <italic>sema7a</italic> transcript variants and the expression of hair cell-specific genes, parvalbumin 8 (<italic>pvalb8</italic>) and S100 calcium binding protein T (<italic>s100t</italic>). (E) A surface micrograph of a neuromast at 3 dpf depicts two pairs of mature hair cells (green dashed lines) and a pair of immature hair cells (grey dashed lines). Inset: among the three pairs of hair cell apices, the immature pair is indicated by arrowheads. Immunolabeling reveals that the Sema7A protein (orange) occurs consistently at the subapical region (arrowheads) and at the basolateral surface (arrows) of a hair cell. In this and in each of the subsequent neuromast images, anterior is to the left and dorsal to the top. (F) A plot quantifies developmental changes in the average Sema7A intensity in both rostrally and caudally polarized hair cells of neuromasts from 1.5 dpf to 4 dpf. The data stem from 18, 36, 39, and 40 hair cells in neuromasts of respectively 1.5 dpf, 2 dpf, 3 dpf, and 4 dpf larvae. (G) A plot quantifies the distribution of average Sema7A intensity along the hair cell’s apicobasal axis. The results stem from 52, 57, and 54 hair cells of neuromasts from 2 dpf, 3 dpf, and 4 dpf larvae. (H) An immunofluorescence image at the nuclear level of a 4 dpf neuromast shows the contact of the sensory arbors (magenta) with the basolateral surface of the hair cells (green). Immunolabeling for Sema7A (orange) reveals enrichment of the protein at the hair cell bases and sensory-axon interfaces (arrowheads). (I) At the base of the hair cell, association of the td-Tomato<sup>+</sup> sensory arbors positively correlated with the Sema7A intensity. The results stemmed from 48 hair cells of 13 neuromasts from 3 dpf larvae.

<p>We adopted a candidate-gene strategy to seek factors that direct the growth of afferent growth cones in the zebrafish’s lateral line. Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data identified the <italic>semaphorin7a</italic> (<italic>sema7a</italic>) gene to be highly expressed in hair cells of that organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Semaphorins are important regulators of axonal growth and target finding during the patterning of diverse neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). The semaphorin family includes proteins that are secreted, transmembrane, and cell surface-attached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Among these, Semaphorin7A (Sema7A) is the only molecule that is anchored to the outer leaflet of the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Unlike many other semaphorins, which act as repulsive cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), Sema7A is involved in promoting axon growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) and imparting directional signals by interacting with the integrin and plexin families of receptors residing on the pathfinding axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Sema7A likely occurs <italic>in vivo</italic> in both GPI-anchored and soluble forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), and studies of neuronal explants confirm that both forms can induce directed axonal outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Furthermore, it has been proposed that the GPI anchor is cleaved by membrane-resident GPI-specific phospholipases (GPI-PLs) or matrix metalloproteases to release the Sema7A into the extracellular environment and thus regulate dynamic cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Because these observations indicate that Sema7A might influence neuronal development both as a juxtracrine and as a diffusive signal, we investigated the role of Sema7A in sculpting a vertebrate peripheral sensory organ.</p>

<title>Sema7A expression and localization in hair cells</title>
<p>The zebrafish genome contains a single <italic>sema7a</italic> gene that produces two transcripts. One transcript encodes Sema7A-GPI, a full-length, GPI-linked, cell surface-attached protein. The second transcript yields Sema7A<sup>sec</sup>, a protein with a truncated C-terminus, which we conjecture is secreted into the local environment. Each transcript encodes an N-terminal signal sequence and a single copy of the conserved Sema domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). To detect the presence of both <italic>sema7a</italic> transcripts in the hair cells of the lateral-line neuromasts, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to capture the labeled hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) and isolated total RNA. Using primers that flank the regions encoding the conserved Sema domain and the distinct C-termini of the two transcripts, we performed reverse transcription and polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) to identify both the membrane-anchored and the secreted transcript in developing larvae (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-D</xref>; <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-D</xref>). Single-cell RNA sequencing data also have shown that the GPI-linked <italic>sema7a</italic> transcript is particularly enriched in the immature and mature hair cells of the neuromast during early larval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), a period when sensory axons of the posterior lateral line contact hair cells and form synapses with them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Indeed, we have observed Sema7A to be specifically localized in both mature and immature hair cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A-D</xref>).</p>
<p>As neuromasts mature, the contacts between sensory axons and hair cells increase in number, become stabilized, and establish synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Because Sema7A can modulate axon guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>) and synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), we wondered whether the level of Sema7A also changes during neuromast development. Upon quantifying the average intensity of Sema7A, we found similar expression in rostrally and caudally polarized hair cells of neuromasts at 1.5, 2, 3, and 4 days post fertilization (dpf). The average Sema7A intensity increased significantly over this period in both rostrally and caudally polarized hair cells. At 1.5 dpf, the neuromasts harbor primarily immature hair cells that make minimal contacts with sensory axons and do not form stable association with axonal terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). At this stage the average Sema7A intensity in hair cells remained low. By 2-4 dpf the hair cells mature to form stable contacts and well-defined synapses with the sensory axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). The average Sema7A intensity in hair cells at each of these stages rose to levels that significantly exceeded those of 1.5 dpf neuromasts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). This rise in the amount of Sema7A during neuromast maturation supports a role for Sema7A in the guidance of sensory axons and their interaction with hair cells.</p>
<p>We additionally demonstrated an anisotropic distribution of Sema7A along the apicobasal axis of each hair cell. As neuromasts develop through 2, 3, and 4 dpf, Sema7A remained highly enriched in the subapical region of the hair cell, the site of the Golgi network (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). This localization suggests that Sema7A—like other proteins of the semaphorin family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>)—is directed to the plasmalemma through Golgi-mediated vesicular trafficking. Using the transgenic line <italic>Tg(cldnb:LY-mScarlet)</italic> that expresses membrane-tethered mScarlet in all cells of the neuromast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), we detected Sema7A at the plasma membrane and potentially in vesicles (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F-I</xref>). While Sema7A maintained a high level in the subapical region, the protein increasingly accumulated at the base of the hair cell: the Sema7A level at the hair cell base was low at 2 dpf, but increased sharply by 3 dpf and 4 dpf (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>; <xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2J</xref>). During this period the hair cells increase in number and mature, whereas the associated sensory axons arborize to contact multiple hair cells and form robust synaptic boutons at their bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Does progressive basal accumulation of Sema7A facilitate association of sensory axon terminals to the hair cell? To address this question, we utilized doubly labeled transgenic fish <italic>Tg(myo6b:actb1-EGFP;neurod1:tdTomato)</italic> that marked the hair cells and the sensory axons of the posterior lateral line with distinct fluorophores (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). We quantified the average Sema7A intensity and the accumulation of sensory arbors, measured by td-Tomato intensity, at the bases of the hair cells. Across developmental stages, the basal association of the sensory arbors showed a positive correlation with Sema7A accumulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H,I</xref>; <xref rid="fig1s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A-E</xref>, Video 1). The progressive enrichment of Sema7A at the hair cell base with the sensory axons suggests that Sema7A acts as a mediator of contacts between sensory axons and hair cells.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Sema7A restricts sensory axons around clustered hair cells</title>
<p>If Sema7A guides and restricts the sensory arbors at and around the hair cells clustered in a neuromast, then inactivating Sema7A function should disrupt this process. To test this hypothesis, we obtained a <italic>sema7a</italic> mutant allele (<italic>sema7a<sup>sa24691</sup></italic>) with a point mutation that introduces a premature stop codon in the conserved sema domain (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The homozygous mutant, hereafter designated <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, should lack both the secreted and the membrane-attached forms of Sema7A. The average intensity of Sema7A immunolabeling in hair cells diminished by 61% in <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic>larvae (0.34 ± 0.01 arbitrary units) in comparison to controls (0.87 ± 0.01 arbitrary units). In a few cases we observed minute accumulations of Sema7A at the subapical region, but little or no protein at the base of the mutant hair cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-E</xref>). We quantified the number of hair cells in the neuromasts of the control and the <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> larvae.

The average intensities of FM 4-64 labeling between the genotypes did not show a significant difference, which suggests that the mutation does not impact essential hair cell functions (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>; Videos 2,3).</p>

<p>To characterize the impact of the <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutation on arbor patterning, we utilized doubly labeled transgenic fish <italic>Tg(myo6b:actb1-EGFP;neurod1:tdTomato)</italic> that distinctly labeled the hair cells and the sensory arbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). In control neuromasts, the sensory axons approached, arborized, and consolidated around the bases of clustered hair cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Although the sensory axons approached the hair cells of <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neuromasts, they displayed aberrant arborization patterns with wayward projections that extended transversely to the organ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). To quantitatively analyze the arborization morphology, we traced the sensory arbors in three dimensions to generate skeletonized network traces that depict–as pseudocolored trajectories–the increase in arbor length from the point of arborization (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H, I</xref>).</p>
<p>To visualize the hair cell clusters and associated arborization networks from multiple neuromasts, we aligned images of hair cell clusters, registered them at their hair bundles, from neuromasts at 2 dpf, 3 dpf, and 4 dpf (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>). Throughout development, the arborization networks of control neuromasts largely remained within the contours of the hair cell clusters; the few that reached farther nonetheless lingered nearby (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>; <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G,I</xref>). This result suggests that an attractive cue retained the axons near the sensory organ. In <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic>neuromasts, however the neuronal arbors failed to consolidate within the boundaries of hair cell clusters and extended far beyond them (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref>; <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H,J</xref>; Video 4).</p>
<p>We quantified the distribution of the sensory arbors around the center of the combined hair cell clusters. For both the control and the <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neuromasts, the arbor densities peaked proximal to the boundaries of the hair cell clusters. Beyond the cluster boundaries, in control neuromasts at 2 dpf, 3 dpf, and 4 dpf the arbor densities fell sharply at respectively 31.7 µm, 36.6 µm, and 32.7 µm from the center. In <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neuromasts of the same ages, the sensory arbors extended respectively 38.5 µm, 51.4 µm, and 56.6 µm from the center (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2L</xref>; <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1K,L</xref>; <xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Furthermore, we quantified the degree of contact of the sensory arbors to their hair cell clusters in individual neuromasts from both control and <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mutants. In control neuromasts, the degree of contact was 83 ± 1 % (mean ± SEM) at 2 dpf and 84 ± 1 % at 3 dpf, but significantly increased to 90 ± 1 % at 4 dpf (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2M</xref>; <xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This observation indicates that the sensory arbors reinforce their association to the hair cell clusters as neuromasts develop. However, in <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neuromasts such contact was significantly reduced. Only 69 ± 4 % of sensory arbors at 2 dpf were closely associated with the corresponding hair cell clusters, a value that remained at 67 ± 2 % at both 3 dpf and 4 dpf (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2M</xref>). These findings signify that, with simultaneous disruption of both signaling modalities of Sema7A, the organ fails to restrict the localization of sensory arbors and has significantly diminished contact with them.</p>

<title>Sema7A patterns the arborization network’s topology</title>
<p>Accurate spatial arrangement of the neuronal projections around hair cells is essential for proper retrieval and transmission of sensory information. Mutations that perturb proper assembly of sensory neuronal microcircuits lead to hearing impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Quantitative insight into the wiring pattern is therefore essential to identify systematic aberrations in the microcircuit arising from genetic deficits. The three-dimensional skeletonized network traces allowed us to accurately delineate the microcircuit topology across individuals, developmental stages, and genotypes from living animals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D, E</xref>). To quantitatively analyze the arbor network, we defined five topological attributes: (1) nodes, denoted as junctions where arbors branch, converge, or cross; (2) loops, comprising minimal arbor cycles forming topological holes; (3) bare terminals, defined as arbors with free ends; (4) the node degree, calculated as the number of first-neighbor nodes incident to a node; and (5) the arbor curvature, measured as the total curvature of a bare terminal (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). We quantified these attributes to accurately determine how the circuit topology is established during maturation of the sensory organ in control larvae and how it is impacted by <italic>sema7a</italic> deficit.</p>

<p>To determine how internode connectivity is distributed across networks, we quantified the distribution of node degrees along the relative height of the hair cell cluster across individuals, developmental stages, and genotypes. As for most other real-world networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>), we observed a highly skewed node-degree distribution: the majority of nodes had low node degrees (three and four) and a small number of nodes—often acting as hubs, like the arborization initiation point—had high node degrees (five to seven). The node degree varied from three to seven in control larvae and three to six in <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> larvae. Across developmental stages and genotypes, the high node degrees primarily occurred at the base (region from 0 % to 10 % of the cluster height) of the hair cell cluster and acted as hubs for the majority of branching events. Low node degrees primarily occurred along the basolateral region (region from 10 % to 60 % of the cluster height) of the hair cell cluster. The apical region (region from 60 % to 100 % of the cluster height) was sparsely populated with low node degrees. The network’s hierarchical organization along the organ’s axis suggests that arbors receive sensory inputs at multiple levels, allowing the network to carry out robust neural computations. Even though nodes of low degree were most prevalent between genotypes across developmental stages, their distribution along the relative organ axis became significantly different at 4 dpf, with nodes in control larvae localized higher along the axis than in <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> larvae (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These observations indicate that Sema7A regulates both the spatial organization and node-degree complexity of the sensory arbor network.</p>
<p>An average of 9.3 sensory axonal branches approach the hair cell cluster of a neuromast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Pathfinding of sensory axons around the hair cell cluster results in the formation of axonal fascicles that form numerous loops and bare terminals, which determine the microcircuit topology (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B, D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). To optimally surround and contact the hair cell cluster, do the sensory arbors prefer to adopt one topological feature over the other? To address this question, we measured the correlation between the number of bare terminals and the number of loops across individuals, developmental stages, and genotypes. In both 2 dpf and 3 dpf larvae, the distributions remained highly scattered across individuals and genotypes. However, by 4 dpf in the control larvae the arbor network contained either a high number of loops with a low number of bare terminals or a high number of bare terminals with a low number of loops. This result suggests that the stereotypical circuit topology observed in the mature organ may emerge through transition of individual arbors from forming bare terminals to forming closed loops encircling topological holes. That we did not observe a similar transition in <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neuromasts of the same age suggests that Sema7A may direct the switch between these two distinct topological features (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Measurement of the contour length of both bare terminals and loops additionally revealed that across developmental stages in control larvae the sensory arbors followed a three-step process to choose the appropriate topological feature: arbors shorter than 10 µm always formed bare terminals; arbors between 10 µm and 30 µm began to switch between features, with arbors longer than 20 µm strongly preferring to form loops; and arbors longer than 30 µm always formed loops. These results imply that the switch between bare terminals and loops is partly dependent on the length of the arbors. However, this characteristic topological preference was significantly perturbed in the <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic>larvae across developmental stages, as many of the sensory arbors longer than 30 µm remained as bare terminals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, in 4 dpf control neuromasts the majority of the loops contained four nodes and utilized 30-40 µm of arbors to form closed cycles. These conserved topological attributes were significantly perturbed in the <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic>larvae of same age (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D, E</xref>; <xref rid="fig3s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A-D</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These findings indicate that Sema7A tightly monitors the sensory arbor loop formation, including the preferred loop length and number of nodes per loop, to properly surround and contact the hair cell cluster.</p>
<p>As observed previously, bare terminals in control neuromasts project transverse to the organ and linger nearby, often curving back to form new loops and contact the hair cell cluster (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D,F</xref>). To analyze the propensity of the bare terminals to curl backward, we measured their total curvatures, defined as the sum of the curvature at each point along the length of an arbor. Henceforth, we address the total curvature as the curvature of a bare terminal. We classified the bare terminals in two categories: high-curvature arbors with curled morphology and curvature greater than <italic>π</italic>/6 (30 degrees); and low-curvature arbors with linear morphology and curvature less than <italic>π</italic> /6. In control neuromasts 44.8 % of arbors had low curvature compared to 56.4 % in <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neuromasts at 4 dpf. Concomitantly, 55.2 % of arbors had high curvature in control neuromasts compared to 43.6 % in <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic>neuromasts at 4 dpf (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>; <xref rid="fig3s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E, F</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These observations further confirm our hypothesis that a Sema7A-mediated attractive cue is involved in orienting bare neural arbors toward the hair cell cluster to potentially form loops.</p>
<p>In summary, we propose that Sema7A mediates four key aspects of the topology of the arborization network: (1) the node degree complexity along the organ’s axis; (2) the transition of arbors from bare terminals to loops; (3) the preference for forming loops containing four nodes with 30-40 µm of arbors; and (4) the preference of bare terminals to adopt higher curvature.</p>

<title>Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> is a sufficient chemoattractive cue for sensory axon guidance</title>
<p>Because genetic inactivation of the <italic>sema7a</italic> gene disrupts both signaling modalities of the cognate protein, we could not assess the specific activity of the Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> diffusive cue in guiding lateral-line sensory axons. To independently verify the potential role of that isoform, we therefore expressed the secreted variant ectopically and investigated the resultant arborization patterns.</p>
<p>Analysis of the microcircuit connectivity of the neuromasts has demonstrated bare sensory-axonal terminals in the perisynaptic compartments, where they do not contact the hair cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). We speculate that these bare terminals are attracted by a Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> diffusive cue. To test this hypothesis, we ectopically expressed Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> protein tagged with the fluorophore mKate2, then analyzed its effect on the morphology of sensory arbors. Fertilized one-cell embryos were injected with the <italic>hsp70:sema7a<sup>sec</sup>-mKate2</italic> plasmid and raised to 3 dpf. Larvae expressing the transgenesis marker—the lens-specific red fluorescent protein mCherry—were heat-shocked, incubated to allow expression, and subsequently mounted for live imaging. In these larvae, a random mosaic of cells—often embryonic muscle progenitors in the dermomyotome or mature myofibers—expressed the exogenous Sema7A<sup>sec</sup>-mKate2 protein. We selected only those neuromasts in which a single mosaic ectopic integration had occurred near the network of sensory arbors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A,B</xref>). In all 22 such cases, we observed robust axonal projections from the sensory arbor network toward the ectopically expressing Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> cells. When the exogenous <italic>sema7a<sup>sec</sup></italic> integration occurred in embryonic muscle progenitor cells, which reside in a superficial layer external to the muscle fibers and adjacent to the larval skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>), the projections were able to form direct contacts with them (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>; Videos 5,6). But more often, when mature myofibers expressed the exogenous Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> deep in the myotome, the axonal projections approached those targets but failed to contact them (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, Videos 7,8). This behavior likely arose because other components in the myotomal niche—including the fibrous epimysium, other myofibers, myoblasts, and immature myotubes whose surroundings are permeable to diverse diffusive cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>)—physically obstructed direct interaction of the extended neurites with the ectopically expressing myofibers. All 18 of the injected but not heat-shocked control larvae did not express ectopic Sema7A<sup>sec</sup>, and we did not observe aberrant projections from the sensory arbor network (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>).</p>

<p>To measure the accuracy of the extended axonal projections in finding the ectopic Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> source, we defined three parameters: (1) the source path, denoted as the linear distance from the point of arborization to the boundary of an ectopically expressing Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> cell; (2) the projection path, representing the linear distance from the point of arborization to the terminus of the extended projection; and (3) the projection proximity, calculated as the linear distance from the terminus of the extended axonal projection to the nearest boundary of the ectopically expressing Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> cell (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). We quantified these parameters from 18 of the 22 mosaic integration events; in the remainder the extended axonal projections– although following the ectopic source–reentered the posterior lateral-line nerve so that identification of the axon terminals was not possible (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-A&quot;</xref>; Video 9). The projection paths of the extended axons reached from 27.1 µm to 142.5 µm while following the ectopic Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> cues. When we plotted the projection path length against the source-path length, we observed a nearly perfect correlation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). This result signifies that irrespective of the location of the ectopic source–whether proximal or distal to the sensory arbor network–the Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> cue sufficed to attract axonal terminals from the sensory arbor. Furthermore, the low average projection-proximity length of 3.5 ± 0.7 µm (mean ± SEM) indicated that the extended projection terminals remained either in contact (8 of 18) or in the vicinity (10 of 18) of the ectopic Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> sources (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). These observations together demonstrate that the Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> diffusive cue is sufficient to provide neural guidance <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>As the posterior lateral-line ganglion matures, newly formed neurons extend their axonal growth cones along the posterior lateral-line nerve to reach the neuromasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). We wondered whether the axonal projections that had yet to be associated with a neuromast could also respond to an ectopic source of Sema7A<sup>sec</sup>. Indeed, on seven occasions in which <italic>sema7a<sup>sec</sup></italic> integration had occurred between two neuromasts, we detected neurite extensions from the posterior lateral-line nerve to the ectopic Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> sources (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>; <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B-B&quot;</xref>, Videos 10-12). Live time-lapse video microscopy further revealed dynamic association between the extending neurites and the ectopic Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> sources. Long and thin along their entire extents, the neurites were highly motile, extending and retracting rapidly near the Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> expressing cells. Many neurites maintained their contact with the ectopic sources of Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> from one hour to almost eight hours (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I,J</xref>; <xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>, Videos 13-16). The responsiveness of the posterior lateral-line axons to Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> might therefore be an intrinsic property of the neurons that does not require the neuromast microenvironment.</p>

Larvae expressing the transgenesis marker—the lens-specific green fluorescent protein (GFP)—were heat-shocked, incubated to allow expression, and subsequently mounted for live imaging (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). In these larvae, a few mature myofibers expressed the exogenous Sema7A-GPI protein. We selected only those neuromasts in which an ectopic integration had occurred near the network of sensory arbors. In all 15 such cases, no sensory axon left the arbor network to approach the ectopic Sema7A-GPI sources. In all 17 of the uninjected and heat-shocked control larvae, the sensory arbor network did not show any perturbation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B-C</xref>, Videos 17-19). These data suggest that the Sema7A-GPI, unlike its secreted counterpart, functions at the surfaces of the expressing cells.</p>

<title>Sema7A deficiency impacts synaptic assembly</title>
<p>Contact stabilization between an axon and its target cell is essential for synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Neural GPI-anchored proteins can act as regulators of various synaptic-adhesion pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). In the mouse olfactory system, GPI-anchored Sema7A is enriched in olfactory sensory axons and mediates sustained interaction with the dendrites of mitral and tufted cells in the olfactory bulb to establish synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). In the developing mouse brain–particularly in Purkinje cells–GPI-anchored Sema7A instead regulates the elimination of synapses onto climbing fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). The role of anchored Sema7A in regulating synaptic architecture can thus vary according to the cell type and developmental stage. Our demonstration that Sema7A is necessary to consolidate the contact between sensory axons and hair cells during neuromast development suggests a possible role in regulating synaptic structure.</p>
<p>Proper synaptogenesis requires the correct spatial organization of the presynaptic and postsynaptic apparatus at the apposition of two cells. At the interface between hair cells and sensory axons, the synaptic network involves two scaffolding proteins in particular: ribeye, a major constituent of the presynaptic ribbons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>), and membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK), a conserved group of proteins that organize postsynaptic densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Utilizing these scaffolding proteins as markers, we investigated the impact of the <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutation on synapse formation. To analyze the distribution of presynaptic densities–immunolabeled with an antibody against the ribeye-associated presynaptic constituent C-terminal binding protein (CTBP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>)–we counted the number and measured the area of CTBP punctae from multiple neuromasts at several stages of neuromast development (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A,B</xref>). The CTBP punctae in each hair cell ranged from zero to seven across developmental stages. In the zebrafish’s posterior lateral line, the formation of presynaptic ribbons is an intrinsic property of the hair cells that does not require contact with lateral-line sensory axons. However, sustained contact with the sensory axon influences the maintenance and stability of ribbons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). As neuromasts matured from 2 dpf to 4 dpf, we identified similar distribution patterns with a characteristic increase in the number of CTBP punctae in both control and <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> larvae (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C,D</xref>). This result implies that the formation of new presynaptic ribbons is not perturbed in the mutants, even though there are on average fewer CTBP punctae (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>). Measurement of the areas of CTBP punctae also showed similar distributions in both genotypes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E,F</xref>) but the average area of presynaptic densities was reduced in the mutants (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D-F</xref>, <xref rid="fig6s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Because GPI-anchored Sema7A lacks a cytosolic domain, it is unlikely that Sema7A signaling directly induces the formation of presynaptic ribbons. We propose that the decrease in average number and area of CTBP punctae likely reflects decreased stability of the presynaptic ribbons owing to lack of contact between the sensory axons and the hair cells.</p>

<p>Our analysis of the skeletonized network traces of the sensory arbor network identified distinct topological features that are resultant of collective assemblies of each sensory axon. Because postsynaptic aggregates are organized at the sensory axons, we wondered whether they are associated with a specific topological feature of the network. To identify the distribution of the postsynaptic aggregates along the arbor network, we utilized the transgenic animal <italic>TgBAC(neurod1:EGFP)</italic> that labeled the sensory axons of the posterior lateral line in green fluorescence protein (GFP), and marked the postsynaptic aggregates through immunostaining with a pan-MAGUK antibody (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). We generated skeletonized network traces of the arbor network and determined the three-dimensional spatial locations of the MAGUK punctae (<xref rid="fig6s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Comparison of the topological features of the network with the spatial locations of the MAGUK punctae revealed that the postsynaptic densities occur more extensively on the loops than on the bare terminals (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). We measured 567 MAGUK punctae from 16 sensory arbor networks, where 531 punctae were located on the loops and only 36 punctae on the bare terminals (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>). Furthermore, the MAGUK punctae predominantly aggregate near the node and their density sharply diminishes moving farther from the node (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I</xref>, <xref rid="fig6s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). These observations suggest that the distribution of the postsynaptic aggregates is closely associated with the topological attributes of the sensory circuit. Because in the <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mutants the arbor networks have significantly lower number of loops and nodes, and more bare terminals, we hypothesize that in the mutants the occurrence of postsynaptic aggregates is perturbed. Moreover, Sema7A-GPI-mediated juxtracrine signaling onto the apposed axonal membrane is essential to induce postsynaptic assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>).</p>
<p>To characterize the impact of <italic>sema7a</italic> mutation on the formation of postsynaptic aggregates, we counted the number and measured the area of MAGUK punctae from multiple neuromasts at several stages of neuromast development (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6J,K</xref>). At 4 dpf, 68.3 % of the hair cells in the control neuromasts were associated with at least one MAGUK punctum. In the <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant this value fell to 37.5 % (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6L,M</xref>). The average number of MAGUK punctae also declined in the mutants (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G-I</xref>). As control neuromasts matured from 2 dpf to 4 dpf, the MAGUK punctae showed a shift toward smaller sizes, suggesting that the postsynaptic structure fragmented into smaller entities as observed in other excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). At 4 dpf, 77.5 % of the hair cells in the control neuromasts had postsynaptic densities with areas between 0.10 µm<sup>2</sup> and 0.40 µm<sup>2</sup>. In the <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant the corresponding value was only 42.5 % (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6N,O</xref>). The average area of MAGUK punctae was also reduced in the mutants compared to the controls (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1J-L</xref>, <xref rid="fig6s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). We speculate that the abnormalities in the postsynaptic structure of the <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mutants arose from reduced contact between the hair cells and the sensory axons and perturbed topological attributes of the sensory circuit or from the lack of Sema7A-GPI-mediated juxtracrine signaling onto the apposed neurite terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The specification of neural circuitry requires precise control of the guidance cues that direct and restrict neural arbors at their target fields and facilitate synapse formation. In the lateral-line neuromast of the zebrafish, we have identified Sema7A as an essential cue that regulates the interaction between hair cells and sensory axons. We have discovered two isoforms of the <italic>sema7a</italic> gene <italic>in vivo</italic>: the chemoattractive diffusible form is sufficient to guide the sensory arbors toward their target, whereas the membrane-attached form likely participates in sculpting accurate neural circuitry to facilitate contact-mediated formation and maintenance of synapses. Our results suggest a potential mechanism for hair cell innervation in which a local Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> diffusive cue likely consolidates the sensory arbors at the hair cell cluster and the membrane-anchored Sema7A-GPI molecule guides microcircuit topology and synapse assembly. Establishing the exact function of each of the <italic>sema7a</italic> isoforms will necessitate studies that include transcript-specific targeted mutagenesis and rescue of the <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant phenotype by each of the transcript variants.</p>
<p>The role of Sema7A in regulating diverse topological features of the arborization network suggests that microcircuits of control and <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic>neuromasts have important functional differences. Loss of Sema7A disrupts the hierarchical organization of the node-degree distribution along the organ’s axis, as well as the preference towards forming loops containing four nodes with 30-40 µm of arbors. What benefit does the network gain from surrounding the hair cell cluster with closed loops instead of bare terminals? The network may actively form loops to contribute to the neuromast’s overall structure and function, or else emerge as a consequence of the arbors navigating the intervening spaces between the hair cells and support cells. The preferential localization of the postsynaptic aggregates in the loops and an enrichment near the nodes of the arbor network suggest that the precise patterning of the network—with characteristic looping behaviors—is not merely a byproduct of neuromast architecture, but may contribute to the network’s ability to gather sensory inputs through properly placed postsynaptic aggregates and to faithfully transmit sensory information to higher processing centers in the hindbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Further studies are necessary to elucidate the potential role of these topological features in regulating the distribution of synaptic bodies and optimizing robust neural transmission in the lateral-line microcircuit.</p>
<p>Recent studies have begun to dissect the molecular mechanisms of semaphorin signaling in axonal navigation. In explants derived from the murine olfactory bulb, Sema7A interacts directly with integrinβ1 to trigger downstream signaling effectors involving focal adhesion kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinases, which are critical regulators of the cytoskeletal network during axonal pathfinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). Moreover, the interaction between Sema7A and its receptor plexinC1 activates the rac1-cdc42-PAK pathway, which alters the actin network to promote axonal guidance and synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). We speculate that lateral-line sensory axons utilize similar mechanisms to sense and respond to Sema7A in the establishment of microcircuits with hair cells.</p>
<p>During early development of the posterior lateral line, the growth cones of sensory axons intimately associate with the prosensory primordium that deposits neuromasts along the lateral surface of the larva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). The growth of the sensory fibers with the primordium is regulated by diverse neurotrophic factors expressed in the primordium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). Impairing brain-derived or glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factors and their receptors perturbs directed axonal motility and innervation of hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). Lateral-line hair cells are particularly enriched in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>) and other chemotropic cues (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Because the sensory axons of <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants reliably branch from the lateral-line nerve to reach hair cell clusters, these chemoattractive factors might compensate in part for the absence of Sema7A function. Although sensory axons are strict selectors of hair cell polarity and form synapses accordingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>), diverse chemoattractant cues including Sema7A occur uniformly between hair cell polarities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). It seems likely that unbiased attractive signals bring sensory arbors toward hair cells, after which polarity-specific molecules on hair cell surfaces dictate the final association between axonal terminal and hair cells. Notch-delta signaling and its downstream effectors regulate hair cell polarity and the innervation pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). It would be interesting to determine whether Notch-mediated polarity signatures on the hair cell’s surface can refine the neuromast neural circuitry.</p>

The italicized nucleotides denote the mutated stop codon. The amplicon was then cloned into the pDONR221 vector by BP recombination to generate the middle entry pME-sema7a<sup>sec</sup> vector. To generate the hsp70:sema7a<sup>sec</sup>-mKate2 construct, gateway cloning was performed by combining the plasmids p5E-hsp70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>), pME-sema7a<sup>sec</sup>, p3E-mKate2-myc no-pA (Addgene, 80812), and pDESTtol2pACrymCherry (Addgene, 64023) with LR Clonase II Plus (Invitrogen). Verified constructs (25 ng/μl plasmid DNA) were injected with Tol2 Transposase mRNA (approximately 25 ng/μl) into one-cell embryos. The transiently transgenic larvae— identified by the expression of red fluorescent protein (mCherry) in their lenses—were raised till 3 dpf, heat-shocked in a water bath at 37 °C for 1 hr, incubated at 28 °C for 1 hr to allow expression, and subsequently mounted for live imaging.</p>

<title>Microscopy and volumetric rendering of living neuronal arbors and cells</title>
<p>Living larvae were dechorionated, anaesthetized in 600 μM 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester methanesulfonate in system-water with 1 μg/mL methylene blue, and mounted in 1 % low-melting-point agarose on a glass-bottom MetTek dish at specific stages. The larvae were maintained at 28 °C during imaging in a temperature-controlled stage top chamber (OKO Lab UNO-T). Static images at successive focal depths were captured at 200 nm intervals and deconvolved with Microvolution software in ImageJ (NIH). For time-lapse video microscopy, the ectopic <italic>sema7a<sup>sec</sup></italic> integration sites were imaged at intervals of 5 min as Z-stacks acquired with 1.0 μm steps with laser excitation at 488 nm and 561 nm under a 60X, silicone-oil objective lens of numerical aperture 1.30. The three-dimensional datasets were processed and volume-rendered with the surface evolver and filament-tracer tools in Imaris (Bitplane, Belfast, UK).

<p>Fluorescent intensity values of the sensory neurites and the ectopic Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> sources were measured from the maximal-intensity projections at each time during the time-lapse video microscopy.

<title>Quantification of sensory arbor distributions around hair cell clusters</title>
<p>The region from the center of the combined hair cell cluster to 60 μm in the post-cluster region was divided into 3600 concentric sections of equal area. Each section, as depicted with a distinct color shade, had an area of π μm<sup>2</sup>. Sensory arbor density was defined as Log10[(Area occupied by the arbors in each section)/ (Area of each section)]. The arbor density was then plotted as a histogram against distance from the center of the combined hair cell cluster. Each bin of the histogram represents an area of π µm<sup>2</sup> (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

<title>Quantification of the sensory arborization network topology</title>
<p>We developed a custom Python script (snt_topology.py; available on GitHub) to convert the skeletonized sensory arborization networks to network graphs (NetworkX, v3.1). We first used a custom ImageJ macro to convert SNT skeletons to csv files, then generated the network graph from the individual arbor paths. As noted previously, we defined five topological attributes: (1) nodes— junctions where arbors branch, converge, or cross; (2) loops—minimal arbor cycles forming topological holes; (3) bare terminals—arbors with free ends; (4) node degree—the number of first-neighbor nodes incident to a node; and (5) arbor curvature—the total curvature of a bare terminal (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). To enumerate loops and quantify their lengths and node numbers, we computed the minimum cycle basis for each network graph. The relative organ height of each node in a graph was defined in 3D using <xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation (1)</xref>:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="516962v5_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="516962v5_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is the vector from the arborization initiation point to a node and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="516962v5_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is the vector from the arborization initiation point to the hair cell cluster apex. The relative occurrence of nodes (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>) was normalized by both the number of hair cells per neuromast and the total number of neuromasts, for comparison across ages and genotypes. The relative number of bare terminals and loops (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>) was normalized by the number of hair cells per neuromast and scaled between 0 and 1. The density was then normalized by the total number of neuromasts imaged for each developmental stage and genotype. For <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref> and <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">G</xref>, the normalized occurrence was computed as the number of arbors of a given length that formed either a bare terminal or a loop, divided by the total number of arbors of either feature of that length. Lastly, we defined bare terminals as having either high or low curvature (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>; <xref rid="fig3s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E,F</xref>) if their absolute total signed curvature [<xref rid="eqn2" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation (2)</xref>] in three dimensions was either higher or lower than <italic>π</italic>/6, respectively:
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="516962v5_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>s</italic> is the arc-length parameter of the bare terminal, <italic>T</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) is the unit tangent vector at each point along the arbor, <italic>N</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) is the unit normal vector at each point, and the integral is evaluated from the terminal’s branching node to the arbor’s tip. For a closed curve forming a full loop, this value will equal 2<italic>π</italic>. In practice, we first fit B-splines (scipy.interpolate.splprep; SciPy, v1.10.1) in 3D to the skeletons for each bare terminal before evaluating their derivatives (scipy.interpolate.splev) and integrating (scipy.integrate.simpson) over their lengths.</p>

<p>Four-day-old <italic>TgBAC(neurod1:EGFP)</italic> larvae were fixed and stained for sensory arbors and postsynaptic aggregates marked by GFP and MAGUK, respectively. The GFP-positive sensory arbors were traced in three dimensions with ImageJ’s semi-automated framework, SNT. The topological attributes of the arbor network, such as the loop and the bare terminal, were determined as described previously. The localizations of the MAGUK punctae along the three-dimensional arbor network were measured using ImageJ’s cell counter framework (<xref rid="fig6s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E,F</xref>). We measured 567 MAGUK punctae from 16 sensory arbor networks.

<p>
This study provides direct evidence showing that Sema7a plays a role in the axon growth during the formation of peripheral sensory circuits in the lateral-line system of zebrafish. This is a valuable finding because the molecules for axon growth in hair-cell sensory systems are not well understood. The majority of the experimental evidence is convincing, and the analysis is rigorous. The evidence supporting Sema7a's juxtracrine vs. secreted role and involvement in synapse formation in hair cells is less conclusive. The study will be of interest to cell, molecular and developmental biologists, and sensory neuroscientists.</p>

<p>Dasguta et al. have dissected the role of Sema7a in fine tuning of a sensory microcircuit in the posterior lateral line organ of zebrafish. They attempt to also outline the different roles of a secreted verses membrane-bound form of Sema7a in this process. Using genetic perturbations and axonal network analysis, the authors show that loss of both Sema7a isoforms causes abnormal axon terminal structure with more bare terminals and fewer loops in contact with presynaptic sensory hair cells. Further, they show that loss of Sema7a causes decreased number and size of both the pre- and post-synapse. Finally, they show that overexpression of the secreted form of Sema7a specifically can elicit axon terminal outgrowth to an ectopic Sema7a expressing cell. Together, the analysis of Sema7a loss of function and overexpression on axon arbor structure is fairly thorough and revealed a novel role for Sema7a in axon terminal structure.</p>

<p>In this work, Dasgupta et al. investigate the role of Sema7a in the formation of peripheral sensory circuit in the lateral line system of zebrafish. They show that Sema7a protein is present during neuromast maturation and localized, in part, to the base of hair cells (HCs). This would be consistent with pre-synaptic Sema7a mediating formation and/or stabilization of the synapse. They use sema7a loss-of-function strain to show that lateral line sensory terminals display abnormal arborization. They provide highly quantitative analysis of the lateral line terminal arborization to show that a number of specific topological parameters are affected in mutants. Next, they ectopically express a secreted form of Sema7a to show that lateral line terminals can be ectopically attracted to the source. Finally, they also demonstrate that the synaptic assembly is impaired in the sema7a mutant. Overall, the data are of high quality and properly controlled. The availability of Sema7a antibody is a big plus, as it allows to address the endogenous protein localization as well to show the signal absence in the sema7a mutant. The quantification of the arbor topology should be useful to people in the field who are looking at the lateral line as well as other axonal terminals.</p>

<p>The data reported here demonstrate that Sema7a defines the local behavior of growing axons in the developing zebrafish lateral line. The analysis is sophisticated and convincingly demonstrates effects on axon growth and synapse architecture. Collectively, the findings point to the idea that the diffusible form of sema7a may influence how axons grow within the neuromast and that the GPI-linked form of sema7a may subsequently impact how synapses form, though additional work is needed to strongly link each form to its' proposed effect on circuit assembly.</p>
<p>Comments on latest version:</p>
<p>The authors comprehensively and appropriately addressed most of the reviewers' concerns. In particular, they added evidence that hair cells express both Sema7A isoforms, showed that membrane bound Sema7A does not have long range effects on guidance, demonstrated how axons behave close to ectopic Sema7A, and analyzed other features of the hair cells that revealed no strong phenotypes. The authors also softened the language in many, but not all places. Overall, I am satisfied with the study as a whole.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p>
<p>Dasgupta and colleagues make a valuable contribution to the understanding how the guidance factor Sema7a promotes connections between mechanosensory hair cells and afferent neurons of the zebrafish lateral line system. The authors provide solid evidence that loss of Sema7a function results in fewer contacts between hair cells and afferents through comprehensive quantitative analysis. Additional work is needed to distinguish the effects of different isoforms of Sema7a to determine whether there are specific roles of secreted and membrane bound forms.</p>

Together, the analysis of Sema7a loss of function and overexpression on axon arbor structure is fairly thorough and revealed a novel role for Sema7a in axon terminal structure. However, the connection between different isoforms of Sema7a and the axon arborization needs to be substantiated. Furthermore, the effect of loss of Sema7a on the presynaptic cell is not ruled out as a contributing factor to the synaptic and axon structure phenotypes. These issues weaken the claims made by the authors including the statement that they have identified dual roles for the GPI-anchored verses secreted forms of Sema7a on synapse formation and as a chemoattractant for axon arborization respectively.</p>

The quantification of the arbor topology should be useful to people in the field who are looking at the lateral line as well as other axonal terminals. I think some results are overinterpreted though. The authors state: &quot;Our findings demonstrate that Sema7A functions both as a juxtracrine and as a secreted cue to pattern neural circuitry during sensory organ development.&quot; However, they have not actually demonstrated which isoform functions in HCs (also see comments below). In addition, they have to be careful in interpreting their topology analysis, as they cannot separate individual axons. Thus, such analysis can generate artifacts. They can perform additional experiments to address these issues or adjust their interpretations.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #4 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>This study provides direct evidence showing that Sema7a plays a role in the axon growth during the formation of peripheral sensory circuits in the lateral-line system of zebrafish. This is a valuable finding because the molecules for axon growth in hair-cell sensory systems are not well understood. The majority of the experimental evidence is convincing, and the analysis is rigorous. The evidence supporting Sema7a's juxtracrine vs. secreted role and involvement in synapse formation in hair cells is less conclusive. The study will be of interest to cell, molecular and developmental biologists, and sensory neuroscientists.</p>
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>In their revised manuscript, Dasgupta et al. have provided further experiments to address the role of Sema7a (sec and GPI-anchored) in regulating axon guidance in the lateral line system. Specifically, the inclusion of the heat shock controls and FM labeling to show hair cell mechanotransduction were crucial to interpretation of the results. However, there are still concerns about the specificity of the results. My primary concern is if the change in axon patterning is specifically due to loss of Sema7a in the mutant hair cells. These animals are morphologically very abnormal and, in the rebuttal, the authors state that hair cell number is reduced. This is not quantified in the manuscript and should be included.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have included the data in the manuscript in lines 137-139, in Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, and in the source data for Figure 2 and Figure 2-figure supplements.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>If there is not a function for Sema7a in hair cells themselves, why is the number reduced?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The sema7a-/- homozygous mutants are not viable and they die by 6 dpf. The loss of Sema7A protein produce other developmental defects including brain edema and a curved body axis. We believe a slight but not significant decrease in hair cell number may arise from a minute developmental delay in the morphogenesis of the neuromast. We have accordingly quantified our data at three distinct developmental stages-at 2 dpf, 3 dpf, and 4 dpf-and have incorporated them in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Additionally, FM data should be quantified and presented in animals without a transgene in the same excitation/emission spectra for clearer interpretation of the staining.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have quantified the intensities of labeling with FM 4-64 styryl dye from the control and the sema7a-/- mutant larvae and incorporated the data in lines 139-146, in Figure 2—figure supplement 1D, and in source data for Figure 2 and Figure 2-figure supplements. We Kept the transgenes to concurrently show the arborization phenotype, hair cell morphology, and the FM 4-64 incorporation between the genotypes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Rescue analysis using the myo6d promotor would allow the authors to ensure that the axon deficits can be rescued by putting Sema7a back into the sensory hair cells. Transient transgenesis could be useful for this approach and would not require the creation of a stable line. This could be done with both forms of Sema7a allowing the true assessment of whether or not the secreted and GPI-anchored form have disparate functions as claimed in lines 418424.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although we recognize the importance of the rescue of the sema7a-/- mutant phenotype with the sema7asec and the sema7aGPI transcripts, it is not possible for us to perform that experiment at the moment, for the first author will leave the lab next week.  However, he plans to continue work on this project as an independent investigator to dissect the individual roles of the transcript variants in specifying the pattern of sensory arborization, a project that includes generation of transcript-specific knockout animals and rescue experiments with stable transgenic fish lines.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Other concerns:</p>
<p>(1) The timeline of the heat shock experiment is confusing to me and, therefore, it makes me question the specificity of those results. Based on the speed of axon outgrowth and the time necessary for transcription and translation after heat shock induction of the transgene, it is unclear to me how the axon growth defects could occur in the timeline provided. Imaging two hours after the start of the heat shock is very rapid and speaks to either an indirect effect of the transgenesis on the axon growth or a leaky promotor/induction paradigm. It is possible I am just misunderstanding the set up but, from what I could gather, the imaging is being done 2 hrs after the start of the heat shock. This should be clarified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The axons of the zebrafish posterior lateral line migrate relatively fast. The pioneering axons migrate at around 120 μm/hour (Sato et. al., 2010) and the follower axons migrate at almost 30-80 μm/hour (Sato et. al., 2010). The heat-shock promoter that we have utilized, hsp70l, is highly effective in inducing gene expression and subsequent protein formation within 30 to 60 mins. We believe an hour of heat shock and an hour of incubation post heat shock is sufficient to induce directed axon migration to a distance that spans from 27 μm to 140 μm.</p>
<p>We strongly believe that the directed arborization of the sensory axons towards the Sema7Asec source is not due to an indirect effect of transgenesis or leaky promoter induction, as in all 18 of the injected but not heat-shocked control larvae we did not observe ectopic Sema7Asec expression, and no aberrant projection was formed from the sensory arbor network. We highlight this observation in lines 297-299 and in Figure 4E.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Similarly, it would help to clarify if t(0) in the figure is the onset of the heat shock or onset of imaging two hours after the heat shock is started.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The t=0 hour in the Figure 4I denotes the onset of imaging two hours after the heat shock began. We have clarified this in the manuscript in lines 1155-1156.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In the rebuttal, the line numbers cited do not match up with the appropriate text, I believe.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have corrected this and updated the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Some of the supplemental figures are not mentioned in the text, or I could not find them. For example: Figure 1 supplement 2J.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this. We have corrected the manuscript, and the new information is added in line 114.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Table 1 statistics: were these adjusted for multiple comparisons using a bonferroni correction or something similar? This is necessary for statistical significance to be meaningful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did not adjust the p-values for multiple comparisons because the values correspond to only three or four statistical tests per experiment, strongly indicating the unlikelihood of erroneous significance due solely to multiple tests.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Figure 1I and 1-S3 - The legend states a positive correlation between axonal signal and sema7A signal. Correlations are 0.5, 0.6, and 0.4 (2,3, 4dpf). This is not a convincing positive correlation. At best this is no to a very weak positive correlation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In lines 122-126 we mention that the basal association of the sensory arbors shows a positive correlation with Sema7A accumulation. We never emphasize on the strength of the correlation. However, a consistent positive correlation at three different developmental stages suggests that progressive Sema7A accumulation at the base of the hair cells may guide the sensory arbors to increasingly associate themselves with the hair cells.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>I am a bit disappointed that the authors elected not to experimentally address the issue raised by all reviewers: whether the secreted or membrane bound isoform is active in hair cells. They rather decided to change their interpretation in the text. It is fine, given the eLife review structure. However, that would make the manuscript much stronger. Other issues were adequately addressed through textual changes as well.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Overall, I am satisfied with the study as a whole and just have a few minor comments that remain to be addressed.</p>
<p>(1) Although the authors say that they added appropriate no plasmid/heatshock-only and plasmid-only/no heatshock controls, these results need to be presented more clearly, as they are separated in the paper and only one was quantified (i.e. 100% of embryos showed no defect). Please just make it clear that no defects were observed in either control for either experiment (both secreted and membrane bound ectopic expression).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have clearly stated this information in lines 297-299 and 343-345.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Please add a compass to Fig. 1A to indicate the orientation of the neuromast. It would also be helpful to add labels for developmental ages to all of the figures, rather than making the reader look it up in the legend.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have updated the Figure 1A and the corresponding figure legend in lines 882883 . We have denoted the larval age in the figure legends to keep the individual images uncluttered.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) For the RT-PCR experiments in Figure 1, no negative control was included to show that supporting cell or neuronal genes are not detected in the purified hair cells and v.v. that neither isoform is detected in supporting cells or neurons. I ask only because there is a lot of immune-signal outside of the hair cells and I am curious whether that is secreted or might come from other cell types. For neurons and supporting cells, simply demonstrating absence of Sema7a overall would suffice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have utilized the transgenic line Tg(myo6b:actb1-EGFP) that expresses the fluorophore GFP specifically in the hair cells of the neuromast. Unfortunately, we do not possess a transgenic line that reliably and specifically labels the support cells in the neuromast. Hence, in our sorting experiment the GFP-negative cells that are collected from the trunk segments of the larvae contain all the non-hair cells including epidermal cells, neuronal cells, and immune cells etc. Such a mixture of varied cellular identity may not serve as a reliable negative control.</p>
<p>In Figure 7, we have plotted the normalized expression values of the sema7a gene in the neuromast. The plot clearly depicts that the source of Sema7A is the young and the mature hair cells, not the support cells. We further confirm this observation by</p>
<p>immunostaining where the Sema7A signal is highly restricted to the hair cells and not in any other cell in the neuromast (Figure 1E). Immunostaining further demonstrates that the lateral line sensory arbors also do not produce the Sema7A protein (Figure 1H; Video 1).</p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that there are diverse immune cells, including macrophages in and around the neuromast. These macrophages are dynamic and possess highly ramified structure (Denans et. al., 2022). In all our Sema7A immunostainings, we never observed structures that resemble macrophages. Albeit we cannot confirm that Sema7A is not expressed in a distant immune cell, but we highly doubt that signal coming from immune cells is impacting hair cell innervation by the sensory arbors during homeostatic development.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In Figure 1, Supplement 4, I do not see the immunogen labeled in blue.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have corrected the figure legend. The immunogenic region of the Sema7A protein is now clearly denoted in the figure legend of Figure 1—figure supplement 4.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) In Figure 2, please add a control image as requested, as that enables direct comparison. There is ample room in the figure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have updated the Figure 2 and made the suggested change.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

<p>We have quantified the FM 4-64 intensities in control and sema7a-/- mutant larvae. The new data is added to the manuscript in lines 142-146, 577-579 , and in Figure 2—figure supplement 1D.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) In Figure 3, there seems to be a typo in the figure legend: &quot;mutants in the same larvae&quot; does not make sense to me.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We have updated the Figure 6—figure supplement 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) Minor point: the authors state that they addressed the distance over which secreted Sema7A may act, but this was not evident to me in the text. Please make this finding clearer.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have clarified this information in lines 310-311.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) Finally, the discussion contains a statement that is not supported by the data: &quot;We have discovered dual modes of Sema7A function in vivo.&quot; They have discovered evidence that there are two isoforms, that loss of both disrupts connectivity, and that overexpression of only the secreted form can elicit growth from a distance. However, there is no direct evidence that the membrane-bound form is responsible for local effects. It is formally possible still that the phenotypes are a result of dual roles for the secreted form. It is clear that another manuscript is forthcoming that will expand on the role of the transmembrane form, but for this manuscript, the authors should make firm conclusions only about the data presented herein.</p>
