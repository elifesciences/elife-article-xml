<title>Abstract</title><p>Preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) is one of the most controversial topics in reproductive medicine, with disagreements over the apparently contradictory results of randomised controlled trials, non-selection trials and outcome data analyses. Data from live birth outcomes largely suggest that fully euploid biopsies are associated with positive live birth rates, while fully aneuploid biopsies are not. However, the possible confounding effects of chromosomal mosaicism (when either the whole embryo, the biopsy result (or both) contain an admixture of euploid and aneuploid cells) is frequently cited as a reason why PGT-A should not be performed. Previous computer models have indicated that a mosaic result is a poor indicator of the level of mosaicism of the rest of the embryo, and it is thus unwise to use mosaic PGT-A results when selecting embryos for transfer. Here we developed a computational model, <italic>tessera</italic>, to create virtual embryos for biopsy, allowing us to vary the number of cells in the simulated embryo and biopsy, the proportion of aneuploid cells and the degree of juxtaposition of those cells. Analysis of approximately 1 million virtual embryos showed that “100% euploid” and “100% aneuploid” biopsy results are relatively accurate predictors of the remainder of the embryo, while mosaic biopsy results are poor predictors of the proportion of euploid and aneuploid cells in the rest of the embryo. Within mosaic embryos, ‘clumping’ of aneuploid cells further reduces the accuracy of biopsies in assaying the true aneuploidy level of any given embryo. Nonetheless - and somewhat counterintuitively - biopsy results can still be used with some confidence to rank embryos within a cohort. Our simulations help resolve the apparent paradox surrounding PGT-A: the biopsy result is poorly predictive of the absolute level of mosaicism of a single embryo, but may be applicable nonetheless in making clinical decisions on which embryos to transfer.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Preimplantation Genetic Testing for Aneuploidy (PGT-A) is one of the most controversial areas of treatment in reproductive medicine. Since its inception, questions about its efficacy have led to entrenched points of view both in favour and against its use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Griffin and Ogur, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Victor et al., 2020</xref>). While randomised controlled trials (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Yan et al., 2021</xref>), mostly in good prognosis patients, often point to minimal or no efficacy (at least in younger women), non-selection trials (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Tiegs et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Yang et al., 2021</xref>) provide strong evidence that embryos diagnosed as fully aneuploid rarely lead to live births and frequently miscarry. Some consensus can be arrived at along the lines of a) PGT-A does not improve cumulative pregnancy/live birth rates (some would say it was never designed to), but b) PGT-A does nonetheless improve pregnancy/live birth rates per embryo transfer (though some would say that this is not an accurate measure of efficacy). Key points of debate and disagreement still persist however as follows: First, the extent to which PGT-A improves pregnancy/live birth rate per cycle. While raw outcome data points to a clear positive benefit of PGT-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Sanders et al., 2021</xref>), this work has been challenged by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Roberts et al., (2022)</xref> as “naïve analysis”; they performed a more in-depth logistic regression including confounders such as patient history, treatment characteristics and year of treatment, and suggested that PGT-A may be detrimental overall. Second, the prospect that the process of biopsying the embryo could lead to damage and therefore impaired developmental potential. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Scott et al., (2013)</xref> have provided compelling evidence that this is not the case in their own setting, worldwide roll-out could theoretically lead to suboptimal practices in some clinics. Third, the possible confounding effects of euploid/aneuploid mosaicism. Specifically, the likely role of embryo “self-correction” (high levels of embryonic mosaicism earlier in development demonstrably reduce in later stages), and, pertinent to this study, whether any mosaic result found in the biopsy accurately reflects that of the rest of the embryo.</p>
<p>Currently, PGT-A involves the removal of a 5-10 cell biopsy from the trophectoderm (TE) of a ∼150-200 cell blastocyst embryo. Most PGT-A performed today entails assessment of the biopsy’s ploidy by low-read whole genome sequencing and subsequent read depth counting (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Viotti, 2020</xref>). The end result is a profile with wide dynamic range that is well established, with considerable accuracy, to assay for the proportion of euploid and aneuploid cells in known admixtures of five or more cells. The subsequent translation to a five-cell embryo biopsy is inferred with some confidence therefore and, by definition, if mosaicism is present in the biopsy, the embryo as a whole was mosaic prior to biopsy. The <italic>level</italic> of mosaicism (i.e. the proportion of aneuploid to euploid cells) among the un-biopsied remainder of the embryo however is not reliably inferred. That is, if two out of the five cells in the biopsy are aneuploid, this does not necessarily mean that the remainder of the embryo is similarly 40% aneuploid and 60% euploid. There are three reasons for this: First, from basic probabilities of sampling from a mixed population, a five-cell biopsy will not always reflect this ratio. Second, the majority of euploid/aneuploid mosaics arise by post-zygotic chromosomal segregation errors; populations of aneuploid cells are thus clonal and would be expected to be in rough juxtaposition to one another. In other words, a mosaic embryo would be expected to have “clumps” of euploid and aneuploid cells, non-homogeneously distributed. Third, there is evidence that the TE and ICM (inner cell mass) can have different levels of aneuploidy or mosaicism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Griffin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ren et al., 2022</xref>). The blastocyst thus either actively expels aneuploid cells to the trophectoderm and other structures (blastocoel, surrounding degenerate cells) or the ICM disproportionately disfavours the growth of aneuploid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Griffin et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, as more data emerges, it appears that the majority of embryos from both healthy and infertile couples are mosaic to some degree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Coticchio et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Griffin et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, human embryonic development is characterised, chromosomally, to be complex, fluid and dynamic, with demonstrably fewer chromosome abnormalities present at day 3 compared to day 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Coticchio et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Harton et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Experimental data provides strong evidence that, for the most part, the biopsy result obtained accurately represents the chromosome constitution of the rest of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Kim et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Navratil et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Victor et al., 2019</xref>). The majority of biopsy results are however “100% euploid” or “100% aneuploid”, with mosaic results comprising ∼4-20% of returns. Furthermore, 100% euploid diagnoses may not have detected low level euploid/aneuploid mosaicism by virtue of the fact that, simply, no aneuploid cells were biopsied. Initial reports of live births following mosaic embryo diagnoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Greco et al., 2015</xref>) were followed by the establishment of a registry logging the transfers of mosaic embryos and their clinical outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Viotti et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">2021</xref>). Data shows that live birth rate per embryo transfer is generally lower in mosaic embryos than embryos with a “100% euploid result”, but that other health outcomes for babies born from the mosaic or euploid groups seem largely indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Viotti et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Computational models provide a useful adjunct to clinical outcome data studies, allowing multiple iterations of the same biological scenario to be tested. In this study, we explored, comprehensively, the utility of embryo biopsy using computational modelling. Previous modelling of embryo biopsy as a sampling approach using a hypergeometric distribution model demonstrated limitations in how much information can be obtained from a single biopsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Gleicher et al., 2017</xref>). This modelling assumed aneuploid cells were randomly distributed within an embryo; however, their clonal origin suggests this to be unlikely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Mantikou et al., 2012</xref>). Clustered aneuploid cells in a biopsy do not fit a hypergeometric distribution and so the previous model could have <italic>overstated</italic> the utility of biopsying. If we were to ask the question “does a mosaic diagnosis accurately predict the level of mosaicism in the rest of the embryo?” we need to define what we mean by “accurately” – within 1%, 5%, 10% or 20% for instance. Finally, even if we cannot accurately predict the absolute level of embryo mosaicism, does this mean that the <italic>ranking</italic> of embryos based on the level of mosaicism seen is also invalid?</p>
<p>With the above in mind, we developed a more extensive computational model of embryo biopsy, allowing us to explore the scenarios in which biopsies do, or do not, provide useful information. We were interested not only in the proportion of aneuploid cells in both the biopsy and the whole embryo, but also how dispersed or clustered those cells are, as well as the size of the biopsy. We related this data back to previously described classifications of aneuploidy rates into low and high-level mosaicism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Munné et al., 2020</xref>) and in the PGDIS position statement on the transfer of mosaic embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Leigh et al., 2022</xref>). This allowed us to resolve the paradoxical utility of trophectoderm biopsy for PGT-A via a simple maxim: <italic>although the information contained in the biopsy is highly imperfect, even imperfect information is clinically useful</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>In order to develop a “virtual embryo” computational model, we used R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">R Core Team, 2022</xref>). The virtual embryo was implemented in the <italic>tessera</italic> R package, available from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/bmskinner/tessera">https://github.com/bmskinner/tessera</ext-link> and allowed us to design virtual embryos with specific proportions of aneuploid cells, dispersals of those cells and to take different sizes of biopsy in multiple iterations.</p>
<p>The embryo was implemented as a Fibonacci lattice: projection of a Fibonacci spiral into spherical coordinates, providing a sphere with evenly spaced points of desired number at the surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">González, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Swinbank and Purser, 2006</xref>). This represents the TE (for simplicity, we do not consider the ICM in this model). Each cell in the embryo can be euploid or aneuploid; when an embryo is created using this model, the proportion of aneuploid cells is specified, and the level to which the aneuploid cells are dispersed on a scale of 0-1. The overall placement strategy models a biological situation in which a variable number of “seed” progenitor cells undergo mal-segregation at an early-stage embryonic development, followed by clonal expansion of these aneuploid cells within their immediate vicinity. The “dispersion” parameter controls the number of initial seed regions, ranging from 0 (no dispersion, one single clump of aneuploid cells is present) to 1 (maximal dispersion, each aneuploid cell in the embryo is placed non-adjacent to other aneuploid cells if possible).</p>
<p>Technically, the dispersion is set by seeding initial aneuploid cells that are not adjacent to another aneuploid cell, and which can grow into aneuploid patches. As dispersion increases, so does the number of initial seeds. When all seeds have been placed, or no more seeds can be placed without being adjacent to an existing aneuploid cell, any remaining aneuploid cells required are selected randomly from the euploid cells adjacent to at least one aneuploid cell. The placement of aneuploid cells is random within these constraints, controlled by R’s random number generator. An overall seed for the generator can be set for each embryo to allow reproducibility.</p>
<p>We then repeatedly biopsied the embryo to yield all possible biopsies from that embryo. A biopsy of desired size <italic>n</italic> is taken by sampling a cell and its <italic>n-1</italic> closest neighbours. This is repeated for each cell in the embryo. The number of aneuploid cells in each biopsy is then counted and aggregated.</p>
<p>We considered four parameters: aneuploidy, dispersal, embryo size and biopsy size. We simulated embryos with aneuploidy from 0% to 100% in 1% intervals, and dispersal of aneuploid cells, from 0 (clustered) to 1 (fully dispersed) in 0.01fractional intervals. Four embryo sizes were modelled: 100, 150, 200 and 250 cells, and twelve biopsy sizes: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 cells. For each combination of aneuploidy, dispersal, embryo size and biopsy size we generated 100 embryos using different random number seeds.</p>
<p>Given the large amount of data, unless otherwise stated, the results presented herein use a biopsy size of 5 cells and embryo size of 200 cells, as aneuploidy and dispersal were more important than embryo or biopsy size to the results. Simulated data were created using tessera v0.6 and results were visualised using ggplot2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wickham, 2016</xref>). The tessera package also contains a visualisation tool in Shiny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Chang et al., 2022</xref>) for exploring the impacts of aneuploidy and dispersal on biopsy results. Tessera can be run in a local web browser, and is also available for basic visualisation via web server at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://reproduction.essex.ac.uk">https://reproduction.essex.ac.uk</ext-link>.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Statistical analysis of clinical data</title>
<p>We assessed the latest clinical data for empirical support for our model outputs. Data were obtained from 1733 embryos by the International Registry of Mosaic Embryo Transfers (IRMET), of which 1000 have previously been reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Viotti et al. (2021)</xref>, and 733 collected since. The analyses presented here were approved by the IRB of the Zouves Foundation (OHRP IRB00011505, Protocol #0002). Embryo were evaluated for chromosomal abnormalities in trophectoderm biopsies by PGT-A (Veisieq, Vitrolife) and classified as ‘mosaic’ if the results indicated intermediate copy number for any genomic region within the assay’s resolution (&gt;20Mb) in the 20-80% interval between whole chromosome numbers, as laid out by the position statement issued by the Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis International Society (PGDIS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Leigh et al., 2022</xref>). Embryos were classified following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Viotti et al. (2021)</xref> as either whole chromosome mosaics (at least one whole chromosomal aneuploidy and zero or more segmental aneuploidies) or segmental mosaics (at least one segmental aneuploidy and no whole chromosomal aneuploidy).</p>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed in R. Data were analysed by logistic regression, modelling successful outcome as dependent on the type of aneuploidy and the level of aneuploidy. Comparisons between categorical groups were performed with two-tailed chi-square tests with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We developed the R package ‘tesser’ to simulate trophectoderm biopsies, allowing us to compare the effects of changing embryo parameters on biopsy results. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> shows two example embryos, both with 20% aneuploidy, but different dispersal of the aneuploid cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> A,B). The distribution of biopsies obtained from these embryos consequently also differs.</p>
<fig id="fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure">
<label>Figure 1:</label>
<caption><p>Model embryos created using tessera with 20% aneuploid cells (dark grey) and 80% euploid cells (light green), shown from front and back. Embryos have either high (A) or low (B) dispersal of the aneuploid cells. The potential biopsies obtained from each differ (graph C for embryo A, graph D for embryo B). For the clustered embryo (B) most biopsies are not representative of the mosaicism level present in the embryo (D); the reverse is true for the dispersed embryo.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="23299850v1_fig1.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>In the dispersed embryo (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>), the majority of biopsies also have 20% aneuploidy (1 aneuploid cell in the biopsy; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>), but in clustered embryo (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>) the majority of the biopsies come from the euploid region of the embryo and have no aneuploid cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). Biopsies taken from a clustered embryo are hence less likely to be representative of the embryo than biopsies taken from the dispersed embryo.</p>
<p>We used this approach to explore the impact of aneuploidy level, dispersal, biopsy size and embryo size by simulating and biopsying multiple randomly generated embryos for each parameter combination.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Aneuploidy level and dispersal both affect biopsy accuracy</title>
<p>In the first step, we kept dispersal high, and varied the level of aneuploidy. We visualised the overall accuracy of the biopsies by comparing the biopsy aneuploidy level to the overall embryo aneuploidy level (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). We saw an increase in the error as aneuploidy increases towards 50%. This matches expectations: the more cells of a single type are present in the embryo, the more likely a biopsy is to reflect those cells. There is also a decrease in error as aneuploidy increases from 50% to 100% and the cells again become more consistent.</p>
<fig id="fig2" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure">
<label>Figure 2:</label>
<caption><p>Difference between the aneuploidy of a 5-cell biopsy and the aneuploidy of the embryo for embryos with increasing levels of (A) aneuploidy at constant dispersal of 1 and (B) increasing dispersal with constant aneuploidy of 20%. Values show the mean and standard deviation of 100 replicates. Error is highest at 40%-60% aneuploidy, and at low dispersals. The local minima in the aneuploidy chart are due to the 5-cell biopsy size, allowing exact matches to the biopsy at these aneuploidies.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="23299850v1_fig2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>

<p>If aneuploidy is held constant at 20%, and dispersal of aneuploid cells is varied, we obtain the pattern in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>: greatest error at low dispersal, decreasing as dispersal increases.

<title>Hard classification thresholds cause lower accuracy in classifying embryos close to the boundary</title>
<p>The difference between the level of mosaicism in the biopsy and that in the embryo is one useful measure, but there are other classification methods used in clinics. The PGDIS (Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis International Society) described classification levels for aneuploidy that are followed or adapted by many fertility clinics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Leigh et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Munné et al., 2020</xref>), hereafter termed ‘embryo classes’ for brevity. Under the position statement, the following classification system is possible: 0-&lt;20% aneuploidy is considered ‘euploid’, 20-&lt;50% ‘low level’ mosaic, 50-80% ‘high level’ mosaic, and &gt;80-100% ‘aneuploid’. We used these classifications as a more practical assessment of biopsy accuracy: what percentage of biopsies from an embryo are in the same class as the embryo itself?</p>
<p><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> shows this embryo classification accuracy for dispersal and aneuploidy combinations as a heatmap. Each combination is calculated as the mean from 100 embryos. Large differences are seen between the accuracies of biopsies from embryos in the different embryo classes become apparent. Generally, high dispersal of aneuploid cells is more accurate than clustered cells, and extremes of aneuploidy are more accurate than intermediate mosaic levels of aneuploidy. Overall classification accuracy is lowest in the low-level mosaic class and at the boundaries between classes.</p>

<title>Increasing biopsy size does not greatly increase accuracy in clustered embryos</title>
<p>All models presented so far have used a biopsy size of 5 cells. In PGT-A biopsies tend to be 5-10 cells, so we tested the effect of varying biopsy size from 3 cells to an unrealistically high 30 cells on the accuracy of embryo classification (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>); the panel for 5-cells in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4</xref> is identical to <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>Notably, while accuracy does increase as biopsy size increases, we see little difference over a ‘practical’ biopsy size of 5-10 cells. We also see that even if the biopsy is unrealistically large (&gt;15 cells), there is little improvement to biopsy accuracy in embryos with highly clustered aneuploid cells, especially in the low-level mosaic class. This suggests there is no clear benefit to biopsying larger numbers of cells. Indeed, the effect of using hard cut-off thresholds with these different biopsy sizes makes, for instance, a 6-cell biopsy appear less accurate over the high-level mosaic embryos than a 5-cell biopsy. Furthermore, classification accuracy of low- and high-level mosaic embryos is very poor for 3-cell biopsies and for 4-cell biopsies of low-level mosaic embryos, and we therefore caution against collecting fewer than 4 cells in a biopsy.</p>
<p>We then tested whether taking two 5-cell biopsies from an embryo improved over a single 10-cell biopsy. There is a small improvement for embryos with low dispersal (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>-<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3</xref>), increasing accuracy by up to ∼12 percentage points, but there are no benefits at higher dispersals.</p>

<title>Predicting an embryo as high- or low-level mosaic from a single biopsy is not reliable</title>
<p>Up to this point, we have demonstrated how patterns of embryo biopsies vary as the embryo parameters change. We next considered the reverse situation, which is what clinicians actually experience: given a single biopsy, which embryos are most likely to generate this biopsy, and does this allow effective prediction of embryo status? For this, we made the assumption that an embryo is equally likely to originate from anywhere in the parameter space of aneuploidy and dispersal. This is probably not true of real embryos, but we do not have enough biological data to clearly constrain these values as yet (see the Discussion).</p>
<p>Under these assumptions, we simulated a pool of 1,020,100 embryos covering all pairwise combinations of aneuploidy and dispersal with 100 replicates per combination, and took all 202,020,000 possible biopsies from these embryos. We then grouped the biopsies by the number of aneuploid cells they contained. For each number of aneuploid cells, we counted how frequently biopsies with that number occurred in each embryo combination (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>).</p>
<fig id="fig5" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure">
<label>Figure 5:</label>
<caption><p>The possible origin embryos for 5-cell biopsies with 0 to 5 aneuploid cells. Biopsies with either 0 or 5 aneuploid cells are more likely to come from a constitutively normal or constitutively aneuploid embryo respectively, but mosaic biopsies can come from a much broader possible range of embryos.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="23299850v1_fig5.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>We observed that while fully euploid or aneuploid biopsies are more likely to originate from correspondingly high or low aneuploid embryos, when biopsies are mosaic there is a wide range of possible origins. This shows that accurately classifying a mosaic embryo based on a single biopsy is not robust.</p>
<p>To demonstrate this further, we focussed on just three levels of dispersal - 0 (clustered), 0.5 (mid dispersal) and 1 (highly dispersed). For each level of biopsy aneuploidy, what percentage of biopsies originate at each level of embryo aneuploidy (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>)? In the ideal scenario biopsy aneuploidy and embryo aneuploidy would be perfectly correlated and we would be able to derive the precise level of aneuploid cells in a mosaic embryo for a given biopsy result. However, while there is a correlation, it is weak, especially at low dispersal (i.e. when cells are clustered). Adding the embryo classification thresholds on top of this chart, we then counted the number of embryos that matched the biopsy’s class (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). At low dispersal, only about half of biopsies would correctly predict their embryo’s class, and even at high dispersal the accuracy rises to ∼80% only for fully euploid or aneuploid biopsies. A practical interpretation is that if one took a 5-cell biopsy from an embryo with clustered aneuploid cells, and the biopsy showed one aneuploid cell (low level mosaic), the embryo itself would be a low-level mosaic for less than half of such biopsies; even if the aneuploid cells were dispersed, the embryo would still be low-level mosaic for 55% of these biopsies. For a mosaic embryo, the classification would be as likely to be incorrect as correct.</p>

<title>Biopsy results are nonetheless informative when ranking mosaic embryos</title>
<p>In clinical practice, it is rare to only consider one single biopsied embryo at a time. Usually multiple oocytes are retrieved following ovarian stimulation, of which some will be graded good quality and suitable for TE biopsy - <italic>e.g.</italic> 16.4±11 oocytes from which 4.9±4.7 blastocysts were biopsied and a single embryo transferred; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Lin et al., 2020</xref>). The clinical real-world question is “<italic>which of these embryos (if any) should be transferred to yield the best chance for pregnancy?”</italic>. The embryos are ranked, using the biopsies to determine their relative quality. Do the limitations imposed by single biopsy accuracy impair the ability to correctly rank two or more embryos?</p>
<p>Consider two embryos. One has 40% aneuploidy, and a biopsy yielding 2/5 aneuploid cells. The second has 60% aneuploidy and a biopsy yielding 3/5 aneuploid cells. The biopsies are <italic>accurate</italic> representations of the embryo. The biopsies can also be used to <italic>rank</italic> the embryos from less aneuploid to more aneuploid. Now consider the same embryos, but with different biopsy results: 0/5 and 2/5 aneuploid cells respectively. The biopsies are no longer <italic>accurate</italic>; they do not reflect the true level of aneuploidy in the embryo. However, they still correctly <italic>rank</italic> the embryos from less aneuploid to more aneuploid. Selecting the embryo with the lowest number of aneuploid cells in the biopsy for transfer is still the most sensible decision.</p>
<p>To understand how this ability to rank embryos is affected by aneuploidy and dispersal, we repeatedly generated two embryos with different aneuploidies, from 0-100%, took all possible biopsies from each embryo, and made all pairwise combinations of those biopsies. We scored the ranking as correct if the biopsy from the less aneuploid embryo had fewer aneuploid cells than the biopsy from the more aneuploid embryo. Equal numbers of aneuploid cells in the biopsies were scored as ties, and higher numbers of aneuploid cells in the biopsy from the less aneuploid embryo were scored as incorrect ranking.</p>
<p>We aggregated the rank results by the true difference in aneuploidies between the two embryos, since ranking embryos with a large aneuploidy difference should be more likely to succeed than ranking embryos with a small aneuploidy difference. <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref> shows the mean and standard deviation over 100 replicates for each aneuploidy combination at zero dispersal (the worst-case scenario for accuracy from our earlier modelling). Although some biopsies are tied (equal numbers of aneuploid cells), on average ranking embryos is successful more than half of the time as long as there is a greater than 25 percentage point difference in aneuploidies.</p>

<p>What practically happens in the clinic if two embryos have equal biopsy results, and one is desired for transfer? The data must be either discarded as uninformative, and other embryo characteristics (<italic>e.g.</italic> morphology) relied upon, or a random choice must be made between the two embryos. In our simulated embryo pairs, a random choice would correctly select the embryo with lower aneuploidy half the time. We accounted for this by splitting half of the ‘Tied’ rank biopsies each into the ‘Correct’ and ‘Incorrect’ ranks (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>), yielding the effective ranking ability. As long as there is a difference in aneuploidy between two embryos, no matter how small, biopsy data will on average allow the two to be distinguished better than by chance. This demonstrates that biopsying an embryo is useful for comparisons <italic>between</italic> embryos, <italic>even if it is not directly informative as to the absolute aneuploidy status of the embryo</italic>.</p>
<p>In practice, clinics are not only trying to distinguish between two embryos alone. The goal is often to select the best <bold>k</bold> embryos from a pool of <bold>n</bold>. We simulated an embryo pool with random aneuploidy levels, from which three embryos were selected via single biopsy (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>) and compared the selected embryos to the true “best” embryos.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The chromosomally complex, fluid and dynamic nature of the human embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Coticchio et al., 2021</xref>), coupled with the widespread use of PGT-A make it no surprise that it is still an area of great debate. The data presented here provide evidence to resolve an apparent paradox on whether the practice of PGT-A is effective when embryos are mosaic. Our modelling demonstrates that mosaic biopsies can derive from a wide range of embryos and their results should not be considered a reliable indicator of individual embryo status. Somewhat counterintuitively however, when considering a pool of embryos that need to be ranked based on the proportion of aneuploid (vs euploid) cells, a mosaic biopsy result can be informative in establishing that ranking. Furthermore, when a biopsy indicates that all cells are aneuploid, or all cells are euploid, it is considerably more informative in predicting the genetic status of the embryo.</p>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Our modelling supports PGT-A outcome data</title>
<p>The data presented here support the outcome data in the mosaicism registry (1733 embryos at the time of writing) suggesting that the proportion of aneuploid cells in a mosaic biopsy is a predictor of the chances of live birth – the greater the level of aneuploidy in the mosaic biopsy, the lower the chances of a live birth. This also supports data from post-2020 non-selection trials and the unblinded cohort study of Gleicher and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Barad et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Tiegs et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Yang et al., 2021</xref>), in which embryo biopsies diagnosed as 100% euploid have a higher chance of pregnancy and live birth (55-65%) than any classes in the mosaicism registry. On the other hand, those diagnosed as 100% aneuploid have little or no chance (0-2%). Of the 4 studies that have addressed this issue, a total of 267 embryos have been transferred, with only 3 (1%) leading to chromosomally normal live births (in 2 of the 4 studies the live birth rate was 0%). The three surviving births presumably represented genotyping errors, or mosaic embryos in which a postzygotic error led to a cluster of aneuploid cells around the site of biopsy.</p>
<p>The debate over the utility of PGT-A often centres around the compounding effects of mosaicism and the interpretation of its results. While there are few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for PGT-A, meta-analysis of RCTs has suggested chromosome copy number screening increases implantation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Dahdouh et al., 2015</xref>). More recent RCTs suggest that PGT-A does not increase cumulative live birth rate in women between 20 and 37 (average age 29) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Yan et al., 2021</xref>) but these studies may be under-powered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Cornelisse et al., 2020</xref>). Data is especially lacking on the utility of PGT-A for women over 35, a high-risk group for aneuploidies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Munné et al., (2019)</xref> found no increase in ongoing pregnancy rate (OPR) at 20 weeks in women aged 25-40 associated with PGT-A, though post-hoc analysis of women aged 35-40 showed a significant increase in OPR. In light of the lack of conclusive RCTs and biological uncertainty about the impacts of mosaicism, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Gleicher et al., (2021)</xref> have suggested PGT-A should not be routinely offered in the clinic, as it risks discarding viable embryos, does not provide reliable information and may give clinics a conflict of interest in recommending expensive yet unnecessary treatments to patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Gleicher et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Most data for higher risk groups come from published pregnancy rates from clinics and deal with pregnancy or live birth rates per embryo transfer. It is very clear that, by this measure, PGT-A confers a benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Sanders et al., 2021</xref>), particularly in older women where the difference is over tenfold. Such results are borne out by other non-selection trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Tiegs et al., 2021</xref>), and an unblinded cohort study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Barad et al., 2022</xref>) in which fully aneuploid diagnoses were transferred, but only led to live birth 1% of the time. Strong support for the effectiveness of biopsies in selecting mosaic embryos for transfer has come from analysis of outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Viotti et al., 2021</xref>) and our follow-up analysis here, which show clear differences in rates of implantation and ongoing pregnancy for embryos with low level or high-level mosaicism. Given the good/poor prognosis for constitutively euploid/aneuploid embryos respectively, this is of primary importance for cycles where <italic>only</italic> embryos with a mosaic diagnosis. The proportion of such cycles is not well characterised but has been reported to be up to 20% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Lin et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s4b">
<title>Relevance for clinical interpretation of biopsy data</title>
<p>The modelling presented here provides evidence that biopsy results (even mosaic ones) can be interpreted with some confidence when ranking embryos for potential transfer, but give limited information about a single embryo. Furthermore, assigning a classification to a biopsy such as “euploid, low-level mosaic, high-level mosaic or aneuploid” can also affects the accuracy of the reporting. In the light of the results presented here we respectfully suggest that while “euploid and aneuploid” should be retained for biopsies showing 0% or 100% aneuploid cells respectively, the classification of mosaic embryos based on biopsies with intermediate levels of aneuploidy detection is less robust. Clinicians should bear in mind that simple fixed cut-offs for “high” or “low” levels of mosaicism can be misleading when considering only a single embryo. Rather, we suggest using classification or absolute aneuploidy level preferentially for ranking embryos, regardless of any nominal cutoffs. We have shown that any absolute difference in the measured aneuploidy level is sufficient to rank one embryo as higher or lower grade aneuploidy than another at better than chance accuracy, though if the measured aneuploidy levels for two embryos fall within 20% of each other, clinicians may wish to weight other aspects of embryo quality (such as morphology) more highly when selecting embryos for transfer. Our testing of biopsy sizes showed classification accuracy of low- and high-level mosaic embryos is poor for 3-cell biopsies and for 4-cell biopsies of low-level mosaic embryos and we therefore suggest collecting at least 5 cells if possible. We also found only a small benefit to taking two 5-cell biopsies versus one 10-cell biopsy, and thus given the robust ranking of embryos in a pool from single biopsies, we do not recommend multiple biopsies.</p>

<sec id="s4c">
<title>Future extensions to modelling for consideration</title>
<p>In this study, while we addressed the level of aneuploidy in the biopsy and its relationship to the likely level of aneuploidy in the whole embryo, we did not consider that the TE forms the placenta and other extraembryonic tissue, distinct from the inner cell mass (ICM) that will develop into the foetus. However, TE biopsy reflects the chromosomal constitution of the ICM in studies from both humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ren et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Victor et al., 2019</xref>) and cattle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Tutt et al., 2021</xref>), and uniform aneuploidies are well detected by TE biopsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Popovic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Victor et al., 2019</xref>). We also do not consider ‘self-correction’; the long-established phenomenon that cleavage stage embryos (day 3) can have aneuploidy in more than half of their cells but that level nonetheless declines by trophectoderm stage (day 5) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">McCoy, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Of all the parameters explored (aneuploidy, dispersal, embryo size, biopsy size), we found that the level of dispersal is the most important factor affecting the accuracy of a biopsy. If the aneuploid cells are evenly dispersed across the embryo, a biopsy may be fully representative, but if the aneuploid cells are clustered, individual biopsies are likely to be misleading. The level of dispersal may also be influenced by the type of error generating the mosaicism in the first place; a nondisjunction error at meiosis followed by a trisomy rescue event may have a different pattern of aneuploidies to a polymerase slippage at mitosis, or a mitotic nondisjunction.</p>
<p>While our model has considered many parameter combinations, it has also still been using a binary treatment of aneuploidy: a cell is aneuploid or it is euploid. In reality, aneuploidies can be more complex, with different chromosomes having different likelihoods of aneuploidy, and an embryo may contain multiple different karyotypes. Aneuploidies can also be segmental, affecting regions of chromosomes and not entire chromosomes. We see from the clinical outcome data analysed here that segmental mosaics do not have as strong a negative impact on outcomes as whole chromosome mosaics. Aneuploidies may also be balanced, invisible to bulk sequencing, and only revealed by single cell sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ren et al., 2022</xref>), and mitotic nondisjunction events typically generate trisomic and monosomic cells that could balance each other out and thus not easily be detectable by NGS when pools of cells are analysed. We want to investigate these additional aspects of mosaicism in the future and how they can affect the measured biopsy outcomes. The true incidence of different levels of embryo aneuploidy and dispersal - both in natural populations and in the patient groups that are typically undergoing PGT-A is also not fully understood. Only with real data on the distribution of aneuploidies and their dispersal in embryos will we be able to refine these models. This can be obtained through (<italic>e.g.</italic>) lineage tracing experiments or more detailed sampling and single cell sequencing of embryos that have been rejected for transfer.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The assisted reproduction community has been debating the merits of PGT-A since its inception and, in our opinion, our data provide a resolution to some of the opposing viewpoints around mosaicism. While debate on other aspects of PGT-A will continue, we suggest a combination of the mosaicism registry data with the modelling presented in this study should inform the decision-making process when a mosaic result is returned from an embryo biopsy. What we have demonstrated is that although a biopsy result is imperfect, it is nonetheless informative in prioritising embryos for transfer whether a 100% euploid, 100% aneuploid or mosaic result is obtained. When navigating hazards, even a blurred map is useful.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Although an oversimplification of the biological complexities, this modeling work does add, in a limited way, to the current knowledge on the theoretical difficulties of detecting mosaicism in human blastocysts from a single trophectoderm biopsy in PGT. However, many of the premises that the modeling was built on are theoretical and based on unproven biological and clinical assumptions that could yet lead to be untrue. Therefore, the work should be considered only as a simplified model that could assist in further understanding of the complexities of preimplantation embryo mosaicism, but assumptions of real-world application are, at this stage, premature and should not be considered as evidence in favour of any clinical strategies.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work has presented an intriguing theoretical model for elaborating on the interpretation of complex and still unclear biological phenomena such as chromosomal mosaicism in preimplantation embryos.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Lines 134-138: The spatial modeling of mitotic errors in the embryo was oversimplified in this manuscript. There is only limited (and non-comprehensive) evidence that meiotic errors leading to chromosome mosaicism arise from chromosome loss or gain only (e.g. anaphase lag). This work did not take into account the (more recognised) possibility of mitotic nondisjunction where following the event there would be clones of cells with either one more or one less of the same chromosome. Although addressed in the discussion (lines 572-574), not including this in the most basic of modeling is a significant oversight that, based on the simple likelihood, could significantly affect results.</p>
<p>General comment: the premise of the manuscript is that an embryologist (embryology laboratory) is aware of and can accurately quantify the number of cells in a blastocyst or TE biopsy. The reality is that it is not possible to accurately do this without the destruction of the sample which is obviously not clinically applicable. Based on many assumptions the findings show that taking small biopsies poorly classifies mosaic embryos, which is not disputed. However, extrapolating this to the clinic and making suggestions to biopsy a certain amount of cells (lines 539-540) is careless and potentially harmful by suggesting the introduction of potential change in clinical practice without validation. Additionally, no embryologist in the field can tell how many cells are present in a clinical TE biopsy, making this suggestion even more impractical.</p>
<p>On a more general clinical consideration, the authors should acknowledge that when reporting findings of unproven clinical utility and unknown predictive values this inevitably results in negative consequences for infertile couples undergoing IVF. It is proven and established that when couples face the decision on how to manage a putative mosaicism finding, the vast majority decide on embryo disposal. It was recently reported in an ESHRE survey that about 75% of practitioners in the field consider discarding or donating to research embryos with reported mosaicism. A prospective clinical trial showed that about 30% live birth rate reduction can be expected if mosaic embryos are not considered (Capalbo et al., AJHG 2021). The real-world experience is that when mosaicism is reported, embryos with almost normal reproductive potential are discarded. The authors should be more careful with the clinical interpretation and translation of these theoretical findings.</p>
<p>There is a robust consensus within the field of clinical genetics and genomics regarding the necessity to exclusively report findings that possess well-established clinical validity and utility. This consensus is grounded in the imperative to mitigate misinterpretation and ineffective actions in patient care. However, the clinical framework delineated in this manuscript diverges from the prevailing consensus in clinical genetics. Clinical genetics and genomics prioritize the dissemination of findings that have undergone rigorous validation processes and have demonstrated clear clinical relevance and utility. This emphasis is crucial for ensuring accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic decision-making in patient care. By adhering to established standards of evidence and clinical utility, healthcare providers can minimize the potential for misinterpretation and inappropriate interventions. The framework proposed in this manuscript appears to deviate from the established principles guiding clinical genetics practice. It is imperative for clinical frameworks to align closely with the consensus guidelines and recommendations set forth by professional organizations and regulatory bodies in the field. This alignment not only upholds the integrity and reliability of genetic testing and interpretation but also safeguards patient well-being and clinical outcomes.</p>

<p>Line 61: &quot;Self correction&quot; - This terminology is unfortunately indiscriminately used in the field for PGT when referring to mosaicism and implies that the embryo can actively correct itself from a state of inherent abnormality. Apart from there being no evidence to suggest that there is an active process by which the embryo itself can correct chromosomal errors, most presumed euploid/aneuploid mosaic embryos will have been euploid zygotes and therefore &quot;self-harm&quot; may be a better explanation. True self-correction in the form of meiotic trisomy/monosomy rescue is of course theoretically possible but not at all clinically significant. The concept being conveyed in this part of the manuscript is not disputed but it is strongly suggested that the term &quot;self correction&quot; is not used in this context, nor in the rest of the manuscript, to prevent the perpetuation of misinformation in the field and instead use a better description.</p>
<p>Lines 69-73: The ability to quantify aneuploidy in known admixtures of aneuploid cells is indeed well established. However, the authors claim that the translation of this to embryo biopsy samples is inferred with some confidence and that if a biopsy shows an intermediate chromosome copy number (ICN), that the biopsy and the embryo are mosaic. There are no references provided here and indeed the only evidence in the literature relating to this is to the contrary. Multifocal biopsy studies have shown that an ICN result in a single biopsy is often not seen in other biopsies from the same embryo (Capalbo et al 2021; Kim et al., 2022; Girardi et al., 2023; Marin, Xu, and Treff 2021). Multifocal biopsies showing reciprocal gain and loss which would provide stronger validation for the presence of true mosaicism are also rare. In this work, the entire manuscript is based on the accuracy of ICN in a biopsy being reflective of mosaicism in the embryo. The evidence however points to a large proportion of ICN detected in embryo biopsy potentially being technical artifacts (misdiagnosing both constitutionally normal and abnormal (meiotic aneuploid) embryos as mosaic. Therefore, although results from the modelling provide insight into theoretical results, these can not be used to inform clinical decision-making at all.</p>
<p>Lines 87-89: The authors make the claim that emerging evidence is suggestive that the majority of embryos are mosaic to some degree. If in fact, mosaicism is the norm, the clinical importance may be limited.</p>
<p>Line 102-103: The statement that data shows that the live birth rate per ET is generally lower in mosaic embryos than euploid embryos is from retrospective cohort studies that suffer from significant selection bias. The authors have ignored non-selection study results (Capalbo et al, ajhg 2021) that suggest that putative mosaicism has limited predictive value when assessed prospectively and blinded.</p>
<p>Lines 94-98: The authors have misrepresented the works they have presented as evidence for biopsy result accuracy (Kim et al., 2023; Victor et al 2019; Capalbo et al., 2021; Girardi et al., 2023, and any others). These studies show that a mosaic biopsy is not representative of the whole embryo and can actually be from embryos where the remainder of the embryo shows no evidence of mosaicism. There is also a missing key reference of Capalbo et al, AJHG 2021, and Girardi et al., HR 2023 where multifocal biopsies were taken.</p>
<p>Lines 371-372: &quot;Selecting the embryo with the lowest number of aneuploid cells in the biopsy for transfer is still the most sensible decision&quot;. Where is the evidence for this other than the modeling which is affected by oversimplification and unproven assumptions? Although the statement seems logical at face value, there is no concrete evidence that the proportion of aneuploid cells within a biopsy is valuable for clinical outcomes, especially when co-evaluated with other more relevant clinical information.</p>
<p>Lines 431-463: In this section, the authors discuss clinical outcome data from the transfer of putative mosaic embryos and make conclusions about the relationship between ICN level in biopsy and successful pregnancy outcomes. The retrospective and selective nature of the data used in forming the results has the potential to lead to incorrect conclusions when applied to prospective unselected data.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this study fails to incorporate the most important variable impacting the ability to predict mosaicism, the accuracy of the test. The fact is that most embryos diagnosed as mosaic are not mosaic. There may be 4 cases out of thousands and thousands of transfers where a confirmation was made. Mosaicism has become a category of diagnosis in which embryos with noisy NGS profiles are placed. With VeriSeq NGS it is not possible to routinely distinguish true mosaicism from noise. An analysis of NGS noise levels (MAPD) versus the rate of mosaics by clinic using the registry will likely demonstrate this is the case. Without accounting for the considerable inaccuracy of the method of testing the proposed modeling is meaningless.</p>
<p>Recent data using more accurate methods of identifying mosaicism indicate that the prevalence of true preimplantation embryonic mosaicism is only 2%, which is also consistent with findings made post-implantation. This model fails to account for the possibility that, because so few embryos are actually mosaic, there is actually no relevance to clinical care whatsoever. In fact, differences in clinical outcomes of embryos designated as mosaic could be entirely attributed to poor embryo quality resulting in noise levels that make NGS results fall into the &quot;mosaic&quot; category.</p>
<p>Additional comments:</p>
<p>Indeed, as more data emerges, it appears that the majority of embryos from both healthy and infertile couples are mosaic to some degree (Coticchio et al., 2021; Griffin et al., 2022).</p>
<p>This statement should be softened as all embryos will be considered mosaic when a method with a 10% false positive rate is applied to 10 more parts of the same embryo. The distinction between artifact and true mosaicism cannot be made with nearly all current methods of testing. When virtually no embryos display uniform aneuploidy in a rebiopsy study, there should be great concern over the accuracy of the testing used. The vast majority of aneuploidy is meiotic in origin.</p>
<p>Experimental data provides strong evidence that, for the most part, the biopsy result obtained accurately represents the chromosome constitution of the rest of the embryo (Kim 96 et al., 2022; Navratil et al., 2020; Victor et al., 2019).</p>
<p>This statement is incorrect given published systematic review of the literature indicates a 10% false positive rate based on rebiopsy results.</p>
<p>This shows that accurately classifying a mosaic embryo based on a single biopsy is not robust.</p>
<p>This is exactly why the practice of designating embryo mosaics with intermediate copy numbers should not exist.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for this detailed review, and that they see the value of theoretical modelling. We agree that this model makes simplifications; we took this simplified approach to focus on the core contradiction between clinical experience and previous modelling. Expanding the model to consider additional aspects of balanced mitotic nondisjunctions and technical accuracy is something we want to address; we are discussing whether this is something that can be practically added to this manuscript, or will involve enough work that should be developed as a further study.</p>

This work did not take into account the (more recognised) possibility of mitotic nondisjunction where following the event there would be clones of cells with either one more or one less of the same chromosome. Although addressed in the discussion (lines 572-574), not including this in the most basic of modeling is a significant oversight that, based on the simple likelihood, could significantly affect results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As above, we certainly plan to address this in future modelling; developing the model to account for this while also incorporating the issue of technical uncertainty in the state of each cell in the biopsy from sequencing.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>General comment: the premise of the manuscript is that an embryologist (embryology laboratory) is aware of and can accurately quantify the number of cells in a blastocyst or TE biopsy. The reality is that it is not possible to accurately do this without the destruction of the sample which is obviously not clinically applicable. Based on many assumptions the findings show that taking small biopsies poorly classifies mosaic embryos, which is not disputed. However, extrapolating this to the clinic and making suggestions to biopsy a certain amount of cells (lines 539-540) is careless and potentially harmful by suggesting the introduction of potential change in clinical practice without validation. Additionally, no embryologist in the field can tell how many cells are present in a clinical TE biopsy, making this suggestion even more impractical.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will revise this to make the technical limitations of clinical TE biopsies clearer.</p>

<p>On a more general clinical consideration, the authors should acknowledge that when reporting findings of unproven clinical utility and unknown predictive values this inevitably results in negative consequences for infertile couples undergoing IVF. It is proven and established that when couples face the decision on how to manage a putative mosaicism finding, the vast majority decide on embryo disposal. It was recently reported in an ESHRE survey that about 75% of practitioners in the field consider discarding or donating to research embryos with reported mosaicism. A prospective clinical trial showed that about 30% live birth rate reduction can be expected if mosaic embryos are not considered (Capalbo et al., AJHG 2021). The real-world experience is that when mosaicism is reported, embryos with almost normal reproductive potential are discarded. The authors should be more careful with the clinical interpretation and translation of these theoretical findings.</p>

<p>The clinical potential of mosaic embryos is much more nuanced than a simple ‘they should be discarded’ or ‘they should be treated like euploid embryos’. While the study mentioned by the reviewer (Capalbo et al., AJHG 2021) does indeed suggest that embryos with putative low level mosaicism have good potential, it also suggests that embryos with putative high level mosaicism are largely to be considered aneuploid and should therefore be discarded. Therefore, even the mentioned study supports a ‘ranking’ of embryos by their mosaic result. Furthermore, large controlled retrospective studies have indicated that even high level mosaic embryos have reproductive potential (Viotti Fertility &amp; Sterility 2021 and Viotti F&amp;S 2023). Recent case reports have shown that mosaicism can occasionally persist from embryo to late gestation and even birth, at times associating with negative medical findings. Therefore, while the true clinical potential of embryos classified as mosaic is still being defined, here we are merely suggesting that from a modelling standpoint, the features of mosaicism detected with PGT-A can help guide clinical decisions (complementing the observations reported in the clinical studies).</p>

<p>There is a robust consensus within the field of clinical genetics and genomics regarding the necessity to exclusively report findings that possess well-established clinical validity and utility. This consensus is grounded in the imperative to mitigate misinterpretation and ineffective actions in patient care. However, the clinical framework delineated in this manuscript diverges from the prevailing consensus in clinical genetics. Clinical genetics and genomics prioritize the dissemination of findings that have undergone rigorous validation processes and have demonstrated clear clinical relevance and utility. This emphasis is crucial for ensuring accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic decision-making in patient care. By adhering to established standards of evidence and clinical utility, healthcare providers can minimize the potential for misinterpretation and inappropriate interventions. The framework proposed in this manuscript appears to deviate from the established principles guiding clinical genetics practice. It is imperative for clinical frameworks to align closely with the consensus guidelines and recommendations set forth by professional organizations and regulatory bodies in the field. This alignment not only upholds the integrity and reliability of genetic testing and interpretation but also safeguards patient well-being and clinical outcomes.</p>

<p>Line 61: &quot;Self correction&quot; - This terminology is unfortunately indiscriminately used in the field for PGT when referring to mosaicism and implies that the embryo can actively correct itself from a state of inherent abnormality. Apart from there being no evidence to suggest that there is an active process by which the embryo itself can correct chromosomal errors, most presumed euploid/aneuploid mosaic embryos will have been euploid zygotes and therefore &quot;self-harm&quot; may be a better explanation. True self-correction in the form of meiotic trisomy/monosomy rescue is of course theoretically possible but not at all clinically significant. The concept being conveyed in this part of the manuscript is not disputed but it is strongly suggested that the term &quot;self correction&quot; is not used in this context, nor in the rest of the manuscript, to prevent the perpetuation of misinformation in the field and instead use a better description.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a good point. We have used ‘self correction’ as a shorthand, but the reality is more nuanced. It will often be a passive process in which aneuploid cell lineages fail to proliferate over time (‘aneuploidy depletion’). The idea of ‘self harm’ is interesting; aneuploidy arising from a healthy euploid embryo. We can also see a further situation where the gametes suffered damage (e.g. DNA fragmentation, unresolved crossovers, persistence of meiotic breaks) leading to mitotic errors. In that case, the embryo would suffer the consequences of harm in the gametes, and ‘aneuploidy rescue’ may be a useful term also. We will discuss this further and reword the terminology along these lines.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Lines 69-73: The ability to quantify aneuploidy in known admixtures of aneuploid cells is indeed well established. However, the authors claim that the translation of this to embryo biopsy samples is inferred with some confidence and that if a biopsy shows an intermediate chromosome copy number (ICN), that the biopsy and the embryo are mosaic. There are no references provided here and indeed the only evidence in the literature relating to this is to the contrary. Multifocal biopsy studies have shown that an ICN result in a single biopsy is often not seen in other biopsies from the same embryo (Capalbo et al 2021; Kim et al., 2022; Girardi et al., 2023; Marin, Xu, and Treff 2021). Multifocal biopsies showing reciprocal gain and loss which would provide stronger validation for the presence of true mosaicism are also rare. In this work, the entire manuscript is based on the accuracy of ICN in a biopsy being reflective of mosaicism in the embryo. The evidence however points to a large proportion of ICN detected in embryo biopsy potentially being technical artifacts (misdiagnosing both constitutionally normal and abnormal (meiotic aneuploid) embryos as mosaic. Therefore, although results from the modelling provide insight into theoretical results, these can not be used to inform clinical decision-making at all.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important conceptual point, which needs to be addressed. The fact that mosaicism is often not observed in serial biopsies of the same embryo is precisely an inherent feature of mosaicism and is an invalid argument to discount the original diagnosis as false. The detection of ICN is not trivial and certain PGT-A platforms might not have the capability to discern noise from true ICN, hence the need for proper validation of the technology. The most stringent validation method for mosaicism detection remains the admixture experiment, such that when ICN patterns are detected the most obvious conclusion is that the biopsy contained a mosaic mix of cells. We aim to add wording regarding these points in the manuscript.</p>

<p>Lines 87-89: The authors make the claim that emerging evidence is suggestive that the majority of embryos are mosaic to some degree. If in fact, mosaicism is the norm, the clinical importance may be limited.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>If the majority of embryos are mosaic to some degree, it is important to understand the impacts that this may have on PGT-A biopsies and how informative such biopsies may be. Returning to the point the reviewer made above about mitotic aneuploidies as an important consideration: a mitotic nondisjunction at the first cleavage would result in a embryo that was entirely aneuploid. A mitotic nondisjunction occurring at the second cleavage would result in an embryo with 50% aneuploid cells, at the third cleavage, 25% aneuploid cells. If these aneuploid cells fail to proliferate, or are removed (either actively or passively), the level of aneuploidy will fall over time. While mosaicism is a binary (an embryo is or is not a mosaic of karyotypes), even if most embryos are mosaic, the clinical importance will depend on the level of aneuploidy.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 102-103: The statement that data shows that the live birth rate per ET is generally lower in mosaic embryos than euploid embryos is from retrospective cohort studies that suffer from significant selection bias. The authors have ignored non-selection study results (Capalbo et al, ajhg 2021) that suggest that putative mosaicism has limited predictive value when assessed prospectively and blinded.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will add the referenced multifocal biopsy study, but in contrast to the reviewer we see the data it contains as supporting our position in this paper. Capalbo et al. performed rebiopsies of trophectoderm and a biopsy of inner cell mass and found that high level mosaic or aneuploid trophectoderm tended to correlate with abnormal karyotypes in the inner cell mass while low level mosaics correlated with a normal inner cell mass. This supports our point that measuring levels of aneuploidy in the trophectoderm is relevant, and that this gives useful information for ranking embryos.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Lines 94-98: The authors have misrepresented the works they have presented as evidence for biopsy result accuracy (Kim et al., 2023; Victor et al 2019; Capalbo et al., 2021; Girardi et al., 2023, and any others). These studies show that a mosaic biopsy is not representative of the whole embryo and can actually be from embryos where the remainder of the embryo shows no evidence of mosaicism. There is also a missing key reference of Capalbo et al, AJHG 2021, and Girardi et al., HR 2023 where multifocal biopsies were taken.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As above, we will add more information on these multifocal biopsy studies; we believe these studies also support our position: that individual biopsies are not predictive of aneuploidy level in an embryo. If mosaicism is detected in the biopsy, then the embryo is mosaic, but if the remainder of the embryo is euploid then that single biopsy was not an accurate representation of the embryo. This could also apply in reverse - if mosaicism is not detected in the biopsy, it does not mean there is no mosaicism in the embryo, only that mosaicism could not be identified.</p>

<p>Lines 371-372: &quot;Selecting the embryo with the lowest number of aneuploid cells in the biopsy for transfer is still the most sensible decision&quot;. Where is the evidence for this other than the modeling which is affected by oversimplification and unproven assumptions? Although the statement seems logical at face value, there is no concrete evidence that the proportion of aneuploid cells within a biopsy is valuable for clinical outcomes, especially when co-evaluated with other more relevant clinical information.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We made this statement as part of a thought experiment to explain the difference between the concepts of absolute measurements versus embryo ranking. This section is not a result of the model, or clinical advice; it is a statement that in the specific example embryos given, the embryo with the fewest aneuploid cells in the biopsy would still be the embryo with the fewest aneuploid cells overall, and thus transferring this embryo (in the absence of any other differences of embryo quality) would remain sensible.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Lines 431-463: In this section, the authors discuss clinical outcome data from the transfer of putative mosaic embryos and make conclusions about the relationship between ICN level in biopsy and successful pregnancy outcomes.

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Unfortunately, this study fails to incorporate the most important variable impacting the ability to predict mosaicism, the accuracy of the test. The fact is that most embryos diagnosed as mosaic are not mosaic. There may be 4 cases out of thousands and thousands of transfers where a confirmation was made. Mosaicism has become a category of diagnosis in which embryos with noisy NGS profiles are placed. With VeriSeq NGS it is not possible to routinely distinguish true mosaicism from noise. An analysis of NGS noise levels (MAPD) versus the rate of mosaics by clinic using the registry will likely demonstrate this is the case. Without accounting for the considerable inaccuracy of the method of testing the proposed modeling is meaningless.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We disagree with the reviewer that the modelling is meaningless; we disagree that mosaicism is rare (see our other points). However, if we grant that mosaicism is rare, that almost all embryos are euploid or aneuploid, and that technical noise is the primary factor generating intermediate copy number values, then it is still important to understand how to interpret such intermediate values. Low-level mosaics would more likely represent miscalled euploid embryos, and high-level mosaics would more likely represent miscalled aneuploid embryos. We demonstrate that ranking on these intermediate values correlates with implantation rates and live birth rates, supporting their use. We do agree that technical accuracy of the NGS is an important consideration, and we will be incorporating this into our modelling in the future.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Recent data using more accurate methods of identifying mosaicism indicate that the prevalence of true preimplantation embryonic mosaicism is only 2%, which is also consistent with findings made post-implantation. This model fails to account for the possibility that, because so few embryos are actually mosaic, there is actually no relevance to clinical care whatsoever. In fact, differences in clinical outcomes of embryos designated as mosaic could be entirely attributed to poor embryo quality resulting in noise levels that make NGS results fall into the &quot;mosaic&quot; category.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As we also wrote in the point above, we disagree; it is possible that a euploid embryo may be misinterpreted as a mosaic. It is also possible that an aneuploid embryo is misinterpreted as a mosaic. Whether the intermediate copy number values arise through biological or technical reasons, they contain information that is useful to decisions on whether to transfer. We also note a recent paper that performed single-cell dissociation of trophectoderm versus inner cell mass which found that mosaicism in human embryos is very common (Chavli et al, 2024, DOI:10.1172/JCI174483).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Additional comments:</p>
<p>“Indeed, as more data emerges, it appears that the majority of embryos from both healthy and infertile couples are mosaic to some degree (Coticchio et al., 2021; Griffin et al., 2022).”</p>
<p>This statement should be softened as all embryos will be considered mosaic when a method with a 10% false positive rate is applied to 10 more parts of the same embryo. The distinction between artifact and true mosaicism cannot be made with nearly all current methods of testing. When virtually no embryos display uniform aneuploidy in a rebiopsy study, there should be great concern over the accuracy of the testing used. The vast majority of aneuploidy is meiotic in origin.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We note that reviewer 2 wrote that mitotic aneuploidy was the key concern, whereas reviewer 3 states meiotic aneuploidy is more common; we argue that both are relevant; a recent study by McCoy et al, 2023 (DOI:10.1186/s13073-023-01231-1) found that both drive arrest of human IVF embryos.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>“Experimental data provides strong evidence that, for the most part, the biopsy result obtained accurately represents the chromosome constitution of the rest of the embryo (Kim 96 et al., 2022; Navratil et al., 2020; Victor et al., 2019).”</p>
<p>This statement is incorrect given published systematic review of the literature indicates a 10% false positive rate based on rebiopsy results.</p>
<p>This shows that accurately classifying a mosaic embryo based on a single biopsy is not robust.</p>
<p>This is exactly why the practice of designating embryo mosaics with intermediate copy numbers should not exist.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that accurately classifying a mosaic embryo based on a single biopsy is not robust. That is one of the main messages of this paper. What we show here is that biopsies from a mosaic embryo are indeed likely to disagree with each other - but we find that there is still enough information at a population level for this to be an indicator or embryo outcomes. We have not yet performed modelling to explore the effect of technical error, so we will not speculate on the impact, but we reiterate a point made earlier: the most stringent validation method for mosaicism detection remains the admixture experiment, such that when intermediate copy number patterns are detected the most obvious conclusion is that the biopsy contained a mosaic mix of cells.</p>
