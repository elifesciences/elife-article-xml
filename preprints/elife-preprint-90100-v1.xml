<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Channelrhodopsins (ChRs) are light-gated ion channels that are widely used to optically activate or silence electrogenic cells such as neurons. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of a set of anion-conducting ChRs (ACRs) from diverse taxa and representing various branches of the ChR phylogenetic tree. The ACR from <italic>Mantoniella squamata</italic> (MsACR1) showed high sensitivity to yellow-green light (<italic>λ</italic><sub>max</sub> at 555 nm) and was further engineered for optogenetic applications. A single amino-acid substitution that mimicked red-light sensitive rhodopsins like Chrimson shifted the photosensitivity 20 nm towards red light and accelerated photocurrent kinetics. Hence, it was named red and accelerated ACR, raACR. Both wild-type and mutant are capable optical silencers at low light intensities in mouse neurons <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, while raACR offers a higher temporal resolution.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Channelrhodopsins (ChRs) are light-activated ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Nagel et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">2002</xref>). They are predominantly found in algae with flagella and an eyespot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Rozenberg et al., 2020</xref>), where they are used for phototactic movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baidukova et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Govorunova et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Sineshchekov et al., 2005</xref>). In optogenetics, cation-conducting ChRs (CCRs) are repurposed to trigger electrical activity in excitable tissue through optically evoked membrane potential depolarization. To shunt electrical activity in neurons, both natural and engineered anion-conducting ChRs (ACRs) are predominantly used to hyperpolarize the membrane potential in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Emiliani et al., 2022</xref>). Most recently, potassium-selective CCRs (KCRs) have been discovered in stramenopiles, offering an additional potential approach to silence electrogenic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Govorunova et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Vierock et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>A limiting factor to efficiently control behavior in model organisms is the need for a large spread of light that sufficiently covers a fraction of behavior-promoting neuronal circuits. Here, an activation wavelength (<italic>λ</italic><sub>max</sub>) for optogenetic tools in the red spectral range allows for penetration in much deeper layers in comparison to blue light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ash et al., 2017</xref>, p. 20). Therefore, optogenetic tools that are sensitive to red light are desirable. Currently, RubyACRs from the Labyrinthulea are the furthest red-shifted ACRs reported. However, they exhibit a substantial photocurrent inactivation and a slow photocurrent recovery at high light intensities <sup>11</sup> caused by accumulation of long-lasting and non-conducting secondary photointermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Sineshchekov et al., 2023</xref>). Furthermore, the operational light sensitivity that describes the ability of an optogenetic tool to exert an effect on the cell at a given photon density also defines the volume of activated neuronal tissue. Here, ACRs that combine high expression, high single-channel conductance, moderate kinetics and a high operational light sensitivity are ideal for efficient silencing of larger volumes.</p>
<p>We screened a panel of ChRs across the phylogenetic tree, including previously unexplored ChR clades. Among them, MsACR1, a member of the prasinophyte ACR family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Rozenberg et al., 2020</xref>), was the most activated with yellow-green light of 555 nm. The introduction of substitutions into the wild-type MsACR1 protein revealed a single mutation that caused a further redshift of the action spectrum and accelerated the photocurrent kinetics. Furthermore, we evaluated the optogenetic usability of MsACR1 and its mutant raACR for “red and accelerated ACR”. As such, we recorded dissociated hippocampal neurons at various light stimulation paradigms and tested the possibility to disrupt neuronal network activity in the primary motor cortex that directly influences locomotion behavior. The ACRs are well expressed and reliably suppressed activity with nano-watt light intensities. Additionally, raACR offers suppression of action potentials at a higher temporal resolution in comparison to MsACR1.</p>

<title>Characterization of metagenomically identified ACRs</title>
<p>The opsin candidates chosen for expression represent multiple ChR subfamilies, some coming from previously unexplored clades: MsACR1 from the mamiellophycean green alga <italic>Mantoniella squamata</italic> and a member of the prasinophyte ACR family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Rozenberg et al., 2020</xref>); GpACR1, a protein from the heterotrophic cryptomonad <italic>Goniomonas pacifica</italic> unrelated to cryptophyte ACRs and instead putatively related to labyrinthulean ACRs; S16-ACR1, which we discovered in the single amplified genome (SAG) of the uncultured MAST3 stramenopile S16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Wideman et al., 2020</xref>), represents its own deeply-branching clade; TaraACR3, a haptophyte ACR of metagenomic origin; and TaraACR1 and TaraACR2, two related ChR sequences coming from giant viruses (see Supplementary Discussion) and forming a separate ChR subfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Govorunova et al., 2021</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">S1</xref>).</p>

<p>We expressed the opsin domains of the identified putative ChRs in ND7/23 cells to test for electrical activity by voltage-clamp electrophysiology in whole-cell mode. We determined the wavelength sensitivity, photocurrent amplitudes, kinetics, and ion selectivity. All constructs showed bidirectional photocurrents upon illumination with high-intensity light, typical for ChRs. However, while MsACR1, TaraACR1, and TaraACR2 showed no or only little photocurrent reduction under continuous illumination (photocurrent inactivation), TaraACR3, S16-ACR1, and GpACR1 showed considerable inactivation. In particular, S16-ACR1 photocurrents showed almost complete inactivation similar to some previously described ACRs and CCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Oppermann et al., 2019</xref>, p. 201; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sineshchekov et al., 2020</xref>). This effect was more pronounced at positive holding potentials. GpACR1 photocurrents, on the other hand, elicited a secondary peak photocurrent upon light-off (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>) indicative of photointermediate inactivation during illumination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Berndt et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Most of the tested ChRs showed a <italic>λ</italic><sub>max</sub> between 470 nm and 510 nm, while MsACR1 exhibited a considerable redshifted <italic>λ</italic><sub>max</sub> at 555 nm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B, C</xref>, and <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">S3A</xref>). Its action spectrum further shows a small secondary peak at 460 nm (Fig. S3A), most likely caused by energy transfer from the fused fluorophore mCerulean3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Markwardt et al., 2011</xref>), as previously shown for RubyACRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Govorunova et al., 2020</xref>). At -60 mV holding potential, photocurrent amplitudes of up to 10 nA were elicited (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>), decaying with an off-kinetic (τ<sub>off</sub>) between 3 ms (TaraACR2) and 400 ms (GpACR1) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). The light sensitivity was proportional to τ<sub>off</sub>. TaraACR3, GpACR1, and MsACR1, with slow off-kinetics, had a high light sensitivity with half-maximal activation at 20 to 40 μW/mm<sup>2</sup>. In contrast, TaraACR2 and S16-ACR1 photocurrents did not saturate at light intensities up to 4 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>, demonstrating a low light sensitivity (Fig. S3B and C).</p>
<p>To determine the ion selectivity of the ChRs, either the external Cl<sup>-</sup> ([Cl<sup>-</sup>]<sub>ex</sub>) was replaced with Asp<sup>-</sup> or the external Na<sup>+</sup> ([Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>ex</sub>) with NMDG<sup>+</sup>. Only the replacement of [Cl<sup>-</sup>]<sub>ex</sub>, but not [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>ex</sub>, resulted in photocurrent changes and a strong shift in the reversal potential (<italic>E</italic><sub>rev</sub>) close to the Nernst potential (<italic>E</italic><sub>Nernst</sub>) of Cl<sup>-</sup> (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3D-F</xref>). Therefore, all tested ChRs are ACRs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Single-residue mutations affect the spectral sensitivity of MsACR1</title>
<p>The strong activation with yellow-green light prompted us to explore the applicability of MsACR1 as an optogenetic silencer. Therefore, to further shift its sensitivity to the red, we tested several point mutations. Generally, a redshift can be achieved by either increasing the polarity close to the β-ionone ring of the retinal chromophore or reducing the polarity in the proximity of the retinal Schiff base (RSB).</p>
<p>First, we tested mutations in the vicinity of the β-ionone ring (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The exchange of the conserved Proline in this region (HsBR P186; see <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref> for an alignment) generally causes strong blue-shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lu et al., 2001</xref>). However, the converse G186P mutation in MsACR1 also blue-shifts the activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>), as do all other tested replacements (G186C, G186H, G186T), with a strong amplitude reduction in the case of G186H (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Other tested replacements close to the β-ionone ring either did not affect <italic>λ</italic><sub>max</sub> or resulted in hypsochromic shifts, including mutations mirroring residues unique to the recently described RubyACRs: W142Y, W182Q, and G186I (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Govorunova et al., 2020</xref>). The only exception was F138N, which showed a small redshift (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) but also strongly decelerated τ<sub>off</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we focused on the active site close to the retinal Schiff base (RSB). Replacing F185, a residue oriented towards the putative counterion D215 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), with a Tyrosine (F185Y) also resulted in a blue-shifted <italic>λ</italic><sub>max</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) and strongly decelerated τ<sub>off</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). Substitution of T87 with Alanine led to a minor redshift (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) but decreased photocurrent amplitudes and decelerated τ<sub>off</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Oda et al., 2018</xref>). Introduction of Valine or Serine (T87V and T87S) did not affect the spectral sensitivity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>Previously, in Chrimson, the residue A298 next to the retinal-binding Lysine was associated with the redshifted absorption of this ChR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Oda et al., 2018</xref>). In MsACR1, the homologous residue is S218. Replacing it with an Alanine (MsACR1-S218A) accelerated τ<sub>off</sub> 5-fold (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>) and shifted <italic>λ</italic><sub>max</sub> 20 nm towards longer wavelengths (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> and <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">S4A</xref>). Consequently, the half-maximal activity on the red side of the spectrum also shifted from 605 nm to 635 nm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Additionally, this mutation increased the photocurrent amplitude at 690 nm two-fold in comparison with the wild-type. Comparatively with GtACR1, the most commonly used ACR for optogenetic application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Mahn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Needham et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tsunoda et al., 2017</xref>), MsACR1-S218A exhibits a 19-fold larger photocurrent at 690 nm (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4B</xref>). Due to these advantageous properties to existing ACRs, we coined the mutant raACR for “<underline>r</underline>ed and <underline>a</underline>ccelerated <underline>A</underline>CR”.</p>

<p>Next, we explored neuronal applications of both MsACR1 and raACR in an <italic>in vitro</italic> neuronal preparation. We then transduced dissociated hippocampal neurons with adeno-associated viruses carrying the ACRs under the control of a pan-neuronal human Synapsin I (hSyn1) promoter. After ten days, membrane-localized fluorescence was visible in somatic, axonal, and dendritic compartments without apparent intracellular or vesicular aggregation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>).</p>

<p>Current-evoked spiking was strongly suppressed in single neurons at intensities &gt;200 nW/mm<sup>2</sup> using 550 nm light. Excitation of MsACR1 at just 5 nW/mm<sup>2</sup> light decreased the spiking probability already by 25% for the slower wild-type MsACR1. At light intensities between 100 and 7100 nW/mm<sup>2</sup>, evoked activity was further reduced to 30-90% for both ACRs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). To quantify the shunting efficiency at different illumination protocols, we either applied 550 nm or 635 nm light continuously or pulsed at 10 Hz (2-ms pulse width) during a current-ramp injection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tsunoda et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, the pulsed illumination reduced the photon exposure 50-fold in comparison to continuous illumination. MsACR1 and raACR both completely silenced spiking during continuous illumination (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). However, at the illumination-pulse on-set, we observed a light-evoked spike (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). This has been similarly described for other ACRs and arises in axonal compartments with a higher intracellular chloride concentration in comparison to the soma, triggering initial chloride efflux upon ACR-activation that leads to a short depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Mahn et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>To avoid misinterpretations arising from an on-set spike during <italic>in-vivo</italic> optogenetic experiments, we designed and tested soma-targeted (st) versions of MsACR1 and raACR. Therefore, we fused a short targeting sequence from the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv2.1 to the N-terminus of the ACRs. We determined the on-set spike probability for st-MsACR1 and st-raACR under continuous and pulsed illumination with 550 nm. The latter significantly reduced the on-set spike probability for both versions (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5C</xref>). Furthermore, in comparison to their untargeted versions, st-raACR showed a significantly reduced on-set spike probability, while st-MsACR1 showed a trend of a reduced on-set spike probability (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5D</xref>). MsACR1 and st-MsACR1 also nearly completely shunt all spikes during pulsed illumination independent of the light color. Activation of raACR, or its somat-targeted version, significantly reduced the number of spikes under all conditions but with a lower potency compared to MsACR1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref> and <xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">S5B</xref>), likely due to the reduced ion flux in a single photocycle.</p>
<p>We further assessed the minimum duration required to re-evoke a current-induced spike after optically suppressing a preceding action potential (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). raACR allows spike-triggering with a 50% spiking frequency already 50 ms after optical silencing, whereas upon activation of MsACR1, a 50% spiking frequency was reached only 180 ms post-shunting (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate the efficiency of MsACR1 and raACR <italic>in vivo</italic>, we assessed how transient neuronal network disruption in the primary motor cortex (M1) translates into locomotion impairments. As such, we injected viral particles of the ACRs into the M1 of wild-type C57BL/6 mice and implanted a 200-μm optical fiber above the injection site (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>).</p>

<p>Both ACRs exhibit homogenous expression in cortical neurons without visible intracellular aggregates or cell death (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Two-second illumination bouts with 635-nm light pulsed at 20 Hz led to immediate locomotion arrest in all tested animals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">C</xref>).</p>
<p>We quantified these motor arrests by calculating the pixel movement of a body marker between two consecutive frames during periods without and with illumination (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). While activation of either ACR led to significantly reduced velocity, the effect was stronger for MsACR1 likely due to its longer lasting response in comparison to raACR (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite the rapidly evolving optogenetic toolbox that offers versatile possibilities to manipulate the electrical activity of excitable cells, highly-efficient red-light activatable tools are still sparse. We identified MsACR1 and tailored a red-light sensitive ACR with large photocurrent amplitudes and fast off-kinetics that we coined raACR. We further demonstrated its applicability and potency in several optogenetic experiments. We also showed that MsACR1 and raACR are highly light-sensitive and therefore allow for an efficient implementation of a 20-Hz pulsed illumination paradigm that drastically reduces the number of photons put into biological tissue.</p>
<p>Besides its availability as a useful optogenetic tool, the wild-type MsACR1 may also offer a venue for answering questions about algal phototaxis. Previously, we suggested that in motile prasinophytes, both ACRs and CCRs may cooperate to regulate motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Rozenberg et al., 2020</xref>). Recently, proton-conduction has been shown for CCR1 from <italic>Mantoniella squamata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Govorunova et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, <italic>M. squamata</italic> may be a suitable algae species to investigate the physiological function of proton- and chloride-carried photocurrents.</p>
<p>Furthermore, within the characterized set of ACRs are two of viral origin, TaraACR1 and TaraACR2. The growing number of viral rhodopsins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bratanov et al., 2019</xref>, p. 20; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Needham et al., 2019</xref>, p. 20; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Rozenberg et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Zabelskii et al., 2020</xref>) poses a question about their function during viral infection: Are they modifying the phototaxis of the host, or are the rhodopsins disrupting the membrane potential, leading to cell death? In comparison to other previously characterized viral ChRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Rozenberg et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Zabelskii et al., 2020</xref>), the two described here were well-expressed and showed large photocurrents. Also, TaraACR2 showed a very fast photocurrent off-kinetic comparable to ZipACR and RapACR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Govorunova et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">2017</xref>).</p>
<p>While the algal GpACR1 and S16-ACR1 are unsuitable for optogenetic applications due to their photocurrent amplitudes and kinetics, their photocurrents unravel interesting molecular features. GpACR1 photocurrents elicit a second peak upon light shut-off, a behavior seen before for the slow-cycling CrChR2 variant C128S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Berndt et al., 2009</xref>) or a viral ChR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Zabelskii et al., 2020</xref>). Its appearance may be caused by the photoisomerization of photocycle intermediates, as similarly described for ReaChR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Krause et al., 2017</xref>, p. 20). S16-ACR1, on the other hand, shows a strong voltage-dependent photocurrent inactivation similar to MerMAIDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Oppermann et al., 2019</xref>, p. 2) and may offer further insight into this process in general.</p>
<p>The action spectrum of MsACR1 shows its highest activity in yellow-green light but also a distinct blue-light peak. The latter is possibly caused by an energy transfer from the attached fluorophore to the rhodopsin. This was previously reported for RubyACRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Govorunova et al., 2020</xref>) and is further supported by the fact that this peak also appears and does not shift in the action spectrum of raACR, as it only decreases in amplitude (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4B</xref>).</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the majority of the substitutions in MsACR1 close to the β-ionone ring resulted in a blue shift, whereas only one mutation (F138N) caused a small redshift, suggesting that this region is already quite polar. In contrast, the active site around the RSB was more susceptible to modification, although the effect of MsACR1-T87A was less pronounced in comparison to Chrimson (ChrimsonSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Oda et al., 2018</xref>). However, upon replacing S218 with Alanine, the action spectrum was shifted by 20 nm towards longer wavelengths, mimicking several orange- or red-light absorbing ChRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Oda et al., 2018</xref>). Similar shifts have been achieved naturally and artificially in animal rhodopsins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Liénard et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Both MsACR1 and raACR reliably shunt spiking <italic>in vitro</italic> and induced motor arrest <italic>in vivo</italic> using 635 nm light. Shunting during continuous illumination was complete, though light-evoked on-set spikes observed for both ACRs were minimized with pulsed illumination and soma-targeting of MsACR1 and raACR. Presumably, longer photon exposure is required to evoke this spike, as previously evident for GtACR1 using 10-ms light pulses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Mahn et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, shorter or ramped-on light pulses can reduce the probability of such events. Overall, pulsed illumination, together with soma-targeting, is recommended for artifact-free <italic>in vivo</italic> optogenetic experiments.</p>
<p>Pulsed illumination was more efficient for MsACR1 due to its slower kinetics and accompanying increased ion flux per photocycle. On the other hand, the accelerated kinetics of raACR allows for a higher temporal resolution, enabling current-evoked spiking already 50 ms post-illumination. Also, in contrast to other ACRs commonly used as optogenetic silencers, both MsACR1 and raACR don’t show any photocurrent inactivation during continuous illumination and can be activated again virtually instantly without photocurrent decline. This makes them reliable in optogenetic applications. Furthermore, its redshift reduces potential cross-activation when used in conjunction with blue-light-sensitive optogenetic tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Vierock et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Lastly, MsACR1 and raACR exhibited an unprecedentedly high operational light sensitivity that inhibits neuronal activity at light intensities as low as 20 nW/mm<sup>2</sup>. Therefore, we believe that both ACRs are a valuable addition to the optogenetic toolbox when long-lasting inhibition of larger brain volumes is required.</p>

<p>One to two days after transfection, photocurrents were recorded using the patch-clamp method in whole-cell mode at room temperature. The whole-cell configuration was established at ≥1 GΩ membrane resistance, and cells were discarded at access resistance &gt;10 MΩ. Patch-pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (G150F-8P, Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) to resistances of 1.5 MΩ to 3 MΩ using a micropipette puller (P-1000, Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) and fire-polished. During measurements, a 140 mM NaCl agar bridge was used as the reference electrode. A 2 kHz Bessel filter was used for signal amplification (AxoPatch200B). Signals were digitized at 10 kHz (DigiData400) and acquired using Clampex 10.4 software (all Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). A Polychrom V (TILL Photonics, Planegg, Germany) with 7-nm bandwidth was used as the light source and coupled into an Axiovert 100 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The light delivery was controlled by a VS25 and VCM-D1 shutter system (Vincent Associates, Rochester, NY). Light intensities were adjusted manually for light titration experiments using neutral density filters. In recordings of action spectra a motorized filter wheel (Newport, Irvine, CA) was used to ensure delivery of equal photon densities. Light intensities in light titration experiments were measured in the sample plane using a P9710 optometer (Gigahertz Optik, Türkenfeld, Germany) and calculated for the illuminated field (0.066 mm<sup>2</sup>) of the W Plan-Apochromat x40/1.0 DIC objective (Carl Zeiss).</p>
<p>Measurements were always started in standard buffer (Extracellular (in mM): 110 NaCl, 1 KCl, 1 CsCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES; Intracellular (in mM): 110 NaCl, 1 KCl, 1 CsCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 10 EDTA). The pH was adjusted to 7 using N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG) or citric acid. The osmolarity was measured (Osmomat 3000basic, Gonotec, Berlin, Germany) and adjusted to 320 mOsm (extracellular) or 290 mOSM (intracellular) using glucose. For ion selectivity measurements, NaCl was replaced by 110 mM NaAsp or 110 mM NMDGCl extracellularly. The extracellular buffer was exchanged manually by adding at least 3 ml to the measuring chamber (volume ∼0.5 ml). Excess buffer was removed using a Ringer Bath Handler MPCU (Lorenz Messgerätebau, Katlenburg-Lindau, Germany).</p>
<p>Action spectra were recorded in standard conditions at -60 mV using illumination with low-intensity light applied for 10 ms. <italic>λ</italic><sub>max</sub> was determined by normalizing recorded action spectra to the respective maximum photocurrent and applying a Gauss function to the data trimmed between ±70 nm and ±90 nm from the maximum.

The liquid junction potential was calculated and corrected during measurements. Light titrations were recorded at -60 mV with light applied for 1 s. The activity of GtACR1, MsACR1, and raACR with green and red light was measured at -60 mV with optical filters (560±10 nm with 82% transmittance and 692±18 nm with 99% transmittance) inserted directly into the light path.</p>

<p>Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of the ACRs were carried out under visual control with a 12-bit monochrome CMOS camera (Hamamatsu Model OrcaFlash).

Neurons were held at -60 mV, and spiking was evoked with a ramp (600 pA injection; 500 ms) or rectangle protocol (pA injection considering the rheobase + 50 pA; 700 ms). The inhibition was tested by activating the ACRs using continuous (700 ms) and pulsed (10 Hz, 2 ms) light and two different wavelengths (550 nm and 635 nm). The pE-4000 (CoolLED, UK) was used for light stimulation, and the light intensities were measured using a PM100D console and an S130VC sensor (Thorlabs, US).</p>

<p>Viral origin of the environmental ChRs TaraACR1 and TaraACR2</p>
<p>The short metagenomic contigs SAMEA2622336_1814029 (1748 bp) and SAMEA2619952_516956 (1239 bp) encoding the ChRs TaraACR1 and TaraACR2, respectively, were initially suspected to be of viral origin due to lack of introns and short intergenic regions to the neighboring genes. The neighboring genes, a DUF285 protein (SAMEA2622336_1814029) and a short fragment of a gene for a Pif1 helicase (SAMEA2619952_516956), are from protein families widespread among, albeit not restricted to, giant viruses. More importantly, the promoter sequence of TaraACR1 contained the classical mimiviral early promoter motif AAAATTGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Suhre et al., 2005</xref>) characteristic to <italic>Imitervirales</italic> and some other giant viruses, while that of TaraACR2 contained its minor variation AAAAATGA prevalent e.g. in the genome of Aureococcus anophagefferens virus (<italic>Imitervirales</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Roitman et al., 2023</xref>). Finally, blastn searches against the GVMAGs database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Schulz et al., 2020</xref>) yielded genomes belonging to the <italic>Imitervirales</italic> containing highly similar nucleotide stretches (best hits to GVMAG-M-3300001348-7 [E-value 3.3×10<sup>-80</sup>, 72.5% nucleotide identity] and GVMAG-M-3300023184-101 [E-value 8.7×10<sup>-10</sup>, 90.2% identity, respectively, both belonging to the <italic>Mesomimiviridae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aylward et al., 2021</xref>)). Although, none of them contained the ChR genes themselves. TaraACR1 and TaraACR2 represent a second example of ChR acquisition by giant viruses, alongside prasinophyte ACRs in genomes of viruses closely related to Pyramimonas orientalis virus 01b (<italic>Imitervirales</italic> family IM_12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aylward et al., 2021</xref>)) and a putative <italic>Algavirales</italic> virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Rozenberg et al., 2020</xref>, p. 20). The appearance of ion-conducting rhodopsins encoded in genomes of giant algal viruses is not restricted to channelrhodopsins, as two unrelated cases of functional rhodopsin cation channels/pumps are known from the <italic>Mesomimiviridae</italic> (viral rhodopsins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bratanov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Zabelskii et al., 2020</xref>)) and the <italic>Coccolithoviridae</italic> (proton-conducting heliorhodopsins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hososhima et al., 2022</xref>)).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors of this manuscript characterize new anion conducting that is more red-shifted in its spectrum than prior variants called MsACR1. An additional mutant variant of MsACR1 that is renamed raACR has a 20 nm red-shifted spectral response with faster kinetics. Due to the spectral shift of these variants, the authors proposed that it is possible to inhibit the expression of MsACR1 and raACR with lights at 635 nm in vivo and in vitro. The authors were able to demonstrate some inhibition in vitro and in vivo with 635 nm light. Overall the new variants with unique properties should be able to suppress neuronal activities with red-shifted light stimulation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors were able to identify a new class of anion conducting channelrhodopsin and have variants that respond strongly to lights with wavelength &gt;550 nm. The authors were able to demonstrate this variant, MsACR1, can alter behavior in vivo with 635 nm light. The second major strength of the study is the development of a red-shifted mutant of MsACR1 that has faster kinetics and 20 nm red-shifted from a single mutation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The red-shifted raACR appears to work much less efficiently than MsACR1 even with 635 nm light illumination both in vivo (Figure 4) and in vitro (Figure 3E) despite the 20 nm red-shift. This is inconsistent with the benefits and effects of red-shifting the spectrum in raACR. This usually would suggest raACR either has a lower conductance than MsACR1 or that the membrane/overall expression of raACR is much weaker than MsACR1. Neither of these is measured in the current manuscript.</p>
<p>There are limited comparisons to existing variants of ACRs under the same conditions in the manuscript overall. There should be more parallel comparison with gtACR1, ZipACR, and RubyACR in identical conditions in cultured cell lines, cultured neurons, and in vivo. This should be in terms of overall performance, efficiency, and expression in identical conditions. Without this information, it is unclear whether the effects at 635 nm are due to the expression level which can compensate for the spectral shift.</p>
<p>There should be more raw traces from the recordings of the different variants in response to short pulse stimulation and long pulse stimulation to different wavelengths. It is difficult to judge what the response would be like when these types of information are missing.</p>
<p>Despite being able to activate the channelrhodopsin with 635 nm light, the main utility of the variant should be transcranial stimulation which was not demonstrated here.</p>
<p>Figure 3B is not clearly annotated and is difficult to match the explanation in the figure legend to the figure. The action potential spikings of neurons expressing raACR in this panel are inhibited as strongly as MsACR1.</p>
<p>For many characterizations, the number of 'n's are quite low (3-7).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors identified a new chloride-conducting Channelrhodopsin (MsACR1) that can be activated at low light intensities and within the red part of the visible spectrum. Additional engineering of MsACR1 yielded a variant (raACR1) with increased current amplitudes, accelerated kinetics, and a 20nm red-shifted peak excitation wavelength. Stimulation of MsACR1 and raACR1 expressing neurons with 635nm in mice's primary motor cortices inhibited the animals' locomotion.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The in vitro characterization of the newly identified ACRs is very detailed and confirms the biophysical properties as described by the authors. Notably, the ACRs are very light sensitive and allow for efficient in vitro inhibition of neurons in the nano Watt/mm^2 range. These new ACRs give neuroscientists and cell biologists a new tool to control chloride flux over biological membranes with high temporal and spatial precision. The red-shifted excitation peaks of these ACRs could allow for multiplexed application with blue-light excited optogenetic tools such as cation-conducting channelrhodopsins or green-fluorescent calcium indicators such as GCaMP.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The in-vivo characterization of MsACR1 and raACR1 lacks critical control experiments and is, therefore, too preliminary. The experimental conditions differ fundamentally between in vitro and in vivo characterizations. For example, chloride gradients differ within neurons which can weaken inhibition or even cause excitation at synapses, as pointed out by the authors. Notably, the patch pipettes for the in vitro characterization contained low chloride concentrations that might not reflect possible conditions found in the in vivo preparations, i.e., increasing chloride gradients from dendrites to synapses.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the authors used soma-targeted (st) MsACR1 and raACR1 for some of their in vitro characterization yielding more efficient inhibition and reduction of co-incidental &quot;on-set&quot; spiking. Still, the authors do not seem to have utilized st-variants in vivo.</p>
<p>Most importantly, critical in vivo control experiments, such as negative controls like GFP or positive controls like NpHR, are missing. These controls would exclude potential behavioral effects due to experimental artifacts. Moreover, in vivo electrophysiology could have confirmed whether targeted neurons were inhibited under optogenetic stimulations.</p>
<p>Some of these concerns stem from the fact that the pulsed raACR stimulation at 635 nm at 10Hz (Fig. 3E) was far less efficient compared to MsACR1, yet the in vivo comparison yielded very similar results (Fig. 4D).</p>
<p>Also, the cortex is highly heterogeneous and comprises excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Using the synapsin promoter, the viral expression paradigm could target both types and cause differential effects, which has not been investigated further, for example, by immunohistochemistry. An alternative expression system, for example, under VGLUT1 control, could have mitigated some of these concerns.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the authors applied different light intensities, wavelengths, and stimulation frequencies during the in vitro characterization, causing varying spike inhibition efficiencies. The in vivo characterization is notably lacking this type of control. Thus, it is unclear why the 635nm, 2s at 20Hz every 5s stimulation protocol, which has no equivalent in the in vitro characterization, was chosen.</p>
<p>In summary, the in vivo experiments did not confirm whether the observed inhibition of mouse locomotion occurred due to the inhibition of neurons or experimental artifacts.</p>
<p>In addition, the author's main claim of more efficient neuronal inhibition would require them to threshold MsACR1 and raACR1 against alternative methods such as the red-shifted NpHR variant Jaws or other ACRs to give readers meaningful guidance when choosing an inhibitory tool.</p>
<p>The light sensitivity of MsACR1 and raACR1 are impressive and well characterized in vitro. However, the authors only reported the overall light output at the fiber tip for the in vivo experiments: 0.5 mW. Without context, it is difficult to evaluate this value. Calculating the light power density at certain distances from the light fiber or thresholding against alternative tools such as NpHR, Jaws, or other ACRs would allow for a more meaningful evaluation.</p>

<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors were able to identify a new class of anion conducting channelrhodopsin and have variants that respond strongly to lights with wavelength &gt;550 nm. The authors were able to demonstrate this variant, MsACR1, can alter behavior in vivo with 635 nm light. The second major strength of the study is the development of a red-shifted mutant of MsACR1 that has faster kinetics and 20 nm red-shifted from a single mutation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The red-shifted raACR appears to work much less efficiently than MsACR1 even with 635 nm light illumination both in vivo (Figure 4) and in vitro (Figure 3E) despite the 20 nm red-shift. This is inconsistent with the benefits and effects of red-shifting the spectrum in raACR. This usually would suggest raACR either has a lower conductance than MsACR1 or that the membrane/overall expression of raACR is much weaker than MsACR1. Neither of these is measured in the current manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for addressing this crucial issue. We posit that the diminished efficiency of raACR in comparison to MsACR1 WT can be attributed to the tenfold acceleration of its photocycle. As noted by Reviewer 1, the anticipated advantages associated with a red-shifted opsin, particularly in in vivo preparations, are offset by its accelerated off-kinetics. Consequently, the shorter dwell time of the open state leads to a reduced number of conducted ions per photon. Nevertheless, the operational light sensitivity is not drastically altered compared to MsACR WT (Fig. 3C). We believe that the rapid kinetics offer interesting applications, such as the precise inhibition of single action potentials through holography.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>There are limited comparisons to existing variants of ACRs under the same conditions in the manuscript overall. There should be more parallel comparison with gtACR1, ZipACR, and RubyACR in identical conditions in cultured cell lines, cultured neurons, and in vivo. This should be in terms of overall performance, efficiency, and expression in identical conditions. Without this information, it is unclear whether the effects at 635 nm are due to the expression level which can compensate for the spectral shift.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We compared MsACR1 and raACR with GtACR1 in ND cells in supplemental figure 4. We concur that further comparisons could be useful to emphasise both the strengths of MsACRs and applications where they may not be as suitable. We are currently in the process of outlining a separate article. We firmly believe that each ACR variant occupies a distinct application niche, which necessitates a more comprehensive electrophysiological comparison to provide valuable insights to the scientific community.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>There should be more raw traces from the recordings of the different variants in response to short pulse stimulation and long pulse stimulation to different wavelengths. It is difficult to judge what the response would be like when these types of information are missing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate Reviewer 1's feedback and have compiled a collection of raw photoresponses, encompassing various pulse widths and wavelengths, which can be found in the Supplementary materials (Supplementary Figures 4 and 5).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Despite being able to activate the channelrhodopsin with 635 nm light, the main utility of the variant should be transcranial stimulation which was not demonstrated here.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We concur with Reviewer 1's assessment that MsACR prime application is indeed transcranial stimulation. However, it's worth emphasising that the full advantages of transcranial optical stimulation become most apparent when animals are truly freely moving without any tethered patch cords. Our ongoing research in the laboratory is dedicated to the development of a wireless LED system that can be securely affixed to the animal's skull. We aim to demonstrate the potential of these novell optogenetic approaches in the field of behavioural neuroscience in the coming year.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 3B is not clearly annotated and is difficult to match the explanation in the figure legend to the figure. The action potential spikings of neurons expressing raACR in this panel are inhibited as strongly as MsACR1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have enhanced the figure caption and annotations for clarity. The traces presented in Figure 3B are intended to demonstrate the overall effectiveness of each variant. However, it is in the population data analysis, as depicted in Figure 3E, where the meaningful insights are revealed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For many characterizations, the number of 'n's are quite low (3-7).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge Reviewer 1's suggestion regarding the in vivo data and agree with the importance of including more animals, as well as control animals. However, we are committed to adhering to the principles of the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction, Refinement) in animal research, and given the robustness of our observed effects, we will add animals to reach the minimal number of animals per condition (n = 2) to minimise unnecessary animal usage while ensuring statistical power.
We will continue to adhere to the established standards in the field, aiming for a range of 3 to 7 cells per condition, sourced from at least two independent preparations, to ensure the robustness and reliability of our in vitro data.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors identified a new chloride-conducting Channelrhodopsin (MsACR1) that can be activated at low light intensities and within the red part of the visible spectrum. Additional engineering of MsACR1 yielded a variant (raACR1) with increased current amplitudes, accelerated kinetics, and a 20nm red-shifted peak excitation wavelength. Stimulation of MsACR1 and raACR1 expressing neurons with 635nm in mice's primary motor cortices inhibited the animals' locomotion.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The in vitro characterization of the newly identified ACRs is very detailed and confirms the biophysical properties as described by the authors. Notably, the ACRs are very light sensitive and allow for efficient in vitro inhibition of neurons in the nano Watt/mm^2 range. These new ACRs give neuroscientists and cell biologists a new tool to control chloride flux over biological membranes with high temporal and spatial precision. The red-shifted excitation peaks of these ACRs could allow for multiplexed application with blue-light excited optogenetic tools such as cation-conducting channelrhodopsins or green-fluorescent calcium indicators such as GCaMP.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The in-vivo characterization of MsACR1 and raACR1 lacks critical control experiments and is, therefore, too preliminary. The experimental conditions differ fundamentally between in vitro and in vivo characterizations. For example, chloride gradients differ within neurons which can weaken inhibition or even cause excitation at synapses, as pointed out by the authors. Notably, the patch pipettes for the in vitro characterization contained low chloride concentrations that might not reflect possible conditions found in the in vivo preparations, i.e., increasing chloride gradients from dendrites to synapses.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate Reviewer 2’s feedback regarding missing control experiments. We will respond to these concerns in another section of our manuscript, as suggested.
Regarding the chloride gradient, we understand the concerns of Reviewer 2, yet we chose these ionic conditions, particularly as they were used in the initial electrical characterization of GtACR1 in a neuronal context (Mahn et al., 2016). We will make sure to provide this context in our manuscript to justify our choice of ionic conditions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Interestingly, the authors used soma-targeted (st) MsACR1 and raACR1 for some of their in vitro characterization yielding more efficient inhibition and reduction of co-incidental &quot;on-set&quot; spiking. Still, the authors do not seem to have utilized st-variants in vivo.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>At the time of submission, due to the long-term absence of our lab technician, we were not able to produce purified viruses. Therefore, we decided to move on with the submission. We now produced the virus externally, and will provide the experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Most importantly, critical in vivo control experiments, such as negative controls like GFP or positive controls like NpHR, are missing. These controls would exclude potential behavioral effects due to experimental artifacts. Moreover, in vivo electrophysiology could have confirmed whether targeted neurons were inhibited under optogenetic stimulations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have several non-injected control animals that we used to calibrate this particular paradigm and never saw similar responses. However, we acknowledge the suggestion of Reviewer 2 and will include the GFP-injected control as recommended.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Some of these concerns stem from the fact that the pulsed raACR stimulation at 635 nm at 10Hz (Fig. 3E) was far less efficient compared to MsACR1, yet the in vivo comparison yielded very similar results (Fig. 4D).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As outlined previously, the accelerated photocycle of raACR results in a reduction in photocurrent amplitude, consequently diminishing the potency of inhibition per photon. In the context of in vitro stimulation, where single action potentials are recorded, this reduction in inhibition efficiency is resolved. However, in the realm of in vivo behavioural analysis, the observed effect is not contingent on single action potentials but rather stems from the disruption of the entire M1 motor network. In this context, despite the reduced efficiency of the fast-cycling raACR, it still manages to interrupt the M1 network, leading to similar behavioural outcomes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Also, the cortex is highly heterogeneous and comprises excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Using the synapsin promoter, the viral expression paradigm could target both types and cause differential effects, which has not been investigated further, for example, by immunohistochemistry. An alternative expression system, for example, under VGLUT1 control, could have mitigated some of these concerns.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, we acknowledge the limitations of our current experimental approach. We are in the process of planning and conducting additional experiments involving cre-dependent expression of st-MSACR and st-raACR in PV-Cre mice.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Furthermore, the authors applied different light intensities, wavelengths, and stimulation frequencies during the in vitro characterization, causing varying spike inhibition efficiencies. The in vivo characterization is notably lacking this type of control. Thus, it is unclear why the 635nm, 2s at 20Hz every 5s stimulation protocol, which has no equivalent in the in vitro characterization, was chosen.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the valuable comment from the reviewer. The objective of our in vitro characterization is to elucidate the general effects of specific stimulation parameters on the efficiency of neuronal inhibition. For instance, we aim to demonstrate that lower light intensities result in less efficient inhibition, or that pulse stimulation may lead to a less complete inhibition, albeit significantly reducing the energy input into the system.</p>
<p>In the in vivo characterization, we face constraints such as animal welfare considerations and limitations in available laser lines, which prevent us from exploring the entire parameter space as comprehensively as in the in vitro preparation. Additionally, it is important to note that membrane capacitance tends to be higher in vivo compared to dissociated hippocampal neurons. Consequently, we have opted for a doubled stimulation frequency from 10 Hz to 20 Hz and the stimulation pattern of 2 seconds ”on” and 5 seconds “off”. This approach allows the animals to spend less time in an arrested state while still demonstrating the effect of MsACR and variants.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In summary, the in vivo experiments did not confirm whether the observed inhibition of mouse locomotion occurred due to the inhibition of neurons or experimental artifacts.</p>
<p>In addition, the author's main claim of more efficient neuronal inhibition would require them to threshold MsACR1 and raACR1 against alternative methods such as the red-shifted NpHR variant Jaws or other ACRs to give readers meaningful guidance when choosing an inhibitory tool.</p>
<p>The light sensitivity of MsACR1 and raACR1 are impressive and well characterized in vitro. However, the authors only reported the overall light output at the fiber tip for the in vivo experiments: 0.5 mW. Without context, it is difficult to evaluate this value. Calculating the light power density at certain distances from the light fiber or thresholding against alternative tools such as NpHR, Jaws, or other ACRs would allow for a more meaningful evaluation.</p>
