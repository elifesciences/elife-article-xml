<title>Abstract</title><p>Kainate receptors are key modulators of synaptic transmission and plasticity in the central nervous system. Different kainate receptor isoforms with distinct spatiotemporal expressions have been identified in the brain. The GluK1-1 splice variant receptors, which are abundant in the adult brain, have an extra fifteen amino acids inserted in the amino-terminal domain (ATD) of the receptor resulting from alternative splicing of exon 9. However, the functional implications of this post-transcriptional modification are not yet clear. We employed a multi-pronged approach using cryogenic electron microscopy, electrophysiology, and other biophysical and biochemical tools to understand the structural and functional impact of this splice insert in the extracellular domain of GluK1 receptors. Our study reveals that the splice insert alters the key gating properties of GluK1 receptors and their modulation by the cognate auxiliary Neuropilin and tolloid-like (Neto) proteins 1 and 2. Mutational analysis identified the role of crucial splice residues that influence receptor properties and their modulation. Furthermore, the cryoEM structure of the variant shows that the presence of exon 9 in GluK1 does not affect the receptor architecture or domain arrangement in the desensitized state. Our study thus provides the first detailed structural and functional characterization of GluK1-1a receptors, highlighting the role of the splice insert in modulating receptor properties and their modulation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Kainate receptors (KARs), a subfamily of ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs), are required in the vertebrate brain for postsynaptic neurotransmission and presynaptic regulation of transmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Erreger et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Huettner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lerma, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pinheiro and Mulle, 2006</xref>). They are known to mediate characteristic small-amplitude excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSC) with slow kinetics in the hippocampal regions of the central nervous system compared to their counterparts, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Castillo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lerma et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Traynelis et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, they play a vital role in the maturation of neuronal circuits during development by interacting with G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lerma, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lerma and Marques, 2013</xref>). Any functional defect predisposes the brain to various disorders, such as autism, epilepsy, schizophrenia, and neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lerma and Marques, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bowie, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Valbuena and Lerma, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Kainate receptors are composed of subunits from two gene families: low kainate affinity and high kainate affinity. The first gene family includes GluK1-GluK3, which can form both homomeric and heteromeric receptors with subunits from the same family or from the high-kainate affinity family. On the other hand, GluK4-GluK5 are high-affinity subunits that must assemble with low-affinity subunits to create functional receptors. The assembly of different subunits results in the formation of various receptor configurations, which contribute to the wide range of functional properties observed in kainate receptors.</p>
<p>The functional repertoire of kainate receptors is further enhanced by RNA editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barbon and Barlati, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Seeburg, 2002</xref>) and alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jaskolski et al., 2004</xref>). In particular, GluK1-containing KARs mainly present in the hippocampus, cortical interneurons, Purkinje cells, and sensory neurons undergo alternative splicing and RNA editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bernard and Khrestchatisky, 1994</xref>). Alternative splicing of the C-terminal domain that produces four isoforms, GluK1-a (shortest C-terminal), GluK1-b, GluK1-c, and GluK1-d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bettler et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gregor et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pinheiro and Mulle, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sommer et al., 1992</xref>) has been studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ren et al., 2003</xref>). However, the functional impact of the mRNA splicing of the N-terminal domain (exon 9) resulting in isoforms GluK1-1 and GluK1-2, with GluK1-1 containing an additional 15 amino acids in the amino-terminal domain (ATD) is not understood. Interestingly, the splice junctions for GluK1-1 were reported to be more frequent than those for GluK1-2, and both variants showed similar expression in different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Herbrechter et al., 2021</xref>). This 15-amino acid insertion in the amino-terminal domain (ATD) is exclusive to the GluK1 subunit and may impart unique properties to KARs containing this variant. Therefore, investigations of functional differences between GluK1 receptors with and without the 15 amino acid splice insert are necessary but missing in the field. Furthermore, the impact of the N-terminal splice insert in GluK1-1 receptors on its modulation by cognate auxiliary subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fisher, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">He et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Sheng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Vinnakota et al., 2021</xref>), neuropilin and tolloid-like (Neto) proteins is also unknown.</p>
<p>Therefore, we conducted structure-function studies to understand the mechanisms of GluK1-1a receptor function and the effects of the ATD splice on receptor assembly, stability, and modulation by Neto proteins. Whole-cell and excised outside-out patch-clamp-based functional assays were performed to investigate the differences between the ATD splice variants GluK1-1a (exon 9) and GluK1-2a (lacking exon 9) and their modulation by Neto proteins. Furthermore, mutational analysis was performed to identify important splice residues that affect receptor functions and their modulation by Neto proteins. Additionally, we expressed and purified rat GluK1-1a from HEK293 GnTI-cells and determined the single-particle cryo-EM structures of the receptors trapped in the desensitized state to understand the effect of splice on receptor architecture.</p>

<title>Spatiotemporal expression pattern of GluK1-1 in the brain</title>
<p>Kainate receptor subunits are differentially and spatially regulated in vertebrates. We analyzed publicly available human transcriptomics data to determine whether the exon encoding the GluK1 ATD splice (exon 9) was differentially expressed in the human brain. RNASeq data analysis of <italic>GRIK1</italic> (Ensembl ID: ENSG00000171189) collected from the BrainSpan ATLAS indicated that exon 9 is present in multiple brain areas that also show prominent GluK1 expression. GRIK1 exon 9 expression varies significantly across brain regions and developmental stages, with dynamic patterns indicating its crucial role in brain development. High expression is noted during critical periods such as early embryonic, postnatal, and childhood stages, particularly in regions like the ventricular zone (VZ), cortical plate (CP), hippocampus (HIP), amygdala (AMY), striatum (STR), and caudate nucleus (CN) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref><bold><italic>; Figure 1-figure supplement 1</italic></bold>). These patterns suggest GRIK1 exon 9’s importance in the functional maturation of these brain regions. For example, in the cerebellar cortex, GRIK1 exon 9 expression peaks during early development and childhood and stabilizes into adulthood, underscoring its role in cortical development and function. <bold>(<italic>Figure 1-figure supplement 1</italic>)</bold>. The significant variability in exon 9 expression across different brain regions, along with its potential role in brain development and functional maturation, motivated us to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms. This prompted us to perform a detailed structure-function analysis of the GluK1-1a splice variant.</p>

<title>The ATD splice imparts functional diversity to GluK1 receptors</title>
<p>Previous studies on functional analysis of GluK1 receptors have primarily focused on GluK1-2 isoform that lacks the ATD splice insert. Therefore, we conducted an extensive electrophysiological investigation to assay the functional differences between GluK1-1a and GluK1-2a. The only difference between these two variants is the presence of 15 amino acids (KASGEVSKHLYKVWK) insertion in the R2 subdomain (lower lobe) of the GluK1-1a ATD. We evaluated multiple gating properties of the two variants by whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology. Interestingly, we observed that GluK1-1a receptors desensitize significantly slowly when compared to GluK1-2a (Ʈ<sub>Des</sub>, GluK1-1a: 5.21 ± 0.50 ms; GluK1-2a: 3.55 ± 0.23 ms **P=0.0092) on prolonged treatment with 10 mM glutamate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table"><italic>Table 1</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>. We also tested receptor desensitization by applying saturating concentrations of kainate (1mM). Since the receptors displayed prolonged desensitizing kainate currents, instead of the rate (Ʈ<sub>Des</sub>), we calculated the % desensitization values at 1 s for comparison. We observed that the % desensitization with kainate was distinct for both ATD splice variants with significantly slower desensitization in the variant with the splice insert (GluK1-1a: 72.06 ± 2.33 %, GluK1-2a: 93.2 ± 0.55 ***P=0.0006) consistent with the glutamate evoked currents (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table"><italic>Table 1</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>.</p>

<p>Next, we evaluated glutamate sensitivity for the two variants. Dose-response experiments (glutamate, GluK1-1a: 0.1-2 mM, and GluK1-2a: 0.01-3 mM) showed a significantly lower potency of glutamate for GluK1-1a variant compared to the non-spliced form (EC<sub>50</sub> glutamate, GluK1-1a: 379.3 ± 52 µM, GluK1-2a: 187.7 ± 33 µM *P=0.0129 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table"><italic>Table 1</italic></xref>). However, for high-affinity agonist kainate, the dose-response curves for both variants were similar, likely indicating differences in the stability of glutamate <italic>versus</italic> the kainate-bound states in GluK1-1a and GluK1-2a <bold><italic>(</italic></bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref><bold><italic>; Figure 2-figure supplement 1</italic></bold>). Thus, the potency of kainate (1mM) <italic>versus</italic> glutamate (10 mM) (I<sub>K</sub>/I<sub>G</sub> ratio) is significantly higher for GluK1-1a compared to GluK1-2a (GluK1-1a: 1.51 ± 0.13, GluK1-2a: 0.56 ± 0.4 ****P&lt; 0.0001) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table"><italic>Table 1</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>.</p>
<p>Further, we investigated the voltage-dependent endogenous polyamine block and found significant differences between the two variants. The presence of splice residues seemed to enhance outward currents at positive potentials in GluK1-1a compared to GluK1-2a (rectification index, +90mV /-90 mV; GluK1-1a = 0.96 ± 0.11; GluK1-2a = 0.61 ± 0.10 *P=0.0385) without affecting the reversal potential (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table"><italic>Table 1</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>. How splice residues situated ∼92 Å away from the TM domain affect the pore properties is unclear. This property is mainly affected by the TM2 region of the KAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bowie and Mayer, 1995</xref>). However, a recent report in which the ATD of GluK2 was deleted showed enhanced rectification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Splice residues likely alter pore structure by allosteric mechanisms that have yet to be identified, thereby affecting rectification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Perrais et al., 2009</xref>). We also performed outside-out patch recordings to examine GluK1-1a receptors. However, we observed extremely weak electrical currents with low amplitudes when GluK1-1a was expressed in isolation. Consequently, the data we obtained from these recordings did not provide reliable results for curve fitting or thorough analysis.</p>

<title>ATD splice insert impacts GluK1 receptor modulation by Neto proteins</title>
<p>Neto 1 and Neto 2 proteins significantly influence the surface expression, synaptic localization, and functional properties of the GluK1-2a receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Copits et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Palacios-Filardo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Sheng et al., 2015</xref>). It has been demonstrated that desensitization of GluK1-2a is accelerated by Neto1 but delayed by Neto2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Sheng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Copits et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Palacios-Filardo et al., 2016</xref>). Hence, to understand the influence of these KAR auxiliary proteins on GluK1-1a, we performed an electrophysiological analysis of GluK1-1a and GluK1-2a receptors co-expressed with either Neto1 or Neto2. Co-expression of Neto1 hastened desensitization of GluK1-1a significantly but not of GluK1-2a at saturating glutamate concentrations (Ʈ<sub>Des</sub>, GluK1-1a +Neto1: 3.56 ± 0.22 ms **P=0.0090; GluK1-2a +Neto1: 4.32 ± 0.34 P=0.1495). On the other hand, Neto2 led to a ∼ 13.4-fold decrease in the desensitization rate of GluK1-1a (Ʈ<sub>Des</sub>, GluK1-1a: 5.21 ± 0.50 ms, +Neto2: 69.62 ± 9.98 ms **P=0.0024) while the desensitization rate of GluK1-2a was decreased only by ∼ 6.1-fold (Ʈ<sub>Des</sub>, GluK1-2a: 3.55 ± 0.23 ms, +Neto2: 21.68 ± 2.64 ms **P=0.0017). Thus, while Neto1 accelerated the desensitization of GluK1-1a, Neto2 significantly slowed it at saturating glutamate concentrations. The rate of desensitization for GluK1-1a was approximately 3.2 times slower compared to GluK1-2a (***P=0.0009) when coexpressed with Neto2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table"><italic>Table 1</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>. Thus, the presence of splice insert leads to differential modulation of GluK1 desensitization by Neto proteins.</p>

<p>Moreover, Neto1 also enhanced the recovery from desensitization for both the variants (Ʈ<sub>Recovery</sub>, GluK1-1a: 3.53 ± 0.81 s, +Neto1: 0.68 ± 0.07 s *P=0.0390; GluK1-2a: 5.31 ± 0.50 s +Neto1: 1.15 ± 0.12 s ***P=0.0002). GluK1-1a recovers ∼ 1.7 times faster than GluK1-2a (*P=0.0125) when co-expressed with Neto1. Neto 2, on the other hand, slowed recovery for both variants to a similar extent (Ʈ<sub>Recovery</sub>, GluK1-1a: 3.53 ± 0.81 s, +Neto2: 8.32 ± 0.81 s **P=0.0044; GluK1-2a: 5.31 ± 0.50 s, +Neto2: 7.91 ± 0.71 s *P=0.0430) and did not show differential modulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table"><italic>Table 1</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>. In addition, both Neto1 and Neto2 increased the potency of glutamate for GluK1-1a by 9.7-fold (39 ± 10 µM) and 11.2-fold (34 ± 8 µM), respectively <bold><italic>(</italic></bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref><bold><italic>; Figure 3-figure supplement 1A</italic></bold>). This is similar to the effect observed in GluK1-2a receptors whereby the glutamate EC<sub>50</sub> was shown to increase by Neto proteins [Neto1: 34-fold and Neto2: 7.5-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Palacios-Filardo et al., 2016</xref>) and Neto1/2: 30-10X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fisher, 2015</xref>)].</p>
<p>Since we observed a significant increase in the I<sub>K</sub>/I<sub>G</sub> ratios in GluK1 due to the presence of splice insert, we next aimed to determine the influence of co-expressing Neto proteins on this parameter. Interestingly, while Neto 1 and Neto2 reduced the I<sub>K</sub>/I<sub>G</sub> ratios in GluK1-1a (GluK1-1a: 1.51 ± 0.13, +Neto1: 1.25 ± 0.04 P=0.1500, +Neto2: 1.0 ± 0.07 **P=0.0090), they increased it for the non-spliced variant (GluK1-2a: 0.56 ± 0.04, +Neto1: 1.37 ± 0.12 ****P&lt;0.0001, +Neto2: 1.16 ± 0.04 ****P&lt;0.0001) <bold><italic>(</italic></bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref><bold><italic>; Figure 3-figure supplement 1B;</italic></bold> <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table"><italic>Table 1</italic></xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>) highlighting the effect of splice residues. Interestingly, this differential modulation of the two variants by Neto proteins resulted in comparable I<sub>K</sub>/I<sub>G</sub> ratios.</p>
<p>Next, we investigated the effects of Neto1 and Neto2 on the voltage-dependent endogenous polyamine block since the presence of splice insert had enhanced the outward rectification of GluK1. We observed that both Neto1 and Neto2 significantly enhanced the outward rectification of GluK1-2a (GluK1-2a: 0.61 ± 0.10, +Neto1: 1.14 ± 0.14 *P=0.0338, +Neto2: 1.37 ± 0.10 **P= 0.0022). However, they did not significantly increase it for GluK1-1a (GluK1-1a: 0.96 ± 0.11, +Neto1: 1.16 ± 0.09 P=0.1880, +Neto2: 0.80 ± 0.05 P=0.2401) and did not show differential modulation <bold><italic>(</italic></bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref><bold><italic> &amp; 3F;</italic></bold> <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table"><italic>Table 1</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>.</p>
<p>We also calculated desensitization and deactivation kinetics in excised outside-out patches. However, GluK1-1a receptors, when expressed alone, exhibited low peak amplitudes in outside-out recordings that prevented reliable calculation of gating kinetics. Hence, we only compared the properties of receptors co-expressed with Neto proteins, and the results were consistent with those obtained from whole-cell recordings (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G-I</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table"><italic>Table 2</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>.. Neto 2 slowed down desensitization of GluK1-1a by ∼ 1.5 times compared to GluK1-2a (Ʈ<sub>Des</sub>, GluK1-1a +Neto2: 31.89 ± 4.08 ms; GluK1-2a +Neto2: 20.91 ± 2.11; P=0.0665) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table"><italic>Table 2</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>. The desensitization rates for GluK1-1a and GluK1-2a receptors co-expressed with Neto1 was also significantly altered (Ʈ<sub>Des</sub>, GluK1-1a +Neto1: 4.83 ± 0.46 ms; GluK1-2a +Neto2: 2.84 ± 0.35; *P=0.0310) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table"><italic>Table 2</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>. Faster solution exchange times in excised patch recordings also allowed us to measure deactivation kinetics using a 1 ms application of 10 mM glutamate. Surprisingly, unlike desensitization, for receptors coexpressed with Neto2, the deactivation rate of GluK1-1a is significantly faster compared to that of GluK1-2a (Ʈ<sub>Dea</sub>, GluK1-1a +Neto2: 5.18 ± 0.65 ms; GluK1-2a +Neto2: 10.74 ± 1.48; **P=0.0077). In contrast, Neto1 did not significantly alter deactivation kinetics of both GluK1 variant receptors (Ʈ<sub>Dea</sub>, GluK1-1a +Neto1: 2.83 ± 0.20 ms; GluK1-2a +Neto1: 2.14 ± 0.37; P=0.2086) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table"><italic>Table 2</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>. Thus, both whole-cell and excised patch recordings confirm the unique functional properties and differential modulation by Neto proteins due to the presence of fifteen amino acid insert in GluK1-1a receptors.</p>

<title>Mutations in GluK1-1a splice insert alter channel properties</title>
<p>Since our electrophysiological analysis showed functional differences between the two splice variants and their modulation by Neto proteins, we created receptors with mutated splice residues and conducted functional assays to identify the key residues. The splice insert (KASGEVSKHLYKVWK) is dominated by positively charged residues and contains four lysins and one histidine. We hypothesized that these charged residues might affect the interactions at the ATD-LBD interface and influence receptor functions. To investigate this, we prepared charge-reversal (K/H to E) and charge-neutral (K/H to A) mutants and carried out functional assays <bold><italic>(Figure 4-table supplement 1)</italic></bold>. Our cell surface biotinylation assay showed that all mutants (glutamate or alanine) reached the cell surface efficiently (data not shown). However, the charge-neutral mutants (K/H to A) gave either very low peak amplitudes (&lt;40 pA) or were not functional and hence, were not included in the study. The charge reversal mutants K<sub>368</sub>-E and K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E revealed fascinating insights into the role of splice residues in altering GluK1 receptor properties (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Interestingly, both mutants, K<sub>368</sub>-E and K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E exhibited a significantly slower rate of glutamate-evoked desensitization compared to wild-type GluK1-1a (Ʈ<sub>Des</sub>, GluK1-1a: 5.21 ± 0.50 ms; K<sub>368</sub>-E: 7.89 ± 1.14 ms *P=0.0334; K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E: 9.61 ± 1.47 *P=0.0290) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table"><italic>Table 1</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>. We also observed a significant delay in the recovery from the desensitized state for K<sub>368</sub>-E mutant (K<sub>368</sub>: 5.61 ± 0.95 s *P=0.0417) compared to wild-type GluK1-1a. In addition, the K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E mutant also exhibited a slowdown in the recovery, though not significant. (K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E: 4.83 ± 0.31 s P=0.2774) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table"><italic>Table 1</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>. Our investigations of glutamate- and kainate-evoked responses for wild-type and mutant receptors considering their peak amplitudes (I<sub>K</sub>/I<sub>G</sub>) revealed a significant decrease for the K<sub>368</sub>-E mutant (GluK1-1a: 1.51 ± 0.13; K<sub>368</sub>-E: 0.81 ± 0.13 **P=0.0037) and a reduction was observed for K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E receptors (1.17 ± 0.28 P=0.3733) compared to wild-type (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table"><italic>Table 1</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>. These observations are reciprocal to the effect of splice insert compared to the non-spliced form, indicating the importance of these residues in influencing receptor desensitization and recovery. A similar trend reversal was also observed for the measurements of the rectification index for these mutants at positive and negative potentials (+90 mV and −90 mV). The rectification index was significantly reduced in the case of mutant K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E (K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E: 0.62 ± 0.14 *P=0.0499).

<title>GluK1-1a splice residues K<sub>368,</sub> K<sub>375</sub>, H<sub>376,</sub> K<sub>379</sub> and K<sub>382</sub> influence receptor modulation by Neto proteins</title>
<p>Next, we investigated the effects of splice mutants on receptor modulation by Neto proteins. To test whether mutations in splice residues could disrupt interactions with Neto proteins, we performed receptor pull-downs using an antibody against the His-tag of the receptor. Our results showed that the mutant receptors could efficiently pull down Neto1 (detected using the Neto1 antibody) and Neto2-EGFP (detected using the GFP antibody) (<bold><italic>Figure 5-figure supplement 1),</italic></bold> suggesting that mutants don’t altogether abolish GluK1-1a and Neto interactions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we conducted electrophysiology experiments to investigate whether coexpression of Neto proteins can restore functionality and influence the functions of splice mutants. We observed that mutant K<sub>368</sub>-E desensitizes significantly slower in the presence of Neto1 while the mutants K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E and K<sub>368/375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E do not exhibit any significant deviation (Ʈ<sub>Des</sub>, GluK1-1a +Neto1: 3.56 ± 0.22 ms; K<sub>368</sub>-E +Neto1: 4.37 ± 0.25 ms *P=0.0393; K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E +Neto1: 3.74 ± 0.20 ms P=0.5390; K<sub>368/375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E +Neto1: 4.86 ± 0.67 ms P=0.1242) <bold><italic>(</italic></bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref><bold><italic>; Figure 5-figure supplement 2A;</italic></bold> <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table"><italic>Table 1</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>.

<p>Similarly, K<sub>368</sub>-E and K<sub>368/375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E mutants recover significantly faster from the desensitized state when coexpressed with Neto1. On the other hand, the recovery from the desensitized state for mutant receptors is not significantly affected by Neto2. Thus, while Neto1 seems to affect the mutant receptor recovery from the desensitized state, Neto 2 doesn’t show significant differences compared to wild-type receptors, again highlighting the differential modulation of GluK1-1a receptors by Neto proteins (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table"><italic>Table 1</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to determine whether the agonist efficacy of mutant receptors changed in the presence of Neto proteins, I<sub>K</sub>/I<sub>G</sub> ratios were measured. Neto1 increased the agonist efficacy for the K<sub>368</sub>-E and K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E mutants but not for K<sub>368/375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E receptors (K<sub>368</sub>-E +Neto1: 6.99 ± 0.47 ***P=0.0002; K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E +Neto1: 1.69 ± 0.15 *P=0.0326; K<sub>368/375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E +Neto1: 1.15 ± 0.20 P=0.6495) <bold><italic>(</italic></bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref><bold><italic>; Figure 5-figure supplement 2B;</italic></bold> <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table"><italic>Table 1</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>. Similarly, Neto2 also considerably increased the I<sub>K</sub>/I<sub>G</sub> values for mutant K<sub>368</sub>-E, rescuing the kainate efficacy (K<sub>368</sub>-E +Neto2: 2.13 ± 0.13 ***P=0.0007), while it does not seem to have any significant effect on the K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E mutant (K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E +Neto2: 0.86 ± 0.08 P=0.2045) <bold><italic>(</italic></bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref><bold><italic>; Figure 5-figure supplement 2B;</italic></bold> <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table"><italic>Table 1</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>.</p>
<p>Consistent with the observation above, our examination of the rectification index revealed a significant increase in outward current for the K<sub>368</sub>-E mutant (K<sub>368</sub>-E +Neto1: 2.84 ± 0.16 **P=0.0021). However, K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E did not show any difference compared to wild-type receptors, while K<sub>368/375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E displayed a significant decrease in the outward current (K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E +Neto1: 1.23 ± 0.07 P=0.5351; K<sub>368/375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E +Neto1: 0.59 ± 0.13 **P=0.0081) <bold><italic>(</italic></bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref><bold><italic>; Figure 5-figure supplement 2C;</italic></bold> <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table"><italic>Table 1</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>. Interestingly, however, the splice residue mutants did not show any significant variation in the rectification index when coexpressed with Neto2 <bold><italic>(</italic></bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref><bold><italic>; Figure 5-figure supplement 2C;</italic></bold> <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table"><italic>Table 1</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>.</p>
<p>Thus, our analysis of the gating properties of GluK1-1a mutants co-expressed with Neto proteins suggests that positively charged residues at positions 368, 375, 376, 379, and 382 in the splice insert influence receptor modulation by Neto proteins. Neto1 appears to have more pronounced effects on the mutant receptors compared to Neto2. Specifically, Neto1 significantly slowed desensitization for the K<sub>368</sub>-E mutant, accelerated recovery from desensitization for K<sub>368-E</sub> and K<sub>368/375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E mutants, increased agonist efficacy for K<sub>368</sub>-E and K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E mutants, and altered rectification properties for K<sub>368</sub>-E and K<sub>368/375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E mutants. In contrast, Neto2 had fewer significant effects on the mutant receptors, with the main impact being an increase in agonist efficacy for the K<sub>368</sub>-E mutant. Notably, Neto2 did not significantly affect desensitization, recovery from desensitization, or rectification properties of the mutant receptors when compared with wild-type GluK1-1a coexpressed with Neto2. These findings suggest that the splice residues in GluK1-1a differentially influence receptor modulation by Neto1 and Neto2, with Neto1 showing more extensive modulation of the mutant receptors’ functional properties.</p>

<p>A tetrameric receptor model was built based on the crystal structures of GluK1-1a ATD, GluK1 LBD (kainate-bound state; PDB:3C32), and the TM domain based on a highly identical GluK2<sub>EM</sub> (PDB:5KUF). Our cryo-EM map represented ATD residues-1-398, but the density corresponding to the ATD splice (368-382) was poorly resolved. The ATD-LBD linkers were resolved for all subunits (A to D) in both structures, the S1 and S2 domains were built entirely, and the TMD (TM1, TM3, and TM4) was built only for detergent-solubilized receptors <bold><italic>(</italic></bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref><bold><italic>; Figure 6-figure supplement 6 and 7)</italic></bold>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Alternative splicing is a well-known mode of protein function modulation in various ion channels, such as transient receptor potential (TRP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gracheva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>), big potassium (BK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2005</xref>), acid-sensing sodium (ASICs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bässler et al., 2001</xref>), and Shaker K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hoshi et al., 1991</xref>). In the case of iGluRs, the 38 amino acid residue preceding TM4, known as flip and flop isoforms, is a well-characterized module of AMPARs that affects receptor expression and gating kinetics and is involved in various pathophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Park et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sommer et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Stine et al., 2001</xref>). For kainate receptors, the combination of different subunits (GluK1-GluK5) and post-transcriptional modifications, such as RNA editing and splicing, provides a broader range of pharmacological and gating properties, which can affect synaptic physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kumar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kumar and Mayer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lerma, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Straub et al., 2016</xref>). GluK1 is the most diversified subunit of KARs due to multiple post-transcriptional events and has been widely studied as a potential drug target. A recent report highlighted the equivalent presence of GRIK1-1 (exon 9) with respect to GRIK1-2 (lacking exon 9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Herbrechter et al., 2021</xref>). The dominant presence of the GRIK1-1 gene was also reported in retinal Off bipolar cells of ground squirrel. Interestingly, an N-terminal splice (exon 5) in a similar position has been observed in the GluN1 subunit of NMDA receptors, which is known to influence the interactions at the ATD-LBD interface and, therefore, proton sensitivity and channel kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Regan et al., 2018</xref>). However, this is the first report to decipher the role of the N-terminal splice insert in the kainate receptor family.</p>
<p>Our study compared the role of ATD splice in the kinetics of the GluK1-1a to a previously extensively characterized equivalent receptor without the splice region, GluK1-2a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Copits et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fisher, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fisher and Fisher, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sommer et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Swanson and Heinemann, 1998</xref>). We found that the splice insert affects desensitization, recovery from desensitization, glutamate sensitivity, and channel rectification of the GluK1 receptor. Moreover, the splice also had a profound impact on desensitization with kainate, suggesting that the receptor follows different functional pathways for the two agonists. Our results showed a significant deviation from GluK1-2a in kainate-versus glutamate-evoked currents (I<sub>K</sub>/I<sub>G</sub>), implying a role for splice residues in imparting higher efficacy for kainate. This likely explains the enhanced stability of the kainate-bound state in GluK1-1a, leading to slower desensitization compared to GluK1-2a. Our functional assays of GluK1-1a receptors co-expressed with Neto proteins showed that Neto1 facilitates faster recovery from the desensitized state, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Copits et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fisher, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Palacios-Filardo et al., 2016</xref>). However, we did not observe the fast onset of desensitization previously reported for GluK-2a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Copits et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fisher, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, our results show that Neto2 retards recovery from desensitization for both GluK1 variants, contradicting earlier reports of conflicting recovery rates with Neto2 for GluK1-2a. This indicates that Neto1 and Neto2 may interact with both GluK1 variants in a mutually exclusive manner or that the splice position may regulate the modulation behavior of Neto2 and Neto1. Our comparison of kainate and glutamate efficacies for the two variants also showed differential modulation by Neto proteins. Both Neto1 and Neto2 reduced the I<sub>K</sub>/I<sub>G</sub> ratios in GluK1-1a, while they significantly increased the I<sub>K</sub>/I<sub>G</sub> ratios in GluK1-2a, highlighting the impact of the splice insert on receptor response to the agonists <bold><italic>(</italic></bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref><bold><italic>; Figure 3-figure supplement 1B;</italic></bold> <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table"><italic>Table 1</italic></xref>).</p>
<p>Our mutational analysis showed that K<sub>368</sub>, a splice insert residue, affects channel kinetics. The charge reversal mutant (K<sub>368</sub>-E) showed significant differences from the wild-type GluK1-1a for all tested properties, indicating a role for K<sub>368</sub> in protein-protein and/or protein-glycan interactions at the ATD-LBD interface.</p>
<p>Our electrophysiological assays reveal a complex interplay between GluK1 receptor splice variants and Neto auxiliary proteins. While Neto2 demonstrates a more profound impact on wild-type GluK1-1a function compared to GluK1-2a, particularly in slowing desensitization, Neto1’s modulation appears more sensitive to specific mutations in the splice insert. This suggests that Neto2 may have a stronger overall effect on receptor function through potentially allosteric mechanisms, whereas Neto1 might interact more directly with specific splice insert residues. The differential sensitivity to mutations highlights distinct roles for these auxiliary proteins: Neto2 as a powerful modulator of overall receptor function, and Neto1 as having more specific interactions with the splice insert region. This complexity underscores the nuanced nature of these protein interactions and the need for further structural and functional studies to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying the functional diversity of GluK1 receptors.</p>
<p>Although our cryo-EM map poorly resolved the splice region, its position can be ascertained close to the ATD-LBD interface. Based on our functional assays, the splice seems to affect the interaction between the receptor and auxiliary proteins. The modulatory effects of Neto1 and Neto2 on GluK1 splice variants might be mediated by multiple conserved positively charged patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Vinnakota et al., 2021</xref>). The complex between GluK2-Neto2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">He et al., 2021b</xref>) provides a model that suggests K<sub>183</sub> and K<sub>187</sub> of GluK1 can potentially interact with a negative patch on Neto1 (D<sub>140</sub>-E<sub>144</sub>) and Neto2 (D<sub>144</sub>-E<sub>148</sub>). However, the splice insert appears to be positioned away from this interacting surface. Thus, it is possible that the splice residues may interact with Neto proteins when the receptor adopts a different conformation during the gating cycle. Additionally, splice residues could have an indirect or allosteric influence on the modulation of receptor functions and regulation by Neto proteins.</p>
<p>Our research, which encompasses structural, biochemical, biophysical, and functional investigations, highlights the significance of the unique N-terminal splice insert in the functions of GluK1 kainate receptors and opens avenues for further studies to understand its physiological effects. We also elucidated the important residues within the splice insert that could impact the modulatory behavior of auxiliary proteins. Our study emphasizes the need to investigate all possible combinations of KAR splice variants to better appreciate their contributions at different developmental stages. This comprehensive understanding of the distribution and functional diversity is essential for a rational therapeutic approach involving kainate receptors.</p>

<title>Whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology</title>
<p>A whole-cell patch-clamp analysis was performed to understand the functional differences between GluK1-1a and GluK1-2a, as well as their modulation by Neto proteins. The constructs used for this study were HEK293 WT mammalian cells were seeded on siliconized glass coverslips in 35 mm dishes using Dulbecco’s Modification of Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM glutamine, and 10 units/mL Penicillin-Streptomycin. Cells were transfected with rat (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>) <italic>GRIK1-1a</italic> or <italic>GRIK1-2a</italic> cloned in pRK7 (in the presence or absence of r<italic>Neto1</italic>/r<italic>Neto2</italic> cloned in IE-pRK8 as indicated) with EGFP expressing plasmid using Xfect (Clontech) according to manufacturer’s instructions (receptor: Neto in 1: 3 and Receptor: EGFP in 1:1 DNA concentration). Similar protocols were followed to test the functionality of the <italic>GRIK1-1a<sub>EM</sub></italic> and <italic>GRIK1-1a</italic> splice mutant constructs. The whole-cell patch-clamp recording was performed with an EPC 10 USB amplifier (HEKA) 24-48 hours post-transfection. Cells were lifted using 1.5 mm diameter thin wall glass capillary tubes (30-0066 Harvard Apparatus), pulled to a fine tip with a Sutter P-1000 micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) containing internal solution (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 100 mM CsF, 30 mM CsCl, 4 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM EGTA and 300 mOsm). Cells were continuously perfused with external/bath solution (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2.8 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2,</sub> and 300 mOsm) through a peristaltic perfusion system (Multichannel systems). Current was measured by holding the membrane at −60 mV, using a 2-kHz low-pass filter. Ligands (10 mM glutamate, 1 mM kainate, 2 mM SYM2081, or 10 µM UBP301) were applied through a double-barrelled theta pipette connected with an ultra-fast piezo-based perfusion system (Multichannel systems) <italic>via</italic> v8 Perfusion Fast-Step System (VC-77SP). Recordings were controlled and measured using Patchmaster-v2x90.2 (Heka Elektronik). The raw files were analyzed using Clampfit 11.2 (Molecular Devices)and Fitmaster-v2x90.4 (HEKA Elektronik). The data was fitted to logistic curves in GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc.). All traces were normalized before being used for calculations. The single exponential two-term fitting (Levenberg-Marquardt) was used to estimate the rate of desensitization (Ʈ<sub>Des</sub>) for 100 ms glutamate application, measured as the decline of the current from 80% of its peak amplitude. Mean-weighted Tau (τ<sub>Des</sub>) values were determined using the formula [(τ1 × amplitude1) + (τ2 × amplitude2)]/[amplitude1 + amplitude2] where the tau values are the time constants from the exponential fit and the amplitudes are the assessed contributions of each component to the total peak current amplitude. To compute the recovery from desensitization, a series of paired-pulse experiments were performed with varying time pulses, where the amplitudes of the test pulse were normalized to that of the desensitizing pulse (calculated as relative amplitude) and plotted in comparison to the time (in seconds) between these two pulses. The recovery rate (Ʈ<sub>Recovery</sub>) was obtained by fitting the one-phase association with an exponential function. Dose-response experiments were performed for GluK1-1a (co-expressed with or without Neto proteins) and GluK1-2a with different concentrations of glutamate or kainate in the range of 1 µM to 3 mM or 0.5 µM to 600 µM, respectively. Dose-response values were calculated as the percentage of maximum response against log[agonist] concentrations and fitted using variable slope (Hill’s equation) in GraphPad Prism 8.0.1. For calculating kainate efficacy (I<sub>K</sub>/I<sub>G</sub>), the ratio of peak amplitudes obtained from the same cell evoked first by glutamate followed by kainate were employed. A ratio of peak amplitudes obtained at +90/-90 mV was utilized to calculate the rectification index. We investigated the voltage-dependent endogenous polyamine block by measuring current-voltage relationships. Current-voltage (IV) plots were prepared using the voltage ramp from −90 to + 90 mV with a 10 mV increment step only after complete recovery of the receptor, and the current amplitude was normalized to that obtained at −90 mV. For kainate-evoked currents, the percentage desensitization was calculated. The steady-state current measured at the end of 1 s kainate application was divided by peak current. This ratio was then subtracted from 1 and multiplied by 100 to give percentage (%) desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fisher and Fisher, 2014</xref>).</p>

Next, the obtained fragment was used as a megaprimer to amplify the complete GluK1-1a vector backbone that would now contain the mutation.

<p>To understand the effect of mutations on GluK1-1a and Neto1/2 interaction, co-immunoprecipitation was carried out using an anti-His monoclonal antibody against the receptor. Similar constructs and transfection protocols were followed for surface expression analysis. Cells were pelleted 65-70 h post-transfection and washed with TBS (20 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl). These cells were sonicated and solubilized in 500 uL lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 1% glycerol, protease inhibitor cocktail, 30 mM DDM). Post solubilization, debris was removed by centrifuging at 17,000 x g for 45 minutes at 4 °C.

To boost the protein production, 10 mM sodium butyrate (Sigma) was added 16 h post-transfection/infection, and cultures were incubated at 30 °C for protein expression. Cells were harvested 65-70 h after transfection/infection, washed with buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 8 and 150 mM NaCl, and stored at −80 ° C until further processing. The cell pellet was resuspended (20 mL/L culture volume) in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, and protease inhibitor cocktail, Roche). These resuspended cells were disrupted using sonication (QSonica sonicator, 3 cycles of 90 s; 10 s ON/ 20 s OFF; temperature cut-off: 15 °C). The lysate was clarified using low-speed spin (4307 x g for 20 minutes at 4 °C). The membranes were pelleted using ultracentrifugation (118991 x g for 1 h at 4 °C).

<p>GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> DDM: Double application of 3 μL protein (∼0.6 mg/mL) SYM2081 complex was carried out on glow-discharged gold grids (R 0.6/1, 300 mesh, Quantifoil). The grids were blotted for 4.5 s and 3.5 s, respectively (0 blot force). Vitrobot temperature was maintained at 12 °C with 100% humidity, and the sample was vitrified in liquid ethane. The clipped grids were loaded into a 300 keV Titan Krios microscope equipped with a Falcon III direct detector camera (4k x 4k). Movies were recorded in counting mode with a nominal magnification of 59,000X (pixel size: 1.38 Å), and the defocus range of −2.0 to −3.2 μm increased in steps of 0.3. Each movie comprises 25 frames with a total exposure of 60 seconds. A dose rate of 0.78 e<sup>-</sup>/frame was applied, with the total dose being 19.5 e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> ND: Double application of 2 μL protein (∼0.9 mg/mL) SYM2081 complex was carried out on glow-discharged gold grids (1.2/1.3, 200 mesh, Quantifoil). Grids were blotted for 3 s and 10 s, respectively, followed by vitrification. The clipped grids were loaded into a 300 keV Titan Krios microscope equipped with a K2 direct-detector camera (Gatan). The movies were recorded in super-resolution mode with an energy filter (20eV slit) and a pixel size of 1.41 Å. Each movie was composed of 30 frames with a total exposure of 12 seconds. A dose rate of 1.36 e<sup>-</sup>/frame was applied, with a total dose of 40.8 e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>All movies (GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> DDM-SYM: 1100, GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> ND-SYM: 1535) were motion-corrected using UCSF Motioncor2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>). Bad micrographs were removed manually post contrast transfer function (CTF) estimation using CTFFIND4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015</xref>). Manually picked particles (∼1000) were 2D classified and used as templates for autopicking in RELION or cryoSPARCv 3. For GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> DDM-SYM and GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> ND-SYM, the autopicked particles in cryoSPARCv3 were cleaned up with multiple rounds of 2D classification. Particles in the best classes were used for training TOPAZ for automated particle picking. For GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> DDM-SYM, initially, 13,750 particles were picked; post iterative rounds of 2D and 3D classification, 5372 particles were used for final 3D reconstruction. In the case of GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> ND-SYM, initially, 1,97,908 particles were picked. Multiple rounds of clean-up using 2D and 3D classification gave 24,531 particles that were used for the final 3D reconstruction.</p>
<p>The final particles were corrected for local motion in cryoSPARCv3, followed by refinement using C1 symmetry for both GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> DDM-SYM and GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> ND-SYM. Since we had less information on TMD in both the detergent and nanodisc forms, as observed in 2D classes, we performed local refinement for ATD and LBD using an ECD mask for GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> DDM-SYM and GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> ND-SYM, which improved map resolution to 8.01 Å and 5.2 Å (0.143 FSC) respectively. For GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> DDM-SYM, local refinement using a mask for full-length structure yielded a resolution of 8.2 Å. The 3D maps were sharpened via cryoSPARCv3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Punjani et al., 2017</xref>) or DeepEMhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sanchez-Garcia et al., 2021</xref>) using a mask from the cryoSPARCv3 refinement output. Local Resolution was estimated using BlocRes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cardone et al., 2013</xref>) in cryoSPARCv3 or Phenix1.19.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Afonine et al., 2018a</xref>).</p>

<title>Model building</title>
<p>Tetrameric assembly for the GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> ND-SYM model was built using crystal structures of individual domains (ATD, not yet published, and LBD, PDB: 3C32, GluK1 LBD crystal structure with kainate) fitted into the EM map (5.2 Å) in UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>). Further, for building GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> ND transmembrane domain 3 and GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> DDM trans-membrane domain, GluK2 TMD (PDB:5KUF) was used due to high identity (∼95%) for fitting into EM density. Phenix1.19.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Afonine et al., 2018b</xref>) and Namdinator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kidmose et al., 2019</xref>) were used to improve the model via the rigid body and Molecular Dynamics based flexible fitting, respectively. The final models fit well into the EM map of GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> ND-SYM, GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> DDM-SYM ECD, and FL, respectively, with a definite density for ATD, LBD, and TMD (pre-M1, M1, M3, and M4). Coot 0.9.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>) was used to analyze the final models, and chimera/chimeraX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Pettersen et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">2004</xref>) was used for figure preparation.</p>

<title>Spatiotemporal distribution of exon 9 of GluK1 using transcriptomics data analysis</title>
<p>To understand the abundance of <italic>GRIK1-1</italic> splice in the human brain, we resorted to RNA-Seq data from the BrainSpan atlas that constitutes various databases to study transcriptional mechanisms in human brain development. The RNA-Seq data were downloaded for <italic>GRIK1</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.brainspan.org/rnaseq/gene/1099967">https://www.brainspan.org/rnaseq/gene/1099967</ext-link>), plotted in Excel (x-axis: regions of the brain; y-axes: expression in log<sub>2</sub> of Reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads, RPKM and age of donor). The heat maps were generated using the Excel file (CSV format) and RStudio (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rstudio.com/">https://www.rstudio.com/</ext-link>) to determine the presence of GluK1 in various regions of the brain at different developmental stages, as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. Further, we narrowed it down to the <italic>GRIK1-1</italic> splice (exon 9; start position 30968845, 45 nucleotides in length) and tried to understand how it overlaps with the entire <italic>GRIK1</italic> gene expression. These data explored the presence of the ATD splice irrespective of which C-terminal splice variant is present.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study shows that a splice variant of the kainate receptor Glu1-1a that inserts 15 amino acids in the extracellular N-terminal region substantially changes the channel's desensitization properties, the sensitivity to glutamate and kainate, and the effects of modulatory Neto proteins. In the revised paper the authors have clarified several points raised by reviewers but the structural portion of the study has not been improved and consequently, more data are needed to determine the molecular mechanism by which the insert changes the functional profile of the channel. Even so, these <bold>solid</bold> findings advance our understanding of splice variants among glutamate receptors and will be of interest to neuro- and cell-biologists and biophysicists in the field.</p>

<p>Kainate receptors play various important roles in synaptic transmission. The receptors can be divided into low affinity kainate receptors (GluK1-3) and high affinity kainate receptos (GluK4-5). The receptors can assemble as homomers (GluK1-3) or low-high affinity heteromers (GluK4-5). The functional diversity is further increased by RNA splicing. Previous studies have investigated C-terminal splice variants of GluK1, but GluK1 N-terminal (exon 9) insertions have not been previously characterized. In this study Dhingra et al investigate the functional implications of a GluK1 splice variant that inserts a 15 amino acid segment into the extracellular N-terminal region of the protein using whole-cell and excised outside-out electrophysiology.</p>
<p>
The authors convincingly show that the insertion profoundly impacts the function of GluK1-1a - the channels that have the insertion are slower to desensitize. The data also shows that the insertion changes the modulatory effects of Neto proteins, resulting in altered rates of desensitization and recovery from desensitization. To determine the mechanism by which the insertion exerts these functional effects, the authors perform pull-down assays of Neto proteins, and extensive mutagenesis on the insert.</p>
<p>
The electrophysiological part of the study is very rigorous and meticulous.</p>
<p>The biggest weakness of the manuscript is the structural work. Due to issues with preferred orientation (a common problem in cryo-EM), the 3D reconstructions are at a low resolution (in the 5-8 Å range) and cannot offer much mechanistic insight into the effects of the insertion. Based on the available data, the authors posit that the insertion does not change the arrangement of the subunits in the desensitized state. However, there is no comparison with a structure that does not contain the insertion, so while the statement may well be true, no data is shown to support it.</p>
<p>Overall, the cryo-EM contributes little and distracts from the good parts of the manuscript.</p>
<p>Another part that does not contribute much is the RNAseq data that has been pulled from a database and analyzed for the paper. It is being used to show that the exon 9 insertion variant is predominantly expressed in the cerebellar cortex at early stages of brain development. The methods do not describe in detail how the data has been analyzed (e.g., is the data scaled per sample/gene or globally?) so it is hard to know what we can compare in the heat plots. In Figure 1- supplement 1 there aren't striking differences in expression (at least not obviously visible in the current illustration).</p>
<p>Despite these weaknesses, the study is a valuable contribution to the field because it characterizes a GluK1 variant that has not been studied before and highlights the functional diversity that exists within the kainate receptor family.</p>
<p>Revised manuscript:</p>
<p>The authors have clarified some of the issues raised by the reviewers, but no new data has been added to strengthen the manuscript. The structural part of the manuscript remains its weakest point, and the extent of mechanistic insight remains low.</p>

<p>Among ionotropic glutamate receptors, kainate receptors (KAR) are still the object of intense investigation to understand their role in normal and pathological excitatory synaptic transmission. Like other receptors, KAR appear under different splicing variants and their respective physiological function is still debated. In this manuscript, Dhingra et al explored the impact of the presence and of the absence of Exon9 of the GluK1 receptors on the pharmacological, biophysi cal and structural properties of the receptors. They further investigated how it is impacted by the association of KAR with their cognate auxiliary subunit Neto 1 and 2. This study represents a large body of work and data. The authors addressed the issue in a very systematic and rigorous manner.</p>
<p>First, by exploring RNAseq database, authors showed that GluK1 transcripts containing the exon 9 are present in many brain structures and especially in the cerebellum suggesting that a large part of GluK1 contains effectively this exon9.</p>
<p>
Using HEK cells as an expression system, they characterized many gating and biophysical properties of GluK1 receptors containing or not the exon9. Evaluated parameters were desensitization, relative potency of glutamate versus kainate, and polyamine block.</p>
<p>It is known that the association of GluK1 with auxiliary proteins Neto1/2 modulates the properties of the receptors. Authors investigated systematically whether Neto1 and 2 similarly alter GluK1 properties in function of the presence of exon9. This study provides many quantitative data that could be reused for modeling the role of kainate receptors. Given the change shown by the authors, the presence of exon in GluK1 is noticeable and likely should have an impact of synaptic transmission.</p>
<p>
Interestingly, authors used a mutational approach to identify critical residues encoded by exon9 that are responsible for the functional differences between the two splice variants. In many cases, the replacement of a single amino acid leads to the absence of current confirming the crucial role of the segment of the receptor. However, it made the comparison and the identification of critical residues more challenging.</p>
<p>Authors attempted to establish the structure GluK1 receptors comprising the exon9 using different preparation methods. They succeeded in obtaining structures with equivalent or lower resolution compared with previous reports on GluK1 and GluK2 receptors. However, the organization of the peptide coded by exon is poorly defined and limited possible analyses. Despite this, they could observe that the presence of the exon9 does not alter significantly the structure of GluK1.</p>

<p>GluK1 forms glutamate-gated ion channels with an important function in synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability. Alternative RNA splicing has been described for these channels, allowing the diversification of GluK1 channels. The GluK1 splice variant GluK1-1a contains 15 residues in the amino-terminal domain, resulting from the Exon 9 splice insert. GluK1-1a displays significant expression in different regions of the brain, likely co-expressing with other Gluk channels. The impact of the 15 residues on GluK1 channel properties and the overall structure has not been studied yet. The paper by Dhingra et al. aims to evaluate the impact of the Exon 9 splice insert on GluK1.1 channel function and structure. This work uses electrophysiological approaches, including whole-cell and patch clamp recordings, to determine the effect of the splice insert on GluK1.1 gating properties, including desensitization, agonist efficacy, recovery from desensitization, and rectification. By using mutagenesis and biochemical approaches, the authors studied the role of positively charged residues in the splice insert on channel properties and the interaction with modulatory Neto proteins. This work also shows the effect of the splice insert on the regulation of GluK1 channels by Neto proteins. Finally, by using Cryo-EM and single-particle analysis, the authors reconstructed a model for a homomeric GluK1-1a channel. Overall, this work provides two major milestones: 1) the first functional characterization of the GluK1-1a variant and 2) the first structure of this channel.</p>
<p>The functional data supporting the role of the insert on channel properties is convincing, although the current data does not provide significant insights about the mechanism. The overall structure in a putative desensitized state shows no differences with channels lacking the splice insert. However, some domains, including most of the 15 residues unique for the GluK1-1a variant were not resolved, suggesting high flexibility or conformational heterogeneity in those regions. Also, the low resolution of the obtained structures precludes conclusions on the structural basis for the role of the insert in channel function/regulation. Nonetheless, this paper represents an important advance in the study of glutamate receptors and invites the field to elucidate the structural basis for gating properties in GluK1-1a channels as well as other glutamate receptors. A more in-depth study about the role of splicing variants on ligand binding affinity, regulation by modulatory subunits such as Neto proteins, and the potential impact of this specific variant on heteromeric channels would also be relevant.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>In its current form, I would exclude the cryo-EM data from the manuscript. It does not add much and it is distracting from the excellent work that you did on the functional characterization of the variant. Alternatively, you could try to improve the resolution and see if you can get some more meaningful analysis out of the structures? I noticed that you only collected very small datasets. If you decide to pursue a higher resolution reconstruction, collecting more movies will give you a better chance to obtain a higher resolution.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We express our gratitude to the reviewer for their invaluable feedback. While acknowledging that our structure currently maintains a low resolution, it still provides valuable insights into the splice's proximity to the N412 glycan density. This proximity and low-resolution map hindered the complete modeling of all the splice residues. Notably, this structure represents the first depiction of this particular splice variant. Consequently, it lays a foundation for subsequent studies in the field, and hence, we would want to keep it in the manuscript. As per reviewers’ suggestions, we have now included comparisons of our structure with the GluK1-2a receptor structure reported recently (Mayerson et al. 2022). We do plan to carry out higher-resolution structures in the future.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I would probably also exclude the RNAseq analysis. I think that Figure 1 is fine, but the supplement 1 is not very successful in convincing me that the exon 9 is expressed mainly in early stages of brain development. In addition, the plot in Figure 1 indicates strong expression in the cerebellar cortex in 20s and 30s. If you decide to keep the data, I strongly encourage you to include more details on the analysis in the methods section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for this insightful comment. We have now modified this section extensively for better clarity. Indeed, the expression of this variant seems to be dynamic in different brain regions. This has now been specified in the revised manuscript. Figure 1 shows the expression of GRIK1 exon 9 gene in different regions of the human brain and donor age. The supplementary figure 1 is a zoom-in on one such region, the Cerebral cortex, where we observe the maximum expression of GRIK1. In this region, we also observed higher expression of exon 9 in the early stages of development. The scales of Figure 1 (0-4 RPKM) and supplemental Figure 1(06RPKM) are different due to more expression of other exons in supplemental Figure 1 (example, we observe 4RPKM expression in the shade of red, for figure 1, whereas similar values of 4RPKM are orange-yellow in the supplemental figure1). Using Supplemental Figure 1, we wanted to show the expression of exon 9 with respect to other exons during developmental stages that prove that GluK1-1 is highly expressed in the initial stages of life. more details on the analysis in the methods section has been added now.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Additionally, there are a few minor issues in the data presentation:</p>
<p>(1) in Fig. 2C there seems to be a mismatch between the green dose response plot and the GluK12a trace shown. The plot reports an EC50 of 187.7 uM, whereas in the sample trace 0.25 mM agonist activates only to ~20%.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have verified the data and statistics, confirming their consistency with the values reported in the manuscript. For Figure 2C, we present representative traces from a single cell. However, the EC50 value was calculated using Hill's equation based on averaged data from 5 cells.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The axis label is misprinted in Figure 3C</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks. Corrected.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In Fig 5 supplement 1, panel B - the 3 last labels above the western blot lanes are off so it is difficult to see which sample corresponds to which lane.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks. We have corrected the figure.</p>

<p>P11 authors indicate that K368/375//379/382H376-E mutant exhibit significant difference in desensitization properties in presence of NEto1, but on the 1st line of p11, they provide a P value above 0.05</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this discrepancy and have fixed the same. We have discussed two mutants that show slower desensitization when compared to GluK1-1a co-expressed with Neto1. The K to E mutant has significance, while the des value for the K368/375//379/382H376-E mutant shows the same pattern, though not significantly. We have now modified the text to explain this more clearly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>P19 the calculation of mean weighted tau TDes is not clear and should be better explained.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks. We have added more details in the Methods sections. We analyzed the current decays in response to 1–2 ms or 1 s applications by employing an exponential function or the sum of two exponential functions. This analysis allowed us to derive a weighted mean τdes using the formula [(τ1 × amplitude1) + (τ2 × amplitude2)]/[amplitude1 + amplitude2]. The tau values represent the time constants obtained from the exponential fits, while the amplitudes correspond to the estimated contributions of each component to the total peak current amplitude.</p>
<p>[(A1 * t1) + (A2 * t2)] / (A1 + A2)</p>
<p>It represents the calculation of a weighted mean, where A1 and A2 are the amplitudes, and t1 and t2 are the corresponding time constants. The formula calculates the overall mean time constant by taking into account the contribution of each component to the total amplitude.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Major concerns:</p>
<p>(1) The effect of the splice insert on Gluk1 regulation by Neto proteins is not fully clear. For example, experiments in Fig. 3G indicate that the desensitization time for Gluk1-1a + Neto2 is ~32ms. This value is half compared with data obtained from whole-cell experiments shown in Fig. 3A (~70ms). What is the reason for this discrepancy? If variability is observed between experiments, I wonder how valid are the comparisons made in panel A between GluK11a+Neto2 vs GluK1-2a+Neto2 groups. In the case of recovery analysis, authors found significant differences comparing both groups in the presence of Neto (Fig. 3B) but recovery times are not identic for Gluk1-1a vs Gluk1-2a (without Neto). Thus, I wonder if the fold change related to the control group (without Neto) is different.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your detailed feedback, which has allowed us to clarify and reinforce the validity of our experimental findings. Different recording configurations (e.g., outside-out patch (Fig. 3G) versus whole-cell recordings (Fig. 3A) have been used. Whole-cell recordings average responses over a larger membrane area and also have slower solution exchange times compared to outside-out patch recordings. This may have contributed to the variability in desensitization times. However, similar trends in our whole cell vs. outside-out patch recordings were observed. Further, all the data except those presented in Figs 3G and 3H are from whole-cell recordings. We have performed multiple independent experiments and utilized rigorous statistical analyses to validate our comparisons. We report mean values with standard deviations or confidence intervals to provide a more accurate representation of the data.</p>
<p>Neto1 significantly speeds up the recovery from desensitization for both variants, with a more pronounced effect on GluK1-1a (GluK1-1a +Neto1: 0.68 s) compared to GluK1-2a (GluK1-2a +Neto1: 1.15 s). The recovery times are not identical for the two variants, likely due to the presence of splice insert in GluK1-1a. Neto2, on the other hand, slows recovery for both variants without significant differential effects. However, the recovery rate from the desensitized state is faster for GluK1-1 compared to GluK1-2a alone, although insignificant (without Neto).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In the case of the glutamate concentration-response curve (Fig. 3C), EC50 values for Neto1 and Neto2 are relatively the same, but this approach on its own does not provide insights about the role of the splice insert. Previous experiments with the Gluk1 reveal differences between EC50 in the presence of Neto1 or 2 (Fisher, 2015), suggesting that the insert could regulate glutamate binding affinity, but still, this point is not directly demonstrated in this work.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for this insightful comment. Indeed, we cannot conclude that splice residues directly affect glutamate sensitivity and have modified the text accordingly. The Fisher paper demonstrated that both Neto1 and Neto2 can influence glutamate sensitivity in GluK1-2a, with EC50 values of 124.6 ± 16.2 µM. Specifically, in the presence of Neto1 and Neto2, the EC50 values are 4.4 ± 0.4 µM and 13.7 ± 4.2 µM, respectively, indicating a noticeable effect though not substantially different for GluK1-2a coexpressed with either Neto1 and Neto2. Our observation for the GluK1-1a has been similar, with both Neto1 and Neto2 showing a leftward shift.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Similar to the previous point, a proper interpretation of mutant data is missing in the manuscript. From current data, it is difficult to visualize the role of the insert on Netodependent regulation, mainly, because of the fact that some mutations alone affect Gluk1-1 channel properties. The authors conclude their data by stating that &quot;while the modulation of the receptor by Neto 1 is affected by mutations in splice insert, the modulation by Neto 2 remains largely unaffected&quot; (Page 13). However, this statement is confusing since the co-expression of Gluk1-1a with Neto2 (Fig. 5) prevents the effect caused by mutation K368 alone (Fig. 4), indicating that modulations by Neto 2 are indeed potentially affected by the mutations. Please, clarify. Also, the effect of the K368/375/379/382H376-E mutant on Neto modulation (pink bar in Fig. 5) is impossible to interpret properly since the effect of the mutation alone is not shown in the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for seeking this important clarification. It is indeed true that splice residue mutations themselves affect the receptor functional properties in comparison to the wild-type receptors. For the sake of clarity, we have presented the effect of splice mutants on receptor properties separately from the effect of mutations on modulation by Neto proteins. Figure 4 demonstrates a comparison between wild-type and mutant receptors without the Neto proteins, showcasing different kinetic properties, while Figure 5 provides detailed information on the role of the insert in Neto-dependent regulation.</p>
<p>It’s true we could not record the effect of the K368/375/379/382H376-E mutant alone or when coexpressed with Neto 2 due to low peak amplitudes (mentioned in Table 1) that prevented reliable comparisons. However, robust currents were observed when the same mutant was coexpressed with Neto1, and hence comparisons were shown for this mutant with GluK1-1a wild-type + Neto1.</p>
<p>We have now modified the statement &quot;while the modulation of the receptor by Neto 1 is affected by mutations in splice insert, the modulation by Neto 2 remains largely unaffected&quot; and the last paragraph as follows:</p>
<p>“Neto1 appears to have more pronounced effects on the mutant receptors compared to Neto2. Specifically, Neto1 significantly slowed desensitization for the K368-E mutant, accelerated recovery from desensitization for K368-E and K368/375/379/382H376-E mutants, increased agonist efficacy for K368-E and K375/379/382H376-E mutants, and altered rectification properties for K368E and K368/375/379/382H376-E mutants. In contrast, Neto2 had fewer significant effects on the mutant receptors, with the main impact being an increase in agonist efficacy for the K368-E mutant. Notably, Neto2 did not significantly affect desensitization, recovery from desensitization, or rectification properties of the mutant receptors when compared with wildtype GluK1-1a coexpressed with Neto2. These findings suggest that the splice residues in GluK1-1a differentially influence receptor modulation by Neto1 and Neto2, with Neto1 showing more extensive modulation of the mutant receptors' functional properties.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) An open question after reading this interesting work is if the proposed change in Neto regulation because of the splice insert is due to changes in Gluk1-Neto interactions or because the rearrangement after interaction with Neto proteins is different. Pull-down experiments (Fig 5 Sup.1) suggest that the splice insert and all the mutants tested do not prevent interaction with Neto proteins. I wonder if the authors could complement their data with a quantitative approach/analysis to demonstrate if the splice insert and the mutants affect Neto1/2 interactions (as expected for the rationale when creating the mutants).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this insightful suggestion. You raise an important point about distinguishing between changes in GluK1-Neto interactions and potential differences in receptor rearrangement after Neto binding. While our pull-down experiments suggest that the splice insert and mutants don't prevent Neto interactions (probably due to a larger interaction interface all along the receptor), a quantitative approach would indeed provide more nuanced information. In future studies, we do plan to perform a quantitative approach like Surface plasmon resonance to assess the changes in interactions upon mutations in the splice and/or Neto proteins in different states of the receptor. In addition, obtaining cryo-EM structures of GluK1 splice variants in complex with Neto1 and Neto2 would provide crucial insights into their interaction interfaces and any conformational changes induced by binding.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Related to the Gluk1-1a structure, the authors state that the overall structure is similar to the one without the insert (page 14); however, this is not properly shown in the manuscript. Even if the overall architecture of the channel is the same, authors should make a proper/adequate comparison between both structures/domains to support their claims. Also, one should expect that the insertion of 15 amino acids would affect in some way the closing neighboring domains. The differential effect of the splice insert on glutamate and kainate EC50 values (Fig. 2 and Fig. 2 sup.1), suggests that the insert could introduce a sort of rearrangement in the binding domain. Thus, I wonder if a more elaborated analysis of the current structural data could reveal some structural insights that would explain the specific functional differences due to the splice insert. If the low resolution and the missing residues avoid making some comparisons and establish differences between sidechain orientations, still, a proper comparison between the domain backbones would be helpful to validate the author's statement at least. Also, I wonder if the changes could be resolved better in a closed state or APO structure, instead of the desensitized structure. Finally, are the structures obtained in DDM and nanodiscs similar?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As per the reviewer’s suggestion, we have now added a new figure in the supplementary information, “Figure 6-figure supplement 9,” where we show a superimposition of GluK11aEM (detergent-solubilized or reconstituted in nanodiscs) and GluK1-2a (PDB:7LVT; silver) showing overall conservation of the structures in the desensitized state.</p>
<p>As evident from the figure and rmsd values mentioned above, we do not observe significant movements at both ATD and LBD layers of GluK1-1a with respect to GluK1-2a. Also as can be observed the DDM solubilized and nanodisc reconstituted GluK1-1a (Panel A) are very similar with a rmsd of ~2.19Å across all the 2664 Calpha atom pairs. Due to low resolution of our structures, we have refrained from carrying out detailed structural comparisions.</p>
<p>Our efforts to capture the closed state or apo state structures have failed due to either severe orientation bias (only top views) or increased heterogeneity.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Methods section lacks relevant information for proper data interpretation as well as for replicating some experiments in the future. For example:</p>
<p>A) The experimental design to determine the rectification index with a Ramp protocol is not clear: 1) Why the authors applied a ramp protocol if receptors desensitize along the time? Please clarify the protocol.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Ramp protocols were used only for the wild-type receptors to compare their voltage-dependent behavior, as this was the first study to compare the two splice variants. All kainate receptors (GluK1-GluK5) desensitize over time. However, their rectification properties have been studied previously (both the absence and presence of Neto proteins) using Ramp protocols as they are faster than step protocols.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>B) Are polyamines included in the solutions to perform the rectification assays?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>No, polyamines were not added to the intracellular solution, and the effect of the endogenous polyamine block was measured. This has now been specified in the results as well as the methods section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>C) It is not clear if the experiments to calculate IK/IG ratios were performed in the same preparation (This is, the same cell was stimulated with glutamate and then kainate or vice versa).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, the current responses for glutamate vs kainate are performed in the same cell (the same cell was stimulated by glutamate then kainate) so that the responses can be compared. It’s now been specified in the methods section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>D) The experimental design for calculating recovery is not clear.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We employed a double pulse protocol to measure receptor recovery. The protocol involved applying two consecutive pulses of agonist stimulation to the receptor. Initially, we applied a brief agonist pulse to activate the receptor, followed by a specific recovery period. After the recovery period, we administered a second agonist pulse to assess the receptor's recovery response. The receptor's recovery was determined by comparing the response amplitude of the second pulse to that of the first pulse, providing valuable insights into the receptor's recovery kinetics. Recovery rates were calculated with single exponential association fits in Prism. We have now modified the text for better clarity.</p>

<p>Minor concerns:</p>
<p>(1) Authors state that splice residues are ~30A away from the TM domain. Currently, there is no friendly representation showing the localization of the splice in the structure, besides Fig.6E. The manuscript could benefit itself if authors include a better 3D representation or a scheme to highlight the position of the splice relative to critical domains.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for pointing this out. The distance between TRP 381 CA (ATD) and LEU 636 CA (TM3) is 92.10 Å. We have changed the value in the text to ~92 Å.</p>

<p>(2) Authors mention that mutations in the insert to alanine show normal traffic to the plasma membrane but low current amplitude. Then, I wonder if single-channel conductance, mean open time or open probability is affected by the splice insert. Showing the effects of the insert on single-channel properties would strengthen the manuscript's quality.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is a good suggestion. However, as can be observed from our whole cell or outside out patch data, we obtained low peak amplitudes (&lt;50 pA) for many of our receptor-only constructs and also suffered from high SEM for some recordings due to heterogeneity between cells of the same population. The suggestion to study the single channel properties of these receptors is considered for future experiments</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) It is unclear how the insert or the mutations specifically affect glutamate- or kainate-induced responses because authors analyze IK/IG ratios only. Maybe authors could consider including an analysis of the role of the insert on specific glutamate- or kainate-induced response to gain insights about ligand selectivity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>All the values have been included in the excel for raw data. We have included the desensitization kinetics of mutant receptors in the presence of glutamate and compared it to the wild type GluK1-1a. Kainate induced responses were very heterogenous (high SEM for % desensitization) and hence have not been included in the main data.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Please be consistent with nomenclature along the manuscript to avoid confusion. For example, Are Gluk-1-1 and Gluk-1-1a referring to the same variant?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>GluK1-1 has been used in the abstract and the introduction where we introduce the N-terminal splice variant which either has the 15 residues (termed as GluK1-1) or lacks it (GluK1-2). The C- terminal splice variants for GluK1 are named as “a-d”, with “a” being the smallest Cterminal domain variant. Later in the manuscript, we have used only GluK1-1a terminology to represent the ATD splice variant with shortest C-terminal domain.</p>

<p>(13) Representative data shown in Fig 5 sup.2A do not match very well with the final quantification shown in Fig 5A. Please check. Also, the authors state in the result section (page 10) that data shown in Fig. 5A indicate that &quot;GluK1-1a modulation by Neto 1 is influenced by the splice residues&quot;. This could be true only for residue K368; however, this is not so obvious since the two mutants containing K368E are inconsistent. Please check and clarify.</p>

<p>(19) I wonder if the authors could discuss the lack of Neto1 effect on the wild type Gluk1-2a channel, as proposed previously.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Sheng et al., 2015 showed that Neto1 enhances the desensitization onset of GluK1. However, it is unclear which GluK1 splice variants were used in that study. GluK1 has several splice variants, but in the present study, we specifically compared GluK1-1a and 2a. In our case, we did not observe the effect of Neto1 on wild-type GluK1-2a in either of the two techniques (whole cell and outside-out patch) we utilized for our study. However, as can be observed from our data, the GluK1-2a receptor alone shows a faster desensitization kinetics than the previous study (Copits et al., 2011). The differences could stem from different experimental conditions such as constructs, recording conditions used etc.</p>
