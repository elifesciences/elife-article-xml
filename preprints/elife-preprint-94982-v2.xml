<title>Abstract</title><p>Pathogenic and nonpathogenic mycobacteria secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) under various conditions. EVs produced by <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) have raised significant interest for their potential in cell communication, nutrient acquisition, and immune evasion. However, the relevance of vesicle secretion during tuberculosis infection remains unknown due to the limited understanding of mycobacterial vesicle biogenesis. We have previously shown that a transposon mutant in the LCP-related gene <italic>virR</italic> (<italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>) manifested a strong attenuated phenotype during experimental macrophage and murine infections, concomitant to enhanced vesicle release. In this study, we aimed to understand the role of VirR in the vesicle production process in <italic>Mtb</italic>. We employ genetic, transcriptional, proteomics, ultrastructural and biochemical methods to investigate the underlying processes explaining the enhanced vesiculogenesis phenomenon observed in the <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>. Our results establish that VirR is critical to sustain proper cell permeability via regulation of cell envelope remodeling possibly through the interaction with similar cell envelope proteins, which control the link between peptidoglycan and arabinogalactan. These findings advance our understanding of mycobacterial extracellular vesicle biogenesis and suggest that these set of proteins could be attractive targets for therapeutic intervention.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>Specifically, (1) we paid special attention to the reanalysis of the transcriptomics and proteomics data, which included data from the virRmut complemented strain. In addition, we resorted to the regulon annotations previously reported (Minch et al., 2015). In this work, authors collected ChIP-seq data on binding events between a panel of transcription factors (TFs) and DNA to annotate interactions between 143 regulators and the promoters of 7248 target genes (peaks between -150 and +70 nucleotides from transcription staring sites). Capitalizing on these data, we interrogated whether the sets of genes up- (N=399) and downregulated in the virRmut strain (N=502) were significantly enriched among each of the regulons reported by Minch et al; (2) new TLC data indicates that the excess of PDIM synthesis can take away methyl malonyl CoA from the biosynthesis of SL-1 and PAT/DAT in the absence of VirR; (3) new FDAA labeling indicates an enhanced and altered PG turnover activity in virRmut relative to WT and complemented strains; (4) Proteomics data suggest the mutant is impaired in responses to stresses, including oxidative stress. We demonstrate the enhanced sensitivity of virRmut relative to WT; (5) Finally, we repeated the split-GFP experiment including controls and providing statistics. We strongly believe that the new version of the manuscript is providing a solid connection between PG remodeling, permeability and vesiculogenesis in Mtb.</p></fn>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) is one of the most successful human pathogens with the capacity to persist within the host establishing long-lasting infections. <italic>Mtb</italic> possesses multiple highly evolved mechanisms to manipulate host cellular machinery and evade the host immune system. Similar to other intracellular pathogens, <italic>Mtb</italic> releases proteins and lipids, that interfere with host cellular processes, via canonical or specialized secretion systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Majlessi et al., 2015</xref>). How mycobacteria confined within phagosomes delivers virulence factors to other cellular compartments and/or into the extracellular milieu to affect the physiology of neighboring cells is currently a matter of investigation. Understanding the physiology of this phenomenon during the infection process might be critical to develop alternative therapies against tuberculosis (TB).</p>
<p>Like most forms of life, <italic>Mtb</italic> uses an alternative antigen release process based on extracellular vesicles (EVs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Prados-Rosales et al., 2011</xref>). Mycobacterial EVs (MEVs) are membrane walled spheres of 60-300 nm in diameter, released by live bacteria <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. MEVs contain iron scavenging molecules, immunologically active complex lipids and lipoproteins, and classical virulence factors such as the <italic>Mycobacterium ulcerans</italic> toxin mycolactone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Marsollier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Prados-Rosales et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">2014b</xref>). Several studies have clearly established a role of MEVs in immunomodulation and shown that MEVs deliver factors that impair macrophage effector functions, inhibit T cell activation, and modify the response of host cells to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Athman et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Prados-Rosales et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">2014b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Rath et al., 2013</xref>). MEVs have also shown potential as biomarkers of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Schirmer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Ziegenbalg et al., 2013</xref>). Although the importance of MEVs has been recognized, hardly anything is known regarding both how such vesicles are exported across the mycobacterial cell wall and the molecular mechanisms underlying vesicle formation in mycobacteria. To date, several modulators of MEVs have been described. Our group identified two conditions leading to stimulation of vesicle production, namely: iron starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Prados-Rosales et al., 2014b</xref>) and the deletion of <italic>virR</italic> (Rv0431, <underline>v</underline>esiculogenesis and immune response <underline>R</underline>egulator) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Rath et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, it was shown that the Pst/SenX3-RegX3 signal transduction system regulates MEVs production independent from VirR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">White et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting an alternative mechanism of vesicle production. We have recently demonstrated that both iron starvation and deletion of VirR in <italic>Mtb</italic>, two hypervesiculating conditions, trigger the induction of the isoniazid-induced gene operon <italic>iniBAC</italic> (Gupta et al., 2023). We determined that both IniA and IniC are dynamin-like proteins (DLP) presumably assisting MEV release through the fusion of the cell membrane (Gupta et al., 2023; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Understanding how defects in VirR lead to hypervesiculation through DLPs is important to provide mechanistic explanation for the vesiculation process in mycobacteria.</p>
<p>Several lines of evidence support the notion that VirR might be involved in maintaining cell wall integrity: (i) First, sequence analysis of the VirR protein indicates that it contains a conserved LytR_C domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig S1</xref>), which is usually found in combination with another domain named LytR-Cps2A-Psr (LCP), and proteins carrying both domains have been associated with the remodeling of the cell wall in Gram-positive bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hubscher et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>Mtb</italic> has six genes encoding for LCP proteins, three with both LCP and LytR_C domains (Rv3267, Rv3484 and Rv0822), two with a solo LytR_C domain (VirR and Rv2700) and one protein with a solo LCP domain (Rv3840) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig S1</xref>). The LCP family includes enzymes that transfer glycopolymers from membrane-linked precursors to peptidoglycan (PG) or cell envelope proteins and are central to cell envelope integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kawai et al., 2011</xref>). In mycobacteria its was demonstrated that some members of the (LCP) family of proteins are responsible for the linkage between arabinogalactan (AG) and PG (Grzegorzewicz et al., 2016; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Harrison et al., 2016</xref>). Rv3267, Rv3484 and Rv0822 appear to have overlapping functions in cell wall assembly, Rv3267 being the primary ligase (Grzegorzewicz et al., 2016). Interestingly, while knocking down the gene encoding for the main AG-PG ligase (cg0847, <italic>lcpA</italic>) in <italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum</italic> leads to the release of outer membrane material to the extracellular medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Baumgart et al., 2016</xref>), this phenotype is not observed in any knockout strain in the <italic>Mtb</italic> orthologs (Grzegorzewicz et al., 2016), probably reflecting the ability of the mutants to negatively regulate the biosynthesis of cell wall constituents in response to a decrease in ligase activity; (ii) Second, we and others have determined the increased susceptibility of the transposon <italic>virR</italic> mutant (<italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>) with respect to the WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ballister et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Rath et al., 2013</xref>), and the mutant in the <italic>virR</italic> ortholog, Rv2700 (cell envelope integrity, <italic>cei</italic>) to cell wall targeting drugs such as meropenem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ballister et al., 2019</xref>). Based on these results, we hypothesize that LytR_C solo domain proteins including VirR and Cei Rv2700 have critical roles in the maintenance of cell wall homeostasis and their absence provokes cell wall alterations leading to enhanced vesiculation.</p>
<p>In this work we show that the absence of VirR leads to ultrastructural changes in the cell envelope as observed by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). These changes are compatible with enhanced permeability and an enlargement of the PG layer, as measured by high resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM). We demonstrate that VirR interacts with canonical LCP proteins and propose a model for such interaction. These results indicate that VirR is a central scaffold at the cell envelope remodeling process assisting the PG-AG linking process and that this function is important for vesicle production in <italic>Mtb</italic>.</p>

<title>High EV production linked to the lack of VirR is associated with an altered cell envelope in <italic>Mtb</italic> in the absence of cell lysis</title>
<p>While Gram-negative bacteria can release outer membrane vesicles directly into the extracellular environment from their outermost compartment, Gram-positive bacteria and mycobacteria have thick cell envelopes surrounding the cytoplasmic membrane that acts as a permeability barrier. The mycobacterial cell envelope is composed of PG covalently linked to AG, which in turn is decorated with exceptionally long-chain mycolic acids (MA). These MA, together with intercalating glycolipids, form the unique mycobacterial outer membrane (OM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kalscheuer et al., 2019</xref>). Previous analysis of mycobacterial vesicle associated lipids showed predominantly polar lipids, consistent with the cytoplasmic membrane being the likely origin of the vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Prados-Rosales et al., 2011</xref>). This is also true in EV produced by Fe-limited <italic>Mtb</italic> whose lipid content consists mainly of polar lipids and the lipidic siderophore, mycobactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Prados-Rosales et al., 2014b</xref>). Given that these vesicles must traffic from their point of origin in the plasma membrane through the cell envelope, we hypothesized that local remodeling of the cell envelope is necessary for EV release, and that this process may be exacerbated in a <italic>virR</italic> mutant (<italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>). To test this, we examined the cell envelope structure of <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> grown in minimal medium (MM), as well as wild type (WT) and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> complemented (<italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-C) strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Rath et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) on whole cells, which allows the study of mycobacterial cell surface-associated compartments in a close-to-native state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sani et al., 2010</xref>), we could easily discern three layers comprising the mycobacterial cell envelope: i) the outer membrane (OM); ii) an intermediate layer composed of two sublayers (L1 and L2, previously assigned to the mycolate-PG-AG (mAGP) network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sani et al., 2010</xref>)); and iii) the cytoplasmic membrane (CM) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). We observed a significant increase in the thickness of the overall cell envelope (OM-CM) in the <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> strain compared to the WT. This difference was largely explained by the expansion of the CM-L1 layer, which appeared also more granulated, suggesting cell wall alterations closer to the cell membrane and indicating aberrant production of either AG, PG or both. Complementation of <italic>virR</italic> restored normal cell envelope structure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A-C</xref>).</p>

<p>In Gram-negative bacteria increased vesiculation has been observed in conditions associated with either loss or maintenance of periplasm integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">McMillan and Kuehn, 2021</xref>). Moreover, a novel mechanism of vesicle production common to both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria has recently been described, in which a cell explosion phenomenon driven by bacteriophages leads to the formation of EVs in culture when bacteria are under genotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Nagakubo et al., 2021</xref>). Consequently, we tested whether the enhanced vesiculation described in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Rath et al., 2013</xref>) could be linked to cell lysis events. To do this, we analyzed the presence of cytoplasmic IdeR, a transcription factor which is not present in EVs and is not detected in secreted proteins preparations, in culture supernatants of <italic>Mtb</italic> strains, assuming that its detection could be linked to a loss of envelope integrity (Gupta et al., 2023). We first confirmed that the <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> strain manifested an enhanced vesiculation by measuring EVs using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig S2A</xref>). We did not detect differences in size distribution of isolated EVs between strains. The same supernatants and cell lysates were used to detect the presence of IdeR by immunoblot using a specific polyclonal antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Pandey and Rodriguez, 2014</xref>). As a control for normal release of an extracellular protein, we used a monoclonal antibody against Ag85b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Prados-Rosales et al., 2017</xref>). We could not detect IdeR in the supernatant of WT and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> strain, but a faint band corresponding to IdeR could be observed in the SN of the <italic>virR</italic> complemented strain (<italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-Comp). These results suggest that the absence of <italic>virR</italic> does not lead to cell lysis but its overexpression may compromise cell envelope integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig S2B</xref>). We validated this approach by serially diluting WT, <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-Comp strains on 7H10 solid media. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig S2D</xref>, we did not observe differences in the number of cells across the diluted spots between strains. Taken together, the observed changes in the cell envelope of high EV producing bacteria suggest that cell envelope alterations in response to lack of VirR and increased membrane vesicle biogenesis may be connected in <italic>Mtb</italic>.</p>

<title>The absence of LytR_C solo domain proteins in <italic>Mtb</italic> leads to enhanced cell envelope permeability concomitant to hypervesiculation</title>
<p>The collective cryoEM observations that indicated an enlargement of the compartment next to the cell membrane may be linked to a more permeable cell envelope. Supporting this notion is the recent finding that <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> or the mutant in the <italic>virR</italic> ortholog <italic>cei</italic> (Rv2700) manifest an enhanced uptake of ethidium bromide (EtBr) relative to WT strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ballister et al., 2019</xref>). We could reproduce these results and add that <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-Comp strain restores the permeability levels of the WT strain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). This enhanced permeability was concomitant to an increased sensitivity to different antitubercular drugs, including meropenem and vancomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ballister et al., 2019</xref>). In agreement with these results, we could measure a significantly enhanced sensitivity of <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>to the PG-targeting drug vancomycin relative to WT and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-Comp strains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>).

<p>Furthermore, we observed enhanced incorporation of fluorescent D-amino acids (FDAAs) in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> relative to the WT and complemented strains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). These probes can freely enter cells and may be incorporated into PG by at least three different mechanisms, depending on the species: through the cytoplasmic steps of PG biosynthesis and via two distinct transpeptidation reactions taking place in the periplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kuru et al., 2019</xref>). Consequently, the differential labeling observed in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>relative to WT strain may be a consequence of altered PG turnover in the mutant.</p>
<p>We then tested whether the enhanced permeability and vesiculation of <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> are also connected in an <italic>Mtb</italic> mutant lacking <italic>cei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ballister et al., 2019</xref>). To do this, we generated <italic>cei</italic> conditional mutants using the CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Rock et al., 2017</xref>). Further, we also generated <italic>virR</italic> CRISPRi conditional mutants to properly compare both strains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). When these strains were cultured in the presence of anhydrotetracycline (ATc) to induce the transcriptional silencing of target genes, we could measure enhanced vesiculation by analyzing vesicle concentration in the supernatant by NTA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>), relative to strains cultured in the absence of ATc. Overall, these results validate the enhanced permeability phenotype of <italic>Mtb</italic> mutants in the LytR_C solo domain proteins VirR and Cei and establish that this subfamily of proteins participates in the regulation of vesicle production in <italic>Mtb</italic>. Moreover, the higher susceptibility to PG-cross-linking inhibitors in both mutants and the enhanced incorporation of FDAAs in the <italic>virR</italic> mutant strain suggests defects in PG remodeling.</p>

<title>Transcriptional profiling of <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> showcases systemic alterations in cell wall architecture and metabolism</title>
<p>To identify <italic>virR</italic>-dependent mediators of vesicle production, we carried out a transcriptional profiling of <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>and compared it to those from a WT and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-Comp strains. Previous efforts to define the transcriptional profile of <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> showed no significant differences compared to WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Rath et al., 2013</xref>). However, those experiments were carried out with bacteria grown in rich 7H9 medium, while here we use a defined high-Fe minimal medium (MM), which is typically used for vesiculation experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Prados-Rosales et al., 2011</xref>). We extracted RNA from four independent cultures (average optical densities (OD) of 0.40, 0.38 and 0.42 for WT, <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>, and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> -Comp, respectively) one day before vesicle isolation, and conducted RNA-seq (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). Principal component analysis (PCA) was then performed on the transcriptomic data, after filtering out lowly expressed genes, as well as genes containing outlier observations (N=3985 genes tested, see Methods), and revealed significant differences between strains. The first principal component, explaining 49% of the variance, separated <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> strain samples from strains bearing functional copies of <italic>virR</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>, WT and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-Comp vs <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>, one-tailed Mann-Whitney test p=2.02E-2). Furthermore, the second principal component (28.3% variance) captured <italic>virR</italic>-independent effects of mutagenesis on transcriptional profiles, as it separated WT samples from <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-Comp and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> (one-tailed Mann-Whitney test p=2.02E-2). After PCA, we conducted differential expression analysis between strains to find 1808, and 2230 genes differentially expressed in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>compared to either WT, or <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-Comp strains, respectively (Supplementary file S1, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>, Benjamini-Hochberg FDR&lt;0.05), representing 45.4% and 56.0% of all genes tested. Although transcriptional profiles of the WT and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-Comp strains are also significantly diverse, with up to 2184 differentially expressed genes between them, the differences in expression between <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> when compared to either WT or <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> -Comp are significantly correlated (r=0.63, p&lt;2.2e-16), and the sets of both upregulated and downregulated genes in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> vs any of the other strains are mutually, directionally enriched (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). Finally, we defined a set of N=399 genes that are simultaneously upregulated in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> with respect to any of the two strains containing functional copies of <italic>virR</italic> (logFC&gt;0 and FDR&lt;0.05 for both <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> vs WT and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> vs <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-Comp), as well as a set of N=502 genes downregulated in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> vs both <italic>virR</italic>-containing strains. This way, the differential expression signature found for these genes in the <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>strain is most likely VirR-dependent and not-induced by non-specific consequences of the mutagenesis procedures.</p>

<p>Next, we looked for gene ontologies (GO) enriched among these <italic>virR</italic>-dependent genes, stratified by the direction of the effects (399 up-regulated, and 502 down-regulated in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> relative to WT and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-Comp alike). A total of 51 GO terms related with biological processes and cell compartment appeared significantly enriched among genes upregulated in the <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> strain (FDR=10%), while 85 terms were enriched among downregulated genes (FDR=10%, see Methods, and supplementary file S2). When focusing on the most prominent of these enrichments (OR&gt;2), the analyses highlighted several groups of biological processes and cell compartment ontologies that appeared altered in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> with respect to both WT and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-Comp strains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>).</p>
<p>First, among genes that were expressed at lower levels in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>, we found terms related to several stresses associated with the intra-phagosomal environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Schnappinger et al., 2003</xref>), such as response to hypoxia (FDR=1.7E-5), heat (FDR = 2.2E-2) or response to metal ions (FDR=3.4E-2), suggesting that responses to host-induced stress are compromised in the mutant, as it is also suggested by the weaker, albeit significant enrichments of responses to host immune response (OR=1.88, FDR=7.47e-02, not highlighted in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>). Furthermore, the mutant strain showed a reduction in transcripts related with secretion (FDR=7.6e-03), and, specifically, protein secretion by the type VII secretion system (FDR=5.2 e-03). Contributing to this enrichment, we found that the key antigen ESAT-6 was significantly down-regulated in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> with respect to both WT (log2FC=-0.17, FDR=4.1E-3) and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-Comp strains (log2FC=-0.19, FDR=2.6E-3), while <italic>cfp10</italic> (Rv3874), was similarly less expressed in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> than in WT (log2FC=-0.24, FDR=2.6E-3).</p>
<p>Second, we found enriched terms related with lipid metabolism and transport both among the sets of genes up and downregulated in the <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> strain. On the one hand, genes downregulated in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> appeared enriched in fatty acid biosynthetic processes (FDR=6.7E-2), suggesting that the regulation of both anabolic and catabolic pathways of lipids, key for bacterial survival and pathogenesis upon infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ghazaei, 2018</xref>), are, at least in part, VirR-dependent. Furthermore, the mutant strain also shows a significant induction of a number of GO terms related with cell wall composition (e.g. cell wall organization: FDR=3.9e-2), including terms associated with the biosynthesis key components of the mycobacterial cell wall such as PDIMs (DIM/DIP cell wall layer assembly enrichment FDR=9.5e-03) and importantly peptidoglycan (peptidoglycan-based cell wall biogenesis FDR=2.2e-2) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, we found a series of enrichments related with global regulation of gene expression (positive: FDR=4.4e-2, negative: FDR=5.4e-2), and RNA biosynthesis (positive: FDR=5.4e-2, negative: FDR=5.8e-2), among genes downregulated in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>, suggesting a global alteration of the transcriptional landscape in the mutant.</p>
<p>Fourth, we found that metabolic reprogramming in the <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>strain is not restricted to lipids but also involves amino acids (cellular amino acid metabolic processes FDR=2.1e-3), and carbohydrates (cellular carbohydrate biosynthetic process FDR=6.8e-3), enriched among genes upregulated in the mutant. Similarly, energy production also appears altered in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>, with related GO terms enriched among downregulated genes, such as electron transfer activity, (FDR=4.2e-2), as well as terms enriched among upregulated genes in the mutant such as NADH dehydrogenase activity, (FDR=3.3e-3). All together, these results combined with the differences concerning lipid metabolism discussed above, suggest a global remodeling of metabolic networks in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>.</p>

<title><italic>virR</italic>-dependent genes intersect the regulons of key transcriptional regulators of responses to stress, dormancy, and cell wall remodeling</title>
<p>To shed light on the specific transcriptional circuits whose disruption in the <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> strain may lead to the differential gene expression patterns described, we resorted to the regulon annotations previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Minch et al., 2015</xref>). In this work, authors collected ChIP-seq data on binding events between a panel of transcription factors (TFs) and DNA to annotate interactions between 143 regulators and the promoters of 7248 target genes (peaks between -150 and +70 nucleotides from transcription staring sites). Capitalizing on these data, we interrogated whether the sets of genes up- (N=399) and downregulated in the <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> strain (N=502) were significantly enriched among each of the regulons reported by Minch et al. A total number of 10 regulons appeared enriched among either down (9) or upregulated genes (1) in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> (Supplementary file S3 and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>, highlighted TFs at OR&gt;2 FDR&lt;0.1). Furthermore, the expression of 7 out of 10 of the TFs controlling these regulons was itself found to be <italic>virR</italic>-dependent in our transcriptional data (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). Genes more highly expressed in the <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> strain appeared significantly enriched among Rv0339 targets (OR=9.1, FDR=7.5E-2, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>), named IniR because of its role as key regulator of the isoniazid-induced operon <italic>iniBAC</italic>, a key element of the response to cell wall biosynthesis inhibition induced by isoniazid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Boot et al., 2017</xref>) and linked to vesicle biogenesis in <italic>Mtb</italic> (Gupta et al., 2023). Several additional transcription factors known to regulate cell wall biosynthesis and homeostasis were also enriched among genes downregulated in the <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> strain. These include SigF (OR=5.8, FDR=8.1E-2), a sigma factor controlling cell envelope organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Williams et al., 2007</xref>), <italic>mtrA</italic> (OR=2.2, FDR=6.0E-2), a TF controlling peptidoglycan cleavage and alterations in the context of regulation of cell growth and division, whose disruption has recently been shown to lead to increased permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Peterson et al., 2023</xref>); as well as Rv0472c (OR=11.7, FDR=3.5E-2), a transcription factor involved in the regulation of mycolate remodeling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Peterson et al., 2019</xref>), a process used by the pathogen upon phagocytosis to evade macrophage-induced stress and enter dormancy. Interestingly, two genes under the control of Rv0472c, that are key to enable this process, are the mycolate desaturases <italic>desA1</italic> and <italic>desA2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Peterson et al., 2019</xref>), which appear downregulated in the <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> strain with respect to WT (logFC=-0.4, -0.1; FDR=2.3E-11, 3.2E-2, for <italic>desA1</italic>, and <italic>desA2</italic>, respectively), as well as with respect to <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-Comp (logFC=-0.4, -0.4; FDR=7.2E-12, 5.3E-21). Furthermore, Rv0472c has also been linked with the regulation of key proteins in the response to several sources of stress in <italic>Mtb</italic>, such as the putative nitroreductase Rv3131 (response to oxidative/nitrosative stress), as well as the triacylglycerol synthase <italic>tgs1</italic>, responsible for the synthesis and accumulation of triacylglycerol, a major energy source for the bacterium during dormancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chauhan and Tyagi, 2009</xref>), both of which are strongly downregulated in the <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> strain vs both WT: (logFC=-1.2, -1.7; FDR=3.1E-19, 3.2E-14) and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-Comp (logFC=-0.4, -1.9; FDR=3.9E-5, 1.4E-17).</p>

Three of the four remaining TFs whose regulons we found enriched among <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> downregulated genes have been similarly linked to the response to assorted sources of stress that are cardinal features of the phagosome environment, such as oxidative stress, response to toxic metals, and low pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Schnappinger et al., 2003</xref>). These include the regulator <italic>lsr2</italic> (OR=2.3, FDR=5.1E-4), a global histone-like protein responsible from protecting the DNA physically from oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bartek et al., 2014</xref>), the zinc-uptake regulator Zur (<italic>furB</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Maciaąg et al., 2007</xref>) (OR=8.8, FDR=4.5E-2), and <italic>tcrX</italic> (OR=2.6, FDR=5.0E-2), part of the recently characterized acid-sensing two-component system tcrXY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Stupar et al., 2024</xref>).

<title>Cell envelope permeability is a major driver of MEV release</title>
<p>If enhanced cell permeability is a global consequence of <italic>virR</italic> disruption that leads to enhanced vesiculation, we hypothesized that other conditions either inducing or decreasing cell envelope permeability could lead to alterations in vesicle production in <italic>Mtb</italic>. To test this, we treated <italic>Mtb</italic> with sublethal concentrations of thioridazine (TRZ), a known enhancer of cell permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">De Keijzer et al., 2016</xref>); and, alternatively, we cultured the bacillus with cholesterol as a sole carbon source, a condition which reduces mycobacterial cell permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Brzostek et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). The enrichment of the DevR regulon among the genes that are downregulated in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> is also suggestive of the existence of a convergent regulatory route controlling both cell permeability and vesiculation under control of this transcription factor, whose activation has been described as a key part of the pathogen’s transcriptomic response to cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Soto-Ramirez et al., 2017</xref>), concomitant to a reduction in cellular permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Brzostek et al., 2009</xref>). Importantly, neither cholesterol nor TRZ altered bacterial viability as measured by the absence of the release of the transcription factor IdeR, as an indication of cell lysis or by spotting serially diluted cultures on solid medium from the corresponding conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig S2C</xref><bold>,D</bold>). We then measured vesicle levels in culture supernatants and found that <italic>Mtb</italic> significantly releases more EVs upon treatment with TRZ, and significantly reduces vesicle release in the presence of cholesterol as a sole carbon source (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>), as measured by dot blot after normalization to colony forming units (CFUs). These results strongly suggest that cell envelope permeability determines the magnitude of the vesiculation phenomenon in <italic>Mtb</italic>. We next investigated whether common transcriptional features underpin the regulation of cell envelope permeability in the tested conditions. To do that, we compared the transcriptional response of <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> with that of available datasets including <italic>Mtb</italic> cultured in the presence of 0.01% of cholesterol as a sole carbon source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Pawełczyk et al., 2021</xref>), and <italic>Mtb</italic> treated with 6 μg ml-1 of TRZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dutta et al., 2010</xref>). Experimentally, we retrieved the set of genes up and downregulated in <italic>Mtb</italic> grown in cholesterol vs glucose-rich culture media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Brzostek et al., 2009</xref>), and interrogated whether those genes were enriched among the sets of differentially expressed genes in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> vs WT, and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> vs <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-Comp reported in this study (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). Interestingly, we found that those genes whose expression changed in the same direction in conditions associated with low, or high permeability, in both studies were mutually enriched, while the cross-comparisons between sets with opposite responses to low-permeability-associated treatments in both studies led to significant depletion statistics. These results validate the initial hypothesis according to which changes in permeability induced by these two treatments are linked to the activation of a common transcriptional program. The inspection of genes that are simultaneously upregulated in treatments associated with low permeability in both studies identified DevR as a putative regulator associated with the orchestration of this transcriptional footprint of low cell permeability. The two-component system DevS-DevR (also known as DosS-DosR) has a well-known role as a global regulator of the transition to dormancy, and its regulon is consistently upregulated in non-permeable dormant bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Honaker et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>Interestingly, authors found that low-permeability bacteria cultured in a cholesterol medium, albeit featuring a regular growing phenotype, activated the DosR regulon, suggesting that cell wall remodeling leading to a decrease in permeability linked with the induction of DosR can be triggered independently to the transcriptional regulatory programs leading to growth arrest and dormancy in <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Pawełczyk et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, the integration of the genes that are downregulated in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> validates this hypothesis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig S4</xref>), since not only the intersection between the DevR regulon and the set of genes downregulated in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> are significantly larger than expected by chance (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>, OR=2.67, p=2.7E-7), but also the intersection between DevR regulon and the genes that are activated by cholesterol in Brzostek et al. data (OR=1.89, p=3.5e-5). 30 out of the 173 genes annotated in the DosR regulon described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Minch et al., 2015</xref>) are simultaneously upregulated in conditions linked to low permeability in both studies.</p>
<p>A similar analytic approach for the comparison of the response of <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> and the response to the drug TRZ, a treatment well-known for inducing an increase in permeability in <italic>Mtb</italic>-treated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dutta et al., 2010</xref>) (GSE16626), led to conceptually similar results, with genes simultaneously downregulated in both TRZ and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> (OR=1.96, p=9.1E-4) being enriched. Interestingly, among the 22 genes showing the largest, and most significant repression effects by both treatments (log2FC&gt;0.25 &amp; FDR&lt;0.05 simultaneously, for TRZ effects, <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> vs WT), we found 4 genes whose functions are related with metal nutrients uptake and homeostasis, such as genes encoding the bacterioferritin BrfB, the metal exporter CtpJ, the cupper regulator CsoR and Moew, involved in Molibdenum-cofactors biosynthesis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>). Taken together, these analyses highlight the transcriptional parallels between <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> and both TRZ and cholesterol conditions, which strongly suggests the existence of a common transcriptional signature associated with the control of cell permeability.</p>

<title>Modulation of EV levels and permeability in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> by cholesterol and TRZ</title>
<p>We next wondered about the effect of culturing <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> on both cholesterol or TRZ could have on cell growth, permeability and EV production. In the case of cholesterol, it has also been shown to affect other aspects of physiology (redox, respiration, ATP), which can directly affect permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lu et al., 2017</xref>). We monitored <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>growth in MM supplemented with either glycerol, cholesterol as a sole carbon source, or TRZ at 3 ug ml<sup>-1</sup> for 20 days. While cholesterol significantly enhanced the growth <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> after 5 days relative to glycerol medium, supplementation of glycerol medium with TRZ restricted growth during the whole time-course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Fig S5A</xref>). The study of cell permeability in the same conditions indicated that the enhanced cell permeability observed in glycerol MM was reduced when <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> when cultured with cholesterol as sole carbon source. Conversely, the presence of TRZ increased cell permeability relative to the medium containing solely glycerol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Fig S5C</xref>). As we have previously observed for the WT strain, either condition (Chol or TRZ) also modified vesiculation levels in the mutant accordingly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Fig S5B</xref>). These results strongly indicates that other aspects of mycobacterial physiology besides permeability are also affected in the absence of VirR and may contribute to the observed enhanced vesiculation.</p>

<title><italic>virR</italic> regulates the protein content of EVs in <italic>Mtb</italic></title>
<p>To capture the impact of transcriptional adaptation to the proteome, and the degree of divergence between transcriptional shifts and proteins changes observed in the absence of <italic>virR</italic>, we next performed label-free peptide mass spectrometry (LF-MS) of whole cell lysates (WCLs) of <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>, WT, and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-Comp strains. Additionally, we isolated EVs from axenic cultures and obtained their proteomic composition to examine for potential VirR-dependent differences in protein cargo that may alter the functionality of EVs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). As a result, we obtained proteomic profiles across strains and cell compartments for a total of N=935 proteins. Upon PCA analysis of the proteomic data (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>), we found that the first principal component (PC1), explaining 36.9% of total variance, separated samples from WCLs and EVs in all strains (PC1 differs across cell compartments: one-tailed Mann Whitney test p=2.1e-05), while the second PC (PC2) (13.6% of total variance explained) captured strain effects on the proteomic footprint only among EVs (one tailed Mann Whitney t test for PC2 differences between <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> EVs and those from either WT or <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-Comp strains (one-tailed Mann Whitney p=1.2 e-02). These results suggest that differences in protein abundances between EVs and WCLs are larger than differences found between strains, and that, concerning the differences across strains, these are more important among EVs. To verify this, we conducted differential protein expression analyses to find barely 27 proteins differentially expressed between <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> and any of the two <italic>virR</italic>-expressing strains, which represents 2.9% of the total of proteins under analyses (supplementary file S4). Despite the scarcity of significant differences in expression across strains in WCLs, some of the features most differentially expressed in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> are, besides VirR itself (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>), proteins involved in key processes for bacterial survival and virulence, including key metabolic enzymes such as the Acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase Acs (logFC = -3.92 (FDR=4.5e-3) and -2.96 (FDR=5.2E-2) for the differences between <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> and WT, and between <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-Comp, respectively), as well as FprA, (logFC= -3.12, FDR=4.5e-3 e-02 for <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-WT and logFC= -2.16, FDR=5.9 e-02 for <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-<italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-Comp), involved in the reduction of NADP+ into NADPH, both downregulated in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>.</p>

<p>Conversely to the WCL dataset, we did find more frequent differences in protein expression across strains in EVs, with as many as 361, and 382 proteins differentially expressed in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> EVs when compared to those from WT and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-Comp strains, respectively (supplementary file S4, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>). This represents 38.6 and 40.9% of all proteins tested, respectively. Similarly to what was observed at the level of RNA expression, differences in expression for the contrasts (<italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-WT) and (<italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-<italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-Comp) were directionally enriched (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E</xref>), thus motivating the definition of two sets of proteins that 1) were observed at higher levels in the EVs isolated from <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> than in those from both WT and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> -Comp strains (N=117 <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> -upregulated proteins); or 2) were observed at lower levels in the EVs from <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>than in those from any of the other two strains (N=108 <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-downregulated proteins). Interestingly, as many as 21 out of the 117 proteins that appeared enriched in <italic>VirR<sup>mut</sup></italic> EVs were also upregulated in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>at the transcriptional level (One-sided Fisher exact test of enrichment OR=2.02, p=7.0e-3) suggesting that at least a part of these differences in EVs’ protein cargo are a consequence of differences in gene expression already observed at a transcriptional level. Notwithstanding that, proteins appearing at lower concentrations in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> EVs were not enriched among genes bearing significant transcriptional effects in the mutant. Regarding downregulated EV proteins in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> we observed robust enrichments in GO terms related with protein biosynthesis, including translation (FDR=9.8 e-22), ribosome (FDR=5.3 e-29), and ribosome biogenesis (FDR=4.1 e-27, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6F</xref> and supplementary file S5). Consistent with these results, 44 ribosomal proteins (out of 49 detected) were found to be significantly less expressed in the <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>strain relative to either WT or <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-Comp strains (FDR&lt;0.05 for at least one comparison), while no ribosomal protein appeared significantly upregulated in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>. Furthermore, 30 of these proteins were simultaneously downregulated in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> when compared to both VirR-containing strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig S6</xref>) implying a stark ribosomal depletion in the EVs in the absence of VirR. Furthermore, we found that the two bacterioferritin proteins BfrA and BfrB were simultaneously less abundant in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> than in both WT and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-Comp strains (logFC&lt;-1.5 and FDR&lt;7.3E-4, for differences <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> vs WT and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> vs <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-Comp in both genes, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6G</xref>, and supplementary file S4), together contributing to the enrichment of the GO term ferroxidase activity (FDR=6.4 e-02, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6F</xref>). This result is suggestive of a possible defect of <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> EVs in iron sequestration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Mohammadzadeh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Prados-Rosales et al., 2014b</xref>). We also found a series of metabolic pathways enriched among proteins upregulated in the EVs of the <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> strain, including enzymes involved in metabolism of nucleotides (e.g. purine nucleotide biosynthetic process FDR=2.0e-02, amino acids (alpha amino acids FDR=8.3e-04), as well as carbohydrates (hexose metabolic process FDR=6.3e-2), whose catabolism appears also enriched among proteins downregulated in the mutant (e.g. glycolytic process FDR=2.2e-2 and carbohydrate catabolic process FDR=4.7E-2). The simultaneous enrichments of these metabolic pathways observed both among upregulated and downregulated vesicular proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Fig S7</xref>), indicates a complex, VirR-dependent, rewiring of metabolic routes in the vesicles from the mutant strain.</p>
<p>Further, proteins upregulated in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> EVs (N=117) were enriched in terms related to mycolic acids metabolic processes (FDR=2.1E-2), and peptidoglycan-based cell-wall biogenesis (FDR=9.0 e-02). Proteins such as InhA (logFC=3.71, 2.26 FDR=2.20 e-05, and 1.4E-3 for comparisons <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> vs WT and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> vs <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-Comp, respectively), and KasB (logFC=1.83; 2.49 FDR=2.23 e-02; 4.4e-3), involved in mycolic acid metabolism were also upregulated in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6H</xref>).</p>
<p>The upregulation of these proteins, along with the enrichments at the transcriptional level of DIM/DIP biosynthetic pathways (upregulated in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>), suggests a shift in the control of the pool of propionyl-CoA, both at the level of its production, -as a byproduct of the catabolism of methyl-branched lipids, odd-chain-length fatty acids as well as cholesterol-and its detoxification by the bacterium through different routes, such as the methylmalonyl pathway, the glyoxylate cycle and the methylcitrate cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). To shed light on these changes at the metabolic level, we conducted a metabolic profiling to quantify the concentration of metabolites that are central in these different detoxification routes including propionyl-CoA: acetyl-CoA, pyruvate, methylcitrate, and methylmalonyl-CoA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6I</xref>). Only methylmalonyl-CoA was found to be significantly repressed in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> (p=0.028). We also observed differences between <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-Comp strains in methylcitrate. This result, along with the trend towards increased protein, and especially gene expression that is observed for genes involved in the biosynthesis of PDIMs from methylmalonyl (including phenolpthiocerol synthesis type-I polyketide synthases A-E, (ppsA-E, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6I</xref>), among others), suggests that the methylmalonyl pool is depleted in the mutant strain because of an increased activity of the PDIM biosynthetic pathway. Furthermore, most of the subunits of the acetyl/propionyl-CoA carboxylase Acc (AccA1, AccA2, AccA3, AccD1, AccD5 appear repressed in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> EVs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6I</xref>), suggesting that the production of methylmalonyl Co-A from the degradation of propionyl CoA is inhibited within EVs of the mutant strain.</p>
<p>Taken together, the omics analyses align with the structural and functional differences observed in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>. We reasoned that the increased expression of PDIMs biosynthetic genes and the reduced expression of genes related to protein synthesis may be triggered to compensate the enhanced permeability measured in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>. In addition, this enhanced permeability leads to an increase in the release of EV, which seems to be depleted in ribosomes and iron storage proteins.</p>

<title>The absence of VirR leads to an aberrant enlargement of PG in <italic>Mtb</italic></title>
<p>To elucidate the specific molecular defects that explain the periplasm enlargement, the enhanced permeability, and the antibiotic sensitivity phenotypes, we performed a biochemical analysis of WT and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>cell envelopes. First, we analyzed the total lipid profile by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and observed significant differences in prevalent polar lipids linked to the cell membrane including, lysophosphatidic and phosphatidic acid, species of monoacylated and diacylated glycerol, phosphatidylethanolamines and phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannoside (PIM) species, being more abundant in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>relative to WT and complementing strain. (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>). To validate these results, we ran thin layer chromatography (TLC) experiments on the same lipid extracts and found that the mutant carries more phospholipids in the membrane including more AcPIM<sub>2</sub> and PE (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>). Moreover, we could not measure major differences in the level of mycolic acid species (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref>), while significantly more PDIMs were detected in the mutant relative to the other strains (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D</xref>). This later result partially validates proteomics and metabolomic data and suggest that the methylmalonyl pool is depleted in the mutant strain because of an increased activity of the PDIM biosynthetic pathway. However, other lipids including SL1 or PAT/DAT that share a common precursor (propionyl-CoA) with PDIM may also explain the depletion of methylmalonyl. Notably, we observed a reduction in the level of these lipids (SL1 or PAT/DAT) in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> cultured in glycerol relative to WT and complemented strains, suggesting that the excess of PDIM synthesis can take away methyl malonyl CoA from the biosynthesis of SL-1 and PAT/DAT in the absence of VirR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Fig S8</xref>).</p>

<p>When analyzing apolar lipids, we also observed increased levels of free mycolic acids (FMA) and free fatty acids (FFA) upon <italic>virR</italic> deletion (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7E</xref>). The enhanced release of these apolar lipids has also been documented in a <italic>C. glutamicum</italic> mutant in Cg0847 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Baumgart et al., 2016</xref>), a canonical LCP protein. Importantly, we could not detect any of these lipids in EVs from <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7F</xref>), while major polar phospholipids could be resolved in EVs from all strains (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7G</xref>), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Prados-Rosales et al., 2011</xref>).

<p>Next, we performed a glycosyl composition analysis of isolated cell walls (including mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex) and determined that there were no significant differences between strains in AG content as well as in the ratio between arabinose and galactose (A/G) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8A</xref>). Similarly, no changes were observed in the galactan length as measured by the ratio between galactose (G) and rhamnose (R) G/R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Justen et al., 2020</xref>). We noticed that the ratio between N-acetylglucosamine (NAGc) and rhamnose (R) (NAGc/R) was significantly higher in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> relative to WT, suggesting an increase in PG content in this strain (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8A</xref>).

<p>We next obtained pure PG preparations of each strain and performed an analysis by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Fig S9</xref>). This technique has been recently used to investigate the nanometric features of isolated Gram-positive bacterial cell walls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Pasquina-Lemonche et al., 2020</xref>). Semi-automated analysis of liquid AFM images from mycobacterial isolated PG samples revealed that: (i) the absence of VirR leads to a significant reduction in PG pore diameter (down to 9.2 ± 0.6 nm) relative to WT (16 ± 3.3 nm) and complemented strains (10 ± 0.8 nm) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8C, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Fig S9</xref>); (ii) the number of pores is significantly higher in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>compared to WT and complemented strain (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Fig S9</xref>); (iii) manual analysis of AFM images in ambient conditions revealed that <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> PG is significantly thicker than that of the other strains of the study (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8F</xref>). These results show for the first time the nanometric architecture of isolated PG in mycobacteria by AFM and suggest a role for VirR in regulating PG thickness and porosity. Strikingly, we found that the PG enlargement observed in the <italic>virR</italic><sup>mut</sup> correlated with increased susceptibility to the muramidase lysozyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">Fig S10</xref>), indicating modifications in PG remodeling in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>. In fact, a deeper MS analysis of PG showed a significant increase in the abundance of deacetylated muropeptides in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> relative WT and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>-Comp strain (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8G, H</xref>). This PG feature has been linked to variability in lysozyme susceptibility in other Gram positive bacterial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bera et al., 2005</xref>). Collectively, although the structural changes at nanoscopic level of the peripheral areas of the cell observed by AFM leads to a more dense and thick structure harder to penetrate, the chemical changes in the peptidoglycan structure observed and biochemical assays suggest that changes associated with alterations in VirR-regulated PG remodeling makes the wall more permeable and support increased release of EV in <italic>Mtb</italic>.</p>

<title>VirR interacts with canonical LCP proteins</title>
<p>As mentioned above VirR is a LytR_C solo domain protein with no catalytic LCP domain. Other members of the LCP protein family like Rv3267 and Rv3287 are the main PG-AG ligases (Grzegorzewicz et al., 2016; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Harrison et al., 2016</xref>) and also carry a LytR_C domain. We have previously shown that VirR interacts with itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Rath et al., 2013</xref>). Consequently, we reasoned that if VirR contributed to PG-AG ligation it could do it via interaction with canonical LCP proteins through the LytR_C domain. Although VirR is one of the most abundant proteins found in tuberculin preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Prasad et al., 2013</xref>), we determined that it localizes at sites of nascent cell wall by fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs11">Fig S11</xref>). Therefore, its location could initially allow for interactions with other cell surface proteins like LCP. Both recombinant VirR and the main AG-PG ligase Lcp1 (Rv3267) oligomerize in a blue-native PAGE gel (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig 9A</xref>). This observation suggests that they interact with proteins sharing similar domain features. We next performed a flotation assay where we examined the behavior of VirR on an iodixanol gradient in the presence or absence of Lcp1. Using a specific antibody raised against VirR, we observed that the presence of Lcp1 displaces the relative location of VirR toward upper fractions of the gradient, indicating a potential interaction of both proteins and the formation of higher molecular weight complexes (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig 9B</xref>). To investigate the interaction of virR and Lcp1, along with other Lcp proteins, in a more physiological environment we used the bipartite splitGFP approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cabantous et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig 9C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs12">Fig S12</xref>), which has been recently utilized to demonstrate the co-localization and interaction of the membrane-bound metal ATPase CtpC with the chaperon PacL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Boudehen et al., 2022</xref>). We first recapitulated the VirR self-interaction and added that such interaction implicates the LytR_C domain since no differences in fluorescence were measured between full and truncated versions of VirR (VirRsol) lacking the first 41 amino acids. As negative controls, we included interactions between VirR and the cell surface associated metal ATPase CtpC (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig 9C</xref>). When testing interactions between VirR and other Lcp proteins (Rv0822c, Lcp1 (Rv3267) and Rv3284) we could not measure any GFP signal when full Lcp proteins were used in the assay. Conversely, a significant increase in fluorescence was measured for all combinations when truncated Lcp proteins including either the C-terminal domain or specifically the LytR_C domain were tested (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig 9C</xref>). These results strongly suggest that VirR interacts with Lcp proteins and that these interactions occur via LytR_C terminal domains.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We reported <italic>virR</italic> as the first gene implicated in the biogenesis of EVs in <italic>Mtb</italic> ten years back (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Rath et al., 2013</xref>). A transposon mutant in <italic>virR</italic> (<italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>) overproduces MEVs and this provokes augmentation of cytokine responses in mouse and human macrophages. This mutant manifested an attenuated phenotype in experimental infections on macrophages and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Beaulieu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Rath et al., 2013</xref>). Such studies established that VirR has a role in virulence by negatively modulating the release of MEVs. These studies provided evidence that vesiculogenesis in <italic>Mtb</italic> is genetically regulated. Since then, conditions such as iron starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Prados-Rosales et al., 2014b</xref>) and other genes, including the bacterial dynamin-like <italic>iniAC</italic> (Gupta et al., 2023), and the Pst/SenX3-RegX3 signal transduction system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">White et al., 2018</xref>) have been shown to contribute to the biogenesis of MEVs. Interestingly, VirR, a LytR_C solo domain protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig S1</xref>), shares homology with Lcp proteins, which in <italic>Mtb</italic> are known to participate in the enzymatic connection between AG and PG (Grzegorzewicz et al., 2016; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Harrison et al., 2016</xref>). This suggests VirR function might be linked to cell wall remodeling.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated how VirR can control the magnitude of MEV release in <italic>Mtb</italic>. We did this by studying the underlying enhanced vesiculogenesis phenomenon observed in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>using genetic, transcriptiomics, proteomics and ultrastructural and biochemical methods. It was clear from our cryo-EM studies that <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> has an aberrant cell wall as the layer above the cell membrane was significantly larger than that of WT and complemented strains. The enlarged compartment showed higher granular texture, a feature that has been previously associated to PG precursors in unrelated Gram-positive bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Zuber et al., 2006</xref>). This observation and previous studies showing the increased sensitivity of <italic>VirR<sup>mut</sup></italic> to vancomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ballister et al., 2019</xref>) strongly suggested that the cell wall defect is connected to PG remodeling. The use of AFM on isolated PG confirmed this and showed for the first time the nanostructure of PG in <italic>Mtb</italic>, providing information on PG thickness, pore size and number of pores. AFM indicated that <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>PG is thicker, has significantly more pores of small size. Considering the pore sizes measured across strains (ranging from 9-16 nm), we initially ruled out the notion that EVs (which are spheres of 50-300 nm in diameter) are released through the peripheral cell wall. Therefore, <italic>Mtb</italic> must have an alternative mechanism to release EVs, possible during the division process where the PG is most fragile, presumably due to defects in crosslinking, something that awaits further experimental verification. These events were not possible to visualize in AFM given that PG fragments from all the strains were lacking the poles or clearly defined division sites but could be the subject of further studies in the future. However, we cannot exclude that MEV plasticity could allow for crossing the cell wall via PG pores.</p>
<p>A recent study showed that <italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum</italic> can produce and release different types of MVs through different routes, including mycomembrane blebbing or bubbling cell death, depending on the stress at which <italic>C. glutamicum</italic> is exposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Nagakubo et al., 2021</xref>). In the present study, we have shown that <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> overproduces EVs under normal growing conditions in the absence of cell lysis, according to our assay which measured cytoplasmic leaking of the transcription factor IdeR or serially diluted spots on solid medium. Overall, we show that EV production in <italic>Mtb</italic> under our growing conditions, is not linked to cell death. This fact largely excludes the bubbling cell death mechanism. Moreover, our lipidomic analysis now and before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Prados-Rosales et al., 2011</xref>) indicates the absence of mycomembrane lipids in isolated MEVs from all strains, ruling out that MEVs originate at the mycomembrane. These apparent disagreements with the <italic>C. glutamicum</italic> study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Nagakubo et al., 2021</xref>) might indicate that <italic>Mtb</italic> EV biogenesis may differ from that of <italic>C glutamicum</italic>, and other mycolic acid-containing bacteria with shorter fatty acids. Additional variables that may explain differences between studies is the growth media and the time at which vesicles are isolated (Gupta et al., 2023). Of note, <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> EVs were isolated at day 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Nagakubo et al., 2021</xref>), a time at which this fast-growing mycobacteria is already in stationary phase.</p>
<p>The transcriptional profile of <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> can provide a partial explanation for the attenuated phenotype of the mutant due to a downregulation of genes activated upon stresses associated to the intraphagosomal environment. It is particularly interesting to observe the specific reduction in transcript levels of the two most important effectors of the esx-1 secretion system. On the other hand, genes involved in PDIM synthesis were upregulated. It is possible that the specific upregulation of PDIM synthesis in absence of <italic>virR</italic> is part of compensatory response to a reduced permeability. We were surprised to find no differences between protein profiles in whole cells between WT and <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>strains, despite difference in transcriptomics. A biological interpretation of these results would point to the existence of global compensatory mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation used by the bacteria to partially recover comparable proteomic profiles in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>to those observed in the WT.</p>
<p>Contrary to whole cell lysates, EV protein profiles between <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>and WT were largely different. In this context, it is accepted that certain proteins and lipids are enriched in bacterial EVs and that preferential inclusion of such antigens in MVs supports a specific vesicle biogenesis mechanism. In Gram positive bacteria and mycobacteria both membrane and cytosolic proteins are included in EVs since the origin of these structures is linked to the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Prados-Rosales et al., 2011</xref>) and, presumably, the incorporation of intracellular proteins may occur during the process of vesicle formation. We found a higher abundance of proteins related to PG and MA synthesis in <italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic> EVs relative to WT. Therefore, these two processes seem to contribute to EV biogenesis in <italic>Mtb</italic>. Additional data presented in this study, which includes ultrastructural and chemical analyses confirm this. Both PG and MA synthesis are complex processes, including a diverse set of genes. What parts of the biogenesis of these molecules are important for the formation of EVs is a matter of future investigations.</p>
<p>Another finding of the study is the connection between permeability and the magnitude of the vesiculation process in <italic>Mtb</italic>. We linked these two phenomena first, by measuring enhanced vesiculation and permeability in the same strain (<italic>virR<sup>mut</sup></italic>) and second, by modifying the permeability using chemical (via sublethal exposure to TRZ) and nutritional supplements (via providing cholesterol as sole carbon source) in WT <italic>Mtb</italic>. TRZ, a repurposed drug that belongs to the class of phenothiazines, is known to affect respiration in <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Amaral et al., 1996</xref>). It is also assumed that TRZ can inhibit efflux pumps leading to an increased susceptibility to first line antitubercular drugs when tested in combination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">De Knegt et al., 2014</xref>). This provides an explanation for the synergistic effects of such combinations. An independent explanation of such synergy may also come from the increased permeability, as it has been recently shown by a quantitative proteomics analysis of <italic>Mtb</italic> cells exposed to sublethal concentration of TRZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">De Keijzer et al., 2016</xref>). When we grew <italic>Mtb</italic> with cholesterol as a sole carbon source, a condition that slows mycobacterial growth but also reduces cell permeability via cholesterol accumulation in the cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Brzostek et al., 2009</xref>), we observed the opposite trend on MEV biogenesis. We consider this finding of high relevance since <italic>Mtb</italic> permeability is one the major concerns when developing potential antimycobacterial drugs. Nevertheless, bacterial cell permeability is a complex property that it is controlled by physiochemical, biological, and chemical processes such as stereochemistry, lipophilicity, saturation and unsaturation, flexibility, viscosity, fluidity, pressure, temperature and physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Nagamani and Sastry, 2021</xref>). How these variables change to allow the release of MEVs is not known.</p>
<p>This study also proposes a model VirR function whereby VirR may work as a scaffold for canonical Lcp proteins, which in <italic>Mtb</italic> links PG to AG. Based on the demonstration that VirR interacts with canonical Lcp proteins, we believe that the absence of VirR deregulates the localization of canonical Lcp proteins. Although we cannot rule out the contribution of other phenomena including alteration of the PG molecule, VirR is a central scaffold in the cell wall remodeling process. Taking into consideration the fact that <italic>VirR<sup>mut</sup></italic>is attenuated in virulence on preclinical models of infections and manifests an enhanced vesiculogenesis and permeability, VirR may represent a novel and interesting drug target. We envision that targeting VirR may not only make <italic>Mtb</italic> weaker and more permeable to other antitubercular drugs, but to stimulate the immune system, via MEVs, to fight infection.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The present study's main aim is to investigate the mechanism of how VirR controls the magnitude of MEV release in Mtb. The authors used various techniques, including genetics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and ultrastructural and biochemical methods. Several observations were made to link VirR-mediated vesiculogenesis with PG metabolism, lipid metabolism, and cell wall permeability. Finally, the authors presented evidence of a direct physical interaction of VirR with the LCP proteins involved in linking PG with AG, providing clues that VirR might act as a scaffold for LCP proteins and remodel the cell wall of Mtb. Since the Mtb cell wall provides a formidable anatomical barrier for the entry of antibiotics, targeting VirR might weaken the permeability of the pathogen along with the stimulation of the immune system due to enhanced vesiculogenesis. Therefore, VirR could be an excellent drug target. Overall, the study is an essential area of TB biology.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors have done a commendable job of comprehensively examining the phenotypes associated with the VirR mutant using various techniques. Application of Cryo-EM technology confirmed increased thickness and altered arrangement of CM-L1 layer. The authors also confirmed that increased vesicle release in the mutant was not due to cell lysis, which contrasts with studies in other bacterial species.</p>
<p>Another strength of the manuscript is that biochemical experiments show altered permeability and PG turnover in the mutant, which fits with later experiments where authors provide evidence of a direct physical interaction of VirR with LCP proteins.</p>
<p>Transcriptomics and proteomics data were helpful in making connections with lipid metabolism, which the authors confirmed by analyzing the lipids and metabolites of the mutant.</p>
<p>Lastly, using three approaches, the authors confirm that VirR interacts with LCP proteins in Mtb via the LytR_C terminal domain.</p>
<p>Altogether, the work is comprehensive, experiments are designed well, and conclusions were made based on the data generated after verification using multiple complementary approaches.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The major weakness is that the mechanism of VirR-mediated EV release remains enigmatic. Most of the findings are observational and only associate enhanced vesiculogenesis observed in the VirR mutant with cell wall permeability and PG metabolism. Authors suggest that EV release occurs during cell division when PG is most fragile. However, this has yet to be tested in the manuscript - the AFM of the VirR mutant, which produces thicker PG with more pore density, displays enhanced vesiculogenesis. No evidence was presented to show that the PG of the mutant is fragile, and there are differences in cell division to explain increased vesiculogenesis. These observations, counterintuitive to the authors' hypothesis, need detailed experimental verification.</p>
<p>Transcriptomic data only adds a little substantial. Transcriptomic data do not correlate with the proteomics data. It remains unclear how VirR deregulates transcription. TLCs of lipids are not quantitative. For example, the TLC image of PDIM is poor; quantitative estimation needs metabolic labeling of lipids with radioactive precursors. Further, change in PDIMs is likely to affect other lipids (SL-1, PAT/DAT) that share a common precursor (propionyl- CoA).</p>
<p>The connection of cholesterol with cell wall permeability is tenuous. Cholesterol will serve as a carbon source and contribute to the biosynthesis of methyl-branched lipids such as PDIM, SL-1, and PAD/DAT. Carbon sources also affect other aspects of physiology (redox, respiration, ATP), which can directly affect permeability and import/export of drugs. Authors should investigate whether restoration of the normal level of permeability and EV release is not due to the maintenance of cell wall lipid balance upon cholesterol exposure of the VirR mutant.</p>
<p>Finally, protein interaction data is based on experiments done once without statistical analysis. If the interaction between VirR and LCP protein is expected on the mycobacterial membrane, how SPLIT_GFP system expressed in the cytoplasm is physiologically relevant. No explanation was provided as to why VirR interacts with the truncated version of LCP proteins and not with the full-length proteins.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this work, Vivian Salgueiro et al. have comprehensively investigated the role of VirR in the vesicle production process in Mtb using state-of-the-art omics, imaging, and several biochemical assays. From the present study, authors have drawn a positive correlation between cell membrane permeability and vasculogenesis and implicated VirR in affecting membrane permeability, thereby impacting vasculogenesis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors have discovered a critical factor (i.e. membrane permeability) that affects vesicle production and release in Mycobacteria, which can broadly be applied to other bacteria and may be of significant interest to other scientists in the field. Through omics and multiple targeted assays such as targeted metabolomics, PG isolation, analysis of Diaminopimelic acid and glycosyl composition of the cell wall, and, importantly, molecular interactions with PG-AG ligating canonical LCP proteins, the authors have established that VirR is a central scaffold at the cell envelope remodelling process which is critical for MEV production.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Throughout the study, the authors have utilized a CRISPR knockout of VirR. VirR is a non-essential gene for the growth of Mtb; a null mutant of VirR would have been a better choice for the study.</p>
<p>Comments on the revised version:</p>
<p>Concerns flagged about using CRISPR -guide RNA mediated knockdown of viral has yet to be addressed entirely. I understand that the authors could not get knock out despite attempts and hence they have guide RNA mediated knockdown strategy. However, I wondered if the authors looked at the levels of the downstream genes in this knockdown.</p>
<p>Authors have used the virmut-Comp strain for some of the experiments. However, the materials and methods must describe how this strain was generated. Given the mutant is a CRISPR-guide RNA mediated knockdown. The CRISPR construct may have taken up the L5 loci. Did authors use episomal construct for complementation? If so, what is the expression level of virR in the complementation construct? What are the expression levels of downstream genes in mutant and complementation strains? This is important because the transcriptome analysis was redone by considering complementation strain. The complemented strain is written as virmut-C or virmut-Comp. This has to be consistent.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The present study's main aim is to investigate the mechanism of how VirR controls the magnitude of MEV release in Mtb. The authors used various techniques, including genetics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and ultrastructural and biochemical methods. Several observations were made to link VirR-mediated vesiculogenesis with PG metabolism, lipid metabolism, and cell wall permeability. Finally, the authors presented evidence of a direct physical interaction of VirR with the LCP proteins involved in linking PG with AG, providing clues that VirR might act as a scaffold for LCP proteins and remodel the cell wall of Mtb. Since the Mtb cell wall provides a formidable anatomical barrier for the entry of antibiotics, targeting VirR might weaken the permeability of the pathogen along with the stimulation of the immune system due to enhanced vesiculogenesis. Therefore, VirR could be an excellent drug target. Overall, the study is an essential area of TB biology.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the kind assessment of our paper.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors have done a commendable job of comprehensively examining the phenotypes associated with the VirR mutant using various techniques. Application of Cryo-EM technology confirmed increased thickness and altered arrangement of CM-L1 layer. The authors also confirmed that increased vesicle release in the mutant was not due to cell lysis, which contrasts with studies in other bacterial species.</p>
<p>Another strength of the manuscript is that biochemical experiments show altered permeability and PG turnover in the mutant, which fits with later experiments where authors provide evidence of a direct physical interaction of VirR with LCP proteins.</p>
<p>Transcriptomics and proteomics data were helpful in making connections with lipid metabolism, which the authors confirmed by analyzing the lipids and metabolites of the mutant.</p>
<p>Lastly, using three approaches, the authors confirm that VirR interacts with LCP proteins in Mtb via the LytR_C terminal domain.</p>
<p>Altogether, the work is comprehensive, experiments are designed well, and conclusions are made based on the data generated after verification using multiple complementary approaches.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are glad that this reviewer finds our study of interest and well designed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The major weakness is that the mechanism of VirR-mediated EV release remains enigmatic. Most of the findings are observational and only associate enhanced vesiculogenesis observed in the VirR mutant with cell wall permeability and PG metabolism. The authors suggest that EV release occurs during cell division when PG is most fragile. However, this has yet to be tested in the manuscript - the AFM of the VirR mutant, which produces thicker PG with more pore density, displays enhanced vesiculogenesis. No evidence was presented to show that the PG of the mutant is fragile, and there are differences in cell division to explain increased vesiculogenesis. These observations, counterintuitive to the authors' hypothesis, need detailed experimental verification.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We concur with the reviewer that we do not have direct evidence showing a more fragile PG in the <italic>virR</italic> mutant and our statement is supported by a compendium of different results. However, this statement is framed in the discussion section as a possible scenario, acknowledging that more experiments are needed to make such connection. Nevertheless, we provide additional data on the molecular characterization of virRmut PG using MS to show a significant increase in the abundance of deacetylated muropeptides, a feature that has been linked to altered lysozyme sensitivity in other unrelated Gram-positive bacteria</p>
<p>(Fig 8 G,H).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2.1) Transcriptomic data only adds a little substantial. Transcriptomic data do not correlate with the proteomics data. It remains unclear how VirR deregulates transcription.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We concur with the reviewer that information provided by transcriptomics and proteomics is a bit fragmented and, taking into consideration the low correlation between both datasets, it does not help to explain the phenotype observed in the mutant. This issue has also been raised by another reviewer so, we have paid special attention to that.</p>
<p>To refine the biological interpretation of the transcriptomic data we have integrated the complemented strain (<italic>virRmut</italic>-Comp) in our analyses. This led us to narrow down the <italic>virR</italic>-dependent transcriptomics signature to the sets of genes that appear simultaneously deregulated in <italic>virRmut</italic> with respect to both WT and complemented strain in either direction. Furthermore, to identify the transcription factors whose regulatory activity appear disrupted in the mutant strain, we have resorted to an external dataset (Minch et al. 2015) and found a set of 10 transcriptional regulators whose regulons appear significantly impacted in the <italic>virRmut</italic> strain. While admittedly these improvements do not fully address the question tackled by the reviewer, we found that they contribute to a more precise characterization of the VirR-dependent transcriptional signatures, as well as the regulons, in the genome-wide transcriptional regulatory network of the pathogen that appear altered because of <italic>virR</italic> disruption. We acknowledge that the lack of correlation between whole-cell lysates proteomics and transcriptomic data is something intriguing, albeit not uncommon in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. However, differences in the protein cargo of the vesicles from different strains share key pathways in common with the transcriptomic analyses, such as the enrichments in cell wall biogenesis and peptidoglycan biosynthesis that are observed both among genes that are downregulated in both cases in <italic>virRmut</italic>.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2.2) TLCs of lipids are not quantitative. For example, the TLC image of PDIM is poor; quantitative estimation needs metabolic labeling of lipids with radioactive precursors. Further, change in PDIMs is likely to affect other lipids (SL-1, PAT/DAT) that share a common precursor (propionyl- CoA).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We also agree with the reviewer that TLC, as it is, it is not quantitative. However, we do not have access to radioactive procedures. In the new version of the manuscript, we have run TLCs on all the strains tested to resolve SLs and PAT/DATs (Fig S8). Our results show a reduction in the pool of SL and DATs in the mutant, indicating that part of the methylmalonil pool is diverted to the synthesis of PDIMs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The connection of cholesterol with cell wall permeability is tenuous. Cholesterol will serve as a carbon source and contribute to the biosynthesis of methyl-branched lipids such as PDIM, SL-1, and PAD/DAT. Carbon sources also affect other aspects of physiology (redox, respiration, ATP), which can directly affect permeability and import/export of drugs. Authors should investigate whether restoration of the normal level of permeability and EV release is not due to the maintenance of cell wall lipid balance upon cholesterol exposure of the VirR mutant.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We concur with the reviewer that cholesterol as a sole carbon source is introducing many changes in <italic>Mtb</italic> cells beside permeability. Consequently, we investigated the virRmut lipid profile upon exposure to either cholesterol or TRZ (Fig S8). Both WT and virRmut-Comp strains were included in the analysis. Polar lipid analysis revealed that either cholesterol or TRZ exposure induced a marked reduction in PIMs and cardiolipin (DPG) levels in virRmut relative to WT or complemented strains (Fig S8A). Analysis of apolar lipids indicated that, relative to glycerol MM, virRmut cultured in the presence of cholesterol or TRZ showed reduced levels of TDM and DATs compared to WT and virRmut-Comp strains (Fig S8B). These results suggest a lack of correlation between modulation of cell permeability by cholesterol and TRZ and lipid levels in the absence of VirR.</p>
<p>Furthermore, about this section, we would like to mention that we have modified the reference used for the annotation of the DosR regulon: moving from the definition of the regulon used in the previous submission (coming from Rustad, el at. PLoS One 3(1), e1502 (2008). The enduring hypoxic response of Mycobacterium tuberculosis) to the more recent characterization of the regulon based on CHiPseq data, reported in Minch et al. 2015. This was done to ensure coherence with the transcriptomics analyses in the new figure 4.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Finally, protein interaction data is based on experiments done once without statistical analysis. If the interaction between VirR and LCP protein is expected on the mycobacterial membrane, how the SPLIT_GFP system expressed in the cytoplasm is physiologically relevant. No explanation was provided as to why VirR interacts with the truncated version of LCP proteins and not with the full-length proteins.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have repeated the experiments and applied statistics (Figure 9). As stated in the manuscript this assay has successfully been applied to interrogate interactions of domains of proteins embedded in the membrane of mycobacteria. Therefore, we believe that this assay is valid to interrogate interactions between Lcp proteins.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this work, Vivian Salgueiro et al. have comprehensively investigated the role of VirR in the vesicle production process in Mtb using state-of-the-art omics, imaging, and several biochemical assays. From the present study, authors have drawn a positive correlation between cell membrane permeability and vesiculogenesis and implicated VirR in affecting membrane permeability, thereby impacting vesiculogenesis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors have discovered a critical factor (i.e. membrane permeability) that affects vesicle production and release in Mycobacteria, which can broadly be applied to other bacteria and may be of significant interest to other scientists in the field. Through omics and multiple targeted assays such as targeted metabolomics, PG isolation, analysis of Diaminopimelic acid and glycosyl composition of the cell wall, and, importantly, molecular interactions with PG-AG ligating canonical LCP proteins, the authors have established that VirR is a central scaffold at the cell envelope remodelling process which is critical for MEV production.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the kind assessment of the paper.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Throughout the study, the authors have utilized a CRISPR knockout of VirR. VirR is a non-essential gene for the growth of Mtb; a null mutant of VirR would have been a better choice for the study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>According to Tn mutant databases and CRISPR databases, <italic>virR</italic> is a non-essential gene. However, we have tried to interrupt this gene using the allelic exchange substitution approach via phages many times with no success. So far there is no precedent of a clean KO mutant in this gene. White et al., generated a <italic>virR</italic> mutant consisting of deletion of a large fragment of the c-terminal part of the protein, pretty much replicating the effect of the <italic>Tn</italic> insertion site in the <italic>virR</italic> <italic>Tn</italic> mutant. These precedents made us to switch to CRISPR technology.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The authors monitored cell lysis by measuring the release of a cytoplasmic iron-responsive protein (IdeR). Since EV release is regulated by iron starvation, which is directly sensed by IdeR, another control (unrelated to iron) is needed. A much better approach would be to use hydrophobic/hydrophilic probes to measure changes in the cell wall envelope.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Does the VirR complemented strain have a faint IdeR band in the supernatant? The authors need to clarify. Also, it's unclear whether the complementation restored normal VirR levels or not.</p>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this recommendation. Consequently, we have complemented these studies by an alternative approach based on serially diluted cultures spotted on solid medium. These results align very well with that of western blot using IdeR levels in the supernatant as a surrogate of cell lysis.</p>
<p>We also noticed the presence of a faint IdeR band in the supernatant of the complemented strain and suggestive of a possible cell lysis. However, as shown in other section this was not translated into increased levels of vesiculation. As previously shown in a previous paper describing VirR as a genetic determinant of vesiculogenesis, VirR levels in the complemented strains are not just restored but increased considerably. This overexpression could explain the potential artifact of a leaky phenotype in the complemented strain. In addition to that previous study, the proteomic data included in this paper clearly shows a restoration of VirR levels relative to the WT strains.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Figure 2C: The data are weak; I don't see any difference in incorporating FDAAs in MM media. Even in the 7H9 medium, differences appear only at the last time point (20 h). What happens at the time point after 20 h (e.g., 48 h)? How do we differentiate between defective permeability or anabolism leading to altered PG? No statistical analysis was performed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the incomplete assessment of the results in this figure. First, this figure just shows differential incorporation of FDAAs in the different strains in different media. As per previous studies (Kuru et al (2017) Nat. Protocols), these probes can freely enter into cells and may be incorporated into PG by at least three different mechanisms, depending on the species: through the cytoplasmic steps of PG biosynthesis and via two distinct transpeptidation reactions taking place in the periplasm. Consequently, the differential labeling observed in virRmut relative to WT strain may be a consequence of the enlarge PG observe din the mutant. We have repeated the experiment and created new data. First, we have cultured strains with a blue FDAA (HADA) for 48 to ensure full labeling. Then, we washed cells and cultured in the presence of a second FDAA, this time green (FDL) for 5 h. The differential incorporation of FDL relative to HADA was then measured under the fluorescence microscope. This experiment showed a virRmut incorporate more FDL that the other strains, suggesting an altered PG remodeling.  modified the figure to make clearer the early and late time points of the time-course and applied statistics.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Many genes (~ 1700) were deregulated in the mutant. Since these transcriptional changes do not correlate at the protein level in WCL, it's important to determine VirR-specificity. RNA-Seq of VirR complemented strain is important.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We think this was an extremely important point, and we thank the reviewer for pointing this out. Following their suggestion, we have analyzed and integrated data from the complemented strain, which we have added to the GEO submission, to conclude that, in fact, differences in expression between the complemented strain and either the WT, or <italic>virRmut</italic> are also common and highly significant. Albeit this is not completely unexpected, given the nature of our mutants and the fact that the complemented strains show significantly higher levels of expression of VirR -both at the RNA and protein levels- than the WT, it motivated us to narrow down our definition of VirR-dependent genes to adopt a combined criterium that integrated the complemented strain. Following this approach, we considered the set of genes upregulated (downregulated) in <italic>virRmut</italic> as those whose expression in that strain is, at the same time, significantly higher (lower) than in WT as well as in <italic>virRmut</italic>-Comp. Working with this integrated definition, the genes considered -399 upregulated and 502 downregulated genes- are those whose observed expression changes are more likely to be genuinely VirR-dependent rather than any non-specific consequence of the mutagenesis protocols. Despite the lower number of genes in these sets, the repetition of all our functional enrichment analyses based on this combined criterium leads us to conclusions that are largely compatible with those presented in the first version of the paper.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Transcriptome data provide no clues about how VirR could mediate expression deregulation. Is there an overlap with the regulations/regulons of any Mtb transcription factors? One clue is DosR; however, DosR only regulates 50-60 genes in Mtb.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Again, we would like to thank the reviewer for this recommendation, which we have followed accordingly to generate a new section in the results named “VirR-dependent genes intersect the regulons of key transcriptional regulators of the responses to stress, dormancy, and cell wall remodeling”. As we explain in this new section, we resorted to the regulon annotations reported in (Minch et al. 2015), where ChIP-seq data is collected on binding events between a panel of 143 transcription factors (TFs) and DNA genome-wide. The dataset includes 7248 binding events between regulators and DNA motifs in the vicinity of targets’ promoters. After completing enrichment analyses with the resulting regulons, we identified 10 transcription factors whose intersections with the sets of up and downregulated genes in <italic>virRmut</italic> were larger than expected by chance (One tailed Fisher exact test, OR&gt;2, FDR&lt;0.1). Those regulators -which, as guessed by the referee, included DevR-, control key pathways related with cell wall remodeling, stress responses, and transition to dormancy.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) How many proteins that are enriched or depleted in the EVs of the VirR mutant also affected transcriptionally in the mutant? How does VirR regulate the abundance and transport of protein in EVs?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While the intersection between genes and proteins that appear upregulated in the <italic>virRmut</italic> strain both at transcriptional and vesicular protein levels (N=21) was found larger than expected by chance (OR=2.0 p=7.0E-3), downregulated genes and proteins in <italic>virRmut</italic> (N=14) were not enriched in each other. These results, indicated, at most, a scarce correlation between RNA and protein levels (a phenomenon nonetheless previously observed in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, among other organisms, see Cortés et al. 2013). Admittedly, the compilation of these omics data is insufficient, by itself to pinpoint the specific regulatory mechanisms through which the absence of VirR impacts protein abundance in EVs. For the sake of transparency, this has been acknowledged in the discussion section of the resubmitted version of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The assumption that a depleted pool of methylmalonyl CoA is due to increased utilization for PDIM biosynthesis is problematic. Without flux-based measurement, we don't know if MMCoA is consumed more or produced less, more so because Acc is repressed in the VirR mutant EVs. Further, MMCoA feeds into the TCA cycle and other methyl-branched lipids. Without data on other lipids and metabolism, the depletion of MMCoA is difficult to explain.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The differential expression statistics compiled suggest that both effects may be at place, since we observed, at the same time, a downregulation of enzymes controlling methylmalonyl synthesis from propionyl-CoA (i.e. Acc, at the protein level), as well as an upregulation of enzymes related with its incorporation into DIM/PDIMs (i.e. <italic>pps</italic> genes). Both effects, combined, would favor an increased rate of methylmalonyl production, and a slower depletion rate, thus contributing to the higher levels observed. We however concur with the reviewer that fluxomics analyses will contribute to shed light on this question in a more decisive manner, and we have acknowledged this in the discussion section too.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Figure 5: Deregulation of rubredoxins and copper indicates impaired redox balance and respiration in the mutant. The data is complex to connect with permeability as TRZ is mycobactericidal and also known to affect the respiratory chain. The authors need to investigate if, in addition to permeability, the presence of VirR is essential for maintaining bioenergetics.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The data related to rubredoxins and copper has been modified after reanalyzing transcriptomic data including the complemented strain. Nevertheless, we found that some features of the response to stresses may be impaired in the mutant, including the one to oxidative stress. In this regard, we found the enhanced sensitivity of the mutant to H2O2 relative to WT and complemented strains. This piece of data is now included as Fig S3 in the new version of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Differential regulation of DoS regulon and cholesterol growth could also be linked to differences in metabolism, redox, and respiration. What is the phenotype of VirR mutants in terms of growth and respiration in the presence of cholesterol/TRZ?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. Consequently, we have added a new section to Results that suggest that other aspects of mycobacterial physiology may be affected in the virR mutant when cultured in the presence of cholesterol or TRZ:</p>
<p>“Modulation of EV levels and permeability in virRmut by cholesterol and TRZ. We next wondered about the effect of culturing virRmut on both cholesterol or TRZ could have on cell growth, permeability and EV production. In the case of cholesterol, it has also been shown to affect other aspects of physiology (redox, respiration, ATP), which can directly affect permeability (Lu et al., 2017). We monitored virRmut growth cultured in MM supplemented with either glycerol, cholesterol as a sole carbon source, and TRZ at 3 ug ml-1 for 20 days. While cholesterol significantly enhanced the growth virRmut after 5 days relative to glycerol medium, supplementation of glycerol medium with TRZ restricted growth during the whole time-course (Fig S5A). The study of cell permeability in the same conditions indicated that the enhanced cell permeability observed in glycerol MM was reduced when virRmut when cultured with cholesterol as sole carbon source. Conversely, the presence of TRZ increased cell permeability relative to the medium containing solely glycerol (Fig S5C). As we have previously observed for the WT strain, either condition (Chol or TRZ) also modified vesiculation levels in the mutant accordingly (Fig S5B). These results strongly indicates that other aspects of mycobacterial physiology besides permeability are also affected in the virR mutant and may contribute to the observed enhanced vesiculation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) PDIM TLC is not evident; both DimA and DImB should be clearly shown. It will also be necessary to show other methyl-branched lipids, such as SL-1 and PAT/DAT, because the increase in PDIM can take away methyl malonyl CoA from the biosynthesis of SL-1 and PAT/DAT. Studies have shown that SLI-, PAT/DAT, and PDIM are tightly regulated, where an increase in one lipid pool can affect the abundance of other lipids. Quantitative assays using 14C acetate/propionate are most appropriate for these experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the fact that TLC analysis is not performed in a radioactive fashion. However, we do not have access to this approach. To answer reviewer question about the fact that other methyl-branched lipids may explain the altered flux of methyl malonyl CoA, we have run TLCs on all the strains tested to resolve SLs and PAT/DATs (Fig S8). Notably, we observed a reduction in the level of these lipids (SL1 or PAT/DAT) in <italic>virRmut</italic> cultured in glycerol relative to WT and complemented strains, suggesting that the excess of PDIM synthesis can take away methyl malonyl CoA from the biosynthesis of SL-1 and PAT/DAT in the absence of VirR (Fig S8B).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) Figure 8: Interaction between VirR and Lcp proteins. Since these interactions are happening in the membrane, using a split GFP system where proteins are expressed in the cytoplasm is unlikely to be relevant.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Also, experiments on Figure 8C are performed once, and representation needs to be clarified; split GFP needs a positive control, and negative control (CtpC) is not indicated in the figure.</p>
<p>We have repeated the experiments and applied statistics (Figure 9). As stated in the manuscript this assay has successfully been applied to interrogate interactions of domains of proteins embedded in the membrane of mycobacteria. Therefore, we believe that this assay is valid to interrogate interactions between Lcp proteins.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Authors should consider making more effort to mine the omics data and integrate them. Given the amount of data that is generated with the omics, they need to be looked at together to find out threads that connect all of them.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the resubmitted version of the paper, we have followed reviewer´s recommendation by incorporating new analyses that integrated the <italic>virRmut</italic>-C strain, and tried to provide context to the differences found in the context of broader transcriptional regulatory networks (new figure 4), as well as in the context of metabolic pathways related with PDIM biosynthesis from methylmalonyl (figure 6I, already present in the first submission). We consider that these additions contribute to a deeper interpretation of the omics data in the line of what was suggested by the reviewer.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The interpretation given by authors in lines 387-390 is an interpretation that does not have sufficient support and, hence should be moved into discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this recommendation. We believe that these new analyses and integration studies now support the above statement.</p>
