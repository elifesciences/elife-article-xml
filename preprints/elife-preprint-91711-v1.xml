<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Almost all herbivorous insects feed on plants and use sucrose as a feeding stimulant, but the molecular basis of their sucrose reception remains unclear. The cotton bollworm <italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic> as a notorious crop pest worldwide mainly feeds on reproductive organs of many plant species in the larval stage, and its adult draws nectar. Its gustatory sensory neurons sensitive to sucrose are distributed in the taste sensilla of larval maxillary galeas and adult antennae, tarsi and proboscis. In this study, using the ectopic expression system, we discovered that <italic>Gr10</italic> highly expressed in the larval sensilla was specifically tuned to sucrose, while <italic>Gr6</italic> highly expressed in the adult sensilla responded to fucose, sucrose and fructose. Moreover, using the CRISPR/Cas9 technique, we revealed that <italic>Gr10</italic> was mainly used by larvae to detect lower sucrose, while <italic>Gr6</italic> was primarily used by adults to detect higher sucrose and other saccharides, which results in the differences in selectivity and sensitivity between larval and adult sugar sensory neurons. Our results demonstrate the sugar receptors in this moth are evolved to adapt towards the larval and adult foods with different types and amounts of sugar, and fill in a gap in sweet taste of animals.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over 400,000 species of phytophagous insects live on approximately 300,000 species of vascular plants worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Schoonhoven et al., 2005</xref>). Carbohydrates produced by plant photosynthesis are important nutrients for phytophagous insects. The disaccharide sucrose, the major sugar in plants, is the principal transport form of photoassimilates in higher plants. Sucrose varies considerably in concentration in green leaves, fruits, and flower nectar where it occurs together with its constituent monosaccharides fructose and glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bernays &amp; Chapman, 1994</xref>). Sucrose, fructose and glucose are the powerful phagostimulants for most phytophagous insects studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bernays &amp; Chapman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Blaney &amp; Simmonds, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chapman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Schoonhoven et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The gustatory sensory neurons (GSNs) in one or more mouthpart sensilla of phytophagous insects respond to sugars, usually including sucrose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chapman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dethier, 1973</xref>). In Lepidoptera, caterpillars often have sugar GSNs in lateral and medial sensilla styloconica in the maxillary galea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Glendinning et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Martin &amp; Shields, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Schoonhoven &amp; van Loon, 2002</xref>), while adults also have sugar GSNs in taste sensilla of the antennae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jørgensen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Popescu et al., 2013</xref>), tarsi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Schnuch &amp; Seebauer, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>), and proboscis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Blaney &amp; Simmonds, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Faucheux, 2013</xref>). The molecular basis of sugar reception in Lepidopteran insects remains unclear although the sweet taste receptors in mammals and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> have been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Liman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Yarmolinsky et al., 2009</xref>). In mammals, the combination of two taste receptors T1R2 and T1R3 recognizes sugars including sucrose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Damak et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Li et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Nelson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zhao et al., 2003</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, multiple gustatory receptors (GRs), including DmGr5a, DmGr61a, and DmGr64a–f clusters, are required for the response of adults to multiple sugars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dahanukar et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dahanukar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jiao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Jiao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Slone et al., 2007</xref>), while DmGr43a specifically responding to fructose is the major larval sugar receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Mishra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Miyamoto et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The cotton bollworm <italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic> (Noctuidae, Lepidoptera) is a worldwide agricultural pest, it causes over $3 billion in annual global economic loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Pearce et al., 2017</xref>). The larvae of <italic>H. armigera</italic> mainly feeds on young leaves, buds, and young fruits of host plants; the adults mainly drink nectar of plants. Larval and adult diets vary dramatically in the variety and concentration of sugars. Sucrose is the major sugar in plant leaves and reproductive organs, whereas flower nectar mainly contains sucrose, fructose and glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Nicolson, 1998</xref>). Previous studies have shown that GSNs sensitive to sucrose and fructose in <italic>H. armigera</italic> are located in the lateral sensilla styloconica in larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Tang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>) and the taste sensilla of antennae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>), tarsi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Blaney &amp; Simmonds, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>), and proboscis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Blaney &amp; Simmonds, 1988</xref>) in adults.</p>
<p>To understand the molecular basis of sugar reception in these neurons, we first compared electrophysiological and behavioral responses of <italic>H. armigera</italic> larvae and adults. Second, we analyzed the expression patterns of nine candidate sugar GR genes in larval and adult taste organs. Third, we carried out functional analysis of these GR genes using the ectopic expression system, and revealed the response profiles of <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes expressing Gr10, Gr6, and both of them. Finally, we individually knocked out the two GR genes and obtained two homozygous mutants of <italic>H. armigera</italic> by CRISPR/Cas9, and then detected changes in the electrophysiological and behavioral responses of the mutant larvae and adults to sugars. Taking all the results together, we demonstrate that larval and adult <italic>H. armigera</italic> used different GRs to detect sucrose in food.</p>

<title>Electrophysiological responses of taste sensilla to sugars</title>
<p>We first investigated the electrophysiological responses of the lateral and medial sensilla styloconica in the larval maxillary galea to seven sugars in plants, including sucrose, fructose, and glucose. The lateral sensilla styloconica showed significant unicellular responses to 10 mM sucrose and fucose, with the firing rates of 169 ± 8.57 and 43 ± 9.78 spikes/s, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, Figure 1—figure supplement 1A).</bold> The threshold concentrations for their responses to sucrose and fucose were 0.1 mM and 10 mM, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</bold>). The medial sensilla styloconica had a weak response to xylose (<bold>Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</bold>). We also compared the responses of the lateral sensilla styloconica to 0.05 mM sucrose, 5 mM fucose, and their mixture with the same concentrations, and found that the mixture induced higher responses with only one amplitude spikes and a firing rate of 71 ± 12.36 spikes/s, which was higher than the firing rates induced by 0.05 mM sucrose (39 ± 6.37 spikes/s) and 5 mM fucose (36 ± 8.87 spikes/s) (<bold>Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</bold>), confirming that the same cell responded to sucrose and fucose. We conclude that there is only one GSN sensitive to sucrose and fucose in each maxillary galea of larvae.</p>

<p>We also studied the responses of the taste sensilla in the tip of the antennae, foreleg tarsi, and proboscis of female adults to seven sugar compounds at 10 mM and the related dose responses (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C–H</xref></bold>). The antennal sensilla responded to sucrose, fucose, and fructose positively (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>), the tarsal sensilla only responded to sucrose and fucose (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref></bold>), and the proboscis sensilla responded to sucrose, fucose, and fructose (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref></bold>), but their firing rates were between 9-22 spikes/s. All the evoked spike traces had one amplitude, indicating that they were single cell responses (<bold>Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</bold>). The dose–response curves showed that the threshold concentrations of sucrose, fucose and fructose were all 10 mM for the antennal sensilla (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</bold>), 100 mM, 10 mM and 100 mM for the tarsal sensilla (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>, Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</bold>), and 10 mM, 100 mM and 10 mM for the proboscis sensilla, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>, Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</bold>).</p>
<p>In short, both larvae and adults of <italic>H. armigera</italic> had sugar GSNs, but their response profiles, intensity and sensitivity differed distinctively. The sugar GSNs in lateral sensilla styloconica of larvae responded strongly to sucrose with high sensitivity, and weakly to fucose; while the sugar GSNs of adults responded to sucrose, fucose, and fructose (except for those on tarsi) with lower intensity and sensitivity. The GSNs of larvae were 100–1000 times more sensitive to sucrose than those of adults.</p>

<p>The two-choice test was used to examine the feeding behavior of the 5<sup>th</sup> instar larvae of <italic>H. armigera</italic> to the seven sugars at 10 mM. Sucrose and fructose stimulated larval feeding, and their threshold concentrations were 10 mM (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A–B</xref>, Figure 2—figure supplement 1</bold>); other tested sugars had no effect on larval feeding (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>We also studied the proboscis extension reflex (PER) induced by sugar stimulation in the antennal and tarsal tip sensilla of virgin female adults. In consideration of the sugar content in nectar and the response intensity of the taste sensilla in adults, the test concentration of sugars was set at 100 mM. The results showed that the PER percentage reached 64 ± 4.35%, 44 ± 5.96% and 20 ± 1.92% when the antennal sensilla were stimulated with sucrose, fucose and fructose (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>), while the PER percentage reached 53 ± 14.08%, 45 ± 4.44% and 36 ± 10.19% when the tarsal sensilla were stimulated, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold>). Stimulation of the antennal or tarsal sensilla by other sugar compounds did not induce changes in the PER percentage compared with stimulation of water (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref></bold>). The dose– response curves showed that the threshold concentrations of sucrose, fucose, and fructose for the antennal sensilla were 100 mM, 100 mM, and 1000 mM (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref></bold>), those for the tarsal sensilla were 10 mM, 10 mM, and 100 mM, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>To determine the expression patterns of nine putative sugar GR genes in larval and adult taste organs, we measured their expression levels in the larval maxillary galea, and the antennae, foreleg tarsi, and proboscis in virgin female and male adults by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>–<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>, Figure 3—figure supplement 1</bold>).

The average expression level of all sugar GRs in the larval maxillary galea was lower than that in the adult organs.

<p>Given that there was only one sugar GSN responding to sucrose and fucose in each larval maxillary galea, we speculated that Gr10 should be expressed together with Gr6 in this cell although their expressing levels were different. Therefore, we examined the response profile of the oocytes expressing Gr10 together with Gr6. The results showed that the oocytes co-expressing Gr10 and Gr6 significantly responded to sucrose with a current value of 1.89 ± 0.58 μA at 100 mM, a threshold concentration, and had a weak response to fucose with a threshold concentration of 250 mM (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Since Gr5 was highly expressed with Gr6 in the proboscis and tarsi (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>, Figure 3—figure supplement 1</bold>), we suspected that Gr5 could be a partner of Gr6 and then tested the response profile of their co-expression in oocytes. Similar to the oocytes expressing Gr6, the oocytes expressing Gr5 and Gr6 had responses to 100 mM fucose with a current value of 0.11 ± 0.015 μA and to 100 mM sucrose with a current value of 0.03 ± 0.002 μA (<bold>Figure 4—figure supplement 1B–C</bold>).</p>
<p>In summary, we find that oocytes expressing single Gr10 or Gr6 confer sensitivity to one or more sugars, indicating their direct roles in ligand recognition. Gr10 is tuned to sucrose specifically, Gr6 is responsive to fucose, sucrose and fructose in the order of sensitivity, and the combination of Gr10 and Gr6 is sensitive to sucrose and then fucose, which is in line with the characteristics of the sugar GSNs in larval and adult taste organs where the two GRs are highly expressed respectively.</p>

When antennae or tarsi were stimulated with 10 mM, 100 mM, or 1000 mM sucrose, fucose, or fructose, <italic>Gr6<sup>−/−</sup></italic> females showed a considerably lower PER percentage than the WT females and even had little or no PER in response to sucrose and fucose, whereas the PER percentage of <italic>Gr10<sup>−/−</sup></italic> females was not different from that of the WT females (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>–<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7I</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, <italic>Gr10</italic> plays a key role in sucrose reception by the sugar GSNs in the larval lateral sensilla styloconica, and mediates the feeding preference of larvae to sucrose, whereas <italic>Gr6</italic> plays a key role in sensing sucrose, fucose, and fructose by the sugar GSNs in taste sensilla of the adult antennae, foreleg tarsi, and proboscis, and mediates the related PER behavior of adults.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we reveal the different molecular bases of sucrose reception between <italic>H. armigera</italic> larvae and adults through ectopic expression and genetic editing of GRs. <italic>Gr10</italic>, which was highly expressed in the larval maxillary galea, is specifically tuned to sucrose with high sensitivity, whereas <italic>Gr6</italic>, which was highly expressed in the adult antennae and foreleg tarsi, has a broader response spectrum but lower sensitivity to sucrose, indicating that larvae mainly use <italic>Gr10</italic> to detect low sucrose in plant tissues, while adults primarily use <italic>Gr6</italic> to detect a variety of sugars with high content, including sucrose in nectar.</p>
<p>Our findings indicate that the <italic>H. armigera</italic> larvae and adults adopt different sugar-sensing systems to satisfy their requirements for food selection. The larvae mainly feed on young leaves, flower buds, and fruits of host plants. As a universal phagostimulant, sucrose is the major sugar in plants and considerably varies in content in different tissues and developmental stages. Tomato is a principal host plant of <italic>H. armigera</italic>. The sucrose content in its leaves generally ranges from 13.72 to 42.06 mM, but that in its fruits generally ranges from 35.2 to 988.22 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Schauer et al., 2005</xref>). The adults mainly feed on plant nectar. Sucrose and some monosaccharides, especially fructose and glucose, are the main components in nectar, where the sugar content is much higher than that in leaves and fruits. The sugar content in the nectar of cotton plants is 10%–34% (which roughly corresponds to 0.5 M–1.7 M) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Vansell,1944</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Waller et al., 1981</xref>), and that of soybean plants is even higher, around 23%–60% (which roughly corresponds to 1.2–3 M) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Free, 1993</xref>). It is clear that, in their life cycle, a single sugar-sensing mechanism cannot meet the requirements for food selection by this phytophagous insect species. From the perspective of insect and plant co-evolution, using value-based and target-specific sugar-sensing systems is a favorable choice for phytophagous insects to ensure their growth and reproduction on plants.</p>
<p>Although <italic>Gr10</italic> plays a major role in sucrose reception in the larval stage, the response of the sugar GSNs in larval lateral sensilla styloconica to sucrose did not completely disappear in <italic>Gr10<sup>−/−</sup></italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>–<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref></bold>), and the larvae still showed a behavioral preference for the high concentration of sucrose (100 mM) (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref></bold>). It is most likely that low-level expressed <italic>Gr6</italic> is functional in the GSNs. The PER percentage of <italic>Gr6</italic><sup>−/−</sup> adults was not disappeared when the antennae and tarsi were stimulated by high fructose concentrations (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7I</xref></bold>); this indicates that fructose-tuned GRs other than <italic>Gr6</italic> were involved. Previous studies have shown that <italic>Gr9</italic> (<italic>Gr4</italic> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>), as an ortholog of DmelGr43a and BmorGr9, is a fructose-tuned GR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ai et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sato et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). A thorough understanding of the sugar coding mechanisms will require comparison of a series of single, double and even multiple knock-out lines.</p>
<p>The larval maxillary galea with only two sensilla styloconica is an ideal system for studying the mechanisms of sugar sensing. In each maxillary galea of <italic>H. armigera</italic>, the only sugar GSN sensitive to sucrose and fucose is located in the lateral sensillum styloconicum. Based on our results, we speculate that Gr10 and Gr6 are expressed in this GSN with different levels, and mainly determine the response profile of the cell. The firing rate of the cell in <italic>Gr10<sup>−/−</sup></italic> to 1mM, 10 mM and 100 mM sucrose was significantly lower than that in WT, but there was no difference between WT and <italic>Gr6<sup>−/−</sup></italic>, indicating that Gr10 mainly determine the sensitivity of this cell to sucrose (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>–<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref></bold>). In contrast, the firing rate of the cell in <italic>Gr6<sup>−/−</sup></italic> to 10 mM and 100 mM fucose was significantly lower than that in the WT, but there was no difference between WT and <italic>Gr10<sup>−/−</sup></italic>, indicating that Gr6 was also functional in larvae (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>–<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref></bold>). This can be well explained by the response profiles of the oocytes expressing Gr10, Gr6, and their combination (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Sugars are common phagostimulants in animals, but the molecular basis of sugar perception differs among animals. In mammals, the taste receptors T1R2 and T1R3 combine to complete the perception of all carbohydrate compounds, including sucrose, and both receptors are indispensable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Damak et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Li et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Nelson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zhao et al., 2003</xref>). In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> adults, multiple sugar GRs are involved in sugar reception, different GRs expressed in sweet taste neurons may function as multimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dahanukar et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dahanukar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fujii et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jiao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Jiao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Slone et al., 2007</xref>). Gr5a and Gr64a are widely used for responses to complementary subsets of sugars in labellar sweet taste neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dahanukar et al., 2007</xref>), and Gr64f is also required broadly as a coreceptor for the detection of sugars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Jiao et al., 2008</xref>). The recent successful ectopic expression of single sugar GRs in olfactory neurons confirmed that each sugar GR is directly involved in ligand recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Freeman et al., 2014</xref>). Sweet sensing neurons or receptors have not been identified in the larval peripheral taste system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kwon et al., 2011</xref>). Sugar perception in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae has been assigned to the fructose receptor <italic>Gr43a</italic>, which, however, is expressed in pharyngeal sensory organs, foregut, and in the brain, but absent from external taste neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Mishra et al., 2013</xref>). Anyway, the sucrose sensing neurons were recently identified in the larval primary taste center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Maier et al., 2021</xref>). In honeybees, AmGr1 acts as a GR for certain sugars other than fructose, and AmGr2 acts as a coreceptor with AmGr1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jung et al., 2015</xref>). AmGr3 is tuned to fructose and is phylogenetically closely related to the DmGr43a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Değirmenci et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Takada et al., 2018</xref>). The whitefly <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic> consistently choose diets containing higher sucrose concentrations. It has been shown that BtabGr1 displayed significant sucrose specificity when expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, and silencing of this GR significantly interfered with the ability of <italic>B. tabaci</italic> adults to detect sucrose in the phloem sap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Harari et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>The most studied phytophagous insects for sugar perception are Lepidopterans. BmGr9 in <italic>B. mori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sato et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Morinaga et al., 2022</xref>), HarmGr9 in <italic>H. armigera</italic> (named as HarmGr4 by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Xu et al., 2012</xref>), PxGr43a-1 in <italic>P. xylostella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Liu et al., 2020</xref>), and SlGr8 in <italic>Spodoptera litura</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Liu et al., 2019</xref>) were all the orthologs of DmGr43a in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Miyamoto et al., 2012</xref>), and tuned to fructose without complexing with other GRs. BmGr4 was recently identified as a receptor for sucrose and glucose and may function as a chemosensor for nutritional compounds in both midgut and brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mang et al., 2022</xref>). In this study, we find <italic>Gr10</italic> and <italic>Gr6</italic> were highly expressed in the larval and adult taste organs, respectively. The experiments on ectopic expression in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes shows that Gr10 specifically responded to sucrose, Gr6 responded to fucose and sucrose, and weakly to fructose, and the combination of Gr10 and Gr6 responded to sucrose and weakly to fucose (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>–<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref></bold>). These results indicate that Gr10 and Gr6 are capable of forming functional receptors singly, and the function of the two co-expressed receptors is not equal to the sum of the functions of the two receptors (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></bold>). When further tracing the genomic locations of the two GR genes, we confirm that <italic>Gr10</italic> and <italic>Gr6</italic> together with other 6 sugar GR genes (except for <italic>Gr9</italic>) are tandemly duplicated on the same scaffold of <italic>H. armigera</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Pearce et al., 2017</xref>). The sugar GR gene cluster and interactions between GRs could provide a degree of evolutionary and regulatory flexibility that may meet the needs of the insect to sense subtle sugar components and concentrations in food sources in a changing environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Delventhal &amp; Carlson, 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>In this work, we report for the first time the molecular basis of sucrose reception in external taste neurons of a Lepidopteran insect, and discover that different taste receptors are used for food selection in <italic>H. armigera</italic> larval and adult stages. These findings greatly improve our understanding of “sweet” taste of phytophagous insects. According to the phylogenetic tree of insect sugar GRs, <italic>Gr10</italic> is clustered in the same branch with BmorGr5 of <italic>Bombyx mori</italic>, whereas <italic>Gr6</italic> is clustered in another branch with BmorGr6 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). GRs closely associated with <italic>Gr10</italic> and <italic>Gr6</italic> are also found in other Lepidopteran species such as <italic>D. plexippus</italic>, <italic>H. melpomene</italic>, and <italic>P. xylostella</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). Therefore, we speculate that similar sugar-sensing mechanisms may also exist in other Lepidopteran species, which is worth verifying in these species in the future. To thoroughly reveal the mechanisms of sugar sensing by phytophagous insects and provide a new approach for pest control, it is necessary to study the function of a complete set of sugar receptors.</p>

<p><italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic> were collected from Xuchang (Henan Province, China) and raised in an indoor environment (27±1°C, 70%–80% humidity) with a 16 : 8 h light : dark cycle. The larvae fed on artificial diet (mainly including wheat bran, wheat germ, and tomato paste) in a glass tube (I.D., 2.5 cm; length, 8 cm). When the larvae reached the 3<sup>rd</sup> instar, they were transferred to a new glass tube and raised individually until pupation. Female and male moths were raised separately until they became sexually mature and then moved to a cage for mating. Since the taste system of the female is similar to that of the male and the nutrient requirements are more critical for females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>), the virgin female adults were used in the related experiments.</p>

<sec id="s4c">
<title>Tip-recording</title>
<p>The tip-recording technique based on a previously described methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hodgson et al., 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">van Loon, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>) was used to record the electrophysiological responses of lateral and medial sensilla styloconica in larval maxillary galea, sensilla chaetica in adult antennae, sensilla trichodea in adult tarsi, and sensilla styloconica in adult proboscis of <italic>H. armigera</italic>. A glass capillary filled with the test compound solution, into which a silver wire was inserted, was placed in contact with the taste sensillum to be recorded as the recording electrode. The tip diameter of the electrode was about 50 μm, suitable for recording from a single sensillum. Action potentials (spikes) generated during the first second after stimulus onset were amplified by a preamplifier and was sampled with a computer equipped with a Metrabyte DAS16 A/D conversion board. The amplifier used an AD 515-K (Analog Devices) integrated circuit in the first stage, yielding &lt; 1 pA input bias current, 1015 Ohm and 0.8 pF input impedance. An interface (GO-box) was used for signal conditioning. This involved a second-order band pass filter (−3 dB frequencies: 180 and 1700 Hz). Stimuli were dissolved in 2 mM KCl, which was used as the control. Arabinose, fructose, fucose, galactose, glucose, sucrose, and xylose (<bold>Key resources table</bold>) were first tested at 10 mM to screen active compounds, which were then tested in a range of concentrations in dose-response assays (0.01 mM, 0.1 mM, 1 mM, 10 mM and 100 mM). To avoid possible adaptation of the taste sensilla tested, the interval between two successive stimulations was at least 3 min. Digitized traces were analyzed by means of SAPID Tools software version 3.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Smith et al., 1990</xref>) and Autospike 3.7 (Syntech, Buchenbach, Germany). The spikes were sorted on the basis of typical biphasic waveforms and spike amplitudes, and the frequency of the same type of spikes was counted from the first second after stimulation.</p>
<p>In recording of electrophysiological responses of larvae, the first day of larvae in the 5<sup>th</sup> instar were used. To guarantee all test caterpillars were in the same stage, we first selected 4<sup>th</sup> instar larvae which were preparing to undergo ecdysis, and then transferred them to a glass tube with green pepper. The test larva was starved for approximately 2 h before recording. The head was cut and fixed in a silver holder which was connected to a preamplifier with a copper miniconnector. The lateral and medial sensilla styloconica in larval maxillary galea were exposed for testing electrophysiological responses. About 12–13 replicates were set for each treatment.</p>
<p>The virgin female moths on the second day after eclosion were used for recording electrophysiological responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). They were only fed with ddH<sub>2</sub>O. When testing sensilla in a tarsus, the foreleg was cut between coxa and femur, and the silver holder connected to the amplifier was inserted into the femur. When testing sensilla in the antennae and proboscis, the head and thorax without all legs were reserved. The silver holder was inserted into the thorax. The orientation of the taste organ was gently adjusted to allow the sensilla to be touched by the electrode. To guarantee the sensilla was steadily exposed, the distal part of antenna or proboscis was fixed on a small platform with double sided adhesive tape. For each individual, three sensilla on the top area of antennae, foreleg tarsi, or proboscis were chosen for testing electrophysiological responses, and about 15–21 replicates were used for each treatment.</p>

<title>Two-choice tests</title>
<p>We determined the behavioral responses to sugars of the <italic>H. armigera</italic> larvae using the two-choice test as previously described with small modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2022</xref>). We used the leaf of cabbage (<italic>Brassica oleraceaas</italic>, Shenglv-7) as the substrate since it is not a favorite food for larvae. Circular cabbage leaf discs of 1 cm in diameter were prepared. The upper surface of the treated leaf disc was painted with the 35.2 μL sugar solution with 0.01% Tween 80 (CAS: 9005-55-6, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, USA) using a paintbrush, and the control leaf disc was painted with 35.2 μL ddH<sub>2</sub>O with 0.01% Tween 80. The feeding preference of larvae to seven sugars including arabinose, fructose, fucose, galactose, glucose, sucrose, and xylose (<bold>Key resources table</bold>) was tested at 10 mM. 0.01 mM, 0.1 mM, 1 mM, 10 mM, and 100 mM sucrose and fructose were used in a dose-response assay. The preference index (PI) was calculated according to the following formula: PI = (the feeding area of test leaf discs – the feeding area of control leaf discs) / (the feeding area of test leaf discs + the feeding area of control leaf discs). 20 replicates were run.</p>

<title>Adult proboscis extension reflex (PER) tests</title>
<p>We determined the behavioral responses to sugars of the <italic>H. armigera</italic> female adults using the proboscis extension reflex (PER) test as previously described with some modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>). Arabinose, fructose, fucose, galactose, glucose, sucrose, and xylose (<bold>Key resources table</bold>) were first tested at 100 mM to screen active compounds, which were then tested in a range of concentrations in dose-response assays (0.01 mM, 0.1 mM, 1 mM, 10 mM, 100 mM, and 1000 mM). In brief, the virgin females on the first day after eclosion were used. Each moth was harnessed in a 1 mL pipette with a tip removed, from which its head protruded, and its antennae, proboscis and forelegs were permitted to move freely. They were allowed to adapt to the environment for about 12 h, and satiated with ddH<sub>2</sub>O until the trial. The testing moth was stimulated to the distal part of one antenna with a given test solution in an absorbent cotton ball, and the PER in response to the stimulation was recorded. The interval between two successive stimulations was 5 min, during which the distal part of the antenna was washed, and the insect was fed with ddH<sub>2</sub>O if needed. Four hours later, two foreleg tarsi of the moth were simultaneously stimulated with the test solutions in the same way as the antenna was stimulated, and the PER was recorded. 20 to 30 individual moths were used for each set of tests. The experiments were repeated three times with groups of insects from three different rearing batches.</p>

<title>RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis</title>
<p>The galea of larvae, and the antennae, foreleg tarsi, proboscis, and abdomen of both male and female adults were removed and directly placed into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes (Axygen, Tewksbury, MA, USA) containing 1 mL QIAzol Lysis Reagent (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany); then, the extraction of total RNA was carried out following the manufacturer’s protocols. After extraction, the RNA quality and concentration were determined with a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). First, for cDNA synthesis 2 μg total RNA was mixed with 1 μL oligo-dT (Promega, Madison, WI, USA); then, the mixture was heated at 70°C 5 min and followed by an ice bath for 5 min. M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was added; subsequently, the mixture was incubated at 42°C for 90 min.

<p>The phylogenetic tree was built with <italic>H. armigera</italic> and sugar GRs of eight other insect species: Diptera, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Robertson et al., 2003</xref>), <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kent et al., 2008</xref>), and <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hill et al., 2002</xref>); Hymenoptera, <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Robertson &amp; Wanner, 2006</xref>); and Lepidoptera, <italic>Danaus plexippus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zhan et al., 2011</xref>), <italic>Heliconius Melpomene</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Briscoe et al., 2013</xref>), <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Guo et al., 2017</xref>), and <italic>Plutella xylostella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Engsontia et al., 2014</xref>). Amino acid sequences were aligned with MAFFT version 7.455 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Rozewicki et al., 2019</xref>), and gap sites were removed with trimAI version 1.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Capella-Gutierrez et al., 2009</xref>). The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the maximum likelihood method in IQ-tree version 6.8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>). The bootstrap algorithm was based on the Jones–Taylor–Thornton (JTT) + F + G4 model and run 5000 times. Visualization and later modification of phylogenetic trees were performed in FigTree version 1.4.4 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/">http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Quantitative real-time PCR</title>
<p>The relative expression levels of sugar GRs in <italic>H. armigera</italic> were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Livak &amp; Schmittgen, 2001</xref>). The specific primers <bold>(Appendix—Table 3</bold>) were designed by Primer3plus (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.primer3plus.com/cgi-bin/dev/primer3plus.cgi">http://www.primer3plus.com/cgi-bin/dev/primer3plus.cgi</ext-link>). qRT-PCR was conducted with a QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). All reactions included 10 μL SYBR Premix Ex <italic>Taq</italic> (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan); 0.4 μL (10 mM) primer (forward and reverse), 2 μL template DNA, 0.4 μL ROX Reference Dye II Dye, 6.8 μL ddH<sub>2</sub>O (20 μL total). The procedure was as follows: 95°C for 30 s; 40 cycles of 95°C for 5 s and 60°C for 34 s; 95°C for 15 s; 60°C for 1 min; and 95°C for 15 s. <italic>18S</italic> ribosomal RNA (GenBank number: KT343378.1) was used as the standard gene because the Ct value of this gene was not different between different tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Sharath Chandra et al., 2014</xref>). The relative expression levels of the specific genes were quantified by using the 2<sup>−ΔCt</sup> method, where ΔCt is the Ct value of GR genes subtracted from that of <italic>18S</italic>. Three biological replicates were run for all experiments, and there were 30–100 insects in each replicate.</p>

<title>Ectopic expression and functional analysis of sugar GRs</title>
<p>The sugar GRs sequences which were used for ectopic expression and functional identification need to contain restriction enzyme sites and Kozak sequences (the primer sequences of <italic>H. armigera</italic> sugar GRs for functional identification are provided in <bold>Appendix—Table 4</bold>). The full-length sequence of the sugar receptor was cloned from cDNA and transferred into pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). After cleavage by appropriate endonucleases, it was linked to pCS2<sup>+</sup> vector. pCS2<sup>+</sup> vector was linearized and cRNA was synthesized according to the protocol of the mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). The products were dissolved in ddH<sub>2</sub>O, diluted to 3000 ng/μL, and then stored at −80°C until use.</p>
<p>Each of Gr4, Gr5, Gr6, Gr7, Gr8, Gr10, Gr11, Gr12, Gr5 + Gr6, and Gr10 + Gr6 was expressed in oocytes. The acquisition of <italic>X. laevis</italic> oocytes was performed following a previously described protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Nakagawa &amp; Touhara, 2013</xref>). <italic>X. laevis</italic> were anesthetized by a mixture of ice and water for 30 min; then, the abdomen was cut to obtain oocytes. The <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes were treated with 2 mg/mL collagenase type I (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) in a calcium-free saline buffer (82.5 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM HEPES, pH = 7.5; the reagents are provided in <bold>Key resource table</bold>) at room temperature for 25 min. The oocytes were microinjected with 27.6 nL (80 ng) cRNA of each <italic>GR</italic> by SMART Touch<sup>TM</sup> (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA). For Gr10 + Gr6 or Gr5 + Gr6, a cRNA mixture with a ratio of 1:1 was used. The oocytes microinjected with RNAse-free water were used as the control. Then, the oocytes were incubated for 3–4 days at 16°C in the bath solution (96 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.5; reagents are provided in <bold>Key resource table</bold>).</p>
<p>The whole-cell current was recorded with a two-electrode voltage clamp, the procedures as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>). The glass electrode, filled with 3M KCl, was inserted into the oocytes and maintained at 0.2–2.0 MΩ. The signal was amplified with an OC-725C amplifier (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT, USA) at a holding potential at –80 mV all the time, low-pass filtered at 50 Hz, and digitized at 1 kHz. The sugar compounds (<bold>Key resource table</bold>) were dissolved in 1 × Ringer solution (96 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.5) as the test solution. The oocytes were stimulated by test solution via the perfusion system for 20 s each time, and then washed by 1 × Ringer solution <sup>68</sup>. The concentration of 100 mM for each chemical was randomly used at first, and then concentration gradients (ranging from 0.01 mM, 0.1 mM, 1 mM, 10 mM, 50 mM, 100 mM, 250 mM, and 500 mM) were recorded later when a clear current response was detected. Data were obtained and analyzed using Digidata 1322A and pCLAMP software version 10.4.2.0 (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA, USA).</p>

<title>Embryo microinjection</title>
<p>The fresh laid eggs of <italic>H. armigera</italic> were placed on microscope slides and fixed on double-sided adhesive tape. These operations were finished within 2 h after oviposition. Microinjection into these pretreated eggs was performed with a mixture of <italic>Gr10</italic> (or <italic>Gr6</italic>) sgRNA and Cas9 protein, with final concentrations at 250 ng/μL and 100 ng/μL, respectively. Microinjection was finished using a PLI-100A PICO-INJECTOR (Warner Instruments, Hamden, Connecticut, USA).

<title>DNA extraction and mutagenesis detection</title>
<p>To screen <italic>Gr10</italic> (or <italic>Gr6</italic>) homozygous mutants, the tarsi on hindlegs were used for DNA extraction with the Animal Tissue PCR Kit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China). Then, we used PCR to amplify the sequences that covered <italic>Gr10</italic> or <italic>Gr6</italic> sgRNA targeting sites. The reactions were 50 μL total and included: 2 μL template, 1 μL forward primer, 1 μL reverse primer (mutation detection primer sequences are provided in <bold>Appendix—Table 5</bold>), 25 μL Premix <italic>Taq</italic><sup>TM</sup> (Takara, Dalian, China), and 19 μL ddH<sub>2</sub>O. The procedure was as follows: 94°C for 3 min, 40 cycles [94°C for 30 s, 55°C (<italic>Gr6</italic>), or 60°C (<italic>Gr10</italic>) for 30 s], 72°C for 1 min, and finally 72°C for 5 min. The PCR products were sent to Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) or the SinoGenoMax for Sanger sequencing, and the sequence results were analyzed by SnapGene<sup>®</sup> software version 4.3.8 (from Insightful Science; available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://snapgene.com">snapgene.com</ext-link>) and SeqMan software version 7.1 (DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA).</p>

<title>Screening homozygous mutants</title>
<p><italic>Gr10</italic> and <italic>Gr6</italic> homozygous mutant lines (<italic>Gr10</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and <italic>Gr6<sup>−/−</sup></italic>, respectively) were established. G0 mutants were backcrossed with the wild type to obtain G1 offspring. For <italic>Gr10<sup>−/−</sup></italic>, <italic>Gr10</italic> heterozygotes of G1 moths, one DNA strands containing 4 bp-deleted modifications, were in-crossed to establish stable lines; for the expanding mutant population, 4 bp-deleted homozygotes of G2 moths were in-crossed to generate homozygotes G3 moths (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold>). Similarly, for <italic>Gr6<sup>−/−</sup></italic>, <italic>Gr6</italic> heterozygotes of G1 moths, one DNA strands containing 17 bp-deleted modifications, were in-crossed to establish stable lines; for the expanding mutant population, 17 bp-deleted homozygotes of G2 moths were in-crossed to generate homozygotes G3 moths (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref></bold>). The related mutation rates are provided in <bold>Appendix—Table 6</bold>.</p>
<p>To confirm the deletion in <italic>Gr10<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Gr6<sup>−/−</sup></italic>at mRNA level, the total RNA of the female adult proboscis of WT, <italic>Gr10</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and <italic>Gr6</italic><sup>−/−</sup> were extracted, and the cDNA was synthesized following the previous gene cloning protocol. The specific primers (<bold>Appendix—Table 5</bold>) were designed based on the DNA exon sequences of <italic>Gr10</italic> and <italic>Gr6</italic>, which covered the DNA-confirmed sgRNA targeting sites. During mRNA sequence cloning, the PCR reaction conditions are largely the same as those used for DNA sequence confirmation, with little modification (the annealing temperature reduced to 50°C). The nucleic acid sequences of the identified <italic>Gr10</italic> and <italic>Gr6</italic> were aligned manually by tools at the T-Coffee web server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Notredame et al., 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Off-target effects detection</title>
<p>The potential off-target sites were predicted as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). The online software Cas-OFFinder (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rgenome.net/cas-offinder/">http://www.rgenome.net/cas-offinder/</ext-link>) was used to blast the <italic>Gr10</italic> and <italic>Gr6</italic> sgRNAs against the <italic>H. armigera</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Pearce et al., 2017</xref>), with mismatch number ≤ 3. According to the blast results, <italic>Gr10</italic> has no potential off-target site, and one sequence (GenBank accession number: LOC126054697) in the presence of <italic>Gr6</italic> sgRNA showed a potential off-target region. The specific primers (<bold>Appendix—Table 5</bold>) were designed based on the DNA sequence of LOC126054697 covering the potential off-target sites. The DNA extraction and mutagenesis detection methods were described previously. Five individual replicates were performed.</p>
<p>To further illustrate that the mutation strains did not exhibit off-target effects, the electrophysiological responses of larvae and the biological parameters were compared among WT, <italic>Gr10<sup>−/−</sup></italic>, and <italic>Gr6<sup>−/−</sup></italic>. The larval medial sensilla styloconica to xylose, the body weight of the fifth instar larvae on the first day, the adult lifespan, and the number of eggs laid were recorded.

<title>Effects of <italic>Gr10</italic> or <italic>Gr6</italic> knockout on sugar reception in larvae and adults</title>
<p>We recorded the electrophysiological responses of taste sensilla in the wild type (WT), <italic>Gr10</italic><sup>−/−</sup>, and <italic>Gr6</italic><sup>−/−</sup> by the tip-recording technique as described earlier. Concentration of 1 mM, 10 mM, and 100 mM for sucrose and fucose were used as stimuli for lateral sensilla styloconica in larvae. As the response thresholds of sugar GSNs in adults were higher than those in larvae, concentrations of 10 mM and 100 mM for sucrose and fucose and 100 mM for fructose were used for adult taste sensilla. 2 mM KCl was used as the control for both larval and adult taste sensilla. 10 mM sinigrin and 10 mM nicotine were used as a positive control (induced the response of a bitter cell in the same sensilla) for larval and adult taste sensilla, respectively.

Fifth instar larvae on the first day after molting were starved for 2.5 h before testing. Each plant tissue was weighed and put into a Petri dish (10 cm diameter × 2 cm depth; Corning, Wujiang, China), and then one larva was introduced. The larva was removed after 1 h, and the rest of the plant tissue was weighed. Petri dishes with plant tissues but no caterpillar was used to measure water evaporation of the plant tissues. The feeding amount of larvae is calculated based on the weight changes of the plant tissue before and after being fed. 20 replicates were set for each experiment.</p>

For the two-choice feeding test, paired-samples <italic>t</italic> test was used. The data of dose-response curves in tip-recording, PER experiments and two-electrode voltage-clamp recording, and gene relative expression levels and feeding amount in the no-choice test were analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD tests.

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study identifies the gustatory receptors for sugar sensing in the larval and adult forms of the cotton bollworm, which is responsible for the destruction of many food crops world-wide. The authors find that the larval and adult forms utilise different receptors to sense sugars. The data are <bold>convincing</bold> and will be of interest neuroscientists working in sensory coding of sugars and to the pest management field.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The process of taste perception is significantly more intricate and complex in Lepidopteran insects. This investigation provides valuable insights into the role of Gustatory receptors and their dynamics in the sensation of sucrose, which serves as a crucial feeding cue for insects. The article highlights the differential sensitivity of Grs to sucrose and their involvement in feeding and insect behavior.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>To support the notion of the differential specificity of Gr to sucrose, this study employed electrophysiology, ectopic expression of Grs in Xenopus, genome editing, and behavioral studies on insects. This investigation offers a fundamental understanding of the gustation process in lepidopteran insects and its regulation of feeding and other gustation-related physiological responses. This study holds significant importance in advancing our comprehension of lepidopteran insect biology, gustation, and feeding behavior.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While this manuscript demonstrates technical proficiency, there exists an opportunity for additional refinement to optimize comprehensibility for the intended audience. Several crucial sugars have been overlooked in the context of electrophysiology studies and should be incorporated. Furthermore, it is imperative to consider the potential off-target effects of Gr knock-out on other Gr expressions. This investigation focuses exclusively on Gr6 and Gr10, while neglecting a comprehensive narrative regarding other Grs involved in sucrose sensation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>To identify sugar receptors and assess the capacity of these genes the authors first set out to identify behavioral responses in larvae and adults as well as physiological response. They used phylogenetics and gene expression (RNAseq) to identify candidates for sugar reception. Using first an in vitro oocyte system they assess the responses to distinct sugars. A subsequent genetic analysis shows that the Gr10 and Gr6 genes provide stage specific functions in sugar perception.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A clear strength of the manuscript is the breadth of techniques employed allowing a comprehensive study in a non-canonical model species.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are no major weaknesses in the study for the current state of knowledge in this species. Since it is much basic work to establish a broader knowledge, context with other modalities remains unknown. It might have been possible to probe certain contexts known from the fruit fly, which would have strengthened the manuscript.</p>

<p>In this study, the authors combine electrophysiology, behavioural analyses, and genetic editing techniques on the cotton bollworm to identify the molecular basis of sugar sensing in this species.</p>
<p>The larval and adult forms of this species feed on different plant parts. Larvae primarily consume leaves, which have relatively lower sugar concentrations, while adults feed on nectar, rich in sugar. Through a series of experiments-spanning electrophysiological recordings from both larval and adult sensillae, qPCR expression analysis of identified GRs from these sensillae, response profiles of these GRs to various sugars via heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes, and evaluations of CRISPR mutants based on these parameters-the authors discovered that larvae and adults employ distinct GRs for sugar sensing. While the larva uses the highly sensitive GR10a, the adult uses the less sensitive and broadly tuned GR6. This differential use of GRs are in keeping with their behavioural ecology.</p>
<p>The data are cohesive and consistently align across the methodologies employed. They are also well presented and the manuscript is clearly written.</p>
