<title>Abstract</title><p>Kainate receptors are key modulators of synaptic transmission and plasticity in the central nervous system. Different kainate receptor isoforms with distinct spatiotemporal expressions have been identified in the brain. The GluK1-1 splice variant receptors, which are abundant in the adult brain, have an extra fifteen amino acids inserted in the amino-terminal domain (ATD) of the receptor resulting from alternative splicing of exon 9. However, the functional implications of this post-transcriptional modification are not yet clear. We employed a multi-pronged approach using cryogenic electron microscopy, electrophysiology, and other biophysical and biochemical tools to understand the structural and functional impact of this splice insert in the extracellular domain of GluK1 receptors. Our study reveals that the splice insert alters the key gating properties of GluK1 receptors and their modulation by the cognate auxiliary Neuropilin and tolloid-like (Neto) proteins 1 and 2. Mutational analysis identified the role of crucial splice residues that influence receptor properties and their modulation. Furthermore, the cryoEM structure of the variant shows that the presence of exon 9 in GluK1 does not affect the receptor architecture or domain arrangement in the desensitized state. Our study thus provides the first detailed structural and functional characterization of GluK1-1a receptors, highlighting the role of the splice insert in modulating receptor properties and their modulation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Kainate receptors (KARs), a subfamily of ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs), are required in the vertebrate brain for postsynaptic neurotransmission and presynaptic regulation of transmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Erreger et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Huettner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lerma, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pinheiro and Mulle, 2006</xref>). They are known to mediate characteristic small-amplitude excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSC) with slow kinetics in the hippocampal regions of the central nervous system compared to their counterparts, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Castillo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lerma et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Traynelis et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, they play a vital role in the maturation of neuronal circuits during development by interacting with G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lerma, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lerma and Marques, 2013</xref>). Any functional defect predisposes the brain to various disorders, such as autism, epilepsy, schizophrenia, and neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lerma and Marques, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bowie, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Valbuena and Lerma, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Kainate receptors are composed of subunits from two gene families: low kainate affinity and high kainate affinity. The first gene family includes GluK1-GluK3, which can form both homomeric and heteromeric receptors with subunits from the same family or from the high-kainate affinity family. On the other hand, GluK4-GluK5 are high-affinity subunits that must assemble with low-affinity subunits to create functional receptors. The assembly of different subunits results in the formation of various receptor configurations, which contribute to the wide range of functional properties observed in kainate receptors.</p>
<p>The functional repertoire of kainate receptors is further enhanced by RNA editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barbon and Barlati, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Seeburg, 2002</xref>) alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jaskolski et al., 2004</xref>). In particular, GluK1-containing KARs mainly present in the hippocampus, cortical interneurons, Purkinje cells, and sensory neurons undergo alternative splicing and RNA editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bernard and Khrestchatisky, 1994</xref>). Alternative splicing of the C-terminal domain that produces four isoforms, GluK1-a (shortest C-terminal), GluK1-b, GluK1-c, and GluK1-d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bettler et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gregor et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pinheiro and Mulle, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sommer et al., 1992</xref>) been studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ren et al., 2003</xref>). However, the functional impact of the mRNA splicing of the N-terminal domain (exon 9) resulting in isoforms GluK1-1 and GluK1-2, with GluK1-1 containing an additional 15 amino acids in the amino-terminal domain (ATD) is not understood. Interestingly, the splice junctions for GluK1-1 were reported to be more frequent than those for GluK1-2, and both variants showed similar expression in different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Herbrechter et al., 2021</xref>). This 15-amino acid insertion in the amino-terminal domain (ATD) is exclusive to the GluK1 subunit and may impart unique properties to KARs containing this variant. Therefore, investigations of functional differences between GluK1 receptors with and without the 15 amino acid splice insert are necessary but missing in the field. Furthermore, the impact of the N-terminal splice insert in GluK1-1 receptors on its modulation by cognate auxiliary subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fisher, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">He et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Sheng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Vinnakota et al., 2021</xref>), neuropilin and tolloid-like (Neto) proteins is also unknown.</p>
<p>Therefore, we conducted structure-function studies to understand the mechanisms of GluK1-1a receptor function and the effects of the ATD splice on receptor assembly, stability, and modulation by Neto proteins. Whole-cell and excised outside-out patch-clamp-based functional assays were performed to investigate the differences between the ATD splice variants GluK1-1a (exon 9) and GluK1-2a (lacking exon 9) and their modulation by Neto proteins. Furthermore, mutational analysis was performed to identify important splice residues that affect receptor functions and their modulation by Neto proteins. Additionally, we expressed and purified rat GluK1-1a from HEK293 GnTI-cells and determined the single-particle cryo-EM structures of the receptors trapped in the desensitized state to understand the effect of splice on receptor architecture.</p>

<title>Spatiotemporal expression pattern of GluK1-1 in the brain</title>
<p>Kainate receptor subunits are differentially and spatially regulated in vertebrates. We analyzed publicly available human transcriptomics data to determine whether the exon encoding the GluK1 ATD splice (exon 9) was differentially expressed in the human brain. RNASeq data analysis of <italic>GRIK1</italic> (Ensembl ID: ENSG00000171189) collected from the BrainSpan ATLAS indicated that exon 9 is present in multiple brain areas that also show prominent GluK1 expression. GRIK1 exon 9 expression varies significantly across brain regions and developmental stages, with dynamic patterns indicating its crucial role in brain development. High expression is noted during critical periods such as early embryonic, postnatal, and childhood stages, particularly in regions like the ventricular zone (VZ), cortical plate (CP), hippocampus (HIP), amygdala (AMY), striatum (STR), and caudate nucleus (CN) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>; Figure 1-figure supplement 1). These patterns suggest GRIK1 exon 9’s importance in the functional maturation of these brain regions. For example, in the cerebellar cortex, GRIK1 exon 9 expression peaks during early development and childhood and stabilizes into adulthood, underscoring its role in cortical development and function. (Figure 1-figure supplement 1). The significant variability in exon 9 expression across different brain regions, along with its potential role in brain development and functional maturation, motivated us to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms. This prompted us to perform a detailed structure-function analysis of the GluK1-1a splice variant.</p>

<title>The ATD splice imparts functional diversity to GluK1 receptors</title>
<p>Previous studies on functional analysis of GluK1 receptors have primarily focused on GluK1-2 isoform that lacks the ATD splice insert. Therefore, we conducted an extensive electrophysiological investigation to assay the functional differences between GluK1-1a and GluK1-2a. The only difference between these two variants is the presence of 15 amino acids (KASGEVSKHLYKVWK) insertion in the R2 subdomain (lower lobe) of the GluK1-1a ATD. We evaluated multiple gating properties of the two variants by whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology. Interestingly, we observed that GluK1-1a receptors desensitize significantly slowly when compared to GluK1-2a (Ʈ<sub>Des</sub>, GluK1-1a: 5.21 ± 0.50 ms; GluK1-2a: 3.55 ± 0.23 ms **P=0.0092) on prolonged treatment with 10 mM glutamate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We also tested receptor desensitization by applying saturating concentrations of kainate (1mM). Since the receptors displayed prolonged desensitizing kainate currents, instead of the rate (Ʈ<sub>Des</sub>), we calculated the % desensitization values at 1 s for comparison. We observed that the % desensitization with kainate was distinct for both ATD splice variants with significantly slower desensitization in the variant with the splice insert (GluK1-1a: 72.06 ± 2.33 %, GluK1-2a: 93.2 ± 0.55 ***P=0.0006) consistent with the glutamate evoked currents (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we evaluated glutamate sensitivity for the two variants. Dose-response experiments (glutamate, GluK1-1a: 0.1-2 mM, and GluK1-2a: 0.01-3 mM) showed a significantly lower potency of glutamate for GluK1-1a variant compared to the non-spliced form (EC<sub>50</sub> glutamate, GluK1-1a: 379.3 ± 52 µM, GluK1-2a: 187.7 ± 33 µM *P=0.0129 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, for high-affinity agonist kainate, the dose-response curves for both variants were similar, likely indicating differences in the stability of glutamate <italic>versus</italic> the kainate-bound states in GluK1-1a and GluK1-2a (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>; Figure 2-figure supplement 1). Thus, the potency of kainate (1mM) <italic>versus</italic> glutamate (10 mM) (I<sub>K</sub>/I<sub>G</sub> ratio) is significantly higher for GluK1-1a compared to GluK1-2a (GluK1-1a: 1.51 ± 0.13, GluK1-2a: 0.56 ± 0.4 ****P&lt; 0.0001) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Further, we investigated the voltage-dependent endogenous polyamine block and found significant differences between the two variants. The presence of splice residues seemed to enhance outward currents at positive potentials in GluK1-1a compared to GluK1-2a (rectification index, +90mV /-90 mV; GluK1-1a = 0.96 ± 0.11; GluK1-2a = 0.61 ± 0.10 *P=0.0385) without affecting the reversal potential (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). How splice residues situated ∼92 Å away from the TM domain (distance between atoms W381 CA in the ATD and L636 CA in the TM3) affect the pore properties is unclear. Earlier reports suggest that rectification in KARs is mainly affected by the TM2 region(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bowie and Mayer, 1995</xref>). However, a recent report in which the ATD of GluK2 was deleted also showed enhanced rectification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Splice residues likely alter pore structure by allosteric mechanisms that have yet to be identified, thereby affecting rectification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Perrais et al., 2009</xref>). We also performed outside-out patch recordings to examine GluK1-1a receptors. However, we observed extremely weak electrical currents with low amplitudes when GluK1-1a was expressed in isolation. Consequently, the data we obtained from these recordings did not provide reliable results for curve fitting or thorough analysis.</p>

<p>Neto 1 and Neto 2 proteins significantly influence the surface expression, synaptic localization, and functional properties of the GluK1-2a receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Copits et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Palacios-Filardo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Sheng et al., 2015</xref>). It has been demonstrated that desensitization of GluK1-2a is accelerated by Neto1 but delayed by Neto2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Sheng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Copits et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Palacios-Filardo et al., 2016</xref>). Hence, to understand the influence of these KAR auxiliary proteins on GluK1-1a, we performed an electrophysiological analysis of GluK1-1a and GluK1-2a receptors co-expressed with either Neto1 or Neto2. Co-expression of Neto1 hastened desensitization of GluK1-1a significantly but not of GluK1-2a at saturating glutamate concentrations (Ʈ<sub>Des</sub>, GluK1-1a +Neto1: 3.56 ± 0.22 ms **P=0.0090; GluK1-2a +Neto1: 4.32 ± 0.34 P=0.1495). On the other hand, Neto2 led to a ∼ 13.4-fold decrease in the desensitization rate of GluK1-1a (Ʈ<sub>Des</sub>, GluK1-1a: 5.21 ± 0.50 ms, +Neto2: 69.62 ± 9.98 ms **P=0.0024) while the desensitization rate of GluK1-2a was decreased only by ∼ 6.1-fold (Ʈ<sub>Des</sub>, GluK1-2a: 3.55 ± 0.23 ms, +Neto2: 21.68 ± 2.64 ms **P=0.0017). Thus, while Neto1 accelerated the desensitization of GluK1-1a, Neto2 significantly slowed it at saturating glutamate concentrations. The rate of desensitization for GluK1-1a was approximately 3.2 times slower compared to GluK1-2a (***P=0.0009) when coexpressed with Neto2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Thus, the presence of splice insert leads to differential modulation of GluK1 desensitization by Neto proteins.</p>

<p>Moreover, Neto1 also enhanced the recovery from desensitization for both the variants (Ʈ<sub>Recovery</sub>, GluK1-1a: 3.53 ± 0.81 s, +Neto1: 0.68 ± 0.07 s *P=0.0390; GluK1-2a: 5.31 ± 0.50 s +Neto1: 1.15 ± 0.12 s ***P=0.0002). GluK1-1a recovers ∼ 1.7 times faster than GluK1-2a (*P=0.0125) when co-expressed with Neto1. Neto 2, on the other hand, slowed recovery for both variants to a similar extent (Ʈ<sub>Recovery</sub>, GluK1-1a: 3.53 ± 0.81 s, +Neto2: 8.32 ± 0.81 s **P=0.0044; GluK1-2a: 5.31 ± 0.50 s, +Neto2: 7.91 ± 0.71 s *P=0.0430) and did not show differential modulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In addition, both Neto1 and Neto2 increased the potency of glutamate for GluK1-1a by 9.7-fold (39 ± 10 µM) and 11.2-fold (34 ± 8 µM), respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>; Figure 3-figure supplement 1A). This is similar to the effect observed in GluK1-2a receptors whereby the glutamate EC<sub>50</sub> was shown to increase by Neto proteins [Neto1: 34-fold and Neto2: 7.5-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Palacios-Filardo et al., 2016</xref>) and Neto1/2: 30-10X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fisher, 2015</xref>)].</p>
<p>Since we observed a significant increase in the I<sub>K</sub>/I<sub>G</sub> ratios in GluK1 due to the presence of splice insert, we next aimed to determine the influence of co-expressing Neto proteins on this parameter. Interestingly, while Neto 1 and Neto2 reduced the I<sub>K</sub>/I<sub>G</sub> ratios in GluK1-1a (GluK1-1a: 1.51 ± 0.13, +Neto1: 1.25 ± 0.04 P=0.1500, +Neto2: 1.0 ± 0.07 **P=0.0090), they increased it for the non-spliced variant (GluK1-2a: 0.56 ± 0.04, +Neto1: 1.37 ± 0.12 ****P&lt;0.0001, +Neto2: 1.16 ± 0.04 ****P&lt;0.0001) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>; Figure 3-figure supplement 1B; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>) highlighting the effect of splice residues. Interestingly, this differential modulation of the two variants by Neto proteins resulted in comparable I<sub>K</sub>/I<sub>G</sub> ratios.</p>
<p>Next, we investigated the effects of Neto1 and Neto2 on the voltage-dependent endogenous polyamine block since the presence of splice insert had enhanced the outward rectification of GluK1. We observed that both Neto1 and Neto2 significantly enhanced the outward rectification of GluK1-2a (GluK1-2a: 0.61 ± 0.10, +Neto1: 1.14 ± 0.14 *P=0.0338, +Neto2: 1.37 ± 0.10 **P= 0.0022). However, they did not significantly increase it for GluK1-1a (GluK1-1a: 0.96 ± 0.11, +Neto1: 1.16 ± 0.09 P=0.1880, +Neto2: 0.80 ± 0.05 P=0.2401) and did not show differential modulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>We also calculated desensitization and deactivation kinetics in excised outside-out patches. However, GluK1-1a receptors, when expressed alone, exhibited low peak amplitudes in outside-out recordings that prevented reliable calculation of gating kinetics. Hence, we only compared the properties of receptors co-expressed with Neto proteins, and the results were consistent with those obtained from whole-cell recordings (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G - H</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).. Neto 2 slowed down desensitization of GluK1-1a by ∼ 1.5 times compared to GluK1-2a (Ʈ<sub>Des</sub>, GluK1-1a +Neto2: 31.89 ± 4.08 ms; GluK1-2a +Neto2: 20.91 ± 2.11; P=0.0665) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The desensitization rates for GluK1-1a and GluK1-2a receptors co-expressed with Neto1 was also significantly altered (Ʈ<sub>Des</sub>, GluK1-1a +Neto1: 4.83 ± 0.46 ms; GluK1-2a +Neto2: 2.84 ± 0.35; *P=0.0310) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Faster solution exchange times in excised patch recordings also allowed us to measure deactivation kinetics using a 1 ms application of 10 mM glutamate. Surprisingly, unlike desensitization, for receptors coexpressed with Neto2, the deactivation rate of GluK1-1a is significantly faster compared to that of GluK1-2a (Ʈ<sub>Dea</sub>, GluK1-1a +Neto2: 5.18 ± 0.65 ms; GluK1-2a +Neto2: 10.74 ± 1.48; **P=0.0077). In contrast, Neto1 did not significantly alter deactivation kinetics of both GluK1 variant receptors (Ʈ<sub>Dea</sub>, GluK1-1a +Neto1: 2.83 ± 0.20 ms; GluK1-2a +Neto1: 2.14 ± 0.37; P=0.2086) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Thus, both whole-cell and excised patch recordings confirm the unique functional properties and differential modulation by Neto proteins due to the presence of fifteen amino acid insert in GluK1-1a receptors.</p>

<title>Mutations in GluK1-1a splice insert alter channel properties</title>
<p>Since our electrophysiological analysis showed functional differences between the two splice variants and their modulation by Neto proteins, we created receptors with mutated splice residues and conducted functional assays to identify the key residues. The splice insert (KASGEVSKHLYKVWK) is dominated by positively charged residues and contains four lysins and one histidine. We hypothesized that these charged residues might affect the interactions at the ATD-LBD interface and influence receptor functions. To investigate this, we prepared charge-reversal (K/H to E) and charge-neutral (K/H to A) mutants and carried out functional assays (Figure 4-table supplement 1). Our cell surface biotinylation assay showed that all mutants (glutamate or alanine) reached the cell surface efficiently (data not shown). However, the charge-neutral mutants (K/H to A) gave either very low peak amplitudes (&lt;40 pA) or were not functional and hence, were not included in the study. The charge reversal mutants K<sub>368</sub>-E and K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E revealed fascinating insights into the role of splice residues in altering GluK1 receptor properties (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Interestingly, both mutants, K<sub>368</sub>-E and K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E exhibited a significantly slower rate of glutamate-evoked desensitization compared to wild-type GluK1-1a (Ʈ<sub>Des</sub>, GluK1-1a: 5.21 ± 0.50 ms; K<sub>368</sub>-E: 7.89 ± 1.14 ms *P=0.0334; K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E: 9.61 ± 1.47 *P=0.0290) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We also observed a significant delay in the recovery from the desensitized state for K<sub>368</sub>-E mutant (K<sub>368</sub>: 5.61 ± 0.95 s *P=0.0417) compared to wild-type GluK1-1a. In addition, the K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E mutant also exhibited a slowdown in the recovery, though not significant. (K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E: 4.83 ± 0.31 s P=0.2774) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Our investigations of glutamate- and kainate-evoked responses for wild-type and mutant receptors considering their peak amplitudes (I<sub>K</sub>/I<sub>G</sub>) revealed a significant decrease for the K<sub>368</sub>-E mutant (GluK1-1a: 1.51 ± 0.13; K<sub>368</sub>-E: 0.81 ± 0.13 **P=0.0037) and a reduction was observed for K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E receptors (1.17 ± 0.28 P=0.3733) compared to wild-type although the differences do not reach statistical significance (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These observations are reciprocal to the effect of splice insert compared to the non-spliced form, indicating the importance of these residues in influencing receptor desensitization and recovery. A similar trend reversal was also observed for the measurements of the rectification index for these mutants at positive and negative potentials (+90 mV and -90 mV). The rectification index was significantly reduced in the case of mutant K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E (K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E: 0.62 ± 0.14 *P=0.0499). Surprisingly, no outward rectification was observed for the K<sub>368</sub>-E mutant, and further investigation is needed to fully understand the reasons for the same (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>; Figure 5-figure supplement 2C; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>GluK1-1a splice residues K<sub>368,</sub> K<sub>375</sub>, H<sub>376,</sub> K<sub>379</sub> and K<sub>382</sub> influence receptor modulation by Neto proteins</title>
<p>Next, we investigated the effects of splice mutants on receptor modulation by Neto proteins. To test whether mutations in splice residues could disrupt interactions with Neto proteins, we performed receptor pull-downs using an antibody against the His-tag of the receptor. Our results showed that the mutant receptors could efficiently pull down Neto1 (detected using the Neto1 antibody) and Neto2-EGFP (detected using the GFP antibody) (Figure 5-figure supplement 1), suggesting that mutants don’t altogether abolish GluK1-1a and Neto interactions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we conducted electrophysiology experiments to investigate whether coexpression of Neto proteins can restore functionality and influence the functions of splice mutants. We observed that mutant K<sub>368</sub>-E desensitizes significantly slower in the presence of Neto1 while the mutants K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E and K<sub>368/375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E do not exhibit any significant deviation (Ʈ<sub>Des</sub>, GluK1-1a +Neto1: 3.56 ± 0.22 ms; K<sub>368</sub>-E +Neto1: 4.37 ± 0.25 ms *P=0.0393; K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E +Neto1: 3.74 ± 0.20 ms P=0.5390; K<sub>368/375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E +Neto1: 4.86 ± 0.67 ms P=0.1242) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>; Figure 5-figure supplement 2A; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This observation suggests that some splice residues influence GluK1-1a modulation by Neto1, and more mutational, functional, and structural studies on this interaction are necessary. On the other hand, Neto2 does not significantly affect the desensitization of these mutant receptors compared to wild-type-Neto2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>; Figure 5-figure supplement 2A; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, K<sub>368</sub>-E and K<sub>368/375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E mutants recover significantly faster from the desensitized state when coexpressed with Neto1. On the other hand, the recovery from the desensitized state for mutant receptors is not significantly affected by Neto2. Thus, while Neto1 seems to affect the mutant receptor recovery from the desensitized state, Neto 2 doesn’t show significant differences compared to wild-type receptors, again highlighting the differential modulation of GluK1-1a receptors by Neto proteins (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, to determine whether the agonist efficacy of mutant receptors changed in the presence of Neto proteins, I<sub>K</sub>/I<sub>G</sub> ratios were measured. Neto1 increased the agonist efficacy for the K<sub>368</sub>-E and K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E mutants but not for K<sub>368/375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E receptors (K<sub>368</sub>-E +Neto1: 6.99 ± 0.47 ***P=0.0002; K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E +Neto1: 1.69 ± 0.15 *P=0.0326; K<sub>368/375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E +Neto1: 1.15 ± 0.20 P=0.6495) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>; Figure 5-figure supplement 2B; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Similarly, Neto2 also considerably increased the I<sub>K</sub>/I<sub>G</sub> values for mutant K<sub>368</sub>-E, rescuing the kainate efficacy (K<sub>368</sub>-E +Neto2: 2.13 ± 0.13 ***P=0.0007), while it does not seem to have any significant effect on the K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E mutant (K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E +Neto2: 0.86 ± 0.08 P=0.2045) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>; Figure 5-figure supplement 2B; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Consistent with the observation above, our examination of the rectification index revealed a significant increase in outward current for the K<sub>368</sub>-E mutant (K<sub>368</sub>-E +Neto1: 2.84 ± 0.16 **P=0.0021). However, K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E did not show any difference compared to wild-type receptors, while K<sub>368/375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E displayed a significant decrease in the outward current (K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E +Neto1: 1.23 ± 0.07 P=0.5351; K<sub>368/375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E +Neto1: 0.59 ± 0.13 **P=0.0081) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>; Figure 5-figure supplement 2C; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, however, the splice residue mutants did not show any significant variation in the rectification index when coexpressed with Neto2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>; Figure 5-figure supplement 2C; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, our analysis of the gating properties of GluK1-1a mutants co-expressed with Neto proteins suggests that positively charged residues at positions 368, 375, 376, 379, and 382 in the splice insert influence receptor modulation by Neto proteins. Neto1 appears to have more pronounced effects on the mutant receptors compared to Neto2. Specifically, Neto1 significantly slowed desensitization for the K<sub>368</sub>-E mutant, accelerated recovery from desensitization for K<sub>368-E</sub> and K<sub>368/375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E mutants, increased agonist efficacy for K<sub>368</sub>-E and K<sub>375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E mutants, and altered rectification properties for K<sub>368</sub>-E and K<sub>368/375/379/382</sub>H<sub>376</sub>-E mutants. In contrast, Neto2 had fewer significant effects on the mutant receptors, with the main impact being an increase in agonist efficacy for the K<sub>368</sub>-E mutant. Notably, Neto2 did not significantly affect desensitization, recovery from desensitization, or rectification properties of the mutant receptors when compared with wild-type GluK1-1a coexpressed with Neto2. These findings suggest that the splice residues in GluK1-1a differentially influence receptor modulation by Neto1 and Neto2, with Neto1 showing more extensive modulation of the mutant receptors’ functional properties.</p>

A resolution of ∼5.2 Å was achieved for the receptors in lipid nanodiscs, but the transmembrane region was not resolved due to an orientation bias (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>; Figure 6-figure supplement 5; Figure 6-table supplement 1). The full-length receptor in detergent micelles had a resolution of 8.2 Å, including the transmembrane region, which was ∼8 Å for the extracellular domain (Figure 6-figure supplement 5; Figure 6-table supplement 1).</p>
<p>A tetrameric receptor model was built based on the crystal structures of GluK1-1a ATD, GluK1 LBD (kainate-bound state; PDB:3C32), and the TM domain based on a highly identical GluK2<sub>EM</sub> (PDB:5KUF). Our cryo-EM map represented ATD residues-1-398, but the density corresponding to the ATD splice (368-382) was poorly resolved. The ATD-LBD linkers were resolved for all subunits (A to D) in both structures, the S1 and S2 domains were built entirely, and the TMD (TM1, TM3, and TM4) was built only for detergent-solubilized receptors (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>; Figure 6-figure supplement 6 and 7). For receptors reconstituted in lipid nanodiscs, we observed only the TM3 bundle. TM2 was not resolved in either dataset (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>; Figure 6-figure supplement 7). Extra densities were observed in the ECD layer of the GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> ND map, which coincided with potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Figure 6-figure supplement 8). GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> maps showed general conservation of the architecture of kainate receptors captured in the desensitized state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Khanra et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kumari et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Meyerson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Selvakumar et al., 2021</xref>). Consistent with earlier studies on homomeric and heteromeric KARs in the desensitized state, GluK1-1a exhibited a modular organization with three layers, namely, the two-fold symmetric ATD, quasi-four-fold symmetric (LBD and four-fold symmetric TMD. The presence of the ATD splice insert in GluK1-1a did not affect the arrangement of the receptor domains in the desensitized state (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>; Figure 6-figure supplement 7). A superimposition of GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> (detergent-solubilized or reconstituted in nanodiscs) and GluK1-2a (PDB:7LVT) showed an overall conservation of the structures in the desensitized state. No significant movements were observed at both the ATD and LBD layers of GluK1-1a with respect to GluK1-2a (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>; Figure 6-figure supplement 9).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Alternative splicing is a well-known mode of protein function modulation in various ion channels, such as transient receptor potential (TRP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gracheva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>), big potassium (BK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2005</xref>), acid-sensing sodium (ASICs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bässler et al., 2001</xref>), and Shaker K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hoshi et al., 1991</xref>). In the case of iGluRs, the 38 amino acid residue preceding TM4, known as flip and flop isoforms, is a well-characterized module of AMPARs that affects receptor expression and gating kinetics and is involved in various pathophysiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Park et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sommer et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Stine et al., 2001</xref>). For kainate receptors, the combination of different subunits (GluK1-GluK5) and post-transcriptional modifications, such as RNA editing and splicing, provides a broader range of pharmacological and gating properties, which can affect synaptic physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kumar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kumar and Mayer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lerma, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Straub et al., 2016</xref>). GluK1 is the most diversified subunit of KARs due to multiple post-transcriptional events and has been widely studied as a potential drug target. A recent report highlighted the equivalent presence of GRIK1-1 (exon 9) with respect to GRIK1-2 (lacking exon 9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Herbrechter et al., 2021</xref>). The dominant presence of the GRIK1-1 gene was also reported in retinal Off bipolar cells of ground squirrel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lindstrom et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, an N-terminal splice (exon 5) in a similar position has been observed in the GluN1 subunit of NMDA receptors, which is known to influence the interactions at the ATD-LBD interface and, therefore, proton sensitivity and channel kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Regan et al., 2018</xref>). However, this is the first report to decipher the role of the N-terminal splice insert in the kainate receptor family.</p>
<p>Our study compared the role of ATD splice in the kinetics of the GluK1-1a to a previously extensively characterized equivalent receptor without the splice region, GluK1-2a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Copits et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fisher, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fisher and Fisher, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sommer et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Swanson and Heinemann, 1998</xref>). We found that the splice insert affects desensitization, recovery from desensitization, glutamate sensitivity, and channel rectification of the GluK1 receptor. Moreover, the splice also had a profound impact on desensitization with kainate, suggesting that the receptor follows different functional pathways for the two agonists. Our results showed a significant deviation from GluK1-2a in kainate-versus glutamate-evoked currents (I<sub>K</sub>/I<sub>G</sub>), implying a role for splice residues in imparting higher efficacy for kainate. This likely explains the enhanced stability of the kainate-bound state in GluK1-1a, leading to slower desensitization compared to GluK1-2a. Our functional assays of GluK1-1a receptors co-expressed with Neto proteins showed that Neto1 facilitates faster recovery from the desensitized state, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Copits et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fisher, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Palacios-Filardo et al., 2016</xref>). However, we did not observe the fast onset of desensitization previously reported for GluK-2a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Copits et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fisher, 2015</xref>). The differences in observations could be due to variations in experimental conditions, such as the constructs and recording conditions used.</p>
<p>Additionally, our results show that Neto2 retards recovery from desensitization for both GluK1 variants, contradicting earlier reports of conflicting recovery rates with Neto2 for GluK1-2a. This indicates that Neto1 and Neto2 may interact with both GluK1 variants in a mutually exclusive manner or that the splice position may regulate the modulation behavior of Neto2 and Neto1. Our comparison of kainate and glutamate efficacies for the two variants also showed differential modulation by Neto proteins. Both Neto1 and Neto2 reduced the I<sub>K</sub>/I<sub>G</sub> ratios in GluK1-1a, while they significantly increased the I<sub>K</sub>/I<sub>G</sub> ratios in GluK1-2a, highlighting the impact of the splice insert on receptor response to the agonists (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>; Figure 3-figure supplement 1B; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Our mutational analysis showed that K<sub>368</sub>, a splice insert residue, affects channel kinetics. The charge reversal mutant (K<sub>368</sub>-E) showed significant differences from the wild-type GluK1-1a for all tested properties, indicating a role for K<sub>368</sub> in protein-protein and/or protein-glycan interactions at the ATD-LBD interface.</p>
<p>Our electrophysiological assays reveal a complex interplay between GluK1 receptor splice variants and Neto auxiliary proteins. While Neto2 demonstrates a more profound impact on wild-type GluK1-1a function compared to GluK1-2a, particularly in slowing desensitization, Neto1’s modulation appears more sensitive to specific mutations in the splice insert. This suggests that Neto2 may have a stronger overall effect on receptor function through potentially allosteric mechanisms, whereas Neto1 might interact more directly with specific splice insert residues. The differential sensitivity to mutations highlights distinct roles for these auxiliary proteins: Neto2 as a powerful modulator of overall receptor function, and Neto1 as having more specific interactions with the splice insert region. This complexity underscores the nuanced nature of these protein interactions and the need for further structural and functional studies to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying the functional diversity of GluK1 receptors.</p>
<p>Although our cryo-EM map poorly resolved the splice region, its position can be ascertained close to the ATD-LBD interface. Based on our functional assays, the splice may possibly affect the interaction between the receptor and auxiliary proteins. The modulatory effects of Neto1 and Neto2 on GluK1 splice variants might be mediated by multiple conserved positively charged patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Vinnakota et al., 2021</xref>). The complex between GluK2-Neto2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">He et al., 2021</xref>) provides a model that suggests K<sub>183</sub> and K<sub>187</sub> of GluK1 can potentially interact with a negative patch on Neto1 (D<sub>140</sub>-E<sub>144</sub>) and Neto2 (D<sub>144</sub>-E<sub>148</sub>). However, the splice insert appears to be positioned away from this interacting surface. Thus, it is possible that the splice residues may interact with Neto proteins when the receptor adopts a different conformation during the gating cycle. Additionally, splice residues could have an indirect or allosteric influence on the modulation of receptor functions and regulation by Neto proteins.</p>
<p>Our research, which encompasses structural, biochemical, biophysical, and functional investigations, highlights the significance of the unique N-terminal splice insert in the functions of GluK1 kainate receptors and opens avenues for further studies to understand its physiological effects. We also elucidated the important residues within the splice insert that could impact the modulatory behavior of auxiliary proteins. Our study emphasizes the need to investigate all possible combinations of KAR splice variants to better appreciate their contributions at different developmental stages. This comprehensive understanding of the distribution and functional diversity is essential for a rational therapeutic approach involving kainate receptors.</p>

<title>Whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology</title>
<p>A whole-cell patch-clamp analysis was performed to understand the functional differences between GluK1-1a and GluK1-2a, as well as their modulation by Neto proteins. HEK293 WT mammalian cells were seeded on siliconized glass coverslips in 35 mm dishes using Dulbecco’s Modification of Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM glutamine, and 10 units/mL Penicillin-Streptomycin 24h before transection. Cells were transfected with rat (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>) <italic>GRIK1-1a</italic> or <italic>GRIK1-2a</italic> cloned in pRK7 (in the presence or absence of r<italic>Neto1</italic>/r<italic>Neto2</italic> cloned in IE-pRK8 as indicated) with EGFP expressing plasmid using Xfect (Clontech) according to manufacturer’s instructions (receptor: Neto in 1: 3 and Receptor: EGFP in 1:1 DNA concentration). Similar protocols were followed to test the functionality of the <italic>GRIK1-1a<sub>EM</sub></italic> and <italic>GRIK1-1a</italic> splice mutant constructs. The whole-cell patch-clamp recording was performed with an EPC 10 USB amplifier (HEKA) 24-48 hours post-transfection. Cells were lifted using 1.5 mm diameter thin wall glass capillary tubes (30-0066 Harvard Apparatus), pulled to a fine tip with a Sutter P-1000 micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) containing internal solution (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 100 mM CsF, 30 mM CsCl, 4 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM EGTA and 300 mOsm). Cells were continuously perfused with external/bath solution (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2.8 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2,</sub> and 300 mOsm) through a peristaltic perfusion system (Multichannel systems). Current was measured by holding the membrane at -60 mV, using a 2-kHz low-pass filter. Ligands (10 mM glutamate, 1 mM kainate, 2 mM SYM2081, or 10 µM UBP301) were applied through a double-barrelled theta pipette connected with an ultra-fast piezo-based perfusion system (Multichannel systems) <italic>via</italic> v8 Perfusion Fast-Step System (VC-77SP). Recordings were controlled and measured using Patchmaster-v2x90.2 (Heka Elektronik). The raw files were analyzed using Clampfit 11.2 (Molecular Devices)and Fitmaster-v2x90.4 (HEKA Elektronik). The data was fitted to logistic curves in GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc.). All traces were normalized before being used for calculations. The single exponential two-term fitting (Levenberg-Marquardt) was used to estimate the rate of desensitization (Ʈ<sub>Des</sub>) for 100 ms glutamate application, measured as the decline of the current from 80% of its peak amplitude. Mean-weighted Tau (τ<sub>Des</sub>) values were determined using the formula [(τ1 × amplitude1) + (τ2 × amplitude2)]/[amplitude1 + amplitude2] where the tau values are the time constants from the exponential fit and the amplitudes are the assessed contributions of each component to the total peak current amplitude. To compute the recovery from desensitization, a series of paired-pulse experiments were performed with varying time pulses, where the amplitudes of the test pulse were normalized to that of the desensitizing pulse (calculated as relative amplitude) and plotted in comparison to the time (in seconds) between these two pulses. The recovery rate (Ʈ<sub>Recovery</sub>) was obtained by fitting the one phase association with an exponential function. Dose-response experiments were performed for GluK1-1a (co-expressed with or without Neto proteins) and GluK1-2a with different concentrations of glutamate or kainate in the range of 1 µM to 3 mM or 0.5 µM to 600 µM, respectively. Dose-response values were calculated as the percentage of maximum response against log[agonist] concentrations and fitted using variable slope (Hill’s equation) in GraphPad Prism 8.0.1. For calculating kainate efficacy (I<sub>K</sub>/I<sub>G</sub>), the ratio of peak amplitudes obtained from the same cell evoked first by glutamate followed by kainate were employed. A ratio of peak amplitudes obtained at +90/-90 mV was utilized to calculate the rectification index. We investigated the voltage-dependent endogenous polyamine block by measuring current-voltage relationships for the wild type GluK1 receptors in absence or presence of Neto proteins. Current-voltage (IV) plots were prepared using the voltage ramp from -90 to + 90 mV with a 10 mV increment step only after complete recovery of the receptor, and the current amplitude was normalized to that obtained at -90 mV. For the mutant receptors, current values were obtained only for 3 voltage steps, -90, 0 and +90 mV. For kainate-evoked currents, the percentage desensitization was calculated. The steady-state current measured at the end of 1 s kainate application was divided by peak current. This ratio was then subtracted from 1 and multiplied by 100 to give percentage (%) desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fisher and Fisher, 2014</xref>).</p>

In brief, we performed the 2 sets of PCR using standard cloning primers (∼300 bp upstream and downstream of the mutation) and the mutant primers as listed in Supplemental Table 1 to obtain the fragment containing our mutation of interest and flanking regions corresponding to the wild-type GluK1-1a. Next, the obtained fragment was used as a megaprimer to amplify the complete GluK1-1a vector backbone that would now contain the mutation. This PCR product was DpnI digested for 1h at 37 °C to remove parental DNA and was transformed into DH5α strain of <italic>E.coli</italic>. Clones were confirmed by sequencing.

<title>Co-immunoprecipitation (<italic>in vitro</italic>)</title>
<p>To understand the effect of mutations on GluK1-1a and Neto1/2 interaction, co-immunoprecipitation was carried out using an anti-His monoclonal antibody against the receptor. Similar constructs and transfection protocols were followed for surface expression analysis. Cells were pelleted 65-70 h post-transfection and washed with TBS (20 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl). These cells were sonicated and solubilized in 500 uL lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 1% glycerol, protease inhibitor cocktail, 30 mM DDM). Post solubilization, debris was removed by centrifuging at 17,000 x g for 45 minutes at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated for pre-clearing with 20 µL of pre-equilibrated Protein A agarose beads (Thermo Scientific) for 1 h on a rotator at 4 °C. Post-pre-clearing, ∼ 10% sample was saved as input, and the rest was used for pull-downs. Simultaneously, 2 ug of anti-His antibody (host: rabbit, Cat.

The wild-type protein generated very low amounts of the tetramer, as observed in fluorescence-assisted size-exclusion chromatography (FSEC).

To boost the protein production, 10 mM sodium butyrate (Sigma) was added 16 h post-transfection/infection, and cultures were incubated at 30 °C for protein expression. Cells were harvested 65-70 h after transfection/infection, washed with buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 8 and 150 mM NaCl, and stored at -80 ° C until further processing. The cell pellet was resuspended (20 mL/L culture volume) in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, and protease inhibitor cocktail, Roche). These resuspended cells were disrupted using sonication (QSonica sonicator, 3 cycles of 90 s; 10 s ON/ 20 s OFF; temperature cut-off: 15 °C). The lysate was clarified using low-speed spin (4307 x g for 20 minutes at 4 °C). The membranes were pelleted using ultracentrifugation (118991 x g for 1 h at 4 °C).

The non-solubilized fraction was separated by centrifugation at 47850 x g for 1 h at 4 °C and 4 mL of cobalt-charged TALON resin (Clontech, Takara) was added to the solubilized fraction for batch binding (3 h at 4 °C).

The concentration of SYM2081 was confirmed by electrophysiology, and the stability of the receptor-SYM2081 complex was tested using FSEC.</p>
<p>GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> DDM: Double application of 3 μL protein (∼0.6 mg/mL) SYM2081 complex was carried out on glow-discharged gold grids (R 0.6/1, 300 mesh, Quantifoil). The grids were blotted for 4.5 s and 3.5 s, respectively (0 blot force). Vitrobot temperature was maintained at 12°C with 100% humidity, and the sample was vitrified in liquid ethane. The clipped grids were loaded into a 300 keV Titan Krios microscope equipped with a Falcon III direct detector camera (4k x 4k). Movies were recorded in counting mode with a nominal magnification of 59,000X (pixel size: 1.38 Å), and the defocus range of −2.0 to −3.2 μm increased in steps of 0.3. Each movie comprises 25 frames with a total exposure of 60 seconds. A dose rate of 0.78 e<sup>-</sup>/frame was applied, with the total dose being 19.5 e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> ND: Double application of 2 μL protein (∼0.9 mg/mL) SYM2081 complex was carried out on glow-discharged gold grids (1.2/1.3, 200 mesh, Quantifoil). Grids were blotted for 3 s and 10 s, respectively, followed by vitrification. The clipped grids were loaded into a 300 keV Titan Krios microscope equipped with a K2 direct-detector camera (Gatan). The movies were recorded in super-resolution mode with an energy filter (20eV slit) and a pixel size of 1.41 Å. Each movie was composed of 30 frames with a total exposure of 12 seconds. A dose rate of 1.36 e<sup>-</sup>/frame was applied, with a total dose of 40.8 e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<title>Single-Particle Analysis</title>
<p>All movies (GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> DDM-SYM: 1100, GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> ND-SYM: 1535) were motion-corrected using UCSF Motioncor2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>). Bad micrographs were removed manually post contrast transfer function (CTF) estimation using CTFFIND4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015</xref>). Manually picked particles (∼1000) were 2D classified and used as templates for autopicking in RELION or cryoSPARCv 3. For GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> DDM-SYM and GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> ND-SYM, the autopicked particles in cryoSPARCv3 were cleaned up with multiple rounds of 2D classification. Particles in the best classes were used for training TOPAZ for automated particle picking. For GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> DDM-SYM, initially, 13,750 particles were picked; post iterative rounds of 2D and 3D classification, 5372 particles were used for final 3D reconstruction. In the case of GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> ND-SYM, initially, 1,97,908 particles were picked and subjected to multiple rounds of clean-up using 2D and 3D classification. Finally, 24,531 particles were used for the final 3D reconstruction.</p>
<p>The final particles were corrected for local motion in cryoSPARCv3, followed by refinement using C1 symmetry for both GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> DDM-SYM and GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> ND-SYM. Since we had less information on TMD in both the detergent and nanodisc forms, as observed in 2D classes, we performed local refinement for ATD and LBD using an ECD mask for GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> DDM-SYM and GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> ND-SYM, which improved map resolution to 8.01 Å and 5.2 Å (0.143 FSC) respectively. For GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> DDM-SYM, local refinement using a mask for full-length structure yielded a resolution of 8.2 Å. The 3D maps were sharpened via cryoSPARCv3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Punjani et al., 2017</xref>) or DeepEMhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sanchez-Garcia et al., 2021</xref>) using a mask from the cryoSPARCv3 refinement output. Local Resolution was estimated using BlocRes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cardone et al., 2013</xref>) in cryoSPARCv3 or Phenix1.19.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Afonine et al., 2018a</xref>).</p>

<title>Model building</title>
<p>Tetrameric assembly for the GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> ND-SYM model was built using crystal structures of individual domains (ATD, not yet published, and LBD, PDB: 3C32, GluK1 LBD crystal structure with kainate) fitted into the EM map (5.2 Å) in UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>). Further, for building GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> ND transmembrane domain 3 and GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> DDM trans-membrane domain, GluK2 TMD (PDB:5KUF) was used due to high identity (∼95%) for fitting into EM density. Phenix1.19.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Afonine et al., 2018b</xref>) and Namdinator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kidmose et al., 2019</xref>) were used to improve the model via the rigid body and Molecular Dynamics based flexible fitting, respectively. The final models fit well into the EM map of GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> ND-SYM, GluK1-1a<sub>EM</sub> DDM-SYM ECD, and FL, respectively, with a definite density for ATD, LBD, and TMD (pre-M1, M1, M3, and M4). Coot 0.9.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>) was used to analyze the final models, and chimera/chimeraX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Pettersen et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">2004</xref>) was used for figure preparation.</p>

<title>Spatiotemporal distribution of exon 9 of GluK1 using transcriptomics data analysis</title>
<p>To understand the abundance of <italic>GRIK1-1</italic> splice in the human brain, we resorted to RNA-Seq data from the BrainSpan atlas that constitutes various databases to study transcriptional mechanisms in human brain development. The RNA-Seq data were downloaded for <italic>GRIK1</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.brainspan.org/rnaseq/gene/1099967">https://www.brainspan.org/rnaseq/gene/1099967</ext-link>), plotted in Excel (x-axis: regions of the brain; y-axes: log<sub>2</sub> transformed normalized expression intensity values in Reads Per Kilobase of exon model per Million mapped reads, RPKM and age of donor). The heat maps were generated using the Excel file (CSV format) and RStudio (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rstudio.com/">https://www.rstudio.com/</ext-link>) to determine the presence of GluK1 in various regions of the brain at different developmental stages, as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. Further, we narrowed it down to the <italic>GRIK1-1</italic> splice (exon 9; start position 30968845, 45 nucleotides in length) and tried to understand how it overlaps with the entire <italic>GRIK1</italic> gene expression. These data explored the presence of the ATD splice irrespective of which C-terminal splice variant is present.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study shows that a splice variant of the kainate receptor Glu1-1a that inserts 15 amino acids in the extracellular N-terminal region substantially changes the channel's desensitization properties, the sensitivity to glutamate and kainate, and the effects of modulatory Neto proteins. In the revised paper the authors have clarified several points raised by reviewers but the structural portion of the study has not been improved and consequently, more data are needed to determine the molecular mechanism by which the insert changes the functional profile of the channel. Even so, these <bold>solid</bold> findings advance our understanding of splice variants among glutamate receptors and will be of interest to neuro- and cell-biologists and biophysicists in the field.</p>

<p>Kainate receptors play various important roles in synaptic transmission. The receptors can be divided into low affinity kainate receptors (GluK1-3) and high affinity kainate receptos (GluK4-5). The receptors can assemble as homomers (GluK1-3) or low-high affinity heteromers (GluK4-5). The functional diversity is further increased by RNA splicing. Previous studies have investigated C-terminal splice variants of GluK1, but GluK1 N-terminal (exon 9) insertions have not been previously characterized. In this study Dhingra et al investigate the functional implications of a GluK1 splice variant that inserts a 15 amino acid segment into the extracellular N-terminal region of the protein using whole-cell and excised outside-out electrophysiology.</p>
<p>The authors convincingly show that the insertion profoundly impacts the function of GluK1-1a - the channels that have the insertion are slower to desensitize. The data also shows that the insertion changes the modulatory effects of Neto proteins, resulting in altered rates of desensitization and recovery from desensitization. To determine the mechanism by which the insertion exerts these functional effects, the authors perform pull-down assays of Neto proteins, and extensive mutagenesis on the insert.</p>
<p>
The electrophysiological part of the study is very rigorous and meticulous.</p>
<p>The biggest weakness of the manuscript is the structural work. Due to issues with preferred orientation (a common problem in cryo-EM), the 3D reconstructions are at a low resolution (in the 5-8 Å range) and cannot offer much mechanistic insight into the effects of the insertion. The authors have opted to keep this data unchanged in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Despite this, the study is a valuable contribution to the field because it characterizes a GluK1 variant that has not been studied before and highlights the functional diversity that exists within the kainate receptor family.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Comments for authors:</p>
<p>The authors have addressed most of the reviewer's concerns. Although no additional data were included to strengthen the manuscript, they have clarified some relevant points, and the manuscript has been updated accordingly. In my view, the current manuscript is well-written and mostly straightforward.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for his time and suggestions. Addressing them have improved the quality of our manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>After a second revision, I just have a few minor comments (mostly editorial) that should be easy to address.</p>
<p>(1) Page 16: &quot;The dominant presence of the GRIK1-1 gene was also reported in retinal Off bipolar cells...&quot; Please include reference(s).</p>

<p>(2) Page 18: &quot;Based on our functional assays, the splice seems to affect the interaction between the receptor and auxiliary proteins&quot;. Please remove or tone down this statement; the current data do not support this claim.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have revised the sentence as following: “Based on our functional assays, the splice may possibly affect the interaction between the receptor and auxiliary proteins.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Page 24: &quot;cultures ... at 0.5 µg/mL were transfected&quot;. In the current context, it is not clear what you mean with 0.5 µg/mL. Please check and correct.</p>

<p>Thanks for pointing out this error. We have corrected it.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Page 30. He et al. reference is repeated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks. We have fixed it now.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Figure 3, Panel C: Please incorporate the EC50 value for the red trace into the figure; it appears to be a different data set and, consequently, a different fitting compared with Figure 2C.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The GluK1-1a data set (red trace) is identical to that in Figure 2c, though it may appear different due to the scale of the X and Y axis. As suggested, we have now included the EC50 value for this data set in Figure 3, panel C.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Figure legend 4: Please check two minor issues here:</p>
<p>(a) &quot;Bar graphs... with or without Neto1 protein...&quot; This statement is apparently wrong; Figure 4 does not show the effect of Neto1.</p>
<p>(b) &quot;The wild type GluK1 splice variant data is the same as from Figure 1..&quot; I think the authors mean Figure 2A instead of Fig. 1. Please check.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for pointing out the error. We have fixed the same in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Please check and correct spelling/wording issues in the text. Here are some examples:</p>
<p>(a) Page 9 &quot; Figure 3G - I, Table2..&quot; (There is no Panel I).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Fixed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(b) Page 16 &quot;... and is involved in various pathophysiology...&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have revised the sentence as “… and is involved in various pathophysiological conditions”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(c) Page 19 &quot;The constructs used for this study were HEK293 WT mammalian cells were seeded on...&quot;</p>

<p>(d) Page 23 &quot;The immunoblots were probed...&quot; Please check the whole paragraph and correct the issues.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Fixed. Thanks.</p>

<p>(e) Page 27 &quot;initially, 1,97,908 particles were picked&quot;. Check the value; the same issue occurs in Fig.6 table supplement 1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks. We have now modified the sentence to clarify that for  GluK1-1aEM ND-SYM, initially, 1,97,908 particles were picked and subjected to multiple rounds of clean-up using 2D and 3D classification. Finally,  24,531 particles were used for the final 3D reconstruction and refinement.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(f) Legend Figure 2: Remove &quot;(F)&quot; from the legend.</p>

<p>Thanks. Fixed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(g) Legend Figure 2-Sup.1: Check/correct spelling issues.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks. Fixed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(h) Figure 5-figure supplement 1: There is a mistake in panel B: &quot;GFP&quot; label is shown for Gluk1 and Neto2, but the authors mention that the pull-down was done with Anti-His antibodies. Please correct.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks. The pull-down experiments were done with anti-His for both the blots presented in panels A and B as mentioned in both the figures (right side panels of both A and B). However, for the GluK1 and Neto2 pull downs (panel B), the blots were probed with anti-GFP antibody which would detect both the receptor (as the receptor has both GFP-His8) and Neto2-GFP at their respective sizes. This has been indicated in the figure panel B.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Related to the point-by-point document:</p>
<p>Major concern 2: Interpreting the effect of mutants on the regulation by Neto proteins requires knowing how the mutant is affecting the channel properties without Neto. In my view, if the data showing the K368/375/379/382H376-E mutant without Neto is missing (in this case due to low current amplitude), then, the pink bars in Fig. 5 should be removed from the figure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this interesting point and agree that it would be valuable to characterize the channel properties of all the mutants individually. However, as mentioned earlier, the functions of some mutant receptors are only rescued, or reliable, measurable currents are detected, when they are co-expressed with Neto proteins. We still believe that comparing wild-type and mutant receptors co-expressed with Neto proteins provides important insights, and therefore, we would like to retain the K368/375/379/382H376-E mutant data in the figure.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Major concern 4: Figure 6-figure Supplement 8 is not mentioned in the manuscript. It would help to include a proper description in the Results section similar to the answer included in the point-by-point document.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figure6-figure Supplement 8 has already been cited on page 15. We have also cited Figure6-figure Supplement 9 on the same page and have added following sentences in the text:</p>
<p>“A superimposition of GluK1-1aEM (detergent-solubilized or reconstituted in nanodiscs) and GluK1-2a (PDB:7LVT) showed an overall conservation of the structures in the desensitized state. No significant movements were observed at both the ATD and LBD layers of GluK1-1a with respect to GluK1-2a (Figure 6; Figure 6-figure supplement 9).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Major concern 5: The ramp/recovery protocol was not included properly in the manuscript; please include the time of the ramp pulse and the time used for the recovery period.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Elaborated ramp and recovery protocols are included in the methods section. The time used for the recovery period was variable and was tuned as per the recovery kinetics. All the figures were representative traces are shown include the scale bar showing the time period of agonist application.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor concern 1: The proposed change was not included in the manuscript; check page 7.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for highlighting this error. We have now changed it in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor concern 10: The manuscript was not corrected as indicated. Please check.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks. We have now modified the sentence as following: “…..a reduction was observed for K375/379/382H376-E receptors (1.17 ± 0.28 P=0.3733) compared to wild-type <italic>although differences do not reach statistical significance</italic>”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor concern 14: The figure was not corrected as indicated. Please check.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for highlighting this error. We have now changed it in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor concern 19: I suggest including this briefly in the Discussion section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion. We have included the following sentence in the discussion:</p>
<p>“The differences in observations could be due to variations in experimental conditions, such as the constructs and recording conditions used.”</p>
