<title>Abstract</title><p>Functional interactions between the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, as revealed by strong oscillatory synchronization in the theta (6-11 Hz) frequency range, correlate with memory-guided decision-making. However, the degree to which this form of long-range synchronization influences memory-guided choice remains unknown. Here, we developed a brain machine interface that initiated trials on T-maze tasks based on the magnitude of prefrontal-hippocampal theta synchronization, then measured choice outcomes. Strong prefrontal-hippocampal theta synchrony was found to bias correct choices on both working memory dependent and cued-response tasks. Prefrontal-thalamic neural interactions increased with prefrontal-hippocampal synchrony and optogenetic activation of the ventral midline thalamus entrained prefrontal neural activity and prefrontal-hippocampal theta synchrony. Together, our results show that prefrontal-hippocampal theta synchronization leads to correct choices and strengthens prefrontal-thalamic dialogue. Our findings reveal new insights into the neural circuit dynamics underlying memory-guided choices and highlight a promising technique to potentiate cognitive processes or behavior via brain machine interfacing.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Working memory, the ability to temporarily maintain and mentally manipulate information, is fundamental to cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Baddeley, 1986</xref>). This ability is known to require communication and neuronal processing across distributed brain regions and is conserved over mammalia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Goldman-Rakic, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Sarnthein et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lee and Kesner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Winter and Stich, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wang and Cai, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Eichenbaum, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fell and Axmacher, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Christophel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Eichenbaum, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Churchwell and Kesner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Spellman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hallock et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ito et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bolkan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ito et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Maisson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lugtmeijer et al., 2021</xref>). Long-range interactions are thought to be supported by the proper timing of action potentials (spikes), and brain rhythms are thought to act as a clocking mechanism to synchronize the timing of spike discharges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fries, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Buzsaki, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fell and Axmacher, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Colgin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fries, 2015</xref>). For example, hippocampal rhythms are coupled to the organization of hippocampal spiking activity in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">O’Keefe and Recce, 1993</xref>), bats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Eliav et al., 2018</xref>), primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Jutras et al., 2009</xref>), and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Qasim et al., 2021</xref>), although the exact frequency can vary over mammalia. The hypothesis that brain rhythms coordinate brain communication by synchronizing neuronal activity, known as “communication through coherence”, is just beginning to be experimentally tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fries, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Buzsaki, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fell and Axmacher, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fries, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Reinhart and Nguyen, 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>In rats, decades of research have shown that computations within, and communication between, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus are required for spatial working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dudchenko, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lee and Kesner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wang and Cai, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Horst and Laubach, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Churchwell and Kesner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hallock et al., 2013a</xref>). Recording studies specifically implicate theta synchrony within the mPFC-hippocampal network as a mechanism for mPFC-hippocampal communication. One metric of oscillatory synchrony, coherence, has been repeatedly correlated with memory-guided choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jones and Wilson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Benchenane et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sigurdsson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">O’Neill et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hallock et al., 2016</xref>), but also with attention and task engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Guise and Shapiro, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bygrave et al., 2019</xref>). In a cornerstone experiment, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jones and Wilson (2005)</xref> showed that 4-12Hz mPFC-hippocampal coherence was stronger before rats made a correct choice when compared to a choice error or forced navigation on a spatial memory task. While foundational, this study treated the dependent variable (choice accuracy) as independent to test the effect of choice outcome on task performance. The same is true of other studies, where theta coherence (dependent variable) was shown to be positively correlated with choice accuracy (dependent variable; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Benchenane et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hallock et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, did mPFC-hippocampal synchrony lead to correct choice outcomes, or co-occur with correct choices?</p>
<p>To understand the effect of mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence on choice, we developed a brain machine interface that tied theta (6-11Hz) coherence magnitude with task manipulation and measured choice outcomes on two different tasks. We are the first to show that strong mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence probabilistically led to more correct choices and that this result was true for a spatial working memory dependent task and a cued-response task. In follow-up experiments, we found that mPFC theta rhythms and mPFC-thalamic interactions increased with mPFC-hippocampal theta synchrony. Consistent with these results, optogenetic activation of the ventral midline thalamus, a structure known to coordinate mPFC-hippocampal interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Vertes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">McKenna and Vertes, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gabbot et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Vertes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hoover and Vertes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hoover and Vertes, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hallock et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dolleman-van der Weel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Griffin, 2021</xref>), reproduced findings seen during times of strong endogenous mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence.</p>

<p>By iteratively extracting signals into MATLAB from our acquisition system at systematically-increasing lags (25ms-300ms), we found that waiting 250ms before extracting new signals provided reliable streaming between the brain and MATLAB (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Extended Fig. 2A-C</xref></bold>). We then tested the impact of dataset sizes on the strength and the shape of the coherence distribution within the 4-12Hz range, in real time. By linearly increasing the amount of data being analyzed, and calculating coherence over 50 separate intervals from an example rat in real-time, we noticed that the dataset sizes strongly impacted the shape of the coherence distribution (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Extended Fig. 2E-F</xref></bold>), although the effect on coherence magnitude was less robust (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Extended Fig. 2D</xref></bold>). Since the strongest frequency (4-12Hz) plateaued at ∼8Hz when analyzing dataset sizes of 1.25s (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Extended Fig. 2E</xref></bold>), we chose to use 1.25s dataset sizes with 250ms steps forward in time (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Extended Fig. 2G</xref></bold>). This approach led to clear transitions between high and low magnitude theta coherence (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Extended Fig. 2H</xref></bold>) indicating that we were accurately tracking coherence in real-time.</p>
<p>Since brain machine interfacing handles data acquired in real time, we z-score transformed real-time detrended signals against a mean and standard deviation acquired during a 10 minute recording session that occurred on a previous day. We excluded epochs if &gt;1% of the LFP signals were saturated with voltages exceeding 4 standard deviations. Since movement related artifacts often coincided with strong delta (1-4Hz) power (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Extended Fig. 2I</xref></bold>), we also excluded epochs if delta coherence was stronger than theta coherence. When combined, these approaches isolated coherence distributions with clear theta synchrony (6-11Hz; <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref></bold>) and high consistency across rats (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Extended Fig. 2I</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Once these algorithms were defined (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Extended Figs 1</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></bold>), we then trained rats to perform a delayed alternation task in a T-maze until they performed at 70% choice accuracy for two consecutive days. On this spatial working memory task, rats are rewarded for alternating between left and right reward zones, and sequestered at the base of the maze before each choice (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>). The ability of this task to tax working memory was validated by measuring the impact of delay duration on choice outcome. Consistent with the use of delayed-response tasks across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dudchenko, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Goldman-Rakic, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Eichenbaum, 2008</xref>), longer delay durations led to lower choice accuracy (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Extended Fig. 4A</xref></bold>)</p>

<p>During training sessions, thousands of theta coherence values were calculated during the delay phases, and distributions of mean theta coherence estimates were created (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Extended Fig. 2J</xref></bold>). Using these distributions, we defined weak theta coherence as 1std below the mean, and strong theta coherence as 1std above the mean of all theta coherence values. Therefore, each rat had a unique numerical value defining states of strong and weak theta coherence, which we could then use as thresholds to initiate trials on the automated maze (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>; <bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Extended Fig. 3</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Strong prefrontal-hippocampal theta coherence leads to correct choices on a spatial working memory task</title>
<p>Based on multiple reports, mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence is positively correlated with memory-guided decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jones and Wilson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Benchenane et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hallock et al., 2016</xref>). The results from such experiments depend on the comparison of two dependent measurements (choice accuracy and theta coherence), but whether theta coherence can be used with task manipulation (independent variable) to bias choice accuracy (dependent variable) remains unexplored. To test this idea, we implemented the algorithms described above with an automatic maze to control trial initiations. During experimentation, our brain machine interface was activated as rats occupied the delay zone and rats were presented with various trial types within a given session as follows. A small proportion of trials were initiated when mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence was above the strong theta coherence threshold (∼10% of trials) or below the weak theta coherence threshold (∼10% of trials) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref></bold>). Since increasing delay durations lead to worse task performance (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Extended Fig. 4A</xref></bold>), rats also experienced trials that were yoked to high and low coherence trials via identical delay durations. For example, if trial N was a high coherence trial, our algorithm logged the duration spent in the delay zone to be presented back to the rat within a 10-trial block. Thus, initiation of yoked trials was independent of the strength of theta coherence (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>) and by comparing choice accuracy on strong/weak coherence trials to that on yoked trials, we were able to rule out the possible confounding variable of working memory load on choice accuracy.</p>
<p>We predicted that, relative to yoked control trials, trials presented during states of strong mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence would be more likely to be correct and trials presented during states of weak mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence would be more likely to be incorrect. Consistent with our first prediction, presenting trials during elevated states of mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence improved choice accuracy (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref></bold>). However, choice accuracy on trials presented during states of low mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence did not differ from choice accuracy on yoked control trials, indicating that naturally occurring weak theta synchronization does not impair choice outcomes. This latter result may be explained by a default mode, such as parallel processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wang and Cai, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Churchwell and Kesner, 2011</xref>)</p>
<p>We then examined various measurements of overt behavior to test if behaviors differed between coherence-triggered trials and yoked trials. First, we examined the amount of time spent until rats made a choice, defined as the amount of time from the point at which a trial is initiated until rats passed the infrared beam that triggers the reward dispenser (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Extended Fig. 1</xref></bold>). While we found no difference in time-to-choice between high coherence trials and yoked trials, there was a trending difference between low and yoked trials (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Extended Fig. 4B</xref></bold>). Using an analysis to test head-movement complexity (IdPhi; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Papale et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Redish, 2016</xref>), we found no differences between high coherence trials and yoked trials, but did observe less head-movement complexity on low coherence trials relative to yoked trials (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Extended Fig. 4C</xref></bold>). Next, we analyzed total distance traveled in the epoch used to trigger trials during high and low coherence states (last 1.25s before trial initiation). Since the amount of time was always consistent (1.25s), this approach is a proxy for speed, an indirect correlate of theta frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kropff et al., 2021</xref>). We found no differences in movement behavior between coherence trials and yoked trials (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Extended Fig. 4D</xref></bold>). Finally, we found that rats spent similar amounts of time in the delay zone during high and low coherence trials (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Extended Fig. 4E</xref></bold>). These analyses show that high coherence trials could be used to promote correct choices in the absence of overt differences in behavior between trial types, indicating that mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence may play a causal role in memory-guided choices.</p>

<title>Trials initiated by strong prefrontal-hippocampal theta coherence are characterized by prominent prefrontal theta rhythms and heightened pre-choice prefrontal-hippocampal synchrony</title>
<p>Next, we performed offline data analysis to understand the neural dynamics occurring during the high coherence states that improved spatial working memory task performance. First, we noticed that theta rhythms were better characterized by changes within the 6-9Hz range (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref></bold>) and as such, offline analyses focused on this narrow band. Relative to low coherence states, mPFC theta rhythms were stronger during high coherence states (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref></bold>; see <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref></bold> for example LFP traces). Hippocampal theta rhythms only exhibited a modest elevation in theta power relative to low coherence states. With respect to theta frequency, both mPFC and hippocampal theta rhythms were shifted toward higher frequencies during high coherence states relative to low coherence states, with mPFC theta rhythms approaching 7 Hz and hippocampal rhythms approaching 8 Hz (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref></bold>). We then analyzed whether these signals exhibited evidence of directionality, the ability for one signal to predict another signal as measured by Granger causality analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cohen, 2014</xref>). Relative to low coherence states, high coherence states were characterized by stronger hippocampal-to-mPFC theta directionality (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref></bold>). Thus, the high theta coherence states used to trigger spatial working memory trials were characterized by strong mPFC theta rhythms and hippocampal-to-mPFC theta directionality.</p>
<p>Even though the delay zone was physically close to the choice point (∼30cm), we wondered whether strong mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence trials impacted synchronization during the goal-arm choice. Therefore, we defined choice-point entry as the infrared beam break immediately preceding the choice (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Extended Fig. 1</xref></bold>). On average, rats took 1.6s and 2.1s to reach this infrared beam from trial initiation on low and high coherence trials, respectively. No significant difference in time-to-choice was observed between high and low coherence trials (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref></bold>). Thus, we extracted LFPs from −2s to +0.5s surrounding choice-entry (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref></bold>), and calculated coherence over time and frequency (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref></bold>). A normalized difference score was calculated from the resultant coherograms (high-low/high+low), revealing a clear difference in theta coherence magnitude between high and low coherence trials as rats approached the choice zone (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref></bold>). As expected, high coherence trials showed significantly stronger synchronization at −2s, an approximate for trial initiation (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref></bold>). Interestingly, after the 2s time-point, theta coherence between high and low coherence trials became more similar, but once again differed at ∼0.5s pre-choice (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref></bold>). This latter result shows that strong mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence during the delay was maintained up until the time of goal arm choice.</p>
<p>Given that mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence fluctuated in a periodical manner (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Extended Fig. 5B</xref></bold>), we wondered how predictive past values of mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence were of future values. Using previously collected data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hallock et al., 2016</xref>), we extracted mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence epochs across the duration of a 30s delay on the delayed alternation task from 3 rats (N = 22 sessions; <bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Extended Figs 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref></bold>). We performed an autocorrelation analysis on theta coherence values on a trial-by-trial basis, then compared the results to a temporally shuffled theta coherence distribution. Since we performed a moving window approach (1.25s in 250ms steps), comparisons between real and temporally shuffled coherence estimates were only included after 5 lags (lag #4 relative to 0; <bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Extended Fig. 5B</xref></bold>). Consistent with the periodical nature of mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence epochs, there was a significant correlation between past and future coherence estimates, even when epochs shared no overlap in data (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Extended Fig. 5C</xref></bold>). Thus, mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence is dynamic and periodical.</p>

<p>In our brain machine interfacing experiments, trials were initiated when mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence was strong or weak. States of strong mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence increased the probability of a correct choice, while increasing synchronization during task performance. However, when we examined the frequency of strong mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence events when the delay phase was fixed and predictable, strong mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence events did not predict trial initiation (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Extended Fig. 5D</xref></bold>). Therefore, strong mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence led to improved task performance through mechanisms specific to choice.</p>

<title>Prefrontal-hippocampal theta coherence states lead to correct choices on a cue-guided task</title>
<p>Our findings from <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref></bold> show that mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence leads to correct spatial working memory-guided choices. We next wondered if this effect was specific to spatial working memory and specifically tested whether strong mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence events were optimal for choices on a task where rats must attend to external stimuli to guide decision making. Rats (N = 3; 1 male, 2 female) were implanted with wires targeting the mPFC and hippocampus (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref></bold>) and were trained to perform a conditional discrimination task where a floor insert dictated choice outcome (e.g. a wooden floor insert might dictate a left choice, while a mesh insert might dictate a right choice; <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref></bold>). This task is similar in difficulty to the delayed alternation task, but requires the striatum, rather than the hippocampus to perform (Griffin, 2012; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hallock et al., 2013a</xref>). Likewise, past research showed that inactivation of the mPFC or the ventral midline thalamus did not disrupt conditional discrimination task performance in well-trained rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hallock et al., 2013b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Shaw et al., 2013</xref>), indicating that the mPFC-hippocampal network is not required for conditional discrimination task performance. Therefore, we predicted that strong mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence would not improve choice outcomes on this cue-guided task.</p>
<p>We collected 35 sessions, of which 16 sessions (7 sessions from 21-48 [male]; 4 sessions from 21-49 [female]; and 5 sessions from 21-55 [female]) met criterion for performance of &gt;70%, alternation of &lt;70%, and a contribution of at least 4 trials. Unexpectedly, we found that initiation of trials during strong mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence enhanced choice accuracy on the conditional discrimination task (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref></bold>). This finding was surprising given that mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence did not previously correlate with choice outcomes on the conditional discrimination task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hallock et al., 2016</xref>), but consistent with increased mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence on a different cue-guided paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Benchenane et al., 2010</xref>). Most importantly, these results show that strong mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence is optimal for decision making behavior regardless of whether working memory and mPFC/hippocampal function is necessary to perform a task.</p>

<title>Prefrontal-thalamo-hippocampal network dynamics vary with prefrontal-hippocampal synchronization</title>
<p>So far, we have shown that initiating trials when mPFC-hippocampal theta synchrony is strong leads to correct memory-guided choices. What are the mechanisms supporting strong mPFC-hippocampal theta synchrony leading to improved choice accuracy? Past research showed that mPFC-hippocampal theta synchrony during choice was supported by the ventral midline thalamus (VMT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hallock et al., 2016</xref>). The VMT is anatomically connected with the mPFC and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sesack et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Vertes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">McKenna and Vertes, 2004</xref>; Vertes, 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hoover and Vertes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hoover and Vertes, 2012</xref>), providing a source of glutamatergic excitation to both structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dolleman-van der Weel et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, we wondered how mPFC-VMT and VMT-hippocampal interactions varied with mPFC-hippocampal theta synchronization.</p>
<p>To probe this question, we examined datasets with simultaneous mPFC, VMT, and dorsal hippocampus recordings from 3 rats performing a spatial working memory task (N = 22/28 sessions; <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref></bold>; <bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Extended Fig. 6B</xref></bold>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Stout and Griffin, 2020</xref>). We extracted neural data as rats occupied the delay zone, then defined and detected epochs of strong and weak mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence offline (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref></bold>; <bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Extended Fig. 6A-B</xref></bold>). Corroborating the findings from our brain machine interfacing experiment (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></bold>), high theta coherence states were characterized by strong 6-9Hz theta rhythms in the mPFC (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs 5C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref></bold>). Intriguingly, the magnitude change of theta power between high and low coherence states was strongest in the mPFC, followed by the VMT, then the hippocampus (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref></bold>). Relative to low coherence epochs, the mPFC was differentially and simultaneously synchronized to the VMT and hippocampus during high coherence states (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref></bold>). Moreover, high coherence states were characterized by a stronger change in neural synchronization between the mPFC and VMT, relative to the VMT and hippocampus (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref></bold>). This latter result suggested that mPFC-VMT interactions may be particularly sensitive to mPFC-hippocampal synchronization. In support of this conclusion, multivariate granger prediction revealed that mPFC-VMT directionality was elevated during strong relative to weak mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence states (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref></bold>; <italic>middle panel</italic>). mPFC-hippocampal directionality was also modulated by mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence magnitude. However, directionality between the VMT and hippocampus was minimally impacted by the magnitude of mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Lastly, we examined whether mPFC spike-LFP synchrony was impacted by mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence. Spike-phase entrainment was used to quantify the non-uniformity of spike-phase distributions at theta to measure theta phase locking, and spike-field coherence was used to understand the correlation between spikes and LFP across frequencies (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref></bold>). Out of 126 mPFC neurons, 46 neurons met criterion for inclusion (see methods). When comparing strong to weak mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence states, there were no significant differences to theta phase entrainment (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref></bold>) nor to spike-field coherence (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5J</xref></bold>) of mPFC spikes to VMT and hippocampal theta.</p>
<p>We then wondered if strong mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence states modulated the spike timing of a select group of mPFC neurons. During strong mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence states, 8.9% and 7% of mPFC neurons were modulated by hippocampal theta and VMT theta, respectively. This contrasted with weak mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence states, where 4.4% and 2.3% of mPFC neurons were significantly modulated by hippocampal and VMT theta, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5K</xref></bold>). These findings indicate that the magnitude of mPFC-hippocampal theta synchronization, which was used to enhance memory guided choice (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></bold>) and known to modulate mPFC neuronal discharge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Benchenane et al., 2010</xref>; <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5K</xref></bold>), is also characterized by an increased proportion of mPFC neurons phase locking to VMT and hippocampal theta.</p>

<sec id="s2f">
<title>Optogenetic activation of the VMT dynamically regulates prefrontal-hippocampal theta rhythms</title>
<p>Next, we examined whether artificial theta frequency stimulation of the VMT was sufficient to produce synchronized theta rhythms between the mPFC and hippocampus. To investigate this question, we injected the VMT with AAV5-hSyn-ChR2-eYPF to create and embed channelrhodopsin2 at the membrane of VMT neurons, a proton pump that promotes excitation of neurons with blue light stimulation (450nm). After 4-6 weeks of recovery to allow for viral expression, we pulsed a blue laser at 7-8Hz (2s on 2-8s off) targeting the VMT while recording from the mPFC (N = 3 rats) and the hippocampus (N = 2 rats; <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref></bold>). As a within-subject control, we also stimulated the VMT with a red laser (638nm). Stimulation with red and blue lasers were randomly interleaved within a recording session.</p>
<p>Optogenetic stimulation of the VMT between 7-8Hz produced a large negative deflection in the mPFC voltage and enhanced mPFC theta rhythms across all rats (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B, D, F, H</xref>, and J</bold>). Using a 64ch silicon probe targeting mPFC lamina, optogenetic activation of the VMT enhanced the power of mPFC theta oscillations across all recording channels (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B-C</xref></bold>). This result demonstrated the clear impact of VMT activation on all lamina of the mPFC.</p>
<p>The effect of VMT activation on mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence was initially disruptive (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D-G</xref></bold>), which led us to visually inspect the raw and theta filtered signals. This approach revealed that upon VMT stimulation, some trials showed a desynchronization of mPFC-hippocampal theta rhythms, followed by synchrony (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H and J</xref></bold>). We therefore excluded the first 0.5s of stimulation, focusing on a 1s window of VMT stimulation. In rat 21-42, we noticed instances where VMT stimulation had a rather small or no clear effect on mPFC theta, which was unexpected based on the data from 21-45 and 21-43. Given that viral injections were focused on one rostro-caudal location, rather than being distributed across the entirety of the ventral midline thalamus (see Dolleman Van-der Weel et al., 2019 for a review), we performed K-means clustering (N = 2 clusters) to identifying times when VMT stimulation increased mPFC theta power. When combined with the data from 21-43, we found that VMT activation increased mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6I</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6K</xref></bold>). Taken together, VMT stimulation dynamically impacted mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence, altered hippocampal oscillations, but drastically influenced mPFC theta rhythms.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Past research has found that mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence was stronger when memory was used to guide choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jones and Wilson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Benchenane et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sigurdsson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">O’Neill et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hallock et al., 2016</xref>). However, these results required the comparison of two dependent measurements that have since been shown to be inter-related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Benchenane et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hallock et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, did mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence lead to, or coincide with, correct choice outcomes?</p>
<p>To answer this question, we implemented brain machine interfacing techniques to incorporate mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence as an independent variable (i.e. task control), and demonstrated for the first time that strong mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence enhances memory-guided choice. While we expected this form of long-range theta synchronization to be particularly useful when spatial working memory was used to guide decision-making, we also observed that mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence enhanced the performance of a task that does not require the mPFC, VMT, nor hippocampus for successful performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hallock et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hallock et al., 2013b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Shaw et al., 2013</xref>). Surprisingly, this latter result indicates that structures deemed unnecessary for a cognitive process can still contribute rather significantly. Based on the communication through coherence hypothesis, we suspect that strong mPFC-hippocampal theta synchronization improved memory-guided choice via increasing the probability of neuronal coordination.</p>
<p>To further test the communication through coherence hypothesis, we extracted strong and weak mPFC-hippocampal theta synchronization events, then compared mPFC-thalamo and hippocampal-thalamo interactions. For these analyses, we focused on the ventral midline thalamus (VMT), a structure that is bidirectionally connected with the mPFC and hippocampus and supports mPFC-hippocampal neuronal interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Vertes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">McKenna and Vertes, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Vertes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hoover and Vertes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hoover and Vertes, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ito et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hallock et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Stout et al., 2022</xref>). mPFC spike times and mPFC theta oscillations synchronized more strongly with VMT theta rhythms when mPFC and hippocampal theta were strongly coherent. Likewise, theta rhythms between the VMT and hippocampus were coupled more strongly when mPFC and hippocampal theta rhythms were synchronized. Given that strong mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence events were previously shown to organize cell assemblies within the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Benchenane et al., 2010</xref>), our results indicate that these events enhanced memory-guided choice by structuring neuronal interactions. Given that mPFC-VMT neural interactions varied with mPFC-hippocampal theta synchronization, and that optogenetic theta stimulation of the VMT modulated mPFC theta and mPFC-hippocampal theta synchrony, our results point towards cortico-thalamic dialogue as a central component of mPFC-hippocampal theta synchronization. Importantly, this latter assertion is supported by anatomy, as the mPFC receives no direct projections from the dorsal hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Jay and Witter, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hoover and Vertes, 2007</xref>), but influences hippocampal neuronal activity via the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ito et al., 2015</xref>). We suspect that the VMT may coordinate mPFC-hippocampal neural interactions through cortico-thalamo-cortical looping mechanisms, as the VMT projects directly to entorhinal cortex neurons that target the CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Wouterlood, 1991</xref>) and modulates CA1 neurons with concurrent cortical activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dolleman-Van der Weel, 2017</xref>). Consistent with this hypothesis, mediodorsal thalamus is known to sustain mPFC neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bolkan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Schmitt et al., 2017</xref>), and the VMT supports mPFC firing and mPFC-hippocampal synchronization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hallock et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Jayachandran, Viena et al., 2023</xref>). We therefore hypothesize that states of strong mPFC-hippocampal theta synchronization probabilistically increased correct decisions through cortico-thalamic communication.</p>
<p>Importantly, our findings provide a promising avenue to rescue cognitive deficits in clinical populations. Consistent with our work, a recent study found that inducing states of theta synchrony between frontal and temporal regions via transcranial alternating-current stimulation, rescued age-related memory impairments in human participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Reinhart and Nguyen, 2019</xref>). Our findings suggest that tapping into pre-existing neural dynamics holds significant promise for improving memory. We hypothesize that non-invasive stimulation techniques prior to therapy, paired with synchrony-dependent attention or working memory practice via brain machine interfacing, could pose a viable intervention to improve cognitive deficits. In closing, the use of brain machine interfacing holds significant promise for clinical and neuroscientific advance.</p>

<title>Subjects</title>
<p>Subjects were 16 adult (&gt;postnatal day 90) Long Evans Hooded rats. For experiment #1 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs 1</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></bold>), there were 4 adult male and 4 adult female rats with simultaneous mPFC and hippocampus local field potential (LFP) recordings. In the analyses from <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4-7</xref></bold>, there were 6 adult male rats, 3 receiving mPFC-VMT-hippocampus recordings, and 3 receiving mPFC/hippocampus recordings (rats were from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hallock et al., 2016</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Stout and Griffin, 2020</xref>). For the optogenetic experiment (<bold>Fig. 8</bold>), 3 male rats received optogenetic virus injections and fiber placement targeting the VMT (2 with simultaneous mPFC/hippocampus recordings and 1 with silicon probe recording from the mPFC). Each rat was placed on mild food restriction (3-4 pellets for females, 4-5 pellets for males) to maintain ∼85-90% <italic>ad libitum</italic> body weight. Rats maintained a 12hr light/dark cycle in a humidity controlled colony room. Experimentation was performed during the light cycle (8am-5pm) at approximately the same time each day +/− ∼1 hour.</p>

<sec id="s7b">
<title>Automated T-maze</title>
<p>The automated maze was in the shape of a figure 8 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>) and was purchased from MazeEngineers. The total width of the maze was 136.5cm and the total length was 74.8cm. Floor width corresponded to ∼12.7cm, while wall height was ∼20.3cm. The delay zone was a rectangular shape, 12.7cm wide and 32.7cm long. Doors were pneumatically controlled via a silent air compressor (SilentAire Super Silent 30-TC), reward delivery (45mg bio-serv chocolate pellets) was controlled through an automated pellet dispenser, and both were under the control of Arduino powered infrared beams (Adafruit) via custom MATLAB programming (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Extended Fig. 1</xref></bold>). Walls were placed on the exterior of the maze with distinct visual cues on the left and right choice arms. For two rats, interior walls were placed to improve maze running behavior. In the delay zone, the south facing wall was lowered to improve mobility. The maze was surrounded by black curtains with visual cues matching the maze and experimentation occurred in a dimly lit room.</p>

<title>Brain machine interface</title>
<p>The brain machine interface relied upon extracting real-time LFPs, performing coherence analysis, and triggering the choice point door to open according to the magnitude of prefrontal-hippocampal theta coherence. Real time signal extraction was performed using the Neuralynx Netcom v3.1.0 package code (<italic>NlxGetNewCSCData.m</italic>). Since signals were extracted serially, this code was modified in-house (<italic>NlxGetNewCSCData_2signals.m</italic>) and verified by feeding the same recording lead through two separate recorded channels (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Extended Fig. 2C</xref></bold>). Once data were extracted in real time, LFPs were detrended by subtracting a third degree polynomial (<italic>detrend.m</italic>). Next, LFPs were filtered for large amplitude artifacts by z-score transforming the real time signal against the mean and standard deviation of all real time signals obtained from the delay period of delayed alternation training. If 1% of the signal contained voltage fluctuations that exceeded 4std from the mean, the epoch was ignored. Mean squared coherence was calculated on accepted data across a range of frequencies (1:0.5:20) using the <italic>mscohere.m</italic> function, and theta coherence was defined as 6-11Hz synchrony according to the frequency x coherence plot (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref></bold>). Because movement artifacts coincided with high magnitude 1-4Hz (delta) coherence (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Extended Fig. 2I</xref></bold>), signals were filtered a second time and only accepted if theta coherence was greater than delta coherence. In real time, LFPs were extracted in 1.25s windows with 0.25s overlaps (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Extended Fig. 2G-H</xref></bold>). LFP sampling at 250ms intervals prevented acquisition failures (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Extended Fig. 2B</xref></bold>). Calculating coherence over 1.25s windows provided a stable ∼8Hz peak in the theta coherence distribution (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Extended Fig. 2E-F</xref></bold>).

<title>Behavior and experimentation</title>
<p>Rats were handled for 5 days in the experimentation room with the lights on and placed on mild food restriction prior to habituation to the automated T-maze. Habituation consisted of “goal-box” training and “forced-runs” training. For goal-box training, rats were placed near the reward dispensers for 3 minutes and were required to eat all pellets within 90s for 6 trials (3 left dispenser / 3 right dispenser). One rat was excluded after not passing goal box training for 7 consecutive days. For forced-runs, rats traversed the maze to receive a reward at the reward dispenser and were required to eat all rewards for at least 1 day. Rats were often run for multiple forced runs days. In between traversals, rats waited in the delay pedestal. After maze habituation, rats were trained to perform the continuous alternation (CA) task, where choice alternations were reinforced with chocolate pellets. The CA task was performed 5 days/week for 30min or 40 trials. Rats were required to perform at 80% accuracy for two consecutive days before and after surgery. After surgical recovery, rats were re-handled for 5 days, then placed on the CA task until they again reached criterion. The CA task was implemented to ensure that coherence-contingent choice outcomes (see <bold>Brain machine interface</bold>) were not confounded by alternation rule acquisition. Rats were then exposed to the spatial working memory delayed alternation (DA) task, where in between choice alternations, rats waited in the delay zone for a 5-30s delay period (randomly distributed). Once rats performed the DA task for 2 consecutive days at 70% accuracy, our brain machine interface testing occurred. DA task training was implemented to rule-out any effect of changing environmental demands on the rats (e.g. the introduction of a delay period), as well as to normalize task performance prior to experimentation. During testing, the experimenter was blinded to trial-type and trials were excluded if unexpected events occurred before the choice (e.g. loud noises, fear behavior, twisted recording tether) then saved as a MATLAB variable after the session ended. 20% of trials were experimental (10% high coherence/10% low coherence), while 80% of trials were controls (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref></bold>). Trial-types were presented psuedo-randomly because high and low coherence trials were required to be presented prior to delay matched control trials. Within blocks of 10 trials, 2 were experimental, 2 were delay matched controls, and 6 were random delays. On a given experimental trial, if rats did not breach the coherence threshold, the trial was initiated after 30s, and the delay matched control trial was replaced with a random delay.</p>
<p>For the conditional discrimination experiment, pre-training procedures were similar to what is described above. Rats were randomly assigned to wood-left/mesh-right or wood-right/mesh-left contingencies. Forced runs training (5 days) included the wood/mesh floor inserts. After recovery from surgery, rats began conditional discrimination training, where a floor insert type dictated the turn direction at the choice (e.g. wood floor insert may require a left turn for a reward). Unlike the delayed alternation experiment, brain machine interfacing began on day 1 of conditional discrimination training to ensure adequate data collection (i.e. it was unclear as to how fast rats could acquire this task on the automatic maze). Data were included for analysis once rats reached a criterion of 70% for two consecutive days. The conditional discrimination task was initially designed such that a random sequence of trials was generated where no more than 3 same-turn directions were rewarded, and so that rats could not receive reward from alternation &gt;60% of the time. Later in data collection, this alternation criterion was lowered to 45% to improve conditional discrimination acquisition. Analysis required that rats performed &gt;70%, alternated &lt;70% of the time, and contributed at least 4 trials to a session. Unlike the delayed alternation dataset, which included high and low coherence trials, the conditional discrimination experiment focused on high coherence trials. The distribution of trial-types were as such; 40% high coherence, 40% yoked control (identical delay duration as high coherence trials), and 20% random delay trials. Trial types were distributed in blocks of 10 trials so that corresponding yoked control trials would follow closely to high coherence trials. Per each session, 60% of trials were not controlled by the brain. A trial was initiated if rats did not reach high coherence threshold after 20s, but rats were required to wait in the delay-zone for ∼3.5-5s to segment trials. A computer monitor was placed in the room with the experimenter which provided trial-by-trial instructions (i.e. trial 1: wood-left, trial 2: mesh-right, etc…). This monitor was also used to monitor LFP data in real-time, but the experimenter remained blinded to trial-type. Trials were marked for exclusion if unexpected events occurred before the choice.</p>
<p>With respect to data used from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hallock et al., 2016</xref> (N = 3 rats) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Stout and Griffin, 2020</xref> (N = 3 rats), 6 rats were trained to perform a delayed alternation task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hallock et al., 2016</xref>) or delayed non-match to position task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Stout and Griffin, 2020</xref>) to 80% criterion for two consecutive days. With respect to the delayed alternation task, sessions were included if performance was &gt;75% because rats switched between performing the delayed alternation task and the conditional discrimination task. Unlike the brain machine interfacing experiment where delays varied between 5 and 30s, rats from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hallock and colleagues (2016)</xref> had predictable delay durations of 30s. With respect to the delayed non-match to position task, sessions were included if performance was &gt;80% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Stout and Griffin, 2020</xref>). This task differs from delayed alteration in that each trial is comprised of a sample phase, where rats are forced to navigate towards the left or right reward zone, followed by a free choice. Rats were rewarded if their choice was an alternation from the sample phase. Sample phase turn directions were pseudo-randomized to ensure there were no more than 3 same-turn directions in a row. Data were extracted from delay periods, which separated the sample from choice phase and were 20s in duration. From choice to sample, there was an intertrial interval of 40s.</p>

<title>Surgery</title>
<p>Isoflurane (1-4%) anesthetic was used prior to shaving the scalp and placing rats in the stereotaxic instrument (Kopf). Puralube was applied to rats’ eyes throughout the surgery. Lidocaine was injected subcutaneously in the scalp, the scalp was sterilized using Chlorhexidine solution (0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate), then incised if rats did not exhibit a kick reflex and eye blink reflex. Bleeding was controlled using hydrogen peroxide. Once the skull was level, bregma was identified, and craniotomies were made above the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and dorsal hippocampus (dHPC). mPFC craniotomies were made at + 3.1mm anterior and +/− 1.0mm lateral to bregma, while dHPC craniotomies were made at −3.7mm posterior and +/− 2.2mm lateral to bregma. Implants were always on the same hemisphere, but hemispheres were decided pseudo-randomly for each rat in a sex matched manner. For the delayed alternation brain machine interfacing experiment, 3 right hemisphere (2 female, 1 male) and 5 left hemisphere (2 female, 3 male) implants were successful. 6 rats received cannula implants targeting the contralateral ventral midline thalamus and 1 rat received electrode implants targeting the contralateral striatum for separate experiments that occurred after the data collected in this report. For the conditional discrimination brain machine interfacing experiment, all 3 successful implants were in the right hemisphere. One rat received a 64 channel silicon probe implant (Buzsaki 64L, Neuronexus) at 3.7mm anterior to bregma and 0.7mm lateral. A small burr hole was made over the cerebellum for reference wire implants at −10 to −12mm posterior and +/− ∼1.5mm lateral to bregma. 5-6 bone screws (Fine Science Tools) were implanted as support screws, and 1-2 bone screws were implanted over the cerebellum for grounding. LFP implants were mounted to the skull using Metabond and the remainder of the micro-drive was mounted using dental acrylic (Lang Dental). A shield surrounding the electronic interface board was built using a plastic medicine cup or a copper mesh shielding. Copper mesh shielding was grounded to the same screw grounding the electronic interface board. Rats were given a dose of flunixin (Banamine; 2.5 mg/kg) at least 20 minutes prior to removal from anesthesia and were placed on ∼15mg Childrens Ibuprofen for a 7-day recovery.</p>
<p>For optogenetic infusions (AAV5-hSyn-ChR2-eYFP) and fiber implants, 21-43 and 21-45 received viral injections at 1.8mm, 2.4mm, and 3mm posterior to bregma. Posterior injections of 2.4mm and 3mm were injected at 2.2mm lateral and 7.1mm ventral to brain surface at a 15 degree angle. The injection at 1.8mm posterior to bregma was injected at 2.2mm lateral to bregma and 6.6mm ventral to brain surface at a 15 degree angle. Once the microsyringe was placed into the brain, it sat for 10 minutes, after which, an injection of .1uL/min was performed for 2.5min at each location. The fiber was placed at 2.4mm posterior to bregma, 2.2mm lateral to bregma, and 6.8mm ventral to brain surface from the opposite hemisphere. pAAV-hSyn-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP was a gift from Karl Deisseroth (Addgene plasmid # 26973; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://n2t.net/addgene:26973">http://n2t.net/addgene:26973</ext-link>; RRID:Addgene_26973).</p>
<p>Rat 21-42 received two separate injections at 1.9mm posterior to bregma and 1.95mm lateral to bregma. The microsyringe was placed at 7mm ventral to brain surface, allowed to settle for 10 minutes, after which a 2.5 minute injection took place at .1uL/min. Once the injection was complete, the microsyringe was slowly raised dorsally to 6.7mm ventral to brain surface, and another injection of 2.5uL occurred. The fiber was then placed at 6.4mm from brain surface from the opposite hemisphere.</p>

<title>Electrophysiological recordings</title>
<p>LFPs were recorded on a Neuralynx (Digital Lynx) 64 channel recording system. Neuralynx software (Cheetah) was used to sample LFPs at 2kHz, and filter LFPs between 1-600Hz. mPFC LFP implants consisted of two stainless steel wires, while dHPC implants consisted of 4 stainless steel wires, each offset dorso-ventrally by ∼0.25-0.5mm. Single units were collected using tetrodes and reported in previous publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hallock et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Stout and Griffin, 2020</xref>). Spikes were sampled at 32kHz, bandpass filtered between 0.6-6kHz, and thresholded at 50-75uV. Clusters were cut using SpikeSort3D with KlustaKwik, then manually curated. Putative pyramidal neurons were selected based on spike waveform and interspike-intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Ranck, 1973</xref>). For silicon probe recordings, signals were referenced to the ground wire. Each recording lead was then re-referenced offline by removing the common average over all recording sites.</p>

<title>Granger Prediction</title>
<p>All follow-up spectral analyses were performed on data that was inspected for break-through artifacts. Bivariate Granger prediction was used to assess directionality between PFC and HPC LFPs (code from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hallock et al., 2016</xref>). Granger prediction is calculated using the variance in errors obtained from univariate and bivariate autoregressions on lagged LFPs. As reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cohen (2014)</xref>:

<graphic xlink:href="535279v2_ueqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>Spectral estimates are calculated using Geweke’s method in both directions (e.g. PFC-to-HPC and HPC-to-PFC). Bayes Information Criterion (BIC) was used to estimate model order for each signal and was defined as the lag providing the smallest BIC value (up to 20 lags). The averaged BIC value across all signals was then rounded and applied to each signal for granger prediction analysis. For multivariate granger prediction analysis, we used the freely available MVGC toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Barnett and Seth, 2014</xref>) downloaded from Github. The information criterion and VAR model estimation mode was set to Lowess Regression (‘LWR’) and BIC was estimated by testing model orders up to 100 lags with an autocovariance lag of 1000. The same BIC value was used for all signals, as described above. Demeaned signals were fit to a VAR model (<italic>tsdata_to_var.m</italic>), the autocovariance sequence was estimated (<italic>var_to_autocov.m</italic>) and the VAR model was checked for potential error, such as violations to stationarity. Finally, the spectral pairwise causality estimations were calculated (<italic>var_to_spwcgc.m</italic>). Granger prediction and model order estimation was performed on signals of identical size (1.25s) for both high and low coherence epochs.

<title>Spike-LFP analyses</title>
<p>Analysis of entrainment was performed over the entire task recording to maximize spike counts. High and low mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence thresholds were determined (see above), then high and low coherence epochs were extracted for each session. Two procedures were implemented for the removal of epochs saturated with recording artifacts. First, large voltage fluctuations were detected on a session by session basis by concatenating signal epochs, z-score transforming the concatenated signal, then assigning a standard deviation cut-off value for large voltage events for mPFC, VMT, and hippocampal signals separately. These standard deviation cut-offs were referenced back to a voltage value, and epochs were searched for fluctuating voltage estimates exceeding this threshold. If epochs were saturated by &gt;1% of extreme voltage fluctuations, the epoch was removed. Epochs were also removed if the mPFC or VMT voltages exceeded 3500mV in the positive or negative direction (tended to fluctuate between −2000 to 2000 mV) in order to minimize the confound of movement related artifacts on spike-phase comparisons. The cleaned high and low mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence were then concatenated across events to create LFP strings. To ensure that spikes were not counted twice in entrainment analysis, the concatenated signal was then filtered for uniquely occurring timestamps.</p>
<p>Spike-phase values were estimated by transforming the filtered signal (4-12Hz via third degree butterworth filtering) via Hilbert transform. Spike-phase values were included if theta was twice the magnitude of delta. Only units with &gt;50 spike-phase estimations during both high and low coherence states were included (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Siapas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jones and Wilson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hyman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hallock et al., 2016</xref>). Rayleigh’s test of non-uniformity was performed and a corresponding p-value was assigned to each neuron representing significant entrainment (<italic>circ_rtest.m</italic>). The mean result length vector (MRL) was calculated using 50 spikes, over 1000 random sampled spike distributions, then taking the average MRL over the 1000 random samples.</p>
<p>Spike field coherence analysis was used to measure spike-LFP coherence as a function of frequency. Across linearly spaced frequencies (1:20Hz at 0.5Hz resolution), complex morlet wavelets (6 cycles) were convolved against the LFP signals.

<title>Behavioral quantification and recording</title>
<p>Behavior was recorded from the rat using two approaches; 1) using a mounted camera sampled at ∼30 pixels/sec (Cheetah; Neuralynx) that detects LEDs on the recording headstage and 2) by sending TTL pulses to Cheetah when infrared beams were broken on the maze via MATLAB. Time spent to choice was estimated using TTL pulses from the central door opening and from choice point exit (as defined by the infrared beam controlling the closing of the choice point door behind the rat). Behavioral complexity was calculated using the integrated change in absolute angular velocity (IdPhi; code provided by D. Redish; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Papale et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Redish, 2016</xref>) using position data obtained from central door opening to choice point exit. Position data was smoothed using a gaussian weighted filter (<italic>smoothdata.m</italic>), then velocity in the x (dX) and y (dY) dimensions are obtained using a discrete time-adaptive windowing approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Janabi-Sharifi et al., 2000</xref>). Phi is defined as the arctangent of dX and dY, and dPhi is calculated by applying the time-adaptive windowing methodology on the unwrapped Phi estimates. IdPhi is then defined as the integral over the |dPhi| scores. Thus, for each trial, there is one IdPhi score that represents the overall head-movement complexity of the rat. Distance traveled in delay was used to assess whether general mobility differed between experimental and control groups. Position data was extracted from the 1.25s interval before the choice point door opened (e.g. delay exit), and total distance traveled was defined as the summation across instantaneous distance, calculated according to the distance equation:

<title>Optogenetics</title>
<p>A Doric laser was programmed with the Neuroscience studio software to pulse blue (450nm) or red (638nm) lights in a square wave pattern. To test if VMT stimulation could enhance theta synchrony, a variety of stimulation parameters were tested. Likewise, stimulation frequency varied slightly between rats (between 7-8Hz and 5-15mW power). Laser power was tested prior to stimulation and red/blue lasers were matched in terms of mW output. Each rat contributed 1 session of data with anywhere between 80 and 110 stimulation events. A stimulation event lasted 2s and then the laser was turned off for 2-6sec. Red and blue laser stimulations were randomly interleaved. Stimulating the VMT of 21-42 revealed mixed results and sometimes visual observations failed to reveal clear theta in the mPFC, despite clear power increases (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref></bold>). Since 21-42 received 2 injections at a single rostro-caudal location in the thalamus, and because the distribution of thalamic fibers targeting the mPFC and hippocampus varies along the rostro-caudal extent of the nucleus reuniens (Dolleman-var Der Weel, 2019), it was probable that VMT stimulation of 21-42 caused sparse activation of thalamo-cortical projections. Therefore, for 21-42 only, k-means clustering (2 clusters separating mPFC 6-9Hz power over stimulation epochs) was used to separate data to when VMT stimulation produced high powered mPFC theta rhythms. This approach revealed highly consistent results with rat 21-43 in terms of heightened theta coherence at ∼9Hz (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>Schematic demonstration of how neural data could be processed in between control of the automatic T-maze. In terms of maze control, serial ports were formed between hardware built from MazeEngineers and an Arduino Uno board. Custom written functions were used to control solenoid valves, which pushed or released air, mediated by a silent air compressor. The solenoid valves and air compressor were placed in a large wooden box, with foam insulation walls, in order to reduce noise. The MazeEngineers hardware was also programmed to control the release of chocolate pellets for reward delivery. Using Arduino-powered infrared beam breaks (yellow lines denote connections), MATLAB could detect the exact location of the rat in order to carry out the programmed sequence of the task. For example, as rats approached a reward zone, an infrared beam break triggered the closing of a door (blue lines on maze) and the release of a reward (if a choice was correct).</p></caption>

<p>Data were acquired in real-time, then processed in MATLAB. Data processing consisted of fitting and removing a third degree polynomial to detrend the signals (1.25s worth of data), then signals were tested for artifacts. These artifacts were defined as large voltage fluctuations exceeding 4std of a mean and standard deviation generated from 10 minute baseline recordings (as rats occupied a flower pot with motion being more restricted than when on the maze). In real-time, if voltage fluctuations exceeded 4std and these events saturated &gt;1% of the signal, then the brain machine interfacing restarted. If no artifacts were detected, coherence was calculated in 0.5Hz steps from 1-20Hz using <italic>mscohere</italic> and only if delta coherence (1-4Hz) exceeded theta coherence (6-11Hz), then brain machine interfacing restarted. If on a high coherence trial, theta coherence exceeded delta coherence, and theta coherence was higher than the predetermined threshold, a door was opened, releasing the rat from being sequestered in the delay zone that separated trials. Upon release, rats could make a choice. Similarly, on low coherence trials, if the criterion described above was met and theta coherence was lower than the predetermined threshold, then the trial was initiated. If coherence was not met, the brain machine interface restarted.</p></caption>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Information transfer between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex is thought to be critical for spatial working memory, but most of the prior evidence for this hypothesis is correlational. This study attempts to test this causally by linking trial start times to theta-band coherence between these two structures. The authors find that trials initiated during periods of high coherence led to a dramatic improvement in performance. This applied not only to a spatial working memory task, but also to a cue-guided navigation task, suggesting that coherence in these regions may be a signature of a heightened attentional or preparatory state. The authors supplement this behavioral result with electrophysiological recordings to test whether the ventral midline thalamus is likely to mediate hippocampal-prefrontal coherence.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study demonstrates a striking behavioral effect; by changing the moment at which a trial is initiated, performance on a spatial working memory task improves dramatically, from around 80% correct to over 90% correct. A smaller but nonetheless robust increase in accuracy was also seen in a texture discrimination task. Therefore, prefrontal-hippocampal synchronization in the theta band may not only be important for spatial navigation but may also be associated with improved performance in a range of tasks. If these results can be replicated using noninvasive EEG, it would open up a powerful avenue for modulating human behavior.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Ventral midline thalamic nuclei, such as reuniens, have reciprocal projections to both the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus and are therefore well-situated to mediate theta-band interactions between these structures. However, alternative mechanisms cannot be ruled out by the results of this study. For example, theta rhythms are globally coherent across the rodent hippocampus, and the ventral hippocampus projects directly to the prefrontal cortex. Theta propagation may depend on this pathway, and may only be passively inherited by VMT.</p>
<p>The optogenetic manipulations are intended to show that theta in VMT propagates to PFC and also affects HPC-PFC coherence. However, the &quot;theta&quot; induced by driving thalamic neurons at 7 Hz is extremely artificial. To demonstrate that VMT is causally involved in coordinating activity across HPC and PFC, it would have been better to optogenetically inhibit, rather than excite, these nuclei. If the authors were able to show that the natural occurrence of theta in PFC depends on activity in VMT, that would be a much more convincing test of their hypothesis.</p>

<p>A number of previous reports have demonstrated that theta synchrony between the hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) is associated with correct performance on spatial working memory tasks. The main goal of the current study is to examine this relationship by initiating trials either randomly (as is typically done) or during periods of high or low PFC-HPC coherence. To this end, they develop a 'brain-machine interface' (BMI) that provides real-time estimates of PFC-HPC theta coherence, which are then used to control trial onset using an automated figure-eight maze. Their main finding is that choice accuracy is significantly higher on trials initiated when theta coherence is high whereas performance on low coherence trials does not differ from randomly initiated control trials. They also observe a similar result using a non-working memory task in the same maze.</p>
<p>Overall the main experiments (Figures 1-4) are well designed and the BMI approach is convincingly validated. There are also appropriate controls and analyses to rule out behavioral confounds and the results clearly presented. The idea of triggering trial onset based on brain activity is an interesting idea and helps to examine how extremes in the distribution of brain states are associated with behavior, something that might be more difficult to examine if trials are initiated randomly. As such, the BMI is an interesting approach for studying the neuronal basis of behavior that could potentially be applied beyond the particular field of the study, something the authors could perhaps have elaborated on more.</p>
<p>That being said, although the authors have elegantly revealed an association between PFC-HPC theta synchrony and behavior using their BMI approach, it is not apparent whether these results add substantially to previous reports of similar associations, including from the author's own work. The authors sometimes seem to claim that they do; for example, in the discussion, after describing previous studies that reported an association between PFC-HPC theta synchrony and behavior, they raise the reasonable question &quot;did mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence lead to, or coincide with, correct choice outcomes?&quot; What they subsequently write gives the impression that their study has somehow addressed the question, whereas in fact their results still leave this question open. For example, it is entirely possible that during high-coherence trials an unobserved neural process is influencing both coherence and task performance. The authors could have made a more convincing case as to why their correlative results go beyond similar findings from previous studies, perhaps by including additional analysis to strengthen their case.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the authors also seem to suggest that their results establish a causal relationship between synchrony and behavior, for example when they say that they have &quot;demonstrated for the first time that strong mPFC-hippocampal theta coherence ENHANCES memory-guided choice&quot; (line 557, my emphasis). However, causal manipulations of PFC-HPC synchrony would be required to make such claims. I am not suggesting that the lack of such data is necessarily a weakness of the study, only that causal claims are not supported by the author's results.</p>
<p>In addition to the behavioral results described above, the authors also examine how HPC-PFC synchrony modulates synchrony with the ventromedial thalamus (VMT; Figure 5) and how optogenetic modulation of the VMT influences PFC-HPC synchrony (Figure 6). However, these results feel somewhat more preliminary and their relationship to the other findings in the manuscript is not always clear. For example, given that the authors demonstrate that &quot;Prefrontal-hippocampal theta synchronization modulates prefrontal-thalamic interactions&quot; (Figure 5) I would rather have expected the authors to manipulate HPC and/or PFC and see how this affects VMT in Figure 6. It is also difficult to draw strong conclusions about the effects of optogenetic VMT stimulation since the results presented by the authors come from only 2 rats (Figure 6D-K) and therefore feel somewhat anecdotal. I could also not find any statistical test supporting the increase in the proportion of phase-locked neurons during high theta states shown in Figure 5K.</p>

<p>Stout et al investigate the link between prefrontal-hippocampal (PFC-HPC) theta-band coherence and accurate decision-making in spatial decision-making tasks. Previous studies show that PFC-HPC theta coherence positively correlates with learning of these tasks and correct decisions but the nature of this relation relies on correlations that cannot show whether coherence leads, coincides, or is a consequence of decision making. To investigate more precisely this link, the authors devise a novel paradigm. In this paradigm, the rat is blocked during a delay period preceding its choice and they control on a trial-by-trial basis the level of PFC-HPC theta coherence prior to the decision by allowing the rat to access the choice point only at a time when coherence reaches above or below a threshold. The design of the paradigm is very nicely controlled thanks in particular to the trial-by-trial matching of delay period durations which is crucial for the working memory task. Moreover, the behaviour of the animal is strongly similar during high and low coherence periods which bolsters the specificity of the author's interpretation. Thanks to this approach, the authors clearly demonstrate that high theta coherence prior to choice-making is strongly predictive of better decision-making both in working memory and a cue-guided version of the task.</p>
<p>This novel paradigm provides an improvement in the level of experimental control to analyse the coherence/choice link but the exact interpretation of the results it yields is not entirely clear in the current manuscript. Using the PFC-HPC theta coherence during the delay period to the gate when the rat accesses the choice zone clearly separates this coherence from the behavioural decision itself. This provides convincing support for the idea that PFC-HPC theta coherence prior to the behavioural decision is related to correct decision-making and is not simply temporally coincidental or a consequence of the decision output. It does not however substantially increase the weight of evidence in favour of a causal link between theta coherence and correct decisions as suggested in the abstract (&quot;PFC-HPC theta synchronization leads to correct choices&quot;). Indeed, the paradigm does not de-correlate PFC-HPC theta synchronization from other neurophysiological variables such as neuromodulation, arousal, synchrony with other areas, etc that could be playing the true causal role in modulating decision-making.</p>
<p>The question of the link between the manuscript's findings and causal involvement of PFC-HPC dialogue is interestingly highlighted by the author's unexpected result showing that their paradigm reveals a link between theta coherence even in a sensory-driven version of the task. As the authors point out, results based on muscimol inhibition have shown that neither PFC nor HPC, nor the ventral midline thalamus, that mediates communication between the two, are involved in this task. This raises the question of why coherence between two areas is predictive of choice accuracy when neither area appears to be causally involved. The manuscript does not discuss the possibility that these results could imply that theta coherence is not in fact a good causal indicator. As an illustrative example, it could be linked for example with neuromodulation (ie dopamine, see Benchenane et al, 2010) which itself causally modifies the choice process. In this case, coherence would be an excellent predictor of accuracy (as the authors show) without implying a causally important information exchange between the two regions, since inhibiting these regions is without effect.</p>
<p>Altogether, this novel paradigm provides finer control to analyse the role of theta coherence in behaviour. This allows pinpointing of interesting cases in which coherence increases during correct task performance although it may have at least an indirect causal role. This opens up the possibility of interrogating when inter-area synchrony is associated with information transfer and when this information is then used to drive behavioural decisions.</p>
