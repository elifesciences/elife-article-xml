<title>Abstract</title><p>A comprehensive census of McrBC systems, among the most common forms of prokaryotic Type IV restriction systems, followed by phylogenetic analysis, reveals their enormous abundance in diverse prokaryotes and a plethora of genomic associations. We focus on a previously uncharacterized branch, which we denote CoCoNuTs (<underline>co</underline>iled-<underline>co</underline>il <underline>nu</underline>clease tandems) for their salient features: the presence of extensive coiled-coil structures and tandem nucleases. The CoCoNuTs alone show extraordinary variety, with 3 distinct types and multiple subtypes. All CoCoNuTs contain domains predicted to interact with translation system components, such as OB-folds resembling the SmpB protein that binds bacterial tmRNA, YTH-like domains that might recognize methylated tmRNA, tRNA, or rRNA, and RNA-binding Hsp70 chaperone homologs, along with RNases, such as HEPN domains, all suggesting that the CoCoNuTs target RNA. Many CoCoNuTs might additionally target DNA, via McrC nuclease homologs. Additional restriction systems, such as Type I RM, BREX, and Druantia Type III, are frequently encoded in the same predicted superoperons. In many of these superoperons, CoCoNuTs are likely regulated by cyclic nucleotides, possibly, RNA fragments with cyclic termini, that bind associated CARF (<underline>C</underline>RISPR-<underline>A</underline>ssociated <underline>R</underline>ossmann <underline>F</underline>old) domains. The CoCoNuTs, together with the ancillary restriction factors, might employ an echeloned defense strategy analogous to that of Type III CRISPR-Cas systems, in which an immune response eliminating virus DNA and/or RNA is launched first, but then, if it fails, an abortive infection response leading to PCD/dormancy via host RNA cleavage takes over.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>All organisms are subject to an incessant barrage of genetic parasites, such as viruses and transposons. Over billions of years, the continuous arms race between hosts and parasites drove the evolution of immense, intricately interconnected networks of diverse defense systems and pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Burroughs et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gao et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Goldfarb et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bell et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Koonin and Aravind, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Swarts et al., 2014</xref>). In particular, in the last few years, targeted searches for defense systems in prokaryotes, typically capitalizing on the presence of variable genomic defense islands, have dramatically expanded their known diversity and led to the discovery of a plethora of biological conflict strategies and mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gao et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bell et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Anantharaman et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Kaur et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the most ancient and common forms of defense against mobile genetic elements (MGE) is the targeted restriction of nucleic acids. Since the initial discovery of this activity among strains of bacteria resistant to certain viruses, myriad forms of recognition and degradation of nucleic acids have been described, in virtually all life forms. Characterization of the most prominent of these systems, such as restriction-modification (RM), RNA interference (RNAi), and CRISPR-Cas (<underline>c</underline>lustered <underline>r</underline>egularly interspaced <underline>s</underline>hort <underline>p</underline>alindromic <underline>r</underline>epeats-<underline>C</underline>RISPR <underline>as</underline>sociated genes), has led to the development of a profusion of highly effective experimental and therapeutic techniques, in particular, genome editing and engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Loenen et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fire et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agrawal et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Makarova et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Makarova et al., 2020b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gasiunas et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Jinek et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Historically, the two-component McrBC (<underline>m</underline>odified <underline>c</underline>ytosine <underline>r</underline>estriction) system was the first form of restriction to be described, although the mechanism remained obscure for decades, and for a time, this system was referred to as RglB (<underline>r</underline>estriction of <underline>g</underline>lucoseless phages) due to its ability to restrict T-even phage DNA which contained hydroxymethylcytosine, but not glucosylated bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Raleigh et al., 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Luria and Human, 1952</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Fleischman et al., 1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dila et al., 1990</xref>). Today, the prototypical McrBC system, native to <italic>E. coil</italic> K-12, is considered a Type IV (modification-dependent) restriction system that degrades DNA containing methylcytosine (5mC) or hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), with a degree of sequence context specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Sutherland et al., 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Sukackaite et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Type IV restriction enzymes contain at least two components: 1) a dedicated specificity domain that recognizes modified DNA, and 2) an endonuclease domain that cleaves the target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Weigele and Raleigh, 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Loenen et al., 2014</xref>). In the well-characterized example from <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12, McrB harbors an N-terminal DUF(domain of unknown function)3578 that recognizes methylcytosine. We denote this domain, as its function is not unknown, as ADAM (<underline>a d</underline>omain with an <underline>a</underline>ffinity for <underline>m</underline>ethylcytosine). The ADAM domain is fused to a GTPase domain of the AAA+ ATPase superfamily, the only known GTPase in this clade, which is believed to translocate DNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 A, B, C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Sutherland et al., 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Iyer et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Nirwan et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Panne et al., 1999</xref>). McrC, encoded by a separate gene in the same operon, contains an N-terminal DUF2357 domain, which interacts with the GTPase domain in McrB and stimulates its activity, and is fused to a PD-(D/E)xK superfamily endonuclease (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 A, B, D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Niu et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Sutherland et al., 1992</xref>).</p>

<p>A) McrBC is a two-component restriction system with each component typically (except for extremely rare gene fusions) encoded by a separate gene expressed as a single operon, depicted here and in subsequent figures as arrows pointing in the direction of transcription. In most cases, McrB is the upstream gene in the operon. B) In the prototypical E.coli K-12 McrBC system, McrB contains an N-terminal methylcytosine-binding domain, ADAM/DUF3578, fused to a GTPase of the AAA+ ATPase clade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Sukackaite et al., 2012</xref>). This GTPase contains the Walker A and Walker B motifs that are conserved in P-loop NTPases as well as a signature NxxD motif, all of which are required for GTP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Nirwan et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Niu et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Pieper et al., 1999</xref>). McrC consists of a PD-DxK nuclease and an N-terminal DUF2357 domain, which comprises a helical bundle with a stalk-like extension that interacts with and activates individual McrB GTPases while they are assembled into hexamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Niu et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Nirwan et al., 2019</xref>).

<p>Our recent analysis of the modified base-binding EVE (named for Protein Data Bank (PDB) structural identifier 2eve) domain superfamily demonstrated how the distribution of the EVE-like domains connects the elaborate eukaryotic RNA regulation and RNA interference-related epigenetic silencing pathways to largely uncharacterized prokaryotic antiphage restriction systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bell et al., 2020</xref>). EVE superfamily domains, which in eukaryotes recognize modified DNA or RNA as part of mRNA maturation or epigenetic silencing functions, are often fused to McrB-like GTPases in prokaryotes, and indeed, these are the most frequently occurring EVE-containing fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bell et al., 2020</xref>). These observations motivated us to conduct a comprehensive computational search for McrBC systems, followed by a census of all associated domains, to chart the vast and diverse population of antiviral specificity modules, vital for prokaryotic defense, that also provided important source material during the evolution of central signature features of eukaryotic cells. Here we present the results of this census and describe an extraordinary, not previously appreciated variety of domain architectures of the McrBC family of Type IV restriction systems. In particular, we focus on a major McrBC branch that we denote <underline>co</underline>iled-<underline>co</underline>il <underline>nu</underline>clease <underline>t</underline>andem (CoCoNuT) systems, which we explore in detail.</p>

<title>Comprehensive census of McrBC systems</title>
<p>The search for McrBC systems included PSI-BLAST runs against the non-redundant protein sequence database at the NCBI, followed by several filtering strategies (see Methods) to obtain a clean set of nearly 34,000, distributed broadly among prokaryotes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 E</xref>).</p>
<p>In the subsequent phase of analysis, GTPase domain sequences were extracted from the McrB homolog pool, and DUF2357 and PD-D/ExK nuclease domain sequences were extracted from the McrC homolog pool, leaving as a remainder the fused specificity domains that we intended to classify (although the McrC homologs are not the primary bearers of specificity modules in McrBC systems, they can be fused to various additional domains, including those of the EVE superfamily) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, Supplementary Figure S1). Unexpectedly, we found that both the GTPase domains and DUF2357 domains frequently contained insertions into their coding sequences, likely encoding specificity domains and coiled-coils, respectively.</p>

<caption><title>Phylogenetic tree of the McrB GTPases</title>
<p>The major clades in the phylogenetic tree of the McrB GTPases are distinguished by the distinct versions of the Nx(xx)D signature motif. The teal and yellow groups, with bootstrap support of 97%, have an NxD motif, whereas the blue, green, red, and purple groups, with variable bootstrap support, have an NxxD motif, indicated by the arrows; the sequences in the smaller, cyan clade, with 98% bootstrap support, have an NxxxD motif. Each of the differently colored groups is characterized by distinct conserved genomic associations that are abundant within but not completely confined to the respective groups. This tree was built from the representatives of 90% identity clusters of all validated homologs.

<p>Removing variable inserts from the conserved McrBC domains allowed accurate, comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the McrB GTPase (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) and McrC DUF2357 (Supplementary Figure S1) families. These two trees were generally topologically concordant and revealed several distinct branches not previously recognized. The branch containing the prototypical McrBC system from <italic>E. coil</italic> K-12 (blue in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) is characterized by frequent genomic association with Type I RM systems, usually with unidirectional gene orientations and the potential of forming a single operon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Raleigh, 1992</xref>). This branch and others, which exhibit two particularly prevalent associations, with a DISARM-like antiphage system (green in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Ofir et al., 2018</xref>), and, surprisingly for a Type IV restriction system, with predicted DNA methyltransferases (red in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), will be the subject of a separate, forthcoming publication.</p>

<title>A variant of the McrB GTPase signature motif distinguishes a large group of unusual <italic>McrBC systems</italic></title>
<p>A major branch (teal and yellow in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) of the McrBC family is characterized by a conserved deletion within the NxxD GTPase signature motif (where x is any amino acid), found in all McrB-like GTPases, reducing it to NxD (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 B</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Neuwald et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Iyer et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Erzberger and Berger, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Niu et al., 2020</xref>). No NxD motif McrB GTPase has been characterized, but the extensive study of the NxxD motif offers clues to the potential impact of the motif shortening. The asparagine (N) residue is strictly required for GTP binding and hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Pieper et al., 1999</xref>). As this residue is analogous to sensor-1 in ATP-hydrolyzing members of the AAA+ family, it can be predicted to position a catalytic water molecule for nucleophilic attack on the γ-phosphate of an NTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Erzberger and Berger, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Colicelli, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bourne et al., 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Niu et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Pieper et al., 1999</xref>). A recent structural analysis has shown that the aspartate (D) interacts with a conserved arginine/lysine residue in McrC which, via a hydrogen-bonding network, resituates the NxxD motif in relation to its interface with the Walker B motif such that, together, they optimally position a catalytic water to stimulate hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Niu et al., 2020</xref>). Accordingly, the truncation of this motif might be expected to modulate the rate of hydrolysis, and potentially compel functional association with only a subset of McrC homologs containing compensatory mutations. The NxD branch is characterized by many McrC homologs with unusual features, such as predicted RNA-binding domains, that might not be compatible with conventional McrB GTPases from the NxxD clade, which often occur in the same genomes (see below).</p>
<p>Many of these NxD GTPases are contextually associated with DNA methyltransferases, like the NxxD GTPases, but are distinguished by additional complexity in the domains fused to the McrC homologs and the frequent presence of two-component regulatory system genes in the same operon (yellow in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). We also detected a small number of GTPases with an insertion in the signature motif (cyan in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), expanding it to NxxxD, which are methyltransferase-associated as well. This association is likely to be ancestral, as it is found in all 3 branches of the McrB GTPase tree with different signature motif variations.</p>
<p>The most notable feature of the NxD branch of GTPases is a large clade characterized by fusion to long coiled-coil domains (teal in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, Supplementary Table S1), a derived and distinctly different architecture from the small, modular DNA-binding specificity domains typically found in canonical McrB homologs. The McrC homologs associated with these coiled-coil McrB GTPase fusions also often lack the PD-D/ExK endonuclease entirely or contain an AlphaFold2 (AF2)-predicted endonuclease fold with inactivating replacements of catalytic residues (Supplementary Table S1). However, in the cases where the McrC nuclease is missing or likely inactive, these systems are always encoded in close association, often with overlapping reading frames, with HEPN (<underline>h</underline>igher <underline>e</underline>ukaryotes and <underline>p</underline>rokaryotes <underline>n</underline>ucleotide-binding) ribonuclease domains, or other predicted nucleases (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, Supplementary Figure S2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Pillon et al., 2021</xref>). Based on these features of domain architecture and genomic context, we denote these uncharacterized McrBC-containing operons <underline>co</underline>iled-<underline>co</underline>il <underline>nu</underline>clease tandem (CoCoNuT) systems.</p>

Hsp70 is an ATP-dependent protein chaperone that binds exposed hydrophobic peptides and facilitates protein folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Mayer, 2021</xref>). It also associates with AU-rich mRNA, and in some cases, such as the bacterial homolog DnaK, C-rich RNA, an interaction involving both the NBD and SBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Kishor et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Zimmer et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Kishor et al., 2013</xref>). These systems might be functionally related to the CoCoNuTs, given that an analogous unit is encoded by a type of CoCoNuT system where similar domains are fused to the McrC homolog rather than to the McrB GTPase homolog (see below). In another large clade of CoCoNuT-like systems, the GTPase is fused to a domain homologous to FtsB, an essential bacterial cell division protein containing transmembrane and coiled-coil helices (Supplementary Figure S2, Supplementary Table S1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Khadria and Senes, 2013</xref>). They are associated with signal peptidase family proteins likely to function as pilus assembly factors (Supplementary Table S1) [47] and usually contain coiled-coil domains fused to both the McrB and McrC homologs. Therefore, we denote them <underline>co</underline>iled-<underline>co</underline>il and <underline>p</underline>ilus <underline>a</underline>ssembly linked to <underline>M</underline>crBC (CoCoPALM) systems (Supplementary Figure S2).</p>
<p>Here, we focus on the CoCoNuTs, whereas the CoCoPALMs and the rest of the NxD GTPase methyltransferase-associated homologs will be explored in a separate, forthcoming publication.</p>
<p>CoCoNuT systems are extremely diverse and represented in a wide variety of bacteria, particularly Pseudomonadota and Bacillota, but are nearly absent in archaea (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Type I CoCoNuT systems</title>
<p>We classified the CoCoNuTs into 3 types and 7 subtypes based on the GTPase domain phylogeny and conserved genomic context (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Type I-A and Type I-C systems consist of McrB and McrC homologs only, which we denote CnuB and CnuC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Type I-B systems usually encode a separate coiled-coil protein, which we denote CnuA, in addition to CnuB/McrB and CnuC/McrC, with no coiled-coil fused to the McrB-like GTPase domain in CnuB (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). CnuA is fused at the N-terminus to a pyrin (PYD)/CARD (<underline>c</underline>aspase <underline>a</underline>ctivation and <underline>r</underline>ecruitment <underline>d</underline>omain)-like helical domain and at the C-terminus to a phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, Supplementary Table S1). The association of the PYD/CARD-like domains with CoCoNuTs suggests involvement in a programmed cell death (PCD)/abortive infection-type response, as they belong to the DEATH domain superfamily and are best characterized in the context of innate immunity, inflammasome formation, and PCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Park et al., 2007</xref>). The REC domains constitute one of the components of two-component regulatory systems. They are targeted for phosphorylation by histidine kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Stock et al., 2000</xref>), which could be a mechanism of Type I-B CoCoNuT regulation.</p>

<p>In contrast to Type II and Type III CnuB homologs, which contain only coiled-coils fused at their N-termini (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>), cold-shock domain (CSD)-like OB-folds are usually fused at the N-termini of Type I CoCoNuT CnuB/McrB proteins, in addition to the coiled-coils (except for the majority of Type I-B, where the coiled-coils are encoded separately) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, Supplementary Table S1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Amir et al., 2018</xref>).

<p>The CnuC/McrC proteins in Type I CoCoNuTs, as well as those in Type II and Type III-B and III-C, all contain an immunoglobulin-like N-terminal beta-sandwich domain of unknown function, not present in the <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 McrC homolog, similar to a wide range of folds from this superfamily with diverse roles (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, Supplementary Table S1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Natarajan et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Halaby et al., 1999</xref>). It is also present in non-CoCoNuT McrC homologs associated with McrB GTPase homologs in the NxD clade, implying its function is not specific to the CoCoNuTs. In the Type I-B and I-C CoCoNuT CnuC homologs, these domains most closely resemble Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 1, suggesting that they may be involved in regulation of CnuB/McrB GTPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dovas and Couchman, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Type II and III CoCoNuT systems</title>
<p>Type II and III CoCoNuT CnuB/McrB GTPase domains branch from within Type I-A and are encoded in a nearly completely conserved genomic association with a Superfamily 1 (SF1) helicase of the UPF1-like clade, which we denote CnuH (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, Supplementary Table S1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Gorbalenya and Koonin, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fairman-Williams et al., 2010</xref>). The UPF1-like family encompasses helicases with diverse functions acting on RNA and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) substrates, and notably, the prototypical UPF1 RNA helicase and its closest relatives are highly conserved in eukaryotes, where they play a critical role in the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) RNA surveillance pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cheng et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chakrabarti et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>SF1 helicases are composed of two RecA-like domains which together harbor a series of signature motifs required for the ATPase and helicase activities, including the Walker A and Walker B motifs conserved in P-loop NTPases, which are located in the N-terminal RecA-like domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fairman-Williams et al., 2010</xref>). In all 4 Type II and Type III CoCoNuT subtypes, following the Walker A motif, the CnuH helicases contain a large helical insertion, with some of the helices predicted to form coiled-coils (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). The Type II, Type III-A, and Type III-B CoCoNuT CnuH helicases contain an OB-fold domain that, in Type II and Type III-A, is flanked by helices predicted to form a stalk-like helical extension of the N-terminal RecA-like domain, a structural feature characteristic of the entire UPF1/DNA2-like helicase family within SF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chakrabarti et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Kalathiya et al., 2019</xref>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). DALI comparisons show that the CnuH predicted OB-fold domain in Type II CoCoNuTs is similar to the OB-fold domain in UPF1 and related RNA helicases SMUBP-2 and SEN1, and this holds for Type III-A as well, although, in these systems, the best DALI hits are to translation factor components such as EF-Tu domain II (Supplementary Table S1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chakrabarti et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Morse et al., 2020</xref>). The Type III-B CnuH predicted OB-folds also match that of UPF1, albeit with lower statistical support (Supplementary Table S1).</p>
<p>In Type II and Type III-A CoCoNuTs, CnuH is fused at the N-terminus to a second OB-fold domain similar to that of SmpB (<underline>sm</underline>all <underline>p</underline>rotein B) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, Supplementary Figure S5, Supplementary Table S1), which we denote SPB (<underline>S</underline>m<underline>pB</underline>-like). SmpB binds to SsrA RNA, also known as transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA), and is required for tmRNA to rescue stalled ribosomes, via entry into their A-sites with its alanine-charged tRNA-like domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barends et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Himeno et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Guyomar et al., 2021</xref>). The SPB domain is around 20 amino acids shorter on average than SmpB itself, and a helix that is conserved in SmpB orthologs and interacts with the tmRNA is absent in the CoCoNuT OB folds (Supplementary Figure S5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bessho et al., 2007</xref>). However, two other structural elements of SmpB involved in binding tmRNA are present (Supplementary Figure S5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Gutmann et al., 2003</xref>). The N-terminal OB-folds in Type II and III-A CnuH homologs also resemble prokaryotic HIRAN domains, which are uncharacterized, but have eukaryotic homologs fused to helicases that bind ssDNA (Supplementary Figure S5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chavez et al., 2018</xref>). These HIRAN domains, however, do not overlay with the CoCoNuT domains any better than SmpB (Supplementary Figure S5), lack a small helix that SmpB and the CoCoNuT domains share, and likely being DNA-binding, do not fit the other pieces of evidence we gathered that all suggest an RNA-binding role for this domain in the CoCoNuTs (see below).</p>
<p>The Type II and Type III-A CoCoNuT CnuH helicases contain an additional domain, structurally similar to the RelE/Colicin D RNase fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Gucinski et al., 2019</xref>), which we denote <underline>R</underline>Nase toxin-like (RTL), located between the SPB OB-fold and the helicase (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, Supplementary Table S1). The proteins of this family are ribosome-dependent toxins that cleave either mRNA or tRNA in the ribosomal A-site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Pedersen et al., 2003</xref>). This domain was identified by structural similarity search with the AF2 models, but no sequence conservation with characterized members of this family was detected, leaving it uncertain whether the RTL domain is an active nuclease. However, considerable divergence in sequence is not unusual in this toxin family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Guglielmini and Van Melderen, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Goeders et al., 2013</xref>). In Type III-B CoCoNuTs, a wHTH domain resembling the archaeal ssDNA-binding protein Sul7s is fused to the CnuH N-termini (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, Supplementary Table S1).</p>
<p>We searched for additional homologs of CnuH (see Methods). Our observations of the contextual associations, both of the CoCoNuTs and their relatives, showed that helicases of this large family are typically encoded in operons with downstream genes coding for an elongated wHTH domain fused at its C-terminus to a variety of effectors, generally, nucleases, which we denote CnuE (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). In the CoCoNuTs, except for Types III-B and III-C, these CnuE effectors are HEPN ribonucleases, with one HEPN domain in Type II and two in Type III-A (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, Supplementary Table S1). In Type III-B, the effector is a Vsr (<underline>v</underline>ery-<underline>s</underline>hort-patch <underline>r</underline>epair)-like PD-(D/E)xK family endonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Tsutakawa et al., 1999</xref>) fused directly to the helicase, with no wHTH domain present, whereas in Type III-C, a distorted version of the elongated wHTH domain is fused to two Phospholipase D (PLD) family endonuclease domains (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, Supplementary Table S1). All these nucleases can degrade RNA, and some, such as HEPN, have been found to cleave RNA exclusively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Pillon et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Ipsaro et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Mendez et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Laganeckas et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Songailiene et al., 2020</xref>). We also detected coiled-coils in the region between the wHTH and effector domains in Type II, Type III-A, and Type III-C CoCoNuT CnuE homologs. Multimer structural modeling with AlphaFold2 suggests that the wHTH domain in CnuE might interact with the coiled-coil-containing helical insertion of CnuH, perhaps mediated by the coiled-coils in each protein, to couple the ATP-driven helicase activity to the various nuclease effectors (Supplementary Figure S7). The accuracy of this model notwithstanding, the fusion of the Vsr-like effector to CnuH in Type III-B CoCoNuTs and the similarity of this system to the other CoCoNuT types strongly suggests that the CnuE effector proteins in these systems form complexes with their respective CnuH helicases. An additional factor in potential complexing by these proteins is the presence of coiled-coils in the associated CnuB/McrB and CnuC/McrC homologs, which may interact with the coiled-coils in CnuH and CnuE. Type III-B CoCoNuTs also code for a separate coiled-coil protein, which we denote CnuA, as it resembles the CnuA protein encoded in Type I-B CoCoNuTs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). However, it is distinguished from Type I-B CnuA in containing no recognizable domains other than the coiled-coil (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). This also could potentially interact with other coiled-coil proteins in the system.</p>
<p>Type II and Type III-A CoCoNuTs, the most widespread varieties apart from Type I, also include conserved genes coding for a “TerY-P” triad. TerY-P consists of a TerY-like von Willebrand factor type A (VWA) domain, a protein phosphatase 2C-like enzyme, and a serine/threonine kinase (STK) fused at the C-terminus to a zinc ribbon (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, Supplementary Table S1). TerY-P triads are involved in tellurite resistance, associated with various predicted DNA restriction and processing systems, and are predicted to function as a metal-sensing phosphorylation-dependent signaling switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Anantharaman et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, TerY-P-like modules, in which the kinase is fused at the C-terminus to an OB-fold rather than a zinc ribbon, have been recently shown to function as stand-alone antiphage defense systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gao et al., 2020</xref>). The OB-fold fusion suggests that this kinase interacts with an oligonucleotide and raises the possibility that the zinc ribbon, which occupies the same position in the CoCoNuTs, is also nucleic acid-binding. Almost all CoCoNuT systems containing <italic>cnuHE</italic> operons also encompass TerY-P, with a few exceptions among Terrabacterial Type II systems and Myxococcal Type III-A systems, implying an important contribution to their function (Supplementary Data). However, the complete absence of the TerY-P module in Type III-B and Type III-C systems implies that when different nucleases and other putative effectors fused to the helicase are present, TerY-P is dispensable for the CoCoNuT activity. Therefore, we do not consider them to be core components of these systems.</p>
<p>Type II and Type III-A CoCoNuTs have similar domain compositions, but a more detailed comparison reveals substantial differences. The CnuE proteins in Type II contain one HEPN domain with the typical RxxxxH RNase motif conserved in most cases, whereas those in Type III-A contain two HEPN domains, one with the RxxxxH motif, and the other, closest to the C-terminus, with a shortened RxH motif. Furthermore, Type III-A CnuB/McrB GTPase homologs often contain C-terminal HTH-domain fusions absent in Type II (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Finally, striking divergence has occurred between the Type II and III-A CnuC/McrC homologs. Type II CnuCs resemble Type I-A CnuCs, which contain N-terminal immunoglobulin-like beta-sandwich domains, PD-D/ExK nucleases, zinc ribbon domains, and insertions into DUF2357 containing coiled-coils and a CSD-like OBD. However, in Type II CnuCs, this domain architecture underwent reductive evolution (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, Supplementary Table S1). In particular, the beta-sandwich domain and coiled-coils are shorter, the CSD was lost, the nuclease domain was inactivated, and in many cases, the number of Zn-binding CPxC motifs was reduced from three to two (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, Supplementary Table S1). This degeneration pattern could indicate functional replacement by the associated CnuH and CnuE proteins, often encoded in reading frames overlapping with the start of the <italic>cnuBC</italic> operon.</p>
<p>By contrast, Type III-A CnuC/McrC homologs entirely lost the beta-sandwich domain, PD-D/ExK nuclease, and zinc ribbon found in Type I-A and Type II, but gained an Hsp70-like NBD/SBD unit similar to those that are fused to the McrB GTPase in early branching members of the NxD clade. They have also acquired a helical domain similar to the HEAT repeat family, and in some cases, a second CSD (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, Supplementary Table S1). Most Type III-A CnuCs contain a CSD and coiled-coils, and thus, resemble Type I-A, but the positioning of these domains, which in Type I-A are inserted into the DUF2357 helix bundle, is not conserved in Type III-A, where these domains are located outside DUF2357 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>).</p>
<p>Hsp70-like ATPase NBD/SBD domains and HEAT-like repeats are fused to the CnuC/McrC N-terminal DUF2357 domain in Type III-A CoCoNuT, but their homologs in Type III-B and III-C are encoded by a separate gene. We denote these proteins CnuD and CnuCD, the latter for the CnuC-CnuD fusions in Type III-A. The separation of these domains in Type III-B and III-C implies that fusion is not required for their functional interaction with the CnuBC/McrBC systems (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 A</xref>, Supplementary Table S1). CnuD proteins associated with both Type III-B and III-C contain predicted coiled-coils, suggesting that they might interact with the large coiled-coil in the CnuB homologs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 A</xref>).</p>
<p>In the CnuD homologs found in the CoCoNuTs and fused to NxD McrB GTPases, Walker B-like motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Yamamoto et al., 2014</xref>) are usually, but not invariably, conserved, whereas the sequences of the helical domains adjacent to the motifs are more strongly constrained. Walker A-like motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chang et al., 2008</xref>) are present but degenerate (Supplementary Figure S8). Therefore, it appears likely that the CoCoNuT CnuD homologs bind ATP/ADP but hydrolyze ATP with extremely low efficiency, at best. Such properties in an Hsp70-like domain are better compatible with RNA binding than unfolded protein binding or remodeling, suggesting that these CnuD homologs may target the respective systems to aberrant RNA. Many Hsp70 homologs have been reported to associate with ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Mayer, 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Willmund et al., 2013</xref>), which could also be true for the CoCoNuT Cnu(C)Ds.</p>
<p>Consistent with this prediction, Type II and III-A CoCoNuTs likely target RNA rather than DNA, given that the respective operons encode HEPN RNases, typically the only recognizable nuclease in these systems. All CnuC/McrC homologs in Type II or III CoCoNuT systems lack the PD-D/ExK catalytic motif that is required for nuclease activity, although for Type II and Type III-B and III-C, but not Type III-A, structural modeling indicates that the inactivated nuclease domain was retained, likely for a nucleic acid-binding role (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, Supplementary Table S1). In Type III-A CoCoNuT, the nuclease domain was lost entirely and replaced by the Hsp70-like NBD/SBD domain with RNA-binding potential described above (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, Supplementary Table S1). Often, one or two CSDs, generally RNA-binding domains, although capable of binding ssDNA, are fused to Type III-A CnuC homologs as well (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, Supplementary Table S1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Heinemann and Roske, 2021</xref>). RNA targeting capability of Type III-B and III-C can perhaps be inferred from their similarity to Type III-A in encoding CnuD Hsp70-like proteins. Moreover, higher-order associations of Type II and Type III-A CoCoNuT systems with various DNA restriction systems suggest a two-pronged DNA and RNA restriction strategy reminiscent of Type III CRISPR-Cas (see below).</p>
<p>We suspect that RNA targeting is an ancestral feature of the CoCoNuT systems. Several observations are compatible with this hypothesis:

<title>Complex higher-order associations between CoCoNuTs, CARF domains, and other defense systems</title>
<p>Genomic neighborhoods of many Type II and Type III-A CoCoNuTs encompass complex operonic associations with genes encoding several types of CARF (<underline>C</underline>RISPR-<underline>A</underline>ssociated <underline>R</underline>ossmann <underline>F</underline>old) domain-containing proteins. This connection suggests multifarious regulation by cyclic (oligo)nucleotide second messengers synthesized in response to viral infection and bound by CARF domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Makarova et al., 2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">McMahon et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>). Activation of an effector, most often a nuclease, such as HEPN or PD-(D/E)xK, by a CARF bound to a cyclic (oligo)nucleotide is a crucial mechanism of CBASS (<underline>c</underline>yclic oligonucleotide-<underline>b</underline>ased <underline>a</underline>ntiphage <underline>s</underline>ignaling <underline>s</underline>ystem) as well as Type III CRISPR-Cas systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">McMahon et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Makarova et al., 2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>). These CARF-regulated enzymes generally function as a fail-safe that eventually induces PCD/dormancy when other antiphage defenses fail to bring the infection under control and are deactivated, typically through cleavage of the second messenger by a RING nuclease, if other mechanisms succeed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Makarova et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Koonin and Zhang, 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Makarova et al., 2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Koonin and Krupovic, 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>The presence of CARFs could implicate the HEPN domains of these systems as PCD effectors that would carry out non-specific RNA degradation in response to infection. Surprisingly, however, most of these CARF domain-containing proteins showed the highest similarity to RtcR, a sigma54 transcriptional coactivator of the RNA repair system RtcAB with a CARF-ATPase-HTH domain architecture, suggesting an alternative functional prediction (Supplementary Figure S9, Supplementary Table S1). Specifically, by analogy with RtcR, CoCoNuT-associated CARF domain-containing proteins might bind (t)RNA fragments with 2’,3’ cyclic phosphate ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Kotta-Loizou et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Hughes et al., 2020</xref>). This interaction could promote transcription of downstream genes, in this case, genes encoding CoCoNuT components, through binding an upstream activating sequence by the HTH domain fused to the CARF-ATPase C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Hughes et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Kotta-Loizou et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>The manifold biological effects of tRNA-like fragments are only beginning to be appreciated. Lately, it has been shown that bacterial anticodon nucleases, in response to infection and DNA degradation by phages, generate tRNA fragments, likely a signal of infection and a defensive strategy to slow down the translation of viral mRNA, and that phages can deploy tRNA repair enzymes and other strategies to counteract this defense mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bitton et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">van den Berg et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Kaufmann, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Ishita et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, the activity of the HEPN ribonucleases in the CoCoNuTs themselves would produce RNA cleavage products with cyclic phosphate ends that might be bound by the associated RtcR-like CARFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Shigematsu et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Pillon et al., 2021</xref>), in a potential feedback loop.</p>
<p>Such a CoCoNuT mechanism could complement the function of RtcAB, as RtcA is an RNA cyclase that converts 3L-phosphate RNA termini to 2L,3L-cyclic phosphate and thus, in a feedback loop, generates 2’,3’-cyclic phosphate RNA fragments that induce expression of the operon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Genschik et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Das and Shuman, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Hughes et al., 2020</xref>). Acting downstream of RtcA, RtcB is an RNA ligase that joins 2’,3’-cyclic phosphate RNA termini to 5’-OH RNA fragments, generating a 5’-3’ bond and, in many cases, reconstituting a functional tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Tanaka and Shuman, 2011</xref>). Recent work has shown that, in bacteria, the most frequent target of RtcB is SsrA, the tmRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Kotta-Loizou et al., 2022</xref>). Intriguingly, as described above, in order to rescue stalled ribosomes, tmRNA must bind to SmpB, an OB-fold protein highly similar to the predicted structures of the SPB domains fused at the N-termini of the Type II and III-A CoCoNuTs, which are the only types that frequently associate with RtcR homologs (Supplementary Figure S9, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Himeno et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Guyomar et al., 2021</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Complex operonic associations of Type II CoCoNuTs</title>
<p>Type II CoCoNuTs are frequently associated with RtcR homologs, and in many cases, ancillary defense genes are located between the RtcR gene and the CoCoNuT, almost always oriented in the same direction in an apparent superoperon.

</fig>
<p>There are notable parallels between CoCoNuTs and Type III CRISPR-Cas systems, where the Cas10-Csm-crRNA effector complex binds phage RNA complementary to the spacer of the crRNA, triggering both restriction of phage DNA and indiscriminate cleavage of RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">McMahon et al., 2020</xref>). The target RNA recognition stimulates the production of cyclic oligoadenylate (cOA) signals by Cas10, which activate, via CARF domain binding, PCD effectors, typically HEPN domain-containing proteins, such as Csm6, that function as promiscuous RNases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Pillon et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Millman et al., 2020</xref>). One of the two outcomes can result from this cascade: the infection can either be eradicated quickly due to the restriction of the virus DNA, which inhibits cOA signaling via the depletion of viral RNA, along with the activity of RING nucleases, thus averting PCD, or the continued presence of viral RNA stimulates cOA signaling until PCD or dormancy occurs, limiting the spread of viruses to neighboring cells in the bacterial population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Makarova et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Koonin and Aravind, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Koonin and Krupovic, 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>If CoCoNuTs associated with RtcR homologs can induce PCD, a conceptually similar but mechanistically distinct phenomenon might occur. Although many of these CoCoNuTs only contain an appended gene encoding a CARF domain-containing protein at the 5’ end of the predicted operon (Supplementary Figure S9), there are also numerous cases where several types of DNA restriction systems are encoded between the CARF gene and the CoCoNuT (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). In these cases, nearly all genes are in an apparent operonic organization that can extend upwards of 40 kb (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Although internal RtcR-independent promoters likely exist in these large loci, the consistent directionality and close spacing of the genes in these superoperons suggests coordination of expression. The complex organization of the CARF-CoCoNuT genomic regions, and by implication, the corresponding defense mechanisms, might accomplish the same effect as Type III CRISPR-Cas, contriving a no-win situation for the target virus. Under this scenario, the virus is either destroyed by the activity of the DNA restriction systems, which would inhibit signal production (likely RNA fragments with cyclic phosphate ends rather than cOA) and drive down CoCoNuT transcription, thereby preventing PCD, or as the virus replicates, signaling and CoCoNuT transcription would continue until the infection is aborted by PCD or dormancy caused by the degradation of host mRNA via the HEPN RNase(s) of the CoCoNuT.</p>
<p>In many species of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, where CoCoNuTs are almost always associated with RtcR and various ancillary factors, Type I RM systems often contain an additional gene that encodes a transmembrane helix and a long coiled-coil fused to an RmuC-like nuclease (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). These proteins were recently described as ShdA, the core component of the <italic>Pseudomonas-</italic> specific defense system Shield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Macdonald et al., 2022</xref>). These can potentially interact with coiled-coils in the CoCoNuTs, perhaps, guiding them to the DNA from which RNA targeted by the CoCoNuTs is being transcribed, or vice versa (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).</p>
<p>A notable difference between the generally similar, dual DNA and RNA-targeting mechanism of many Type III CRISPR-Cas systems and the proposed mechanism of the CoCoNuTs is that viral RNA recognition by the Cas10-Csm complex, rather than binding of a second messenger to a CARF domain, activates both DNA cleavage activity by the HD domain and production of cOA that triggers non-specific RNA cleavage. In contrast, in the CARF-containing CoCoNuTs, both the DNA and RNA restriction factors appear to be arranged such that binding of a 2’,3’ cyclic phosphate RNA fragment by the CARF domain would initiate the expression of the entire cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">McMahon et al., 2020</xref>). In the case of the CoCoNuTs, signals of infection could promote transcription, first of the DNA restriction systems, and then, the CoCoNuT itself, a predicted RNA restriction system. In these complex configurations of the CoCoNuT genome neighborhoods (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>), the gene order is likely to be important, with Type I RM almost always directly following CARF genes and CoCoNuTs typically coming last, although Druantia Type III sometimes follows the CoCoNuT. As translation in bacteria is co-transcriptional, the products of genes transcribed first would accumulate before those of the genes transcribed last, so that the full, potentially suicidal impact of the CoCoNuT predicted RNA nucleolytic engine would only be felt after the associated DNA restriction systems had ample time to act – and possibly, fail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Irastortza-Olaziregi and Amster-Choder, 2020</xref>).</p>

<title>Concluding remarks</title>
<p>In recent years, systematic searches for defense systems in prokaryotes, primarily by analysis of defense islands, revealed enormous, previously unsuspected diversity of such systems that function through a remarkable variety of molecular mechanisms. In this work, we uncovered the hidden diversity and striking hierarchical complexity of a distinct class of defense mechanisms, the Type IV (McrBC) restriction systems. We then zeroed in on a single major but previously overlooked branch of the McrBC systems, which we denoted CoCoNuTs for their salient features, namely, the presence of extensive coiled-coil structures and tandem nucleases. Astounding complexity was discovered at this level as well, with 3 distinct types and multiple subtypes of CoCoNuTs that differ by their domain compositions and genomic associations. All CoCoNuTs contain domains capable of interacting with translation systems components, such as the SmpB-like OB-fold, Hsp70 homologs, or YTH domains, along with RNases, such as HEPN, suggesting that at least one of the activities of these systems targets RNA. Most of the CoCoNuTs are likely endowed with DNA-targeting activity as well, either by factors integral to the system, such as the McrC nuclease, or more loosely associated, such as Type I RM and Druantia Type III systems that are encoded in the same predicted superoperon with many CoCoNuTs. Numerous CoCoNuTs are associated with proteins containing CARF domains, suggesting that cyclic (oligo)nucleotides regulate the CoCoNuT activity. Given the presence of the RtcR-like CARF domains, it appears likely that the specific second messengers involved are RNA fragments with cyclic phosphate termini. We hypothesize that the CoCoNuTs, in conjunction with ancillary restriction factors, implement an echeloned defense strategy analogous to that of Type III CRISPR-Cas systems, whereby an immune response eliminating virus DNA and/or RNA is launched first, but then, if it fails, an abortive infection response leading to PCD/dormancy via host RNA cleavage takes over.</p>

<title>Comprehensive identification and phylogenetic and genomic neighborhood analysis of McrB and McrC proteins</title>
<p>The comprehensive search for McrB and McrC proteins was seeded with publicly available multiple sequence alignments COG1401 (McrB GTPase domain), AAA_5 (The branch of AAA+ ATPases containing the McrB GTPase), COG4268 (McrC), PF10117 (McrBC), COG1700 (McrC PD-D/ExK nuclease domain), PF04411 (McrC PD-D/ExK nuclease domain), PF09823 (McrC N-terminal DUF2357). Additional alignments and individual queries were derived from data from our previous work on the EVE domain family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bell et al., 2020</xref>). All alignments were clustered, and each sub-alignment or individual query sequence was used to produce a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM). These PSSMs were used as PSI-BLAST queries against the non-redundant (nr) NCBI database (<italic>E</italic>-value ≤ 10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Altschul et al., 1997</xref>). Although a branch of McrB GTPase homologs has been described in animals, these are highly divergent in function, and no associated McrC homologs have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Iyer et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, we excluded eukaryotic sequences from our analysis to focus on the composition and contextual connections of prokaryotic McrBC systems. Genome neighborhoods for the hits were generated by downloading their gene sequence, coordinates, and directional information from GenBank, as well as for 10 genes on each side of the hit. Domains in these genes were identified using PSI-BLAST against alignments of domains in the NCBI Conserved Domain Database (CDD) and Pfam (<italic>E</italic>-value 0.001). Some genes were additionally analyzed with HHpred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gabler et al., 2020</xref>). Then, these neighborhoods were filtered for the presence of a COG1401 hit (McrB GTPase domain), or hits to both an McrB “alias” (MoxR, AAA_5, COG4127, DUF4357, Smc, WEMBL, Myosin_tail_1, DUF3578, EVE, Mrr_N, pfam01878) and an McrC “alias” (McrBC, McrC, PF09823, DUF2357, COG1700, PDDEXK_7, RE_LlaJI). These aliases were determined from a preliminary manual investigation of the data using HHpred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Zimmermann et al., 2018</xref>). Several of the McrB aliases are not specific to McrB, and instead are domains commonly fused to McrB GTPase homologs, or are larger families, such as AAA_5, that contain McrB homologs. We found that many <italic>bona fide</italic> McrB homologs, validated by HHpred, produced hits not to COG1401 but rather to these other domains, so we made an effort to retain them.</p>
<p>The McrB candidates identified by this filtering process were clustered to a similarity threshold of 0.5 with MMseqs2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hauser et al., 2016</xref>), after which the sequences in each cluster were aligned with MUSCLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Edgar, 2004</xref>). Next, profile-to-profile similarity scores between all clusters were calculated with HHsearch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Söding, 2004</xref>). Clusters with high similarity, defined as a pairwise score to self-score ratio &gt;L0.1, were aligned to each other with HHalign (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Söding et al., 2006</xref>). This procedure was performed for a total of 3 iterations. The alignments resulting from this protocol were analyzed with HHpred to remove false positives, after which the GTPase domain sequences were extracted manually using HHpred, and the alignments were used as queries for a second round of PSI-BLAST against the nr NCBI database as described above. At this stage, the abundance of the CoCoNuT and CoCoPALM (<underline>co</underline>iled-<underline>co</underline>il and <underline>p</underline>ilus <underline>a</underline>ssembly linked to <underline>M</underline>crBC, see below) types of McrB GTPases had become apparent, therefore, results of targeted searches for these subtypes were included in the pool of hits from the second round of PSI-BLAST. Genome neighborhoods were generated for these hits and filtered for aliases as described above. Further filtering of the data, which did not pass this initial filter, involved relaxing the criteria to include neighborhoods with only one hit to an McrB or McrC alias, but with a gene adjacent to the hit (within 90 nucleotides), oriented in the same direction as the hit, and encoding a protein of sufficient size (&gt; 200 aa for McrB, &gt; 150 aa for McrC) to be the undetected McrB or McrC component. Afterward, we filtered the remaining data to retain genome islands with no McrBC aliases but with PSI-BLAST hits in operonic association with genes of sufficient size, as described above, to be the other McrBC component. These data, which contained many false positives but captured many rare variants, were then clustered and analyzed as described above to remove false positives. Next, an automated procedure was developed to excise the GTPase domain sequences using the manual alignments generated during the first phase of the search as a reference. These GTPase sequences were further analyzed by clustering and HHpred to remove false positives. Definitive validation by pairing McrB homologs with their respective McrC homologs was also used to corroborate their identification. Occasionally, the McrB and McrC homologs were separated by intervening genes, or the operon order was reversed, and consideration of those possibilities allowed the validation of many additional systems. The pairing process was complicated by and drew our attention to the frequent occurrence of multiple copies of McrBC systems in the same islands that may function cooperatively. Finally, the rigorously validated set of McrBC pairs, supplemented only with orphans manually annotated as McrBC components using HHpred, were used for our phylogenetics. The final alignments of GTPase and DUF2357 domains were produced using the iterative alignment procedure described above for 10 iterations. Approximately-maximum-likelihood trees were built with the FastTree program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Price et al., 2010</xref>) from representative sequences following clustering to a 0.9 similarity threshold with MMseqs2. The phyletic distribution was calculated by assigning a weight to the lineage of each sequence that was inversely proportional to its cluster size (1/n, where n=the cluster size).</p>

<title>Preliminary phylogenetic analysis of CoCoNuT CnuH helicases</title>
<p>A comprehensive search and phylogenetic analysis of this family was beyond the scope of this work, but to determine the relationships between the CoCoNuTs and the rest of the UPF1-like helicases, we used the following procedure. We retrieved the best 2000 hits in each of two searches with UPF1 and CoCoNuT helicases as queries against both a database containing predicted proteins from 24,757 completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes downloaded from the NCBI GenBank in November 2021 and a database containing 72 representative eukaryotic genomes that were downloaded from the NCBI GenBank in June 2020. Next, we combined all proteins in four searches, made a nonredundant set, and annotated them using CDD profiles, as described above. Then, we aligned them with MUSCLE v5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Robert, 2022</xref>), constructed an approximately-maximum-likelihood tree with FastTree, and mapped the annotations onto the tree.

<p>This paper marks a <bold>fundamental</bold> advance in our understanding of prokaryotic Type IV restriction systems. The authors provide an encyclopedic overview of a hitherto uncharacterized branch of these systems, which they name CoCoNuTs, for coiled-coil nuclease tandems.

This article will be of great interest to scientists studying prokaryotic immunity mechanisms, as well as broadly to protein scientists engaged in the analysis, classification, and functional annotation of the proteome of life.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this manuscript, Bell et al. provide an exhaustive and clear description of the diversity of a new class of predicted type IV restriction systems that the authors denote as CoCoNuTs, for their characteristic presence of coiled-coil segments and nuclease tandems. Along with a comprehensive analysis that includes phylogenetics, protein structure prediction, extensive protein domain annotations, and an in-depth investigation of encoding genomic contexts, they also provide detailed hypotheses about the biological activity and molecular functions of the members of this class of predicted systems. This work is highly relevant, it underscores the wide diversity of defence systems that are used by prokaryotes and demonstrates that there are still many systems to be discovered. The work is sound and backed-up by a clear and reasonable bioinformatics approach. I do not have any major issues with the manuscript, but only some minor comments.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The analysis provided by the authors is extensive and covers the three most important aspects that can be covered computationally when analysing a new family/superfamily: phylogenetics, genomic context analysis, and protein-structure-based domain content annotation. With this, one can directly have an idea about the superfamily of the predicted system and infer their biological role. The bioinformatics approach is sound and makes use of the most current advances in the fields of protein evolution and structural bioinformatics.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
It is not clear how coiled-coil segments were assigned if only based on AF2-predicted models or also backed by sequence analysis, as no description is provided in the methods. The structure prediction quality assessment is based solely on the average pLDDT of the obtained models (with a threshold of 80 or better). However, this is not enough, particularly when multimeric models are used. The PAE matrix should be used to evaluate relative orientations, particularly in the case where there is a prediction that parts from 2 proteins are interacting. In the case of multimers, interface quality scores, such as the ipTM or pDockQ, should also be considered and, at minimum, reported.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this work, using in-depth computational analysis, Bell et al. explore the diverse repertoire of type IV McrBC modification-dependent restriction systems. The prototypical two-component McrBC system has been structurally and functionally characterised and is known to act as a defence by restricting phage and foreign DNA containing methylated cytosines. Here, the authors find previously unanticipated complexity and versatility of these systems and focus on detailed analysis and classification of a distinct branch, the so-called CoCoNut, named after its composition of coiled-coil structures and tandem nucleases. These CoCoNut systems are predicted to target RNA as well as DNA and to utilise defence mechanisms with some similarity to type III CRISPR-Cas systems.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This work is enriched with a plethora of ideas and a myriad of compelling hypotheses that now await experimental verification. The study comes from the group that was amongst the first to describe, characterize, and classify CRISPR-Cas systems. By analogy, the findings described here can similarly promote ingenious experimental and conceptual research that could further drive technological advances. It could also instigate vigorous scientific debates that will ultimately benefit the community.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The multi-component systems described here function in the context of large oligomeric complexes. Some of the single chain AF2 predictions shown in this work are not compatible, for example, with homohexameric complex formation due to incompatible orientation of domains. The recent advances in protein structure prediction, in particular AlphaFold2 (AF2) multimer, now allow us to confidently probe potential protein-protein interactions and protein complex formation. This predictive power could be exploited here to produce a better glimpse of these multimeric protein systems. It can also provide a more sound explanation for some of the observed differences amongst different McrBC types.</p>
