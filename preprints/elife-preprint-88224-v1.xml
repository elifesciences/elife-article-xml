<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Previous observations showed that chloride and osmotic stress regulate the autophosphorylation and activity of the kinase domains of WNK1 and WNK3. Further, prior crystallography on the asymmetric dimeric of the unphosphorylated WNK1 kinase domain (WNK1/S382A, WNK1/SA) revealed conserved waters in the active site. Here we show by crystallography that PEG400 applied to crystals of dimeric WNK1/SA grown in space group P1 induces de-dimerization with a change in space group to P2<sub>1</sub>. Both the conserved waters, referred to here as conserved water network 1 (CWN1) and the chloride binding site are disrupted by PEG400. CWN1 is surrounded and stabilized by a pan-WNK-conserved cluster of charged residues. Here we mutagenized these charges in WNK3 to probe the importance of the CWN1 to WNK regulation. Two mutations at E314 in the Activation Loop (WNK3/E314Q and WNK3/E314A) enhanced activity, consistent with the idea that the CWN1 is inhibitory. Mutations of other residues in the cluster had similar or less activity than wild-type. PEG400 activation of WNK3 was not significantly reduced in the point mutants tested. The crystallographic and assay data support a role for CWN1 and the charged cluster in stabilizing an inactive configuration of WNKs and suggest that water functions as an allosteric inhibitor of WNKs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><underline>W</underline>ith <underline>N</underline>o <underline>L</underline>ysine (WNK) kinases are soluble intracelluar serine-threonine kinases noted for their unique active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Xu <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>) and their association with familial hyperkalemic hypertension (FHHt) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Wilson <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). Previous data has implicated WNKs as homeostatic regulators of the intracellular milieu with respect to ions and osmotic pressure (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Goldsmith &amp; Rodan, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Richardson &amp; Alessi, 2008</xref>)). WNKs are the chloride-inhibited protein kinases long anticipated from cellular studies to control the activity of cation chloride cotransporters in response to osmotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Lytle &amp; Forbush, 1992</xref>). WNKs are activated by osmotic stress in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Xu <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). We demonstrated that WNKs 1 and 3 are inhibited by chloride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Piala <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>) and are directly activated <italic>in vitro</italic> by osmolytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Akella <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous data has shown that unphosphorylated WNK1 and WNK3 adopt an asymmetric dimer configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Akella <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Min <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>), data acquired either using non-phosphorylatable WNK1/SA, or de-phosphorylated WNK1 and WNK3 kinase domains (uWNK1 and uWNK3, “u” for unphosphorylated). Phosphorylated kinase domains of WNK1 and WNK3 (pWNK1 and pWNK3, “p” for phosphorylated) are monomeric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akella <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>) (PDB files 5W7T and 5O26). Chloride ion is a pan-WNK inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Piala <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Terker <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>) and binds the inactive dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Piala <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). Osmotic pressure was applied using osmolytes to put a demand on solvent in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Kuznetsova <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). Osmolytes induced de-dimerization as observed by SLS and SAXS in both uWNK1 and uWNK3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Akella <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). A model for WNK regulation, then, is the presence of a dimer⇔monomer equilibrium: the dimer is inactive and binds inhibitory ligands; the monomer is autophosphorylation-competent. We described previously that the inactive dimer, counter-intuitively, has more bound water than the monomeric form in bulk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Akella <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). We also identified a large network of water molecules that is independently observed in two WNK1/SA structures (PDB files 6CN9 and 5DRB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Yamada <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>)). Here we refer to this water network as Conserved Water Network 1 (CWN1, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>Here we present crystallographic data that the osmolyte PEG400, when applied to crystals of WNK1/SA, induces de-dimerization (forming monomers) and conformational changes. Comparison of the water structure in the inactive dimer versus the PEG400-induced conformation supports the idea that water is an allosteric ligand binding an inactive WNK configuration, and that an osmolyte-induced demand on solvent favors a structure with less bound water, overall and in water networks.</p>
<p>We further present a mutagenic study. A pan-WNK conserved cluster of charged residues surround and stabilize the water network CWN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Akella <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). This amino acid cluster is between the Activation Loop and Catalytic Loop (referred to here as the AL-CL Cluster). Here we analyze the effect of mutating the AL-CL Cluster on WNK activity and regulation. The mutagenic study was carried out primarily on WNK3, the kinase domain most sensitive to osmotic pressure among WNK kinase domains tested. In this study, we observe both positive and negative effects of mutations on WNK3 activity and regulation.</p>

<title>Conserved Water Networks in WNKs</title>
<p>CWN1 in WNK1/SA, and by extension other unphosphorylated WNKs is a salient feature both in 6CN9 and 5DRB. ProBis-H2O (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Jukic <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>) was used to find water clusters across WNK1 structures, then curated in PyMOL (see Methods). Two water clusters were identified (CWN2 and CWN3) in addition to CWN1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Of the 14 waters that make up CWN1 in PDB file 6CN9, nine are conserved in PDB file 5DRB (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> (5DRB waters are yellow)). 5DRB has two non-identical waters in this region. Another network of waters, CWN2, was found by superimposing the N-terminal domains of 6CN9 and 5DRB. CWN2 is in the subunit interface in 6CN9 which is a lattice contact in 5DRB (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Another set of eight conserved waters (CWN3, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) is present near helix E. These waters are also observed in phosphorylated WNK1 (PDB file 5W7T).</p>

<title>PEG400 disrupts the water networks CWN1 and CWN2 and the chloride binding site</title>
<p>Crystals grown in PEG3350 and potassium formate are similar in structure to the previously reported WNK1/SA, (PDB file 6CN9) exhibiting an asymmetric dimer and the same water clusters as 6CN9. Two different reagents were used for cryoprotection, glycerol and PEG400. Crystallographic data collection parameters and refinement statistics of the two structures are given in Table S1. The structure observed in glycerol-soaked crystals was very similar to the previously determined 6CN9. On the other hand, PEG400-soaked crystals revealed a significantly altered structure (Table S2). PEG400 induced a space group change from P1 to P2<sub>1</sub> (cell constants compared in Table S2) (see Methods). WNK1/SA cryoprotected in glycerol is dimeric. In the presence of PEG400, WNK1/SA monomerizes in the crystal (lattice constants are compared in Table S2). We observed previously that the osmolyte ethylene glycol induces a dimer-to-monomer transition in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Akella <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>)). The change in structure induced by PEG400 is illustrated in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>: the WNK1/SA monomer from WNK1/SA/PEG400 together with the appropriate symmetry mate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) is superimposed with the WNK1/SA dimer (PDB file 6CN9) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> (giving an overall r.m.s.d. of 3.2 Å (Table S2). <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> shows the overlay aligning one subunit to reveal a significant rotation that accompanies the monomer conversion induced by PEG400. Superpositions of monomers show that the PEG400-induced monomer is more similar to the A-chain of PDB 6CN9. The PEG-induced structure exhibits the same similarity to pWNK1 (PDB file 5W7T). <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref> shows the locus of conformational changes across the sequence and compares this with the osmolyte-induced changes in phosphorylated forms of WNK1. As with the effect of the osmolyte sucrose on pWNK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akella <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>), conformational changes occur in the Activation Loop and near helix C and β5.</p>

A prominent change in interactions occur on WNK1/K375 and WNK1/D349 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). PEG400 induces significant losses in the CWN1, with only 5 waters left out of the 14 in CWN1 (electron density of water molecules shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). An active configuration of WNK1, pWNK1 (PDB file 5W7T) has even fewer bound waters (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Apparently, the osmolyte PEG400 affects both the water and chloride binding sites of WNK1/SA. CWN2 is completely lost in PEG400.</p>

<title>Probing the potential role of water networks in osmosensing</title>
<p>We explored the role of CWN1 by mutational analysis of the AL-CL cluster. Pan-WNK conserved residues in the AL-CL Cluster are shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>. Activation Loop residues E388, K381, and K375 of WNK1 interact with Catalytic Loop residues WNK1/D349, K351 and D353 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). WNK1/D349 and WNK1/K351 are pan-kinase catalytic residues. Additional residues in the active site cavity, WNK1/K310, K375, K381, and Y420, contribute to the AL-CL cluster. The AL-CL Cluster is conserved in WNK3 and other WNKs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). WNK1/E388 (WNK3/314) is noteworthy because it is on the Activation Loop that undergoes large conformational changes upon phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akella <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). WNK1/D353 (WNK3/D279N) is noteworthy because it is often glutamate in other protein kinases and involved in substrate recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Manning <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Zheng <italic>et al</italic>, 1993</xref>).</p>

<title>Expression and phosphorylation state of AL-CL cluster mutants</title>
<p>Mutational analysis of the AL-CL Cluster was carried out in WNK3. Residues in the Activation Loop, WNK3/E314 (WNK1/388), and K307 (WNK1/381), and a residue in the catalytic loop, WNK3/D279 (WNK1/D353) were mutated. Additional residues that contribute to the ionic AL-CL cluster, K236, M301 (lysine in WNK1) and Y346 were also mutated. AL-CL Cluster mutants were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, purified and the state of autophosphorylation assessed. Mutant expression levels were variable, but all sufficient to be assayed (Table S3). Activation Loop phosphorylation at WNK3/S308 (WNK1/S382) and WNK3/S304 (WNK1/S378) is necessary for WNK activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Xu <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). Chymotrypsin-derived peptides were monitored by LC-MS to determine Activation Loop phosphorylation state (Table S4). Each of the mutants were at least 95% phosphorylated as expressed, suggestive of proper folding (Table S3). Mutant proteins were dephosphorylated to form uWNKs (see Methods). Basal autophosphorylation activity of AL-CL mutants was measured under standard conditions (Table S5). A range of phenotypes was observed from more active to less active than wild-type WNK3 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> (A-H, purple progress curves)).</p>

<title>WNK3 AL-CL Cluster mutant chloride sensitivity</title>
<p>Chloride ion exhibits large inhibitory effects on WNKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Piala <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). To probe whether AL-CL cluster mutants affect WNK chloride regulation, we measured the chloride inhibition of uWNK3 autophosphorylation. The precise content of the assay buffer is given in Table S5. Assays were run at 4 μM uWNK3. The AL-CL Cluster mutants exhibited three different chloride inhibition phenotypes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>): (1) more autophosphorylation competent and less sensitive to Cl<sup>-</sup>, (2) similar to WT; and (3) less autophosphorylation competent and more sensitive to Cl<sup>-</sup>. The mutants WNK3/E314Q and WNK3/E314A were more active than wild-type and exhibit reduced chloride sensitivity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B, 5C</xref>). WNK3/E314A was assayed at a reduced temperature because of its high activity. Mutation of lysine residues on the periphery of the AL-CL Cluster (K236A and K307A) are little changed from WT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5D, 5E</xref>). K307A has only a small effect, even though it is adjacent to the phosphorylation site at Ser308. Effects of chloride on S304 phosphorylation was also tracked (Figure S1). S304 is typically phosphorylated more slowly than S308. Each of the more active mutant had similar effects on S304 as on S308 (Figure S1).</p>
<p>The mutants WNK3/D279N, M301A and Y314F show related and complex phenotypes. These mutants are less active than WT and much more sensitive to chloride (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5F-H</xref>). S304 is phosphorylated more slowly than S308 for both wild type and mutants. In general, the effects of mutation of different sites on phosphorylation of this peptide mirrored the effects on Ser308 phosphorylation: wtWNK3 and WNK3/E314A the most active, K236A and K307A similar to wild-type, and M301A, Y346F and D279N least active. S304 phosphorylation appears to be more sensitive to chloride than S308 phosphorylation in these less active mutants (Figure S1).</p>

<title>WNK3 AL-CL Cluster mutant osmotic sensitivity</title>
<p>The osmolyte PEG400 was used to put a demand on solvent in vitro as a mimic of osmotic pressure effects in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Kuznetsova <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). We previously observed that PEG400 stimulates ATP consumption by WNK3 in the presence of substrate GST-OSR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Akella <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Unlike the LC-MS method used to study chloride inhibition, ADP-Glo is compatible with PEG400. The high activity mutant WNK3/E314Q, and two less active mutants WNK3/D279N and Y346F were selected for assays (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Osmotic effects on WNKs measured in vitro with osmolytes are generally smaller than the chloride effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Akella <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Piala <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). In this assay, the mutants followed a trend of less activity, with little change in the osmosensitivity. Apparently, none of the single point mutations abolished the osmosensitivity.</p>

<p>The high activity of the mutant WNK3/E314Q and E314A is most easily interpreted as a loss of stability of CWN1-stabilized inhibitory conformation. The lower activity mutants require more data to understand, but all are in the active site, and potentially could affect substrate binding or catalysis.</p>

<title>Static Light Scattering of mutant WNK3</title>
<p>To check whether the mutations effected the oligomeric state, SLS was performed on wt and mutant uWNK3 between 0.8 mg/ml and 2.4 mg/ml at room temperature as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Akella <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>) (Table S6). Based on the 40 kD molecular weight of one subunit of uWNK3, wt uWNK3 is a mixture of monomer and dimer. Two of the mutants behave similar to wild-type including K236A and Y346F. Two other mutants on the Activation Loop are well behaved showing a monomer-dimer mixture at both concentrations (M301A, K307A). Three of the mutants were either aggregated or form higher order oligomers, including E314Q, E314A and D279N. The faster mutants tested at WNK3/E314, despite their enhanced activity, are not monomeric.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>WNKs are activated in cells both by osmotic stress and low chloride. The osmolyte PEG400, which put a demand on solvent, induced de-dimerization of WNK1/SA in crystals and change in space group. The conformational changes take place in parts of the structure that change shape on activation of WNKs. PEG400 eliminates many of the water molecule observed in CWN1 in the inactive dimer, and all of the waters in CWN2. Apparently, the water networks may be considered allosteric ligands that promote the inactive structure of WNKs. PEG400 also eliminates the binding site for chloride, another inhibitory ligand.</p>
<p>We probed the potential role of CWN1 as an allosteric ligand by mutating residues that stabilize it, the AL-CL Cluster. Changes in autophosphorylation activity and chloride sensitivity were observed. Two hyper-active mutants were discovered, WNK3/E314A, and WNK3/E314Q. These mutants are straightforward to interpret based on our model: the mutated residues support and stabilize inactive dimeric WNK. On the other hand, proximity of the AL-CL cluster to the active site probably explains the low activity of the slow mutants. However, only small changes in osmolyte activation were seen. We look forward to future data to determine the effects of disrupting other water networks, making multiple mutations, and data on the mechanism of other osmotic pressure sensors to ascertain the generality of the themes observed here.</p>

<p>This study presents a potentially <bold>valuable</bold> investigation of water coordination in a specific kinase family with a focus on the regulation of osmosensing protein kinases. X-ray crystallographic approaches combined with functional assays are used to address the hypothesis that bound water participates in the osmosensing mechanism as an allosteric kinase inhibitor. Evidence for changes in kinase conformation and space group of the crystal as a function of added low molecular weight polyethylene glycol is <bold>solid</bold>, but there alternative interpretations for much of the other data cannot be excluded and the work thus remains <bold>incomplete</bold>. With stronger evidence and/or alternative explanations explored, the work would be of considerable interest to the kinase field as well as colleagues studying allosteric regulation of protein function.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This manuscript addresses the regulation of the osmosensing protein kinases, WNK1 and WNK3. Prior work by the authors has shown that these enzymes are activated by PEG400 or ethylene glycol and inhibited by chloride ion, and that activation is associated with a conformational transition from dimer to monomer. In X-ray structures of the WNK1/SA inactive dimer, a water-mediated hydrogen bond network was observed between the catalytic loop (CL) and the activation loop (AL), named CWN1. This led to the proposal that bound water may be part of the osmosensing mechanism.</p>
<p>The current study carries this work further, by applying PEG400 to Xtals of dimeric WNK1/SA. This results in a change in kinase conformation and space group, along with 4-9 fewer waters in CWN1 and the complete disappearance of another water cluster (CWN2) located at the dimer interface. Six conserved residues lining the CWN1 pocket in WNK3 are mutated to determine effects on activity and inhibition by chloride ion (measured by AL autophosphorylation) and monomer-dimer interconversion (light scattering).</p>
<p>The results show that two mutants (E314Q/A in WNK3) at a site central to the water cluster result in increased kinase activity (autophosphorylation), and increased SLS, interpreted as aggregation. Three sites (D279A, Y346F, M301A) inhibit kinase activity with varying effects on oligomerization - Y346A and M301A retain monomer-dimer ratios similar to WT while D279N promotes aggregation. K236A and K307A show activity and monomer:dimer ratios similar to WT. Selected mutants (E314Q, D279N, Y346F) and WT appear to retain osmosensitivity with comparable activation by PEG400.</p>
<p>The study concludes that osmolytes may activate the kinase by removing waters from the CWN1 and CWN2 clusters, suggesting that waters might be considered allosteric ligands that promote the inactive structure of WNKs. The differing effects of mutations may be ascribed to disruption of the water networks as well as inhibitory perturbations at the active site.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This study presents a novel and unique function for bound water, and its potential role to explain osmosensory regulation. The mechanism is innovative and the new structures and mutational data presented by the work will be useful for further investigations of the mechanisms that enable cells to respond to osmotic pressure.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Given that all mutants tested showed the same degree of activation by PEG400, it seemed possible that PEG400 might be an allosteric activator of WNK1/3 through direct binding interactions. Perhaps PEG400 eliminates CWN1/2 waters by inducing conformational changes so that water loss is an effect not a cause of activation. To address this it would be helpful to comment on whether new electron densities appeared in the X-ray structure of WNK1/SA/PEG400 that might reflect PEG400 interactions with chains A or B. It would also be helpful to discuss any experiments that might have been done in previous work to examine the direct binding of glycerol and other osmolytes to WNKs.</p>
<p>The study would benefit from a deeper discussion about how to reconcile the different effects of mutations. For example, wouldn't most or all of the mutations be expected to disrupt the water network, and relieve the proposed autoinhibition? This seemed especially true for some of the residues, like Y420(Y346), D353(D279), and K310(K236), which based on Fig 3 appeared to interact with waters that were removed by PEG400.</p>
<p>Alternatively, perhaps the waters in CWN2 are more important for maintaining the autoinhibited structure. This possibility would be useful to discuss, and perhaps comment on what may be known about the energetic contributions of bound water towards stabilizing dimers.</p>
<p>It would also be useful to comment on why aggregation of E319Q/A shouldn't inhibit kinase activity instead of activating it.</p>
<p>The X-ray work was done entirely with WNK1 while the mutational work was done entirely with WNK3. Therefore, a simple explanation for the disconnect between structure and mutations might be that WNK1 and WNK3 differ enough that predictions from the structure of one are not applicable to mutations of the other. It would be helpful to describe past work comparing the structure and regulation of WNK1 and WNK3 that support the assumption of their interchangeability.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This work tests the hypothesis that water coordination in WNK kinases is linked to allosteric control of activity. It is proposed that dimeric WNK is inactive and bound to some conserved water molecules, and that monomerization/activation involves departure of these waters. New data here include a crystal structure of monomeric WNK1 which shows missing waters compared to the dimeric structure, in support of the hypothesis. Mutant proteins of a different isozyme (WNK3) designed to disrupt water coordination were produced, and activity and quaternary structure were measured. The results with WNK3 do not clearly support or refute the hypothesis as there is no systematic correlation between mutations designed to disrupt water coordination and activity or quaternary structure.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The most interesting result presented here is that P1 crystals of WNK1 convert to P21 in the presence of PEG400 and still diffract (rather than being destroyed as the crystal contacts change, as one would expect). All of the assays for activity and osmolyte sensing are carried out well.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The rationale for using WNK3 for the mutagenesis study is that it is more sensitive to osmotic pressure than WNK1. I think that WNK1 would have been a better platform because of the direct correlation to the structural work leading to the hypothesis being tested. All of the crystallographic work is WNK1; it is not logical to jump to WNK3 without other practical considerations.</p>
<p>Osmolyte sensing was tested by measuring ATP consumption as a function of PEG400 (Figure 6). Data for the subset of mutants analyzed by this assay showed increasing activity. It is not clear why the same collection of mutant proteins analyzed in the experiments of Figure 5 was not also measured for osmolyte sensing in Figure 6.</p>
<p>The last set of data presented uses light scattering to test whether the WNK3 mutant proteins exhibit quaternary structural changes consistent with the monomer/dimer hypothesis. If they did, one would expect a higher degree of monomer for those that are activated by mutation, and a lower amount of monomer (like wt) for those that are not. Instead, one of the mutant proteins that showed the most chloride inhibition (Y346F) had a quaternary structure similar to the wt protein, and others have similar monomer/dimer mixtures but distinct chloride inhibition profiles (K307A and M301A). I don't see how the light scattering data contribute to this story other than to refute the hypothesis by showing a lack of correlation between quaternary structure, water binding, and activity. This is another reason why the disconnect between WNK1 and WNK3 could be a problem. All of the detailed structural work with WNK1 must be assumed with WNK3; perhaps the light scattering data are contradicting this assumption?</p>
