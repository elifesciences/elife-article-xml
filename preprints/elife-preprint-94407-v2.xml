<title>Summary</title><p>MYC family oncoproteins regulate the expression of a large number of genes and broadly stimulate elongation by RNA polymerase II. While the factors that control the chromatin association of MYC proteins are well understood, much less is known about how interacting proteins mediate MYC’s effects on transcription. Here we show that TFIIIC, an architectural protein complex that controls the three-dimensional chromatin organization at its target sites, binds directly to the amino-terminal transcriptional regulatory domain of MYCN. Surprisingly, TFIIIC has no discernible role in MYCN-dependent gene expression and transcription elongation. Instead, MYCN and TFIIIC preferentially bind to promoters with paused RNAPII and globally limit the accumulation of non-phosphorylated RNAPII at promoters. Consistent with its ubiquitous role in transcription, MYCN broadly participates in hubs of active promoters. Depletion of TFIIIC further increases MYCN localization to these hubs. This increase correlates with a failure of the nuclear exosome and BRCA1, both of which are involved in nascent RNA degradation, to localize to active promoters. Our data suggest that MYCN and TFIIIC exert an censoring function in early transcription that limits promoter accumulation of inactive RNAPII and facilitates promoter-proximal degradation of nascent RNA.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The MYC family of proto-oncogenes is at the epicenter of cellular regulatory networks that govern cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dang, 2012</xref>, Kress, Sabo et al., 2015). The three MYC paralogs (MYC, MYCN, and MYCL) are central players in normal development and tissue homeostasis, and when dysregulated, fuel many of the processes that are hallmarks of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17a">Dhanasekaran, Deutzmann et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hanahan, 2022</xref>). Among them, MYCN has attracted attention for its causal role in the development of neuroblastoma and other childhood tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Rickman, Schulte et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Both MYC and MYCN bind to virtually all active promotors and profoundly alter the dynamics of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription, with an increase in pause release and elongation being most apparent (Herold, Kalb et al., 2019, Walz, Lorenzin et al., 2014). One consequence of these changes are alterations in expression of a broad range of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dhanasekaran, Hansen et al., 2023</xref>). Unrelated to those changes in gene expression, MYC and MYCN also control RNAPII function to limit the accumulation of R-loops, to facilitate promoter-proximal double-strand break repair and to co-ordinate transcription elongation with DNA replication (Papadopoulos, Uhl et al., 2023). Which of these effects are critical for the oncogenic functions of MYC is an open question and consequently the partner proteins via which MYC proteins alter RNAPII dynamics are under intense investigation (Baluapuri, Hofstetter et al., 2019, Baluapuri, Wolf et al., 2020, Buchel, Carstensen et al., 2017, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Das, Lewis et al., 2022</xref>, Heidelberger, Voigt et al., 2018, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kalkat, Resetca et al., 2018</xref>, Lourenco, Resetca et al., 2021, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Oksuz, Henninger et al., 2023</xref>). Direct interactions of MYC and MYCN with MAX, WDR5 and MIZ1 control the localization of MYC on chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Blackwood &amp; Eisenman, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blackwood, Lüscher et al., 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Thomas, Wang et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Vo, Wolf et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Walz et al., 2014</xref>). MYC-dependent effects on RNAPII elongation involves the transfer of elongation factors SPT5 and PAF1c from MYC onto RNAPII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Baluapuri et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Endres, Solvie et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Jaenicke, von Eyss et al., 2016</xref>). Both MYC and MYCN also interact with and activate topoisomerases I and II, suggesting that MYC/N-dependent pause release also involves the relieve of torsional stress that builds up during early transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Das, Kuzin et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Intriguingly, both MYC and MYCN form prominent complexes with TFIIIC and mapping experiments for MYCN show that the amino terminal transcription-regulatory domain is required for the interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Buchel et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Heidelberger et al., 2018</xref>). TFIIIC was first identified as a general transcription factor for RNA polymerase III (RNAPIII) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Orioli, Pascali et al., 2012</xref>). Surprisingly, TFIIIC also binds to thousands of genomic sites that are not shared with RNAPIII and are called <underline>e</underline>xtra <underline>T</underline>FIII<underline>C</underline> (ETC) sites (Noma, Cam et al., 2006). Many ETC sites localize to RNAPII-transcribed promoters and such sites are often juxtaposed to MYCN binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Buchel et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Moqtaderi, Wang et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Noma et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Oler, Alla et al., 2010</xref>). TFIIIC is an architectural protein that can affect the three-dimensional chromatin organization at its binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Noma et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Van Bortle &amp; Corces, 2013</xref>). Functionally TFIIIC can act as insulator that blocks the spread of chromatin states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Raab, Chiu et al., 2012</xref>), affect cohesin loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Buchel et al., 2017</xref>), and bind at the borders of topologically <underline>a</underline>ssociating <underline>d</underline>omains (TADs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Van Bortle, Nichols et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Intriguingly, TFIIIC compartmentalizes RNAPII promoters and gene expression. Specifically, the effects of TFIIIC on the expression of E2F-dependent and neuronal genes correlate with its effects on the three-dimensional chromatin architecture. In the case of neuronal genes, TFIIIC prevents the localization of activity-dependent genes to sites of active transcription before stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Crepaldi, Policarpi et al., 2013</xref>, Ferrari, de Llobet Cucalon et al., 2020, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Policarpi, Crepaldi et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, TFIIIC together with the <underline>a</underline>ctivity-<underline>d</underline>ependent <underline>n</underline>euro<underline>p</underline>rotector homeobox protein (ADNP) controls the three-dimensional architecture of cell cycle genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ferrari et al., 2020</xref>). Our previous experiments had suggested that TFIIIC may have a role in MYCN-dependent control of RNAPII function and we here show that MYCN and TFIIIC together have an unexpected censoring function that excludes non-functional RNAPII from hubs of active promoters.</p>

<title>TFIIIC interacts directly with the amino-terminus of MYCN</title>
<p>TFIIIC is present in MYCN immunoprecipitates and the amino terminal region of recombinant MYCN binds to TFIIIC in pull-down experiments performed with cell lysates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Buchel et al., 2017</xref>). To test whether MYCN and TFIIIC interact directly, we expressed the six subunits of TFIIIC together with a FLAG-tagged MYCN construct comprising amino acids 2-137 using a recombinant baculovirus to infect insect cells. Performing pulldown experiments with cell lysates and immobilized FLAG-tagged MYCN, we recovered all six subunits of the TFIIIC complex in the eluate along with the FLAG-tagged MYCN construct, demonstrating that TFIIIC can bind to the amino terminal region of MYCN (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). TFIIIC is composed of two subcomplexes, designated TauA (1A) and TauB (1B), each comprising three of the six subunits. We first attempted co-expression of FLAG-MYCN with individual subcomplexes, but the 1B complex was too unstable to be isolated, and so we focused on the stable 1A complex. To test whether MYCN binds directly to 1A, we purified MYCN and the 1A complex separately (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>, B) and then mixed the purified preparations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-D</xref>). In gel filtration experiments, the isolated MYCN protein eluted with a molecular weight of around 50 kDa, whereas a fraction of MYCN eluted with a much larger molecular weight together with the 1A complex when both were mixed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-D</xref>). Native-mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Tamara, den Boer et al., 2022</xref>) showed the molecular weight of this complex to be 204.7 kDa, very close to the sum of the molecular weights of a 1:1:1:1 complex (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1C</xref>, D). We concluded that the MYCN amino terminal region and the 1A subcomplex of TFIIIC form a stable complex with each other in solution.</p>

<p>As described in the introduction, TFIIIC is both a general transcription factor for RNAPIII and has been implicated in regulation of RNAPII-dependent transcription. To test whether TFIIIC is required for the proliferation of neuroblastoma cells, we individually depleted three of its subunits, TFIIIC2, TFIIIC3 and TFIIIC5, by stable expression of doxycycline-inducible shRNAs. Controls confirmed that each shRNA efficiently depleted its target protein (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1E</xref>). To test both for a general requirement of each subunit in neuroblastoma cell proliferation and for MYCN-specific effects, we expressed each shRNA in SH-EP-MYCN-ER cell. SH-EP cells express endogenous MYC and are engineered to stably express a MYCN-ER chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Herold et al., 2019</xref>). Activation of the MYCN-ER by addition of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) suppresses the expression of endogenous MYC (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1F</xref>), in effect causing a switch from MYC to MYCN expression. Under control conditions, depletion of TFIIIC2 or TFIIIC3 attenuated proliferation, whereas depletion of the small TFIIIC5 subunit had little effect. Addition of 4-OHT had little effect by itself, but greatly enhanced the inhibitory effect of depletion of each subunit (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>), suggesting that TFIIIC has both general and MYCN-specific roles in neuroblastoma cell proliferation.</p>

<title>TFIIIC limits promoter binding of non-phosphorylated RNAPII in MYCN-expressing cells</title>
<p>The proximity of TFIIIC binding sites to MYCN binding sites at many promoters transcribed by RNAPII prompted us to explore the role of TFIIIC in MYCN-driven transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Buchel et al., 2017</xref>). Using an antibody that detects total RNAPII, we had previously shown that activation of MYCN in SH-EP-MYCN-ER cells impacts RNAPII in two ways: First, MYCN promotes pause release and MYCŃs effect on elongation correlates with its effects on gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Herold et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Rahl, Lin et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Walz et al., 2014</xref>). At the same time, activation of MYCN uniformly reduces RNAPII occupancy at all active promoters; this correlates with a reduced accumulation of promoter-proximal R-loops, suggesting that MYCN limits the accumulation of RNAPII at promoters that is impaired in productive elongation and/or splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Herold et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous experiments using antibodies directed against total RNAPII had yielded results that varied among different antibodies ( (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Buchel et al., 2017</xref>) and RV, unpublished). To directly compare the effects of MYCN and TFIIIC on promoter-bound RNAPII with those on elongating RNAPII in a side-by-side manner, we conducted parallel ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses using antibodies that specifically recognize non-phosphorylated and Ser2-phosphorylated (pSer2) RNAPII, respectively. Visual inspection of multiple individual genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) and global analyses (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B,C</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A</xref>,B) showed that activation of MYCN caused a global decrease in promoter association of non-phosphorylated RNAPII. A control ChIP-seq experiment established that addition of 4-OHT had no such effect in SH-EP cells that do not express a MYCN-ER chimera, demonstrating that the reduction is due to activation of MYCN (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2C</xref>). At the same time, MYCN promoted an increase in transcription elongation as best documented by pSer2-RNAPII occupancy at the transcription end site (TES) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref>, C). This increase was most pronounced on MYCN-activated genes. Comparison with RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data showed that it correlated closely with MYCN-dependent changes in gene expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Depletion of TFIIIC5 abrogated the MYCN-dependent decrease in chromatin association of non-phosphorylated RNAPII but had no effect on MYCN-dependent changes in transcription elongation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-C</xref>). In many experimental systems, MYC and MYCN effects on elongation parallel closely with the corresponding changes in gene expression. Consistent with these observations, RNA-seq showed that neither depletion of TFIIIC3 nor of TFIIIC5 had significant effects on either basal gene expression or MYCN-dependent changes in steady-state mRNA levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2E</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2D</xref>). Finally, we aimed to understand whether the localization of TFIIIC and MYCN at promoters is linked to the dynamics of RNAPII at promoters and performed ChIP-seq of TFIIIC5 in SH-EP-MYCN-ER cells in the presence of 5,6-Dichlorobenzimidazole-1-β-D-ribofuranoside (DRB), which stabilizes paused RNAPII and prevents pause-release of RNAPII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mancebo, Lee et al., 1997</xref>). Inspection of individual genes (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2E</xref>) and average density plots of all active promoters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>) showed that activation of MYCN globally enhanced TFIIIC5 association with regions surrounding active transcription start sites, consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Buchel et al., 2017</xref>). Addition of DRB increased TFIIIC5 association with active promoters and the combination of MYCN activation and DRB had a strong additive effect, arguing that MYCN preferentially recruits TFIIIC5 to promoters with paused RNAPII.</p>

<title>MYCN takes part in three-dimensional networks of active promoters</title>
<p>The effects of TFIIIC on the expression of E2F-dependent and neuronal genes correlate with its effects on the three-dimensional chromatin architecture (see Introduction). This raised the possibility that complex formation of TFIIIC similarly affects three-dimensional chromatin interactions of MYCN. To test this hypothesis, we used <underline>p</underline>hosphorylated linker HiChIP (pLHiChIP), a modification of the HiChIP protocol, which identifies pairs of DNA loci that are brought into close spatial proximity to a specific protein (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A</xref>) (Mumbach, Rubin et al., 2016). We initially performed pLHiChIP for MYCN in SH-EP-MYCN-ER neuroblastoma cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). ChIP experiments measuring the occupancy of multiple promoters bound by both MYCN and MYC showed that the chromatin association of MYCN is much greater than that of MYC, allowing analysis of MYCN function on chromatin with little interference from MYC (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B</xref>). Visual inspection of the MYCN pLHiChIP showed that thousands of pairs of MYCN binding sites are in close spatial proximity with each other (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Appropriate quality controls established the validity of these results: For example, the Hi-C module of pLHiChIP protocol yielded a high percentage of valid interactions pairs (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3C</xref>, D). Relative to the Hi-C input, the MYCN HiChIP is strongly enriched for interactions that connected two MYCN-binding sites with each other, confirming the specificity of the signal (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3E</xref>).</p>

<p>The pLHiChIP data analysis revealed a total of 4,591 distinct binary interactions involving MYCN (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). To facilitate a comprehensive functional analysis of MYCN anchor sites, we performed ChIP-seq for RNAPII from SH-EP-MYCN-ER cells and integrated the HiChIP data with these data (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), along with other relevant annotations, such as SINE elements. Remarkably, our analysis revealed that 1,277 out of the 4,591 MYCN anchors (28%) were positioned on RNAPII promoters (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, 864 out of the 4,591 MYCN interactions (19%) exhibited connections between promoters and either exonic or intronic sequences, consistent with previous observations showing that MYCN binding sites are often located within transcribed regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Buchel et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, MYCN interactions were observed between promoters and SINE repetitive elements (647/4,591; 14%) including interactions with tRNAs (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3F</xref>). These connections are likely shared with TFIIIC (see below). We also observed interactions between promoters or gene bodies and enhancers, accounting for 453 out of the 4,591 interactions (10%).</p>
<p>We used the RNAPII and published MYCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Herold et al., 2019</xref>) ChIP-seq data as well as sequencing datasets of mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Buchel et al., 2017</xref>) and nascent (4sU-labeled) (Papadopoulos, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Solvie et al., 2022</xref>) RNA to identify the specific properties of promoters within three-dimensional MYCN interactions. This showed that significantly more MYCN and RNAPII bound to promoters that participated in such interactions and that these promoters were more active than MYCN-bound promoters without such interactions, although the latter difference was small (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). We next used the binary interactions as a starting point to reconstruct interaction networks. This showed that MYCN participated in three-dimensional promoter hubs of different sizes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>), with the largest connecting up to 34 promoters and 10 enhancers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). This number of promoters is consistent with published estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Palacio &amp; Taatjes, 2022</xref>). Functional annotation of the promoters that are contained in these large hubs showed that they are highly enriched in genes encoding ribosomal proteins and ribosome biogenesis genes transcribed by RNAPII (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3G</xref>). We concluded from the data that MYCN participates in three-dimensional hubs of highly active promoters; we will use the term “promoter hubs” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lim &amp; Levine, 2021</xref>) for these structures.</p>

<title>Binding to TFIIIC antagonizes MYCN localization in promoter hubs</title>
<p>To determine whether TFIIIC participates in three-dimensional chromatin structures, we performed pLHiChIP using a previously validated antibody against TFIIIC5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Buchel et al., 2017</xref>). In these experiments, thousands of pairs of TFIIIC binding sites yielded a robust signal, demonstrating that they are in close spatial proximity with each other (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Specifically, these analyses identified a total of 3,499 binary non-contiguous interactions for TFIIIC. Comparison to RNAPII ChIP-seq data showed that 31% of these interactions connected a promoter or the gene body of an RNAPII-transcribed gene to a SINE repetitive element (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Importantly, 1,107 out of 4,591 MYCN interactions shared one (1,075) or both (32) anchors with TFIIIC-containing interactions arguing that both proteins participate in common hubs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). This is consistent with our previous data, which showed that many promoters contain a TFIIIC-bound site close to a MYCN-bound E-box element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Buchel et al., 2017</xref>). A significant percentage of the interactions that are shared between MYCN and TFIIIC contained an E-box in one anchor and A- or B-boxes, which are bound by TFIIIC, in the other anchor sequence, arguing that MYCN and TFIIIC can participate in the same interactions (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A</xref>). Most interactions that are shared by MYCN and TFIIIC connected promoters to other promoters, to gene bodies or to SINE elements. Conversely, TFIIIC5 anchors without overlapping MYCN loops (“TFIIIC5 only”) did not show an enrichment for promoter interactions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). We concluded that both MYCN and TFIIIC5 are present in promoter hubs. To determine how TFIIIC affects MYCN involvement in promoter hubs, we used SH-EP-MYCN-ER neuroblastoma cells that express a Dox-inducible shRNA targeting <italic>TFIIIC5</italic> (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1E</xref>) and performed <underline>s</underline>pike-in <underline>p</underline>hosphorylated linker HiChIP (spLHiChIP), a spike-in variation of pLHiChIP that allows quantitative comparisons between different samples. These experiments showed that depletion of TFIIIC5 strongly increased the number of chromatin interactions of MYCN, arguing that association with TFIIIC antagonizes MYCN participation in promoter hubs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>, F and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4B</xref>). HiChIP experiments performed for TFIIIC5 showed that expression of MYCN moderately and blockade of pause release by DRB strongly decreased the frequency of three-dimensional interactions of TFIIIC5 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4G</xref>, H). Stratification showed that interactions of TFIIIC5 with promoters, gene bodies and SINE elements were all decreased upon incubation of cells with DRB (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4C</xref>), arguing that MYCN/TFIIIC5-bound genes are not part of three-dimensional promoter hubs.</p>

<title>TFIIIC is required for promoter association of factors involved in nascent RNA degradation</title>
<p>Depletion of TFIIIC led to the accumulation of non-phosphorylated RNAPII and an enhanced presence of MYCN in promoter hubs, suggesting that lack of TFIIIC might lead to enhanced or uncontrolled functionality of RNAPII. To ascertain whether TFIIIC is required for functionality of elongating RNAPII, we first performed an rMATS analysis, which analyzes changes in splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Shen, Park et al., 2014b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Wang, Pan et al., 2017</xref>). This showed that depletion of TFIIIC3 caused significant increases in intron retention and exon skipping, evidence of aberrant splicing (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5A</xref>, B). However, most of these alterations occurred in downstream exons, and were not observed for TFIIIC5. Furthermore, expression of MYCN weakened this effect for TFIIIC3 (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5A</xref>, B), arguing that it does account for the requirement for TFIIIC function in MYCN-expressing cells.</p>
<p>To explore promoter-proximal events, we made use of the fact that many of the factors that determine premature termination and degradation of nascent RNA have recently been elucidated and initially used PLA assays to survey a series of factors involved in premature termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Rodriguez-Molina, West et al., 2023</xref>). Appropriate controls using immunofluorescence and PLA assays with single antibodies established the specificity of each assay (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5C</xref>). Consistent with the ChIP-seq data, activation of MYCN enhanced the proximity between TFIIIC5 and total RNAPII and depletion of TFIIIC5 reduced the signal, confirming the specificity of the assay (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5D</xref>). Activation of MYCN and depletion of TFIIIC5 had only weak effects on the proximity of RNAPII with NELFE, which associates with pausing RNAPII. Similarly, depletion of TFIIIC5 either alone or in combination with MYCN activation enhanced the proximity of RNAPII with PP2A, which is recruited to promoters via its interaction with the integrator termination complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cossa, Parua et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Vervoort, Welsh et al., 2021</xref>), and with PNUTS, a targeting subunit of PP1 that is globally involved in termination (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cortazar, Sheridan et al., 2019</xref>, Estell, Davidson et al., 2023, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Landsverk, Sandquist et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

<p>Key factors in degradation of aberrant nascent RNAs include XRN2, a 5’-3’ RNA exonuclease, and the exosome, a 3’-5’ exonuclease RNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cortazar, Erickson et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gerlach, Garland et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Noe Gonzalez, Blears et al., 2021</xref>). We have previously shown that MYCN can recruit the nuclear exosome to its target promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Papadopoulos et al., 2022</xref>). MYCN can also recruit BRCA1, which in turn stimulates binding of the mRNA decapping enzyme DCP1 that initiates RNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Herold et al., 2019</xref>). No significant effects were observed in the proximity between RNAPII with the XRN2 exonuclease (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). In contrast, CUT&amp;RUN experiments using antibodies directed EXOSC5, a core structural subunit of the exosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kilchert, Wittmann et al., 2016</xref>), showed that depletion of TFIIIC5 strongly decreased the association of EXOSC5 with regions around the TSS, both in control and in MYCN-expressing cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). To test whether MYCN-dependent recruitment of BRCA1 depends on TFIIIC, we performed ChIP experiments at multiple MYCN-bound promoters (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5E</xref>). Consistent with our previous observations, only low amount of BRCA1 were found at core promoter in SH-EP cells and that induction of MYCN recruited BRCA1 to all tested promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Herold et al., 2019</xref>). Depletion of TFIIIC5 had variable effects on the presence of BRCA1 by itself, but abrogated BRCA1 recruitment by MYCN at all promoters tested (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5E</xref>), demonstrating that TFIIIC5 is required for MYCN-dependent recruitment of BRCA1 to multiple target sites. Collectively, the data show that TFIIIC is required for association of the nuclear exosome and of BRCA1 with active promoters and that these effects are enhanced in cells expressing MYCN, arguing that they can account for the enhanced dependence of MYCN expressing cells on TFIIIC.

The precise mechanisms by which MYCN and TFIIIC limit accumulation of non-phosphorylated RNAPII at promoters remain to be determined.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>One of the most puzzling aspects of MYC biology is the apparent discrepancy between the global association of MYC and MYCN oncoproteins with open chromatin, which includes virtually all active promoters, particularly in tumor cells, and their much more restricted and often weak effects on the expression of downstream target genes. Most MYC/N binding sites on chromatin do not appear to be functional with respect to gene expression and transcriptional elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kress et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Sabo, Kress et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Walz et al., 2014</xref>). This raises the possibility that such binding sites are indeed non-functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Pellanda, Dalsass et al., 2021</xref>). Alternatively, MYCN has functions in transcription that go beyond gene regulation. In support of the later model, we and others have uncovered critical roles of MYC and MYCN in maintaining the genomic stability of tumor cells, for example, by coordinating transcription with DNA replication and by enabling promoter-proximal double-strand break repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baluapuri et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Papadopoulos et al., 2023</xref>). This raises the question of which direct interaction partners of MYC and MYCN mediate these effects and what the underlying mechanisms are. Here we show that TFIIIC binds directly to the amino-terminus of MYCN, and that a MYCN/TFIIIC complex globally limits the accumulation of non-phosphorylated RNAPII at promoters.</p>
<p>Several mechanisms can account for these observations: First, the amino-terminus of MYC proteins is a transcription-activating domain that can interact with cyclin T1 and CDK8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Eberhardy &amp; Farnham, 2002</xref>) and potentially other co-activators, hence TFIIIC may block MYCN interaction with co-activators that recruit RNAPII to promoters. Since MYCN/TFIIIC also restricts RNAPII accumulation at promoters that are not activated by MYCN, this is unlikely to be the sole mode of action. Second, MYCN and TFIIIC binding sites are often downstream of the transcription start sites and the three-dimensional structures formed by MYCN and TFIIIC may sterically restrict elongation and favour termination of non-phosphorylated RNAPII. Third, TFIIIC is an architectural protein complex and re-localization of promoters may be central to the mechanism of MYCN/TFIIIC action. Active promoters coalesce at a discrete number of sites in the eucaryotic nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lim &amp; Levine, 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Palacio &amp; Taatjes, 2022</xref>). Many of the factors involved in basal transcription undergo liquid-liquid phase separation, arguing that transcription initiation takes place in condensate-like structures established by transcription-regulatory domains and by RNAPII itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hnisz, Shrinivas et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lewis, Das et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lu, Yu et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with their ubiquitous role in transcription, MYC proteins form condensates by themselves and enter condensates formed by the RNAPII-associated mediator complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Boija, Klein et al., 2018</xref>, Solvie, Baluapuri et al., 2022, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Yang, Chung et al., 2022</xref>). As described in the introduction, TFIIIC can restrict the localization of genes to sites of active transcription. We show here that MYCN/TFIIIC complexes, in contrast to MYCN, are not part of hubs of active promoters, leading us to propose that TFIIIC antagonizes MYCN participation in promoter hubs and limits the accumulation of paused or stalled RNAPII at promoters (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Since TFIIIC competes with the Aurora-A kinase for binding of MYCN and Aurora-A in turn promotes elongation by RNAPII, we propose that the competition between both complexes enables transcriptional elongation on promoters that are activated by MYCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Buchel et al., 2017</xref>, Roeschert, Poon et al., 2021).</p>
<p>As described above, depletion of TFIIIC has no discernible role in elongation and changes in polyA+ mRNA levels, raising the question of what the function of the association might be. The fate of nascent RNA is controlled by several interrelated processes leading to splicing and polyadenylation of the full-length transcript on the one hand, and mis-splicing, premature termination and RNA degradation on the other and MYCN has been implicated in both processes (Noe Gonzalez et al., 2021, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Papadopoulos et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Schmid &amp; Jensen, 2019</xref>). Depletion of TFIIIC strongly decreased the association of the nuclear exosome, an RNA exonuclease complex that degrades multiple forms of aberrant nascent RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Schmid &amp; Jensen, 2019</xref>), and of BRCA1, which in turn recruits the mRNA decapping enzyme DCP1 at promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Herold et al., 2019</xref>). The association of both the exosome and BRCA1 with promoters were enhanced in MYCN expressing cells, arguing that they are likely to reflect - at least in part - the activity of the TFIIIC/MYCN complex. At the same time, TFIIIC3 depletion caused splicing errors, which occurred predominantly in downstream exons and were independent of MYCN, arguing that the effect on splicing may reflect an activity of TFIIIC that is independent of its function at promoters. We propose that the TFIIIC/MYCN complex formation exerts a censoring and quality control function for RNAPII at promoters that have not received a full complement of activating signals and hypothesize that this contributes to focus the transcription machinery and metabolic resources on the genes that drive the growth of MYCN-driven tumors.</p>

<title>Transfection and lentiviral infection</title>
<p>For lentivirus production, HEK293TN (CVCL_UL49) cells were transfected using PEI (Polyethyleneimine, Sigma-Aldrich). Lentiviruses expressing a shRNA targeting <italic>GTFIIIC5</italic> (targeting sequence #1: AAGCGCAGCACCTACAACTACA, #2: TTGATAAATCTTGGCATCTGGG) were produced by transfection of pINDUCER11 (Sequence #1) and pLT3GEPIR (Sequence #2) plasmid together with the packaging plasmid psPAX.2 and the envelope plasmid pMD2.G into HEK293TN cells. Virus-containing supernatant was harvested 24 h and 48 h after transfection. SH-EP-MYCN-ER cells were infected with lentiviral supernatants in the presence of 4 µg/ml polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 h. Cells were sorted for GFP and RFP expression. shRNA expression was stimulated by addition of doxycycline (1 µg/ml) for 12 h and cells were FACS-sorted for RFP-GFP double-positive cells. Lentiviruses expressing a shRNA targeting <italic>GTFIIIC2 or GTFIIIC3</italic> (targeting sequence <italic>GTFIIIC2:</italic> TGAAGCAGAAGAATGGTCTGGA<italic>, GTFIIIC3:</italic> TTCATCATTTTCTTGGTTTCAC) were produced by transfection of and pLT3GEPIR plasmid together with the packaging plasmid psPAX.2 and the envelope plasmid pMD2.G into HEK293TN cells. After harvesting supernatant and infection SH-EP-MYCN-ER cells were selected using puromycin and sorted for GFP expression.</p>
<p>For experiments, cells were harvested 48 h after induction with doxycycline (1 µg/ml) or ethanol as control. For induction of the MYCN chimera cells were treated with 4-OHT (200 nM, 4 h) as indicated.</p>

<title>Constructs</title>
<p>All constructs were cloned from human cDNA, or subcloned from plasmids containing specific human cDNA sequences. All TFIIIC subunit containing complexes (TFIIIC/3xFLAG-MYCN; 1A/3xFLAG-MYCN; 1A) were expressed using the MultiBac system. For 1A/3xFLAG-MYCN, TFIIIC3, TFIIIC5, Strep-TFIIIC6, and 3xFLAG-MYCN aa 2-137, were cloned into pACEBAC1, pIDC, pIDK, and pIDS respectively. These were sequentially assembled into a single vector using Cre-Lox recombination. For the TFIIIC/3xFLAG MYCN complex, 10xHis-TFIIIC1, TFIIIC3, TFIIIC5, TFIIIC6, and 3xFLAG MYCN aa 2-137 were all cloned into pACEBAC1. A single pACEBAC1 vector containing all of these inserts was generated by repetitive sub-cloning of the subunits. The acceptor pACEBAC1 was opened using I-CeuI and SpeI. The region of interest was removed from the donor pACEBAC1 clone using I-CeuI and AvrII. The region of interest was then ligated into the acceptor pACEBAC1. An internal AvrII site had to be silently removed from TFIIIC3 by site directed mutagenesis prior to sub-cloning. The pACEBAC1 with these five members was then used in successive Cre-Lox recombination reactions with pIDK TFIIIC4 and then pIDC TFIIIC2 in order to generate a construct with all seven members of the complex. For the 1A complex 6xhis-TEV-TFIIIC3 was cloned into pACEBAC1. This was Cre-loxed with pIDK Strep-TFIIIC6, and pIDC TFIIIC5. MultiBac constructs were validated by restriction enzyme digest and sequencing. Post assembly, constructs containing multiple subunits were validated by analytical PCR and restriction enzyme digest.</p>

<title>Protein expression and purification</title>
<p>For <italic>Sf</italic>9 expression, bacmid DNA was generated by transformation of expression vectors into <italic>E. coli</italic> DH10MultiBac cells. Purified bacmid DNA (1.6 – 8.3 µg) was transfected into a monolayer of <italic>Sf</italic>9 cells, in a T25 flask, using X-tremeGENE™ HP DNA Transfection Reagent (Roche). After 7 days at 28 °C the P1 virus stock was collected. 1 ml of P1 virus was used to infect 300 ml of <italic>Sf</italic>9 cells at a density of 2 x10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml. The infected cells were grown for 72 h at 120 rpm and 27 °C prior to harvesting by centrifugation at 1,000 xg for 10 min. The supernatant was used to infect large scale cultures of <italic>Sf</italic>9 cells. 100 ml of virus stock was used per litre of <italic>Sf</italic>9 cells at a density of 1.5 x10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml. These were harvested after 48 h. <italic>E.coli</italic> expression was performed using BL21(DE3)RIL cells. 10 ml from overnight cultures were used to seed each Litre of LB media (supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 35 μg/ml chloramphenical). The cells were grown at 37 °C and 220 rpm until mid log phase (∼0.6 OD<sub>600</sub>) whereupon expression was induced using 0.6 mM final isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Cells were grown overnight at 20 °C, and were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 xg for 15 minutes. Cell pellets were stored at -80 °C prior to purification.</p>
<p>For the purification of TFIIIC/3xFLAG-MYCN and 1A/3xFLAG-MYCN complexes <italic>Sf</italic>9 pellets were resuspended in a lysis buffer (25 mM Tris pH8, 200 mM NaCl, EDTA free cOmplete PI (Roche), 10 µg/ml DNAseI) then lysed by sonication. Lysate was clarified at 40,000 xg for 20 min. Clarified lysate was applied to 2 ml bed volume Anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel (Sigma-Aldrich). The slurry was rotated in the cold room for two hours prior to application to a gravity flow column. Flow was collected and resin washed as follows. For the TFIIIC/3xFLAG-MYCN complex the resin was washed with 40 ml of wash buffer (25 mM Tris pH8, 200 mM NaCl) in four 10 ml batches. For the 1A/3xFLAG-MYCN complex the resin was washed with two 10 ml batches of wash buffer, followed by 10 ml of wash buffer with a final NaCl concentration of 350 mM, followed by 10 ml of wash buffer with a final NaCl concentration of 400 mM. The resin was finally washed with 10 ml of wash buffer. In both cases the protein was eluted by addition of 17.5 ml wash buffer spiked with a final concentration of 0.25 mg/ml 3xFLAG peptide. For the 1A/3XFLAG-MYCN complex the eluate fractions were spiked with 2 mM final β-mercaptoethanol and then concentrated to less than 1 ml with a Vivaspin 6 10 kDa MWCO centrifugal concentrator. Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) was performed using a Superose 6 10/300 GL column attached to an ÄKTA pure FPLC system (Cytiva). The SEC buffer (25 mM Tris pH8, 200 mM NaCl, 3 mM DTT) was flowed over the column at 0.3 ml/min and fractions collected every 0.25 ml over the peaks. In order to do an MYCN alone SEC run, the MYCN peak fractions from several SEC runs of the complex were combined and re-concentrated down to 300 µl. This was then run as previous. For all purified proteins, protein concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm. Unless otherwise stated proteins were aliquoted, flash frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub> and stored at -80 °C prior to use.</p>
<p>For the purification of 1A alone, <italic>Sf</italic>9 pellets were resuspended in a base buffer (25 mM Tris pH 7.4, 2.7 mM KCl, 287 mM NaCl, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml DNase I, and 1 EDTA free cOmplete PI (Roche) tablet per 30 ml of buffer. Cells were lysed by sonication, then the lysate clarified at 40,000 xg for 25 min. Clarified lysate was applied to 2.5 ml bed volume His-select Cobalt Affinity Gel (Sigma-Aldrich). The slurry was rotated in the cold room for an hour prior to application to a gravity flow column. The resin was washed sequentially as follows: 50 ml base buffer, 10 ml ATP buffer (25 mM Tris pH 7.4, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM ATP), 50 ml base buffer with 5 mM imidazole, 50 ml base buffer with 10 mM imidazole. Protein was eluted sequentially by addition of 25 ml of base buffer with 150 mM imidazole followed by 10 ml of the same buffer with 500 mM imidazole. Eluted fractions were pooled and 0.7 mg of his-tagged TEV NIa was added. The mixture was dialysed overnight, using 10 kDa MWCO Snakeskin dialysis tubing, against 4 l of buffer (25 mM Tris pH 7.4, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol). Post-dialysis the TEV NIa processed complex was rebound to Cobalt resin as per previous. The flow fraction was collected and concentrated. SEC was performed as per the 1A/3XFLAG-MYCN complex. 1A was concentrated, as per pre-SEC, down to 16.8 μM and used for 1A/MYCN complex reconstruction immediately.</p>
<p>Protein purification was assessed by a combination of Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE gels and immunoblotting (TFIIIC90: A301-239A, AB_890667; TFIIIC5: A301-242A, AB_890669; TFIIIC102: A301-238A, AB_890671, Bethyl Laboratories; TFIIIC110: sc-81406, AB_2115237; MYCN: sc-53993, AB_831602, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies; TFIIIC35: NBP2-31851, AB_2891101; TFIIIC1: NBP2-14077, AB_2891102, Novus Biologicals). The SEC elution position of molecular weight standards were established by using Bio-Rad gel filtration standards (cat #1511901). 5 mg/ml BSA was additionally used as the 66 kDa marker. Dextran blue was used to establish the void position of the column.</p>
<p>Aurora-A aa 122-403 D274N C290A C393A was purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bayliss, Sardon et al., 2003</xref>). The final buffer was 20 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10% glycerol, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol. <italic>E. coli</italic> expressed MYCN aa 1-137 pellets were initially disrupted using base buffer (pH 7.5, 100 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol) which was supplemented with 30 mg of lysozyme, 0.3 μg DNAseI, and 0.9 μM MnCl<sub>2</sub> per 30 ml of base buffer. This was sonicated 15 seconds on 15 seconds off for 150 seconds at 40 % amplitude. The lysate was initially clarified by centrifugation for 30 min at 30,000 xg. As this construct of MYCN expresses into inclusion bodies, the protein had to be recovered from the pellet using urea. All urea solutions were prepared immediately prior to use. The pellet was disrupted by vigorous pipetting after addition of 30 ml of 1 M urea in base buffer followed by sonication as previous. This solution was clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 30,000 xg. This protocol of disruption of the pellet, following addition of urea containing base buffers, followed by clarification was repeated sequentially for solutions containing 2 M and 4 M urea. 6xHis-tagged MYCN aa 1-137 was found in the soluble fraction of the 4 M urea solution. This was diluted 1/4 with 25 mM Tris pH 7.4, 2.7 mM KCl, 137 mM NaCl, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol prior to application of the protein to His-Select Cobalt affinity gel (Sigma-Aldrich). The slurry was rotated for 60 min prior to application to a gravity flow column. The resin was washed sequentially as follows with imidazole containing buffer (25 mM Tris pH 7.4, 2.7 mM KCl, 137 mM NaCl, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol): 50 ml 0 mM imidazole, 50 ml 5 mM imidazole, 25 ml 10 mM imidazole, 25 ml 150 mM imidazole, and 10 ml 500 mM imidazole. Pure fractions were pooled, along with 0.7 mg of his-tagged TEV NIa, and were dialysed overnight using 3.5 kDa MWCO snakeskin dialysis tubing against 4 l of buffer (25 mM Tris pH 7.4, 2.7 mM KCl, 137 mM NaCl, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol). Post TEV Nia processing, the protein was re-applied to His-Select Cobalt affinity gel (Sigma-Aldrich). The flow through fractions were pooled and concentrated (Vivaspin Turbo 3,000 MWCO) prior to SEC. SEC was performed using an ÄKTA prime and 16/600 S75 column. Pure fractions were pooled and concentrated as per pre SEC. Protein concentration was determined using absorbance at 280 nm.</p>

<p>The 1A/3xFLAG-MYCN complex was desalted into 200 mM ammonium acetate using 75 μl Zeba spin desalting columns (ThermoFisher Scientific). Samples were analysed by nanoelectrospray ionisation MS using a quadrupole-orbitrap MS (Q-Exactive UHMR, ThermoFisher Scientific) using gold/palladium coated nanospray tips prepared in-house. The MS was operated in positive ion mode using a capillary voltage of 1.3 kV, capillary temperature of 250 °C and S-lens RF of 200 V. In source trapping was used with a desolvation voltage of - 100 V for 4 µs. Extended trapping was not used. The quadrupole mass range was 2000-15000 m/z. Nitrogen gas was used in the HCD cell with a trap gas pressure setting of 5. Orbitrap resolution was 12500, detector m/z optimisation was low. 5 microscans were averaged. Mass calibration was performed by a separate injection of sodium iodide at a concentration of 2 µg/µl.

Samples were diluted to 1 µM using 0.1% TFA. 1 µl of the 1 µM sample was run on an Acquity UPLC Protein BEH C4 column (300 Å, 1.7 µm, 2.1 mm × 100 mm, Waters UK) with an Acquity UPLC Protein BEH VanGuard Pre-Column (300 Å, 1.7 µm, 2.1 mm × 5 mm, Waters UK). Buffer A was 0.1% formic acid in water, and buffer B was 0.1% formic acid in AcN (v/v basis). System flow rate was kept constant at 50 µl/min. Protein sample was loaded on to the trap column in 20% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid and washed for 5 min. Following valve switching, the bound protein was eluted by a gradient of 20-95% solvent B in A over 10 min. The column was subsequently washed with 95 % solvent B in A for 5 min before re-equilibration at 20% solvent B in A ready for the next injection.

<title>Protein identification/Peptide LC-MS analysis</title>
<p>Gel bands were excised and chopped into small pieces (∼ 1 mm<sup>3</sup>), covered with 30% ethanol in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and heated to 56 °C for 30 min with shaking. The supernatant was removed, replaced with fresh ethanol solution and was again heated to 56 °C for 30 min with shaking. This was repeated until all Coomassie stain was removed from the gel. The gel slices were then dehydrated by covering with 100% acetonitrile and left for five minutes before the supernatant was discarded and replaced with a fresh aliquot of acetonitrile. Proteins were reduced by adding 100 µl 20 mM DTT solution before incubation at 57 °C for 1 h with shaking. The supernatant was removed and once the gel pieces were at room temperature proteins were alkylated by adding 100 µl 55 mM iodoacetic acid. The samples were then incubated at room temperature in the dark for 30 min with shaking. After removing the supernatant, the gel slices were then covered with 100% acetonitrile and left for five minutes. The acetonitrile was removed, and the gel pieces were left to dry in a laminar flow hood for 60 min. Once dry, the gel slices were cooled on ice then they were covered with ice-cold protease solution and left on ice for 20 min to rehydrate. Trypsin solution (20 ng/µl in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate) was added to the unknown bands, chymotrypsin solution (25 ng/µl in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate). Excess protease solution was removed, and the gel slices were covered with a minimal amount of 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate. After briefly vortexing and centrifuging, the gel slices were incubated at 37 °C while shaking for 18 h. The resulting digest was vortexed and centrifuged. The supernatant was recovered and added to a 1.5 ml tube containing 5 µl acetonitrile/ water/ formic acid (60/35/5; v/v). 50 µl acetonitrile/ water/ formic acid (60/35/5; v/v) was added to the gel slices and vortexed for an additional 10 min. The supernatant was pooled with the previous wash and one additional wash of the gel slices was performed. The pool of three washes was dried by vacuum centrifugation. The peptides were reconstituted in 20 µl 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid prior to analysis. 4 µl sample were injected onto an in house-packed 20 cm capillary column (inner diameter 75 µm, 3.5 µm Kromasil C18 media). An EasyLC nano liquid chromatography system was used to apply a gradient of 4–40% ACN in 0.1% formic acid over 45 min at a flow rate of 250 nl/min. Total acquisition time was 60 min including column wash and re-equilibration. Separated peptides were eluted directly from the column and sprayed into an Orbitrap Velos Mass Spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Hemel Hempstead, UK) using an electrospray capillary voltage of 2.7 kV. Precursor ion scans were acquired in the Orbitrap with resolution of 60,000. Up to 20 ions per precursor scan were selected for fragmentation in the ion-trap. Dynamic exclusion of 30 s was used. Peptide MS/MS data were processed with PEAKS Studio X+ (Bioinformatic Solutions Inc, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada) and searched against the Uniprot databases for <italic>H. sapiens</italic> and <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> proteins (release 2021_02). Carbamiodomethylation was selected as a fixed modification, variable modifications were set for oxidation of methionine and deamidation of glutamine and asparagine.

<p>ChIP and ChIP-seq was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Roeschert et al., 2021</xref>). For each ChIP or ChIP-Rx seq experiment, 5x10<sup>7</sup> cells per immunoprecipitation condition were fixed for 5 min at room temperature with formaldehyde (final concentration, 1%). Fixation was stopped by adding 125 mM glycine for 5 min. Cells were harvested in ice-cold PBS containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich). As exogenous control (spike-in), murine NHO2A or NIH3T3 cells were added at a 1:10 cell ratio during cell lysis. Cell lysis was carried out for 20 min in lysis buffer I (5 mM PIPES pH 8.0, 85 mM KCl, 0.5% NP-40) and nuclei were collected by centrifugation (1,500 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C). Crosslinked chromatin was prepared in lysis buffer II (10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) and fragmented by using the Covaris Focused Ultrasonicator M220 for 50 min per ml lysate. For each IP reaction, 15 µl (for ChIP) or 100 μl (for ChIP-seq) Dynabeads Protein A and Protein G (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were pre-incubated overnight with rotation in the presence of 5 mg/ml BSA and 3 µg (for ChIP) or 10-15 μg (for ChIP-seq) antibody (MYCN (B8.4.B): sc-53993, AB_831602; TFIIIC5: A301-242A, AB_890669; RNAPII pSer2: ab5095, AB_304749; RNAPII (8WG16): sc-56767, AB_785522; BRCA1: A300-000A, AB_67367, Bethyl Laboratories). Chromatin was added to the beads, and IP was performed for a minimum of 6 h at 4 °C with rotation.

Chromatin was eluted twice by incubating with 200 µl elution buffer (100 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1% SDS in TE) for 15 min with rotation. Input samples and eluted samples were de-crosslinked overnight. Protein and RNA were digested with proteinase K and RNase A, respectively. DNA was isolated by phenol-chloroform extraction followed by an ethanol precipitation and analyzed by qPCR using StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or sequencing on the Illumina Next-Seq 2000.</p>
<p>After DNA extraction occupancy of different proteins were assessed by RT-PCR.

<p>For ChIP- or ChIP-Rx-seq, DNA was quantified using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). DNA library preparation was done using the NEBnext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs) following manufacturer’s instructions. Quality of the library was assessed on the Fragment Analyzer (Agilent) using the NGS Fragment High Sensitivity Analysis Kit (1-6,000 bp; Agilent). Finally, libraries were subjected to cluster generation and base calling for 75 cycles on Illumina NextSeq 500 platform.</p>
<p>CUT&amp;RUN followed by sequencing was performed as described in Meers et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Meers, Tenenbaum et al., 2019</xref>). 5 x10<sup>5</sup> cells were harvested using Accutase (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were washed in wash buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM Spermidine). After washing, cells were coupled to ConA-coated magnetic beads (Polysciences Europe), permeabilized and subsequently incubated with the primary antibody (EXOSC5: NBP2-14952, 1:100, Novus Biologicals) in antibody binding buffer (wash buffer, 0.05% digitonin, 2 mM EDTA) over night at 4 °C. Cells were washed in Dig-Wash buffer (Wash buffer, 0.05% digitonin) and MNase (700 ng/ml) was added to each sample for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing with Dig-wash buffer and Low-Salt Rinse buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 0.5 mM Spermidine, 0.05% digitonin) incubation buffer (3.5 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.05% digitonin) was added for 30 min at 4 °C. STOP buffer (170 mM NaCl, 20 mM EGTA, 0.05% digitonin, 20 µg/ml RNase A, 25 µg/ml Glycogen) was added to stop the MNase digestion. DNA fragments were released at 37 °C for 30 min. Decrosslinking was performed for 1 h at 50 °C after adding 0.01% SDS and 10 mg/ml Proteinase K followed by Phenol Chloroform extraction. Precipitated DNA was resuspended in 30 µl 0.1x TE buffer. For library preparation NEBnext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs) was used. Pre-PCR samples were purified using AmpureXP beads with a ratio of 1.75x. Then the eluted material was used with 16 PCR cycles. The libraries were cleaned using Agentcourt AMPure XP Beads (ratio 0.8x, Beckman Coulter), quality, quantity and fragment size assessed on the Fragment Analyzer (Agilent) using the NGS Fragment High Sensitivity Analysis Kit (1-6,000 bp; Agilent). Finally, libraries were subjected to cluster generation and base calling for 75 cycles on Illumina NextSeq 500 platform.</p>
<p>Phosphorylated linker Hi-C (pLHi-C) was based on Hi-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dixon, Selvaraj et al., 2012</xref>) and <italic>in situ</italic> Hi-C (Rao, Huntley et al., 2014). The main differences consisted in replacing the digestion enzyme and the Klenow fill-in step to increase resolution and overall protocol efficiency. 1x10<sup>6</sup> cells per condition were fixed with formaldehyde (1% final concentration) for 10 min at room temperature (RT). Reaction was stopped by adding 125 mM glycine for 15 min at RT. Cells were harvested with ice-cold PBS supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich). Nuclei isolation was performed by adding buffer I (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 10 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 1x protease inhibitors; Sigma-Aldrich) coupled with douncer homogenization. The resulting solution was centrifuged (2,500 xg, 5 min, 4 °C), the nuclei pellet was washed with 1x NEBuffer 3.1 (NEB) and incubated in buffer IIa (0.2% SDS, 1x NEBuffer 3.1; NEB) for 10 min at 50 °C. Buffer IIb (2% Triton X-100, 1.5 x NEBuffer 3.1, 1x protease inhibitors;) was added to a final volume of 943 µl. Sample was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. 850 U DpnII (NEB) and 35 µl rSAP (NEB) were added and sample was incubated for at least 8 h at 37 °C. Modified DNA oligos, 5’-GATCCCCAAATCT-3’ and 5’-GATCAGAT[BtndT]TGGG-3’ with 5’ end phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich), were annealed (81 µl of each Oligo 100 µM, 1x T4 ligase buffer; NEB) at 98 °C for 5 min, followed by 20 min at RT. After digestion, sample was washed with 1x T4 ligase buffer (NEB) (2,500 xg, 5 min, 4 °C). Nuclei pellet was resuspended in buffer IIIa (0.3% SDS, 1x T4 ligase buffer) and incubated for 15 min at 60 °C. Buffer IIIb (3% Triton X-100, 1x T4 ligase buffer, 1x protease inhibitors; NEB, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to a final volume of 1 ml and sample was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The nuclei pellet was resuspended in buffer IV (160 µl annealed oligos, 1.2x T4 ligase buffer, 6,000 U T4 ligase, 1x protease inhibitors; NEB) to a final volume of 800 µl after washing it with 1x T4 ligase buffer (NEB) (2,500 xg, 5 min, 4 °C). Sample was incubated overnight at 16 °C. rSAP in the digestion followed by phosphorylated linker in ligation was introduced to decrease the likelihood of self-ligation, increasing the final yield. Nuclei pellet was isolated by centrifugation (2,500 xg, 5 min, 4 °C) and mixed with buffer V (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS,1x protease inhibitors). Chromatin fragmentation was performed using the Covaris Focused Ultrasonicator M220 for 30 min per ml lysate. Samples were de-crosslinked overnight. Protein and RNA were digested with proteinase K and RNase A, respectively. DNA was isolated by ChIP DNA Clean &amp; Concentrator (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Biotin pull-down was performed with MyOne Streptavidin C1 beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Library preparation was performed on beads using NEBNext ChIP-Sequencing Library Prep Master Mix Set for Illumina (NEB). The manufacturer’s instructions were followed, apart from introducing a washing step between each module of the protocol with buffer VI (3x, 5 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl, 0.05% Tween) followed by one with 1x TE buffer. Quality of the library was assessed on the Fragment Analyzer (Agilent) using the NGS Fragment High Sensitivity Analysis Kit (1-6,000 bp; Agilent). Libraries were subjected to cluster generation and base calling for 150 cycles paired end on Illumina NextSeq 500 platform.</p>
<p>Spike-in phosphorylated linker HiChIP (spLHiChIP) and phosphorylated linker HiChIP (pLHiChIP) were based on pLHi-C, ChIP-Rx, and the original HiChIP protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Mumbach et al., 2016</xref>). spLHiChIP and pLHiChIP benefit from the same modules of pLHi-C fixation, digestion, ligation, chromatin fragmentation, and library preparation. The difference consists in the ChIP module, which follows the exact same steps from IP of target protein to de-crosslinked overnight stated in the ChIP workflow. The ChIP module allocated between the chromatin fragmentation and library preparation in pLHi-C workflow defines the spLHiChIP and pLHiChIP workflows. spLHiChIP differs from pLHiChIP by adding murine NHO2A cells as an exogenous control (spike-in) at a 1:20 cell ratio during nuclei isolation. This allows normalization by murine paired end valid tags in a similar fashion as murine reads for ChIP-Rx. 10x10<sup>6</sup> cells per condition were fixed with formaldehyde (1% final concentration) for 10 min at room temperature (RT). Reaction was stopped by adding 125 mM glycine for 15 min at RT. Cells were harvested with ice-cold PBS supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich). Nuclei isolation was performed by adding buffer I (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 10 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 1x protease inhibitors; Sigma-Aldrich) coupled with douncer homogenization. The resulting solution was centrifuged (2,500 xg, 5 min, 4 °C), the nuclei pellet was washed with 1x NEBuffer 3.1 (NEB) and incubated in buffer IIa (0.2% SDS, 1x NEBuffer 3.1; NEB) for 10 min at 50 °C. Buffer IIb (2% Triton X-100, 1.5 x NEBuffer 3.1, 1x protease inhibitors;) was added to a final volume of 943 µl. Sample was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. 850 U DpnII (NEB) and 35 µl rSAP (NEB) were added and sample was incubated for at least 8 h at 37 °C. Modified DNA oligos, 5’-GATCCCCAAATCT-3’ and 5’-GATCAGAT[BtndT]TGGG-3’ with 5’ end phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich), were annealed (81 µl of each Oligo 100 µM, 1x T4 ligase buffer; NEB) at 98 °C for 5 min, followed by 20 min at RT. After digestion, sample was washed with 1x T4 ligase buffer (NEB) (2,500 xg, 5 min, 4 °C). Nuclei pellet was resuspended in buffer IIIa (0.3% SDS, 1x T4 ligase buffer) and incubated for 15 min at 60 °C. Buffer IIIb (3% Triton X-100, 1x T4 ligase buffer, 1x protease inhibitors; NEB, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to a final volume of 1 ml and sample was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The nuclei pellet was resuspended in buffer IV (160 µl annealed oligos, 1.2x T4 ligase buffer, 6,000 U T4 ligase, 1x protease inhibitors; NEB) to a final volume of 800 µl after washing it with 1x T4 ligase buffer (NEB) (2,500 xg, 5 min, 4 °C). Sample was incubated overnight at 16 °C. Nuclei pellet was isolated by centrifugation (2,500 xg, 5 min, 4 °C) and mixed with buffer V (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS,1x protease inhibitors). Chromatin fragmentation was performed using the Covaris Focused Ultrasonicator M220 for 30 min per ml lysate. For each IP reaction, 100 μl Dynabeads Protein A and Protein G (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were pre-incubated overnight with rotation in the presence of 5 mg/ml BSA and 10 μg antibody (MYCN (B8.4.B): sc-53993, AB_831602; TFIIIC5: A301-242A, AB_890669). Chromatin was added to the beads, and IP was performed for a minimum of 6 h at 4 °C with rotation. Beads were washed three times each with washing buffer I (20 mM Tris pH 8.1, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS), washing buffer II (20 mM Tris pH 8.1, 500 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS), washing buffer III (10 mM Tris pH 8.1, 250 mM LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate; including a 5 min incubation with rotation) and TE buffer. Chromatin was eluted twice by incubating with 200 µl elution buffer (100 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1% SDS in TE) for 15 min with rotation. Input samples and eluted samples were de-crosslinked overnight. Protein and RNA were digested with proteinase K and RNase A, respectively. DNA was isolated by phenol-chloroform extraction followed by an ethanol precipitation. DNA library preparation was done using the NEBnext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Quality of the library was assessed on the Fragment Analyzer (Agilent) using the NGS Fragment High Sensitivity Analysis Kit (1-6,000 bp; Agilent). Finally, libraries were subjected to cluster generation and base calling on Illumina NextSeq 500 platform.</p>
<p>RNA sequencing was performed by extracting RNA with RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. On-column DNase I digestion was performed followed by mRNA isolation with the NEBNext Poly (A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Kit (NEB). Library preparation was done with the Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep for Illumina following the manufacturer’s manual. Libraries were size selected using SPRIselect Beads (Beckman Coulter) after amplification with 9 PCR cycles. Library quantification and size determination was performed with the Fragment Analyzer (Agilent) using the NGS Fragment High Sensitivity Analysis Kit (1-6,000 bp; Agilent).

<title>Bioinformatics analysis and statistics</title>
<p>All libraries were subjected to NextSeq 500 or NextSeq 2000 (Illumina) sequencing following the manufacturer’s guidelines. Base call data was converted and demultiplex to FASTQ files by bcl2fastq Conversion Software v1.1.0 (Illumina). Quality control of each dataset was done using FastQC tool.</p>
<p>ChIP-seq and CUT&amp;RUN sequencing reads were aligned to human (hg19/ GRCh37 assembly) using Bowtie2 v2.3.5.1. with default parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Langmead &amp; Salzberg, 2012</xref>). Normalization by aligned read number was performed on the input and on all correspondent IP samples. For each sample, the number of spike-in normalized reads was calculated by dividing the number of reads mapping exclusively to hg19 by the number of reads mapping exclusively to mm10 and multiplying this number with the smallest number of reads mapping to mm10 of all samples. After normalization, files were converted to bedGraph with “bedtools genomecov” v2.26 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Quinlan &amp; Hall, 2010</xref>). These files were used to plot genome browser track examples via the package plotgardener v1.012 in R v4.1.1.</p>
<p>MACS2 v2.1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Zhang, Liu et al., 2008</xref>) was used for peak calling with the following ChIPseq-datasets &amp; parameters, with inputs serving as control: MYCN (GSM3044606, GSM3044608; dup = 5, q = 1x10<sup>-3</sup>), TFIIIC5 in SH-EP-MYCN-ER (this work; dup = 5, q = 10<sup>-3</sup>), and RAD21 (this work; dup = 5, p = 10<sup>-2</sup>). H3K4me1, H3K4me3, and H3K27ac peaks were called with SICER v1.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Xu, Grullon et al., 2014</xref>), using input as control and the parameters: redundancy threshold = 1, window size = 200 bp, fragment size = 75 bp, effective genome fraction = 0.74, gap size = 600, FDR = 0.001. Peak calling results were refined and confirmed by visual inspection.</p>
<p>RNA sequencing reads were aligned to human (hg19/ GRCh37 assembly) using STAR aligner v2.7.9a with the default parameters and gene quantification (--quantMode GeneCounts) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dobin, Davis et al., 2013</xref>). The output table with the gene counts was loaded into R v4.1.1. and processed with DESeq2 package accordingly to their manual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Love, Huber et al., 2014</xref>). Genes with or more than 15 counts in at least 3 samples or more were selected, and all samples were normalized by size factors. The fold average for 3 independent biological replicates was calculated on treatment to control as showed in the correspondent figure and legend. The result was averaged in 100 or 150 bins for a total of 14,085 genes and displayed as dot plot. Alternative splicing events were identified using rMATS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Shen et al., 2014b</xref>).</p>
<p>pLHi-C, pLHiChIP and spLHiChIP sequencing reads were processed in two steps. In the first step they were all processed in the same way, HiC-Pro v 2.11.4 (Servant, Varoquaux et al., 2015) trims the reads for the linker sequence, aligns it to hg19 and filters it by DpnII restriction fragments of the same genome assembly. The default parameters were used for the alignment steps, except for the length of the seed (-L) parameter that was set to 25 for the global options and 15 for the local one, and mismatch (-N) that was set to 1. Read trimming was performed by inserting combinations of the linker sequence (GATCAGATTTGGGGATC, GATCCCCAAATCTGATC) in the ligation site parameter. Reads considered as duplicates were accepted and multi-mapped reads were only removed for pLHiChIP and spLHiChIP. Quality control for all steps until all valid pairs (<underline>p</underline>aired <underline>e</underline>nd tags; PETs) output was also performed thru HiC-Pro. We compared HiC-Pro’s standard quality controls example (IMR90 replicate 1 sample; GSM862724), according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Servant <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Servant et al., 2015</xref>), to the base of our methods variation, pLHi-C.</p>
<p>In the second step, spLHiChIP samples undergo the same workflow described for the first step replacing hg19 for mm10 assembly. PETs from mm10 were removed from hg19 PETs and a spike-in normalization was applied to hg19 PETs in the same way explained for ChIP-Rx hg19 aligned reads. DNA loop calling was performed on spLHiChIP and pLHiChIP PETs using hichipper v0.7.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lareau &amp; Aryee, 2018</xref>). ChIP-seq peak calling sites were used as pre-determined peaks. All the default parameters with a loop maximum distance (--max-dist) of 5,000,000 were used for all proteins. We compared the DNA loops calling quality control for Oct4 HiChIP (GSM2238510) from the original method description (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Mumbach et al., 2016</xref>) to our method variation for MYCN and TFIIIC5. An extra quality control to show enrichment and specificity was performed by plotting MYCN pLHiChIP, its input pLHi-C and its ChIP-seq with pLHiChIP and pLHi-C normalized to the same number of PETs. DNA loops calling results were refined and confirmed by visual inspection. The mango output files from the loop calling were then loaded in R, filter by a q-value equal or smaller than 0.01 and used in all further plots and analyses. All examples showing DNA loops, ChIP-seq and annotation tracks in different genomic regions/locus were plotted using plotgardener package in R environment.</p>
<p>The different genome functional annotations were retrieved from UCSC table browser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Karolchik, Hinrichs et al., 2004</xref>). Promoters, gene bodies and transcription end sites (TES) come from Reference Sequence (RefSeq) collection of genes for hg19 assembly and were adapted via R language. For RNAPII targets, promoters were defined as TSS ± 0.5 kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Buchel et al., 2017</xref>), gene bodies as the sum of exons and introns, TES as TES ± 0.3 kb. Enhancers were defined as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Walz <italic>et al</italic>. (2014)</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Walz et al., 2014</xref>): H3K3me1 and H3K27ac overlapping sites without H3K4me3. Overlapping and discontinuous regions were obtained by using peak calling outputs as inputs in intersectBed (BEDTools) with standard parameters.</p>
<p>Overlapping between different pLHiChIP was calculated by “bedtools pairtopair” function (BEDTools) using the options to prevent self-hits and ignore strands. The type of overlap was set to report when both anchors of the different pLHiChIP overlaps (-type either). This provided outputs of loops with and without overlapping that could be used for other analyses. For discrimination between the different types of overlaps, the type both was removed from the type either and the two types were then reported. Overlaps were called joint sites and adapted as Venn diagrams by centering the coordinates and numbers to MYCN anchors or MYCN-TFIIIC5 anchors. TADs overlap corresponds to common sites in at least eight out of nine cell lines reported in (GSE35156) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rao et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>The GenomicInteractions v1.28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Harmston, Ing-Simmons et al., 2015</xref>) package in R language was used to calculate and report the overlaps between the different pLHiChIP anchors and their functional annotations. Overlaps on different functional annotations were reported in the following order of priority: enhancer, promoter, TES, gene body, tRNA, rRNA, miRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, SINE, LINE, LTR, and satellite. The bar graphs reporting the functional annotation of each anchor are proportional to the total number of loops of each pLHiChIP, numbers were rounded and plotted by GenomicInteractions and ggplot2 v3.3.5 packages in R environment. Motif analysis was performed by using the FIMO algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Grant, Bailey et al., 2011</xref>) of the MEME Suite software toolkit v5.3.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bailey, Johnson et al., 2015</xref>). The function getfasta (BEDTools) extracted the hg19 FASTA sequence from each pLHiChIP anchor to be used independently as input for motif search. The background model was generated by the function fasta-get-markov (MEME Suite) using hg19 FASTA with standard parameters. Pre-defined motifs for MYCN (E-box) (MA0104.4: JASPAR 2018 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Sandelin, Alkema et al., 2004</xref>)), B-box, and A-box were scanned using the options “--thresh 1.0 --text” with the default parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chan, Lin et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Pavesi, Conterio et al., 1994</xref>). Resulting hits were then filtered by p-value &lt;= 1x10<sup>-4</sup>. In R environment, duplicated hits of the same motif in the same anchor were filtered by the one with the lowest p-value. Different motifs in the same anchor window were reported according to the decreasing priority: E-box, B-box, and A-box. The overlap between anchors and motifs was computed by GenomicInteractions package and the corresponding heatmap was plotted in R.</p>
<p>To visualize the influence of the MYCN interaction on gene expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>), MYCN bound genes (as defined by MACS2 on MYCN ChIP-seq data, above) were subdivided into genes that are bound by MYCN without loops (“no MYCN loops”) and genes bound by MYCN forming loops (above, “MYCN loops”). For both classes, RNA-sequencing reads between TSS &amp; TSS+2 kb were counted using “bedtools intersect” on spike-normalized ChIP-seq data for RNAPII (A10), MYCN (GSM3044606), TFIIIC5; processed transcript data were obtained from Büchel <italic>et al</italic>. 2017 (RNA-sequencing, GSE111905 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Buchel et al., 2017</xref>)) and Papadopoulos et al. 2021 (4sU-sequencing, GSE164569 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Papadopoulos et al., 2022</xref>)), respectively. Plots were generated with “boxplot” and statistical significance calculated using Students’ t-test (unpaired, two-sided, unequal variance), both in R v3.6.3.</p>
<p>Over-representation analysis for Molecular Signatures Database (MsigDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Subramanian, Tamayo et al., 2005</xref>)) were calculated by clusterProfiler package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Wu, Hu et al., 2021</xref>) in R environment. Different functional classes of loops were retrieved from the overlaps and discontinuous loops by the GenomicInteractions package. Gene names were converted to HGNC symbol name using AnnotationDbi package and sorted by the number of PETs. Duplicated gene names were merged and the median of their number of PETs was used. A hypergeometric test was calculated on the sorted list for MSigDB collections H (hallmark gene sets) or C5 (ontology gene sets) using a 0.05 q-value threshold.</p>
<p>MYCN spLHiChIP treated sample was normalize by its control counterpart in each biological replicate before plotted as graph bar in R enviroment. The ratio of TFIIIC5 binding (ChIP-Rx) per number of interaction (spLHiChIP) was calculated in R environment v4.1.1. The number of ChIP-Rx reads was calculated to TSS ± 2 kb for all genes using bedtools intersect (BEDtools) with default parameters. The number of spLHiChIP interactions was calculated for the same region. The ratio was calculated on reads to number of interactions per each sample and plotted as bar graph.</p>
<p>Networks were reconstituted by using the R package igraph v1.2.11 and Cytoscape v3.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brockmann, Poon et al., 2013</xref>). The different classes of loops were retrieved via the GenomicInteractions package and converted to the simple interaction file format and to a node table. These files were used in Cytoscape for visualization, using the Edge-weighted Spring-Embedded Layout based on the number of PETs for each loop. The resulting MYCN network reports the nodes as functional annotations; explained before. In parallel, the sif file was used as input for the igraph package. This package was used to define the membership of each anchor to the different clusters and to quantify the number of nodes per cluster. The statistical significance comparing the number of nodes per cluster between two groups were calculated via Wilcoxon rank sum test.</p>
<p>Density plots for the different regions were performed using ngs.plot v2.41.3 (Shen, Shao et al., 2014a). Default parameters were used for samples normalized by reads number. For spike-in normalized samples, we used a custom variation of ngs.plot that allows the spike-in normalization by skipping the internal normalization step. All densities plots and metaplots were based on gene expression for SH-EP-MYCN-ER cells ± MYCN induction (4-OHT treatment) – evaluated by RNA-sequencing (GSE111905; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Herold <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Based on this, all expressed genes gene set consists of 14,704 genes, down- and up-regulated gene sets are represented by 613 and 921 genes, respectively. MYCN-down and -up regulated genes are defined by negative and positive fold change upon ±4-OHT treatment of genes with q-values less than 0.05 and expression filter by counts per million. In R v4.1.1., Wilcoxon rank sum test (unpaired, two-sided) was used to compare the different conditions on the plotted region per ChIP.</p>
<p>PLA’s p-values were calculated by comparing the signal of the pool of the cells in all replicates using Wilcoxon rank sum test (unpaired, two-sided) in R v4.1.1.</p>

<p>This study presents the <bold>valuable</bold> finding that TFIIIC interacts with MYCN to regulate RNA polymerase II dynamics by dissecting its impact on 3D chromatin architecture. Authors provide <bold>convincing</bold> evidence that MYCN and TFIIIC show long-range chromatin contacts, and that the expression of each protein limits the function of the other. The notion emerges that TFIIIC helps MYCN to maintain output at promoters while decreasing less productive associations at larger more extensively connected chromatin hubs. The paper is of interest to molecular biologists working on MYCN-dependent regulation of gene expression.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript entitled &quot;Association with TFIIIC limits MYCN accumulation in hubs of active promoters and chromatin accumulation of non-phosphorylated RNA polymerase II&quot; the authors examine how the cohesin complex component (and RNA pol III associated factor) TFIIIC interacts with MYCN and controls transcription. They confirm that TFIIIC co-purifies with MYCN, dependent on its amino terminus, as shown in previous work. The authors also find that TFIIIC and MYCN are both found in promoter hubs and suggest that TFIIIC inhibits MYCN association with these hubs. Finally, the authors indicate that TFIIIC/MYCN alter exosome function, and BRCA1 dependent effects, at MYCN regulated loci.</p>
<p>In the revised manuscript the authors have adequately addressed or responded to our questions and comments. The exception concerns point #2 in our initial review:</p>
<p>(2) The authors indicate in Figure 2 that TF3C has essentially no effect on MYCN- dependent gene expression and/or transcription elongation. Yet a previous study (PMID: 29262328) associated with several of the same authors concluded that TF3C positively affects transcription elongation. The authors to not attempt to reconcile these disparate results and the point still needs to clarified.</p>
<p>Authors' Response</p>
<p>
We agree that the data in this manuscript do not support the role on transcription elongation. This point was also raised by Reviewer 3. Comparing our new results to the data published previously we can summarize that the data sets in the two studies show three key results: First, the traveling ratio of RNAPII changes upon induction of MYCN. Second, RNAPII decreases at the transcription start side and third, it increases towards the end side.</p>
<p>We agree that in the previous study we linked the traveling ratio directly to elongation. However performing ChIP-seq with different RNAPII antibodies showed us that for example RNAPII (N20), which is unfortunately discontinued, gives different results compared to RNAPII (A10). Combining our new results using the RNAPII (8WG16) antibody shows that the traveling ratio is not only reflecting transcription elongation but also includes that the RNAPII is kicked-off chromatin at the start side.</p>
<p>Reviewer revised response:</p>
<p>
The explanation for the change in interpretation of the previous study (Buchel, et. al., 2017) in light of the differing results using different RNA pol2 antibodies used in the present study seems reasonable. However the final manuscript may well result in some confusion in the literature in regards to TF3C and elongation. This is because, while the authors refer to the earlier paper frequently, they do not directly discuss the re-interpretation of the elongation conclusion of the earlier paper. It seems likely that a reader of the present paper will find this issue confusing when trying to reconcile the results of the two papers.</p>

<p>This manuscript reports several interesting observations that invite follow-up. The notion that hubs, and perhaps condensates that may (or may not embrace them) are functionally and physiologically important is an open issue at this time. The authors note that TFIIIC helps to prune extraneous connections from hubs, but do not comment that the connections that are maintained are also reinforced. At the same time only modest changes in gene expression associated with expanded or decreased connections and changes in bound proteins. One interesting possibility might be that standard methods for assessing expression miss changes global or background transcription. It seems that the TFIIIC-MYCN-ER connection has features that would help to suppress such background. The results invite a more global consideration of TFIIIC than as primarily RNAPIII/small RNA transcription factor and of MYCN as an E-box dependent transcription factor. The results use sate of the art methods to develop interesting new ideas that have the potential to instruct further studies that may reveal new mechanisms of action for TFIIIC and MYCN.</p>
<p>The work is however subject to a couple of caveats. First, the authors should be more cautious when drawing firm conclusions about the dynamics and kinetics of transcription from the static snapshots obtained from most genomic methods. For example, please take a look at Figure 1F of &quot;Transcription elongation defects link oncogenicSF3B1 mutations to targetable alterations in chromatin landscape&quot; by Buddu et al, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2024.02.032">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2024.02.032</ext-link>. Here, an increase in RNAPSer2P is seen in gene bodies and a bit at the TES- superficially inviting the conclusion that expression is increased (a similar erroneous conclusion has been claimed in other genomic studies), but the increase is in fact, not due to increased transcription, rather to impaired elongation-this conclusion required performing TT-Seq which allowed inferences to be made about elongation rates. Acknowledging this qualification would help advise the reader.</p>
<p>The authors also need to discuss directly what differences between the MYC predominant SH-EP cells and the MYCN-predominant SH-EP-MYCNER+tamoxifen are qualitative versus quantitative. MYCNER indeed associates much more with chromatin than did MYC, but there seems to be a lot more MYCER than there was MYC prior to the addition of tamoxifen. (The true control for this would be to prepare SH-EP-MYCER cells expressed from the same promoter as was MYCNER. Some discussion of qualitative versus quantitative differences should be acknowledged.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Use of a variety of methods to assess the genomic response to increased MYCN in the presence or absence of TFIIIC. Clearly establishes in vitro and in vivo the TFIIIC-MYCN complex</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Dynamic inferences are made without kinetic experiments.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Vidal et al. investigated how TFIIIC may mediate MYCN effects on transcription. The work builds upon previous reports from the same group where they describe MYCN interactors in neuroblastoma cells (Buchel et al, 2017), which include TFIIIC, and their different roles in MYCN-dependent control of RNA polymerase II function (Herold et al, 2019) (Roeschert et al, 2021) (Papadopoulus et al, 2022). Using baculovirus expression systems, they confirm that MYCN-TFIIIC interaction is direct, and likely relevant for neuroblastoma cell proliferation. However, transcriptomics analyses led them to conclude that TFIIC is largely dispensable for MYCN-dependent gene expression. Instead, they propose that TFIIC limits MYCN-mediated promoter-promoter 3D chromatin contacts, which would in turn facilitate the recruitment of the nascent RNA degradation machinery and restrict the accumulation of non-phosphorylated RNA polymerase II at promoters. How this mechanism may impact on MYCN-driven neuroblastoma cell biology remains to be elucidated.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study presents a nice variety of genomic datasets addressing the specific role of TFIIIC in MYCN-dependent functions. In particular, the technically challenging HiChIP sequencing experiments performed under various conditions provide very useful information about the interplay between MYCN and TFIIIC in the regulation of 3D chromatin contacts. The authors show that MYCN and TFIIIC participate both in unique and overlapping long-range chromatin contacts and that the expression of each of these proteins limits the function of the other. Together, their results suggest a dynamic and interconnected relationship between MYCN and TFIIIC in regulating 3D chromatin contacts.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Mechanistic questions regarding the specific role of TFIIIC in regulating MYCN function remain unsolved. Why is it important to restrict MYCN association to promoter hubs? Do the authors find any TFIIIC-dependent phenotype that is restricted or particularly enhanced at these locations? Both the effects on the accumulation of non-phosphorylated RNA pol II and the recruitment of the nascent RNA degradation machinery seem to be global.</p>
<p>(2) Two specific points regarding RNA pol II ChIPseq results remain unclear:</p>
<p>-It is unfortunate that although both RNAPII (N20) and RNAPII (A10) antibodies were raised against the N-teminal domain, they give different results according to the authors. Caution should be taken, as it may imply that some previous results could be explained by epitope masking.</p>
<p>-I am sorry if I missed something crucial, but to my understanding, the disparities regarding the ChIPseq results obtained using the 8WG16 antibody are not fully resolved. In Figure S7C from their previous publication (Buchel et al, 2017) the authors concluded that &quot;Intriguingly, ChIP sequencing showed that activation of N-MYC had no significant effect on chromatin association of hypo-phosphorylated Pol II&quot;. Is this not a similar experiment, using the same antibody and experimental conditions as in Figure 2 from the current manuscript? They now conclude that &quot;activation of MYCN caused a global decrease in promoter association of non-phosphorylated RNAPII&quot;.</p>
<p>(3) Conducting ChIP-qPCR experiments for all nascent RNA degradation factors to be compared would have enabled a more direct and comprehensive comparison.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>(1) In Figure 1, the authors show that TF3C binds to the amino terminus of MYCN (Myc box I region), as shown previously. The data in Figure 1 B-D support, but do not rigorously confirm a 'direct' interaction because it has not been ruled out that accessory proteins mediating the association may be present in the mixture.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In Figure 1B-D we have purified MYCN and the TFIIIC/TauA complex separately and then mixed the purified preparations, demonstrating that the purified proteins interact. We have additionally performed mass spectrometry, which shows that the TauA/MYCN complex is formed without further accessory proteins, as the molecular weight would be higher. Based on the Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE gels, there is no plausible contaminating band in the purified complex that could be mediating the interaction between MYCN and TauA, either in the purified complex (Figure 1C), or in the purified protein used to reconstitute the complex (Figure S1A &amp; S1B).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors indicate in Figure 2 that TF3C has essentially no effect on MYCNdependent gene expression and/or transcription elongation.

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Figures 2B and C show that unphosphorylated pol2 is TSS-centered, and Ser2-P pol2 occupation is centered beyond the TES. From this data, however, the reader can't tell how much of the phospho-Ser2- pol2 is centered on the TSS. The authors should include overall plots over TSS and TES, and also perhaps the gene-body to allow a better comparison for TSS and TES plotted for both antibodies over the collected gene sets.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We focused on the TSS for unphosphorylated RNAPII and the TES for pSer2-RNAPII, as these are the regions with specific enrichment of the respective antibodies. As requested for comparison, we now include metagenes showing TSS, gene-body, and TES for both antibodies as new Figure S2A and B. Additionally, we included density plots for unphosphorylated RNAPII at the TES as well as for pSer2-RNAPII at the TSS as a Figure for the Reviewers (Figure 1).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors see more TF3C at promoters in cells with MYCN (Figure 2F). What are the levels of TF3C in the absence and presence of MYCN?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As shown in the immunoblot in Figure S1E, TF3C5 levels do not change upon induction of MYCN. We therefore think that MYCN helps to recruit TFIIIC5 to RNAPII promoter sites. This is also in accordance to what we previously reported 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The finding that TF3C is increased at TSS (Figure 2F) doesn't necessarily indicate that 1) MYCN is recruiting TF3C there, and 2) that this is due to the phosphorylation status of pol2. It could mean many other things. The logic of conflating these 3 points based on the data shown is questionable.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We showed previously that knock-down of MYCN affects TFIIIC5 binding, showing that MYCN is required for binding of TFIIIC5 at promoter sites 1.</p>
<p>Additionally, we included data with DRB treated cells (Figure 2F), which prevents RNAPII loading by preventing downstream de novo elongation. Those data show that TFIIIC5 binding at the TSS is massively increased upon induction of MYCN and additionally upon treatment with DRB. Conversely, we observed that the major effect of TFIIIC knock-down was at the nonphosphorylated RNAPII at the TSS on MYCN induction (Figure 2B). Therefore, we would argue that our assumption fits well to the data presented in the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Figure 3A doesn't add much to the paper, as it is overplotted and no relationship is clear, except that Pol2 and MYCN occupy many of the same sites. Perhaps a less complex or different type of plot would allow the interactions to be better visible.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the comment and since in another comment we were asked to show the same window for all shown Hi-ChIP data plots, we changed Figure 3A.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) That depletion of TF3C leads to increased promoter hubs may or may not have anything to do with its association with MYCN (Figure 4E). This could be a direct consequence of its known structural function in cohesin complexes, and the MYCN changes as a secondary consequence of this (also see point 4, above).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As shown in Büchel et al. (2017) 1 MYCN is needed to recruit RAD21 and depletion of RAD21 has no impact on the recruitment of MYCN. Since RAD21 is part of the cohesin complex we would exclude that the MYCN changes are a secondary consequence.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Depletion of TF3C5 results in a loss of EXOSC5 (exosome) at TSS in the presence and absence of MYCN (Figure 5B). As TF3C5 is a cohesin, could this simply be a consequence of genomic structure changes?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the discovered changes in EXOSC5 can be due to depletion of TFIIIC5. TFIIIC has been shown to recruit cohesin 1 and condensin complexes 2, as well as inducing chromatin architectural changes 3. However, MYCN is needed to recruit TFIIIC and depletion of TFIIIC had no impact on MYCN recruitment 1. Furthermore, MYCN has been shown to recruit exosome 4. Therefore, we would argue that either MYCN can directly play a role or thru chromatin architectural changes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) The authors suggest that RNA dynamics are affected by changes in exosome function (RNA degradation, etc). What effect, if any does TF3C depletion have on the overall gene expression profile?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We show in the manuscript that TFIIIC depletion in unperturbed cells has no effect on the global gene expression profile in the time frame analyzed (Figure 2E and S2B).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Dynamic inferences are made without kinetic experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While we agree that we did not collect kinetic data to study the dynamics of RNA polymerase we would argue that the integration of our different data sets make it possible to draw conclusions about dynamic interferences. The transcription cycle and its sequential steps have been well described. In this sense, we use the non-phosphorylated RNAPII data that is situated between RNAPII recruitment and initiation and RNAPII-pSer2 that shows pause-release to elongation to draw conclusions on the dynamic. Likewise, we also made use of our previous published datasets.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) A number of changes are reported in hub size, expression, etc. upon treatment with tamoxifen to activate MCN-ER. But MYC is already present in the SHEP cells, so why doesn't MYC support these same phenomena? It would seem that either the ability to cooperate with TFIIIC to clear non-productive polymerase complexes from promoters is particular to MYCN, or else it reflects a quantitative increase in total MYC proteins due to the entry of MYCN-ER into the nucleus with tamoxifen. The authors should address or discuss this issue.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It could be that protein levels are the limiting factor between MYC and MYCN observed effects in this system. This interpretation would be in accordance with the results of Lorenzin et al. 5, which reported that different levels of MYC had different targets based on the affinity to Eboxes and protein level. A similar profile of MYC levels compared to function was also reported regarding SPT5 6. Those high protein levels mimic what is found in certain tumors in contrast to physiological levels. In this sense, the observed differences can also be between physiological and oncological levels of MYC proteins.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it has been described both a core MYC- and an isoform specific-signature of target genes. MYCN is described to be involved in gene expression during the S-phase of the cell cycle 7. This suggests that there are differences between MYC and MYCN other than gene sets. The interaction with TFIIIC appears to be one of these differences. We have found multiple TFIIIC subunits as part of the MYCN interactome, but the interaction of TFIIIC with MYC is weaker and we are uncertain how relevant it is 7,8. We show here that depletion of different subunits of the TFIIIC complex show a MYCN-dependent growth defect (Figure 1 E). Similarly, nuclear exosome is a MYCN-specific dependence 4, and we show here that MYCNdependent recruitment of the exosome requires TFIIIC5. We take this as an indication that there is an intrinsic difference between MYC and MYCN and that MYCN engages TFIIIC for this pathway.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Reciprocal to TFIIIC recruitment to MYCN- rRNA, and other RNAPIII genes. Does this happen targets would be MYCN association with tRNA genes, 5S, and if so, is this association TFIIIC dependent? What happens to the expression of these genes?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did observe MYCN in interactions involving tRNA and other RNAPIII sites, such as SINE elements and tRNAs (Figure 4B, 4D, S3F, and S4B). There was no relevant number of 5S rRNA involved in interactions – either because the difficulty to properly map these repetitive regions or due to biology. In any case, none of those regions appeared to be specifically dependent on TFIIIC as the overall number of interactions increased in TFIIIC depletion regardless of the genomic annotation (Figure S4B). Regarding the expression of RNAPIII genes, we are constrained by technical limitations of poly(A) enrichment RNA-seq to globally analyze it in an unbiased way. However, we addressed this point for tRNAs expression in an earlier work 1 and found that tRNA levels do not change upon TFIIIC depletion. We think this is because tRNAs are stable transcripts and RNAPIII recycling can occur in a TFIIICindependent manner 9. Conversely, we reported no significant expression changes in RNAPII genes upon TFIIIC depletion in this work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors show that TFIIIC depletion does not alter the RNA-expression profile; how do they account for this? Can they comment on &quot;background&quot; transcription that it would seem should be suppressed by TFIIIC-dependent removal of various hypofunctional polymerases?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Since TFIIIC is important for the removal of non-functional RNAPII we would not expect changes to the gene expression profile upon depletion of TFIIIC in the time frame analyzed. Monitoring the elongating form of RNAPII by measuring pSer2 indeed shows us that transcription elongation is not affected.</p>

<p>(4) Global changes in expression are difficult to assess with DESEQ2. This hypernormalizing algorithm is not really suited to distinguish differential, but universal upregulation from some targets being truly upregulated while others are downregulated. The authors should comment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The authors acknowledge that DESEQ2 relies on the conjecture that genewise estimates of dispersion are generally unchanged among samples. We address this comment in two different ways. We include those in the Figure for the Reviewers (Figure 2). The first was to sequence samples deeper to avoid any bias created by random effect of lower coverage, the range of total reads increased from 6.8-9.3 to 16.5-20.7 million reads. The second was to compare the fold average bin dot plot for RNA-seq of SH-EP-MYCN-ER showing mRNA expression normalized by control per bin using the DESEQ2 (Figure 2A) normalization to TMM in edgeR (Figure 2B) and to quantile normalization (Figure 2C). No major differences were found from the original data or using the different methods, but we updated the Figure 2E in the manuscript to include the deeper sequencing dataset, we also adjusted it to show -/+ MYCN and transformed to log2 to make it more intuitive. Overall, it enhances our original understanding that gene expression remains largely unaffected by TFIIIC5 knockdown.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) On page 7, the authors claim that MYCN-ER increased Ser-2 can reflect MYCN-stimulated transcription elongation. In fact, without kinetic studies, this is not fully supported. Accumulation of Ser-2 RNAPII along a gene can reflect increased initiation of full-speed RNAPs or a pile-up of RNAPs slowing down. This should be resolved or qualified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While we agree that we did not collect kinetic data to study the dynamics of RNA polymerase we would argue that the integration of our different data sets make it possible to draw conclusions about dynamic interferences. We showed on the one side that pSer-2 accumulates on the TES and on the other side the induction of MYCN-ER up-regulates gene expression which proves productive transcription elongation.</p>

<p>We carefully rechecked all the labels in Figure 2 and it was correct as it was. We understand the confusion that may have created comparing Figure 2D and Figure 2E. To avoid confusion, we updated Figure 2E to show the same direction of Figure 2D. We also log2 transformed the y-axis of Figure 2E to foster a more intuitive reading.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The connection between the three major findings presented in this study regarding the role of TFIIIC in the regulation of MYCN function remains unclear. Specifically, how the TFIIICdependent restriction of MYCN localization to promoter hubs enhances the association of factors involved in nascent RNA degradation to prevent the accumulation of inactive RNA polymerase II at promoters is not apparent. As they are currently presented, these findings appear as independent observations. Cross-comparison of the different datasets obtained may provide some insight into addressing this question.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We previously observed that TFIIIC does not affect MYCN recruitment, while MYCN affects TFIIIC binding 1. Moreover, our group reported that MYCN recruits exosome 4 and BRCA1 to promoter-proximal regions 10 to clear out non-functional RNAPII. We are currently reporting that MYCN-TFIIIC complexes exclude non-functional RNAPII. However, MYCN-active promoter hubs have more RNAPII and more transcription than MYCN-active promoter outside hubs. Furthermore, TFIIIC binding occurs upstream of BRCA1 and exosome recruitments as depletion of TFIIIC leads to recruitment decrease of both factors. Therefore, we argue that TFIIIC is required for the proper function of those MYCN-active promoter hubs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Another concern involves the disparities in RNA polymerase II ChIP-seq results between this study and earlier ones conducted by the same group. In Figure 2, the authors demonstrate that activation of MYCN results in a reduction of non-phosphorylated RNA polymerase II across all expressed genes. This discovery contradicts prior findings obtained using the same methodology, where it was concluded that the expression of MYCN had no significant effect on the chromatin association of hypo-phosphorylated RNA polymerase II (Buchel et al, 2017). In this regard, the choice of the 8WG16 antibody raises concern, as fluctuations in the signal may be attributed to changes in the phosphorylation levels of the Cterminal domain. It remains unclear why the authors decided against using antibodies targeting the N-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, which are unaffected by phosphorylation and consistently demonstrated a significant signal reduction upon MYCN activation in their previous studies (Buchel et al, 2017) (Herold et al, 2019). Similarly, the authors previously proposed that depletion of TFIIIC5 abrogates the MYCN-dependent increase of Ser2phosphorylated RNA polymerase II (Buchel et al, 2017), whereas they now show that it has no obvious impact. These aspects need clarification.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We politely disagree that our discoveries are contradicting each other. Comparing our new results to the data published previously we can summarize that the data sets in the two studies show three key results: First, the traveling ratio of RNAPII changes upon induction of MYCN. Second, RNAPII decreases at the transcription start side and third, it increases towards the end side.</p>
<p>We agree that in the previous study we linked the traveling ratio directly to elongation. However performing ChIP-seq with different RNAPII antibodies showed us that for example RNAPII (N20), which is unfortunately discontinued, gives different results compared to RNAPII (A10). Combining our new results using the RNAPII (8WG16) antibody shows that the traveling ratio is not only reflecting transcription elongation but also includes that the RNAPII is kicked-off chromatin at the start side.</p>
<p>In the previous study we only performed manual ChIP experiments for RNAPII (8WG16) and pSer2. Now we did a global analysis which is more meaningful and is also reflected in the RNA sequencing data.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Finally, the varied techniques employed to explore the role of TFIIIC in MYCNdependent recruitment of nascent RNA degradation factors make it challenging to draw definitive conclusions about which factor is affected and which one is not. While conducting ChIPseq experiments for all factors may be beyond the scope of this manuscript, incorporating proximity ligation assays (PLA) or ChIP-qPCR assays with each factor would have enabled a more direct and comprehensive comparison.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand the criticism that we are comparing different assays. We have performed PLAs with different antibodies. Since the controls of the PLAs were not sufficient for us, we refrain from using them. ChIP-qPCR experiments are much more challenging to do side by side compared to PLAs, which is why we decided against looking at all factors with this method.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations For The Authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Figure 2: Why did the authors choose the 8WG16 antibody? Does TFIIIC5 depletion suppress the MYCN-dependent reduction of total RNA polymerase II binding to promoters that they consistently showed in previous studies? Given that phosphorylation of the CTD impacts 8WG16 recognition, including Ser5-phosphorylated RNA polymerase II ChIPseq experiments might clarify this issue.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We used the RNAPII (8WG16) antibody to exactly map non-phosphorylated RNAPII which shows us the binding of non-functional RNAPII.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Figures 3 and 4: As it stands, the manuscript does not convincingly establish a functional connection between the results in Figures 2, 3, and 4 or elucidate potential mechanisms. Are changes in RNA polymerase II levels upon MYCN activation more pronounced at promoters located at MYCN hubs? Do changes in MYCN-enriched chromatin contacts upon TFIIIC5 depletion somehow correlate with alterations in RNA polymerase II levels? Performing similar cross-comparisons as in Figure 3C may help address this issue. Furthermore, it not clear how the authors concluded that MYCN/TFIIIC5-bound genes are not part of these so-called promoter hubs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In Figure 3C we show that RNAPII levels are more pronounced upon MYCN activation at promoters located at MYCN hubs. Additionally, we show non-phosphorylated ChIP-seq on TSS and RNAPII-pSer2 ChIP-seq on TES density plots for promoters with MYCN interactions in the Figure for the Reviewers (Figure 3). We found no other difference than binding compared to the overall global analysis for all expressed genes showed in Figure 2B and Figure 2C. This goes on the same direction of the high expression observed of those genes in MYCN interactions observed in Figure 3C.</p>
<p>The changes observed in Figures 2B and 2C are global and do include the promoters with MYCN interactions. At the same time, it is required a higher number of replicates to statistically distinguish the MYCN interaction differences between TFIIIC5 presence and depletion. We acknowledge this limitation, and we therefore restrain any attempt towards this end. We base our conclusions on the other parts of the manuscript and on our previous studies that show that MYCN recruits TFIIIC, BRCA1, and the exosome to promoter proximal regions 1,4,10.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Figure 5: According to the PLA results, activation of MYCN could enhance RNA polymerase II-NELFE interaction in a TFIIC5-dependent manner. Considering the raised issues regarding the use of the 8WG16 antibody, this result might be of relevance.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, PLA does not seem to be the optimal technique to address these questions, and I would rather suggest performing ChIP-qPCR experiments for all the factors to be compared. Finally, do the authors conclude that the TFIIIC5 effect on MYCN-dependent changes in RNA polymerase II depends upon the recruitment of EXOSC5 and BRCA1? If so, it would be interesting to determine whether depletion of these factors phenocopies the effects observed with TFIIC5.</p>
