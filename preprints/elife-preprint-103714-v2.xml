<title>Abstract</title><p><italic>Salmonella</italic> is a major foodborne pathogen that can effectively replicate inside host macrophages to establish life-threatening systemic infections. <italic>Salmonella</italic> must utilize diverse nutrients for growth in nutrient-poor macrophages, but which nutrients are required for intracellular <italic>Salmonella</italic> growth is largely unknown.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Salmonella</italic> is a major foodborne pathogen worldwide that can cause self-limiting gastroenteritis or life-threatening systemic disease in a wide range of animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Fàbrega &amp; Vila, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Ohl &amp; Miller, 2001</xref>). <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection remains a significant global public health concern. An estimated 93.8 million cases of gastroenteritis and 27 million cases of systemic diseases caused by <italic>Salmonella</italic> species occur annually worldwide, with 355,000 deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Majowicz et al., 2010</xref>). The ability to survive and replicate in host macrophages is a key determinant for <italic>Salmonella</italic> to induce systemic infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Fields, Swanson, Haidaris, &amp; Heffron, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">LaRock, Chaudhary, &amp; Miller, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Leung &amp; Finlay, 1991</xref>). After internalization by macrophages, <italic>Salmonella</italic> delivers a set of more than 30 effector proteins to the macrophage cytoplasm, mainly through a type III secretion system (T3SS) encoded by <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenicity island-2 (SPI-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Pillay et al., 2023</xref>). SPI-2 effectors manipulate diverse cellular processes to promote the formation of a membrane-bound compartment, termed the <italic>Salmonella</italic>-containing vacuole (SCV), a niche where <italic>Salmonella</italic> resides and grows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Castanheira &amp; García-Del Portillo, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rosenberg, Riquelme, Prince, &amp; Avraham, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Steeb et al., 2013</xref>). SCV protects <italic>Salmonella</italic> from contact with antimicrobial agents in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Figueira &amp; Holden, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Li et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, SPI-2 effectors induce the formation of specific tubular membrane compartments that extend from the SCV, known as <italic>Salmonella</italic>-induced filaments (SIFs). These filaments allow <italic>Salmonella</italic> to access various types of endocytosed nutrients, thereby facilitating efficient replication within macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Brumell, Tang, Mills, &amp; Finlay, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Liss et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Rajashekar, Liebl, Seitz, &amp; Hensel, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>As the SCV of macrophages is a nutrient-poor environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Fields et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kehl, Noster, &amp; Hensel, 2020</xref>), to effectively replicate in the SCV, <italic>Salmonella</italic> needs to acquire a wide range of host nutrients or host-derived metabolites and synthesize metabolites <italic>de novo</italic> that cannot be sufficiently accessed from the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dandekar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Röder, Felgner, &amp; Hensel, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Tuli &amp; Sharma, 2019</xref>). Nutrients/metabolites are used by intracellular <italic>Salmonella</italic> either as carbon sources to generate energy or for the synthesis of fatty acids and proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dandekar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Steeb et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, several metabolites were found to be employed by <italic>Salmonella</italic> as environmental cues to induce the expression of virulence genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Jiang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">X. Wang et al., 2023</xref>). In recent years, an increasing number of studies have focused on the intracellular nutrition of <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Bumann &amp; Schothorst, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Liss et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Röder et al., 2021</xref>); however, the nutrients that are required for <italic>Salmonella</italic> replication in macrophages remain largely unknown.</p>
<p>β-Alanine, also known as 3-aminopropionic acid (3-AP), is the only naturally occurring β-type amino acid and is found in all living organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Song, Zhang, Wang, Xu, &amp; Wei, 2023</xref>). β-Alanine can be synthesized <italic>de novo</italic> by bacteria, fungi, and plants, whereas animals need to obtain it from food or generate it via the catabolism of cytosine and uracil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gojković, Sandrini, &amp; Piskur, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">L. Wang, Mao, Wang, Ma, &amp; Chen, 2021</xref>). In bacteria, β-alanine is synthesized <italic>via</italic> the decarboxylation of L-aspartate, a reaction catalyzed by L-aspartate decarboxylase (PanD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Begley, Kinsland, &amp; Strauss, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Schmitzberger, Smith, Abell, &amp; Blundell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">West, Traut, Shanley, &amp; O’Donovan, 1985</xref>). The <italic>panD</italic> gene is conserved among most bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Nozaki, Webb, &amp; Niki, 2012</xref>). Although β-alanine is a nonprotein amino acid that is not incorporated into proteins, it has important physiological functions in the metabolism of organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">L. Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Yuan et al., 2022</xref>). First, β-alanine forms a part of pantothenate (vitamin B5), which is the key precursor for the biosynthesis of coenzyme A (CoA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Webb, Smith, &amp; Abell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">White, Gunyuzlu, &amp; Toyn, 2001</xref>). CoA is an essential cofactor involved in many metabolic pathways, including the synthesis and degradation of fatty acids, pyruvate oxidation through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and the production of secondary metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Davaapil, Tsuchiya, &amp; Gout, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gout, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Sibon &amp; Strauss, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Theodoulou, Sibon, Jackowski, &amp; Gout, 2014</xref>). Second, β-alanine is a limiting precursor of carnosine, a nonenzymatic free radical scavenger and a natural antioxidant, with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Boldyrev, Aldini, &amp; Derave, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hoffman, Varanoske, &amp; Stout, 2018</xref>). In the past 15 years, β-alanine has become one of the most commonly used sports supplements worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bellinger, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hoffman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Huerta Ojeda, Tapia Cerda, Poblete Salvatierra, Barahona-Fuentes, &amp; Jorquera Aguilera, 2020</xref>). Although both <italic>Salmonella</italic> and host cells are capable of producing β-alanine, whether β-alanine contributes to the pathogenicity and intracellular growth of <italic>Salmonella</italic> remains unknown.</p>
<p>In this work, using targeted metabolic profiling, <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> infection assays, and many other molecular techniques, we demonstrated that the utilization of β-alanine is essential for <italic>Salmonella</italic> replication in host macrophages and virulence in mice. <italic>Salmonella</italic> acquires β-alanine both via the uptake of β-alanine from host macrophages and the <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of β-alanine. Further investigation revealed the molecular mechanism underlying the contribution of β-alanine to <italic>Salmonella</italic> intracellular replication and pathogenicity, wherein β-alanine promotes the expression of zinc transporter genes to facilitate the uptake of the essential micronutrient zinc by intracellular <italic>Salmonella,</italic> therefore promoting <italic>Salmonella</italic> replication in macrophages and subsequent systemic infection. Taken together, these findings demonstrate a correlation between <italic>Salmonella</italic> β-alanine utilization and zinc uptake during intracellular infection and provide new insights into the intracellular nutrition of <italic>Salmonella</italic>. The rate-limiting gene (<italic>panD</italic>) in the β-alanine synthesis pathway of <italic>Salmonella</italic> might be a future target for the prevention and treatment of this pathogen.</p>

<title>Host-derived β-alanine promotes <italic>Salmonella</italic> replication inside macrophages</title>
<p>To explore changes in the levels of different amino acids inside macrophages upon <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection, we performed targeted metabolomics analysis of mouse RAW264.7 macrophages that were mock-infected or infected with wild-type <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028s, STM) for 8 h using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrated a clear separation between the mock- and <italic>Salmonella</italic>-infected groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). A total of 26 free amino acids were analyzed, and 8 showed significant differences in abundance between the two groups (VIP (Variable Importance in the Projection) &gt; 1 and <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; FC (fold change) &gt;1.5 or &lt; 0.667) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C, D</xref>). Compared with those in the mock-infected group, the concentrations of 3 amino acids (L-hydroxyproline, L-citrulline and L-cysteine) were upregulated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), and 5 amino acids (L-asparagine, L-serine, L-aspartate, β-alanine and γ-aminobutyric acid) were downregulated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) in the <italic>Salmonella</italic>-infected group. Consistent with previous findings, intracellular serine concentrations were downregulated due to the reprogramming of macrophage glucose metabolism during <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Jiang et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>Salmonella</italic> can use host-derived aspartate and asparagine for growth in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Popp et al., 2015</xref>); therefore, the decrease in intracellular aspartate and asparagine upon <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection is likely due to their utilization by bacteria. Interestingly, β-alanine concentrations were also downregulated in the <italic>Salmonella</italic>-infected group (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting that intracellular <italic>Salmonella</italic> may use host-derived β-alanine for growth.</p>

</fig>
<p>To investigate whether host-derived β-alanine can promote intracellular <italic>Salmonella</italic> replication, we added an additional 0.5, 1, 2, 4 mM β-alanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Schneider, Krämer, &amp; Burkovski, 2004</xref>) to the culture medium (RPMI) of RAW264.7 cells and then infected them with <italic>Salmonella</italic> to test the influence of β-alanine addition on the ability of <italic>Salmonella</italic> to replicate in macrophages. The results showed that the replication of <italic>Salmonella</italic> in RAW264.7 cells significantly (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) increased with the addition of 1, 2, or 4 mM β-alanine (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Furthermore, β-alanine enhanced <italic>Salmonella</italic> intracellular replication in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). The results suggest that host-derived β-alanine facilitates <italic>Salmonella</italic> replication inside macrophages. We then investigated whether β-alanine-mediated <italic>Salmonella</italic> growth promotion is due to the changes in antimicrobial activity of the macrophages. We observed that the addition of 1 mM β-alanine did not influence the ROS (reactive oxygen species) and RNS (reactive nitrogen species) levels in <italic>Salmonella</italic>-infected RAW264.7 cells (Figure 1_figure Supplement 1). Flow cytometry analysis indicated that the addition of 1 mM β-alanine did not affect the percentage of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages (CD86+) and anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages (CD163+) during <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection (Figure 1_figure Supplement 2), implying that the addition of β-alanine to macrophages does not change their immune response. Combining these results, we can further infer that <italic>Salmonella</italic> use host-derived β-alanine for intracellular growth.</p>
<p>Direct validation of <italic>Salmonella</italic> using host-derived β-alanine for intracellular growth requires a mutant that has a defect in β-alanine uptake. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> uptakes β-alanine via the transporter protein CycA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Schneider et al., 2004</xref>). However, the <italic>Salmonella</italic> Δ<italic>cycA</italic> mutant was able to use β-alanine as the sole carbon source for growth in minimal medium (Figure 1_figure Supplement 3), indicating that CycA is not a transporter for β-alanine in <italic>Salmonella</italic> and that other unknown β-alanine import mechanisms are involved. Consistent with these results, mutation of <italic>cycA</italic> did not influence the replication of <italic>Salmonella</italic> in RAW264.7 cells (Figure 1_figure Supplement 4) or colonization in mouse systemic tissues (liver and spleen; Figure 1_figure Supplement 5).</p>

<p>We then constructed the <italic>panD</italic> mutant strain Δ<italic>panD</italic> and compared the replication ability of the Δ<italic>panD</italic> strain and the <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium 14028s wild type (WT) strain in RAW264.7 cells.

The growth rates of Δ<italic>panD</italic> in LB medium and RPMI medium resembled those of the WT (Figure 2_figure Supplement 1, Figure 2_figure Supplement 2), indicating that the impaired intracellular replication ability of the mutant was not due to a growth defect. Moreover, the replication defect of Δ<italic>panD</italic> in RAW264.7 cells was relieved by the addition of 1 mM β-alanine to the RPMI medium (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>).

<title><italic>De novo</italic> β-alanine synthesis is critical for systemic <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection in mice</title>
<p>As replication in macrophages is a key determinant of systemic <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection, we reasoned that β-alanine synthesis also influences <italic>Salmonella</italic> systemic infection <italic>in vivo</italic>. To determine whether β-alanine influences systemic <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection, we conducted mouse infection assays using intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. This method allows <italic>Salmonella</italic> to disseminate directly to systemic sites <italic>via</italic> the lymphatic and bloodstream system, bypassing the need for intestinal invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Pandeya et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Silva et al., 2016</xref>). BALB/c mice were infected by i.p. injection of 5,000 CFU of WT, Δ<italic>panD</italic>, or the complemented strain c<italic>panD</italic>. The survival rate, body weight, bacterial burden in the liver and spleen, and liver histopathological alterations of the infected mice were measured (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The WT-infected mice exhibited high lethality and marked loss of body weight within 5 days, and all mice died within 9 days of infection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B, C</xref>). In contrast, the Δ<italic>panD</italic>-infected mice displayed significantly improved survival rates and body weights, and no mice died within the 10-day surveillance period (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B, C</xref>). Consistent with these results, the bacterial burden in the liver and spleen of the Δ<italic>panD</italic>-infected mice was significantly decreased, and the body weight was significantly increased compared with that of the WT-infected mice on day 3 postinfection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>).

Complementation of Δ<italic>panD</italic> with <italic>panD</italic> restored the bacterial count in each macrophage to WT level (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Furthermore, H&amp;E staining revealed increased aggregation of inflammatory cells and pyknosis in the livers of the WT-infected mice on day 5 postinfection, while these histopathological alterations were obviously reduced in the livers of Δ<italic>panD</italic>-infected mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>).

<title>β-Alanine is involved in the regulation of several metabolic pathways in <italic>Salmonella</italic></title>
<p>To explore the mechanism(s) associated with β-alanine-mediated promotion of <italic>Salmonella</italic> replication in macrophages and <italic>in vivo</italic> virulence, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to reveal the differences in gene transcripts between <italic>Salmonella</italic> WT and Δ<italic>panD</italic> strains grown in N-minimal medium.

Remarkable transcriptional changes were observed due to the mutation of <italic>panD</italic>. Compared with those in the WT strain, 1379 genes were differentially expressed in the Δ<italic>panD</italic> strain, with 561 upregulated genes and 618 downregulated genes (fold change ≥ 2 and <italic>P</italic> value &lt; 0.05; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>).

Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis also revealed a high frequency of terms related to metabolism, including amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism, and nucleotide metabolism (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>).

<p>Further analysis of the downregulated DEGs (activated by PanD) revealed that mutation of <italic>panD</italic> decreased the expression of genes involved in 7 pathways that are associated with the virulence of <italic>Salmonella</italic> or other bacterial pathogens, including methionine metabolism, fatty acid β-oxidation, histidine biosynthesis, and the transport of zinc, galactose, potassium, and polyamine (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Zinc and potassium uptake are associated with the virulence of <italic>Salmonella</italic> (zinc acquisition promotes <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium virulence in mice, and potassium acquisition promotes <italic>Salmonella</italic> Enteritidis virulence in chickens) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ammendola et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Battistoni, Ammendola, Chiancone, &amp; Ilari, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ilari et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Liu et al., 2013</xref>), while the remaining 5 pathways are involved in the pathogenicity of other pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Basavanna et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">de Paiva et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Feldman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lauriano et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Martínez-Guitián et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, the expression of the LysR-type transcriptional regulator LeuO, which activates the expression of the <italic>leuABCD</italic> leucine synthesis operon and numerous virulence genes in <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dillon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Guadarrama, Villaseñor, &amp; Calva, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hernández-Lucas et al., 2008</xref>), was also downregulated in the Δ<italic>panD</italic> strain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). In line with the decreased expression of <italic>leuO</italic>, the expression of <italic>leuABCD</italic> was downregulated in the Δ<italic>panD</italic> strain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>).</p>
<p>We selected 16 downregulated DEGs (including the regulatory gene <italic>leuO</italic> and genes from the above 7 pathways) for qRT-PCR analysis. The results showed that the expression of all 16 genes significantly (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) decreased in the Δ<italic>panD</italic> mutant compared with the WT strain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>), and complementation of Δ<italic>panD</italic> with <italic>panD</italic> restored the gene expression to the WT level (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>), thus confirming the positive regulation of these pathways and LeuO by β-alanine.</p>
<p><italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenesis largely depends on virulence genes encoded by <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenicity islands (SPIs), with SPI-1 to SPI-5 being well-characterized for their involvement in <italic>Salmonella</italic> virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Han et al., 2024</xref>). SPI-2 gene expression is essential for <italic>Salmonella</italic> replication in macrophages and systemic infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Deng et al., 2017</xref>), yet the expression of SPI-2 genes was unaffected by <italic>panD</italic> mutation (Figure 4_figure Supplement 1). Moreover, the gene expression of four other virulence-associated SPIs, SPI-1, SPI-3, SPI-4, and SPI-5, is also unaffected by <italic>panD</italic> mutation (Figure 4_figure Supplement 2, Figure 4_figure Supplement 3).</p>
<p>Taken together, these data suggest that β-alanine might promote <italic>Salmonella</italic> intracellular replication and virulence by activating virulence-associated pathway(s) or activating the virulence-associated regulator LeuO, rather than by activating the expression of virulence genes encoded within pathogenicity islands.</p>

<p>Next, we inactivated the 7 downregulated pathways mentioned above, as well as the regulatory gene <italic>leuO</italic> in <italic>Salmonella,</italic> to uncover the mechanism(s) by which β-alanine promotes <italic>Salmonella</italic> virulence <italic>in vivo</italic>.

The addition of 100 μM zinc to RPMI medium increased the replication of Δ<italic>panD</italic> in RAW264.7 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>), while the addition of 1 mM β-alanine to RPMI medium did not increase the replication of Δ<italic>znuA</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>), suggesting that the impaired replication due to the decrease in β-alanine can be relieved by zinc supplementation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Replication within host macrophages is a crucial step for <italic>Salmonella</italic> to cause life-threatening systemic infection in the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bomjan, Zhang, &amp; Zhou, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lathrop et al., 2015</xref>), while the crosstalk between <italic>Salmonella</italic> and macrophages at the metabolic interface is critical for intracellular <italic>Salmonella</italic> replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dandekar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Herrero-Fresno &amp; Olsen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Lynch &amp; Lesser, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Rosenberg et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Thompson, Fulde, &amp; Tedin, 2018</xref>). Emerging evidence suggests that several metabolites affect the replication of <italic>Salmonella</italic> in macrophages. The promotion of intracellular replication by metabolites is possibly achieved in three ways: i) metabolites are utilized by <italic>Salmonella</italic> as nutrients for intracellular growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bowden, Rowley, Hinton, &amp; Thompson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Eisenreich, Dandekar, Heesemann, &amp; Goebel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">J. Wang et al., 2021</xref>); ii) <italic>Salmonella</italic> senses metabolites as environmental cues to activate the expression of virulence genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Jiang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">X. Wang et al., 2023</xref>); and iii) metabolites can regulate the immune responses of macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Michelucci et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Peace &amp; O’Neill, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Yang &amp; Cong, 2021</xref>). In this study, we demonstrated that <italic>Salmonella</italic> promotes its replication inside macrophages by utilizing both host- and bacterial-derived β-alanine (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). We showed that β-alanine promotes <italic>Salmonella</italic> intracellular replication and systemic infection partially by increasing the expression of zinc transporter genes and therefore the uptake of zinc by intracellular <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). Therefore, this work identified another metabolite that can influence the replication of <italic>Salmonella</italic> in macrophages and illustrated the mechanism by which β-alanine promotes intracellular <italic>Salmonella</italic> replication.</p>
<p>We observed that <italic>Salmonella</italic>-infected macrophages contained lower β-alanine levels than mock-infected macrophages, while β-alanine supplementation in the cell medium increased the replication of <italic>Salmonella</italic> in macrophages, revealing that <italic>Salmonella</italic> uptakes host-derived β-alanine to promote intracellular replication. In addition, a deficiency in the biosynthesis of β-alanine (<italic>via</italic> mutation of the rate-limiting gene <italic>panD</italic>) reduced <italic>Salmonella</italic> replication in macrophages and systemic infection in mice, suggesting that <italic>Salmonella</italic> also utilizes bacterial-derived β-alanine to promote intracellular replication and pathogenicity. It is known that bacteria are quite stringent with their energy resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bergkessel, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bosdriesz, Molenaar, Teusink, &amp; Bruggeman, 2015</xref>), while the results of this work indicate that either acquisition from the host or <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of β-alanine is critical for <italic>Salmonella</italic> replication inside macrophages. We speculate that <italic>Salmonella</italic> relies on a large amount of β-alanine to efficiently replicate in macrophages, thereby highlighting the importance of β-alanine for <italic>Salmonella</italic> intracellular growth. Nevertheless, unlike the closely related species <italic>E. coli</italic>, which takes up β-alanine via the transporter protein CycA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Schneider et al., 2004</xref>), <italic>Salmonel la</italic> does not use CycA to uptake β-alanine, implying the presence of other yet unknown β-alanine import mechanisms in <italic>Salmonella</italic>.</p>
<p>Several amino acids, including lysine, proline, arginine, aspartate and asparagine, have previously been reported to be associated with the pathogenicity of <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Popp et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Steeb et al., 2013</xref>). These amino acids are involved in the synthesis of proteins in <italic>Salmonella</italic>. In contrast, β-alanine is not incorporated into proteins but can participate in the regulation of bacterial activity through the synthesis of pantothenate and CoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Webb et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">White et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Yuan et al., 2022</xref>). Accordingly, our transcriptome data showed that a deficiency in β-alanine biosynthesis affected the expression of <italic>Salmonella</italic> genes involved in a series of important metabolic pathways. Importantly, although β-alanine does not influence the gene expression of SPIs, it activates methionine metabolism; fatty acid β-oxidation; histidine biosynthesis; and the transport of zinc, galactose, potassium, and polyamine, which have been previously known to be associated with the virulence of <italic>Salmonella</italic> and other bacterial pathogens. Further analysis revealed that β-alanine promotes <italic>Salmonella</italic> intracellular replication and systemic infection partially by promoting the uptake of zinc. As for the other virulence-related metabolic pathways activated by β-alanine, methionine metabolism, fatty acid β-oxidation, and histidine biosynthesis contribute to the virulence of <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Basavanna et al., 2013</xref>)<italic>, Yersinia pestis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Feldman et al., 2016</xref>), and <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Martínez-Guitián et al., 2019</xref>), respectively; the uptake of galactose and polyamine influences the pathogenicity of <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lauriano et al., 2004</xref>) and the avian pathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">de Paiva et al., 2016</xref>), respectively; and the uptake of potassium is associated with the virulence of <italic>Salmonella</italic> Enteritidis in chickens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). However, blocking these pathways did not influence the systemic <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium infection in mice, implying that different bacterial pathogens adopt different virulence strategies to establish infection. Determining other mechanism(s) by which β-alanine promotes the intracellular replication and systemic infection of <italic>Salmonella</italic> require further investigation.</p>
<p>We observed that β-alanine also activates the expression of the LysR-type transcriptional regulator LeuO, which is known to regulate the expression of a wide variety of <italic>Salmonella</italic> genes that impact the stress response and virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dillon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Guadarrama et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hernández-Lucas et al., 2008</xref>). Typically, LeuO activates the synthesis of the quiescent porins OmpS1 and OmpS2, which are required for <italic>Salmonella</italic> virulence in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">De la Cruz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Fernández-Mora, Puente, &amp; Calva, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Rodríguez-Morales et al., 2006</xref>). Consistent with the positive regulation of OmpS1 and OmpS2 by LeuO, lack of <italic>leuO</italic> in <italic>Salmonella</italic> also attenuated virulence in a mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Rodríguez-Morales et al., 2006</xref>). However, the attenuated phenotypes of the <italic>leuO</italic> mutant in mice were not evident after i.p. injection relative to oral infection, as a previous report showed that the competitive index for the <italic>leuO</italic> mutant indicated approximately 1,000-fold reduced colonization in mouse systemic tissues after oral infection but much less reduced colonization after i.p. injection (less than 10-fold) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Rodríguez-Morales et al., 2006</xref>). These results imply that LeuO might be predominantly associated with the invasion and intestinal infection of <italic>Salmonella</italic> but is weakly implicated in <italic>Salmonella</italic> intracellular replication and systemic infection. Therefore, it is not surprising that lack of <italic>leuO</italic> did not significantly affect <italic>Salmonella</italic> colonization in the systemic tissues of mice after i.p. injection, as revealed by our results.</p>
<p>Zinc is an essential micronutrient for all living organisms and is used as a cofactor for various enzymes and proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bock, Müller, &amp; Blankenfeldt, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ilari et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Tan, Bramlett, &amp; Lindahl, 2004</xref>). In bacteria, zinc-binding proteins account for approximately 5% of the bacterial proteome and play crucial roles in bacterial metabolism and virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Andreini, Banci, Bertini, &amp; Rosato, 2006</xref>). Knockout of the zinc transporter ZnuABC reduces the virulence of <italic>Salmonella</italic>, <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic>, <italic>Haemophilus ducreyi</italic>, <italic>Moraxella</italic>, and urinary tract pathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (UPEC) in the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ilari et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, zinc is also utilized by <italic>Salmonella</italic> to subvert the antimicrobial host defense of macrophages by inhibiting NF-кB activation and impairing NF-кB-dependent bacterial clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Jennings, Esposito, Rittinger, &amp; Thurston, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, the efficient acquisition of zinc may be crucial for <italic>Salmonella</italic>’s survival and replication within macrophages, where zinc availability is limited (<italic>Infect Immun.</italic> 2007, 75(12):5867-76; <italic>Biochim Biophys Acta.</italic> 2016, 1860(3):534-41). It has been reported that <italic>Salmonella</italic> utilizes the high-affinity ZnuABC zinc transporter to optimize zinc availability in host cells (<italic>Infect Immun.</italic> 2007, 75(12):5867-76). In this study, we found that β-alanine can increase the expression of the zinc transporter genes <italic>znuABC</italic>, which could represent an additional mechanism for the efficient zinc uptake of <italic>Salmonella</italic> in macrophages. The results demonstrate a correlation between <italic>Salmonella</italic> β-alanine utilization and zinc uptake during intracellular infection and provide evidence that β-alanine can influence the macrophage immune response by acting on zinc uptake.</p>
<p>Overall, our findings suggest a model in which <italic>Salmonella</italic> exploits host- and bacterial-derived β-alanine to efficiently replicate in host macrophages and cause systemic disease. We propose that <italic>Salmonella</italic> requires a large amount of β-alanine during intracellular infection. The utilization of β-alanine promotes <italic>Salmonella</italic> uptake of the essential micronutrient zinc, which was previously shown to be required for the metabolic needs of intracellular <italic>Salmonella</italic> and to subvert the antimicrobial defense of macrophages by <italic>Salmonella</italic>. These observations provide new insight into <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenesis and the crosstalk between <italic>Salmonella</italic> and macrophages during intracellular infection. Considering that the <italic>panD</italic> gene is present in the genomes of all <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains and that mutation of <italic>panD</italic> markedly reduced <italic>Salmonella</italic> replication ability in macrophages, as well as virulence in the mouse model, this gene may be used as a potential target to control systemic <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection.</p>

The zinc concentration in mouse liver was determined using a zinc fluorescence probe (Zinquin ethyl ester, MKBio, MX4516) following the manufacturer’s instructions and normalized by the cell count.</p>
<p>To assess the zinc level in RAW 264.7 macrophages, RAW 264.7 cells were infected with <italic>Salmonella</italic> WT or Δ<italic>panD</italic> for 8 hours. The infected cells were washed three times with PBS, and zinc concentration was measured using a zinc fluorescence probe (Zinquin ethyl ester, MKBio, MX4516) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The zinc concentration was normalized by the cell count.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The data are presented as the mean ± SD. All in vitro experiments were conducted in duplicate and repeated at least three times (n ≥ 3). Mouse assays were performed twice, with at least two mouse (n ≥ 2) in each injection group, and the combined data from the two experiments was used for statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad InStat software (version GraphPad Prism 9.5.1, San Diego, CA, USA) with two-sided Student’s <italic>t</italic> tests, one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA, log-rank Mantel–Cox tests, or Mann-Whitney U tests according to the test requirements (as stated in the figure legends). A <italic>P</italic> value &lt; 0.05 indicated a statistically significant difference. ns represents no statistical significance.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Ma &amp; Yang et al. report a new investigation aimed at elucidating one of the key nutrients S. Typhimurium (STM) utilizes with the nutrient-poor intracellular niche within macrophage, focusing on the amino acid beta-alanine. From these data, the authors report that beta-alanine plays important roles in mediating STM infection and virulence. The authors employ a multidisciplinary approach that includes some mouse studies, and ultimately propose a mechanism by which panD, involved in B-Ala synthesis, mediates regulation of zinc homeostatisis in Salmonella.</p>
<p>Strengths and weaknesses:</p>
<p>The results and model are adequately supported by the authors' data. Further work will need to be performed to learn whether the Zn2+ functions as proposed in their mechanism. By performing a small set of confirmatory experiments in S. Typhi, the authors provide some evidence of relevance to human infections.</p>
<p>Impact:</p>
<p>This work adds to the body of literature on the metabolic flexibility of Salmonella during infection that enable pathogenesis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Salmonella is interesting due to its life within a compact compartment, which we call SCV or Salmonella containing vacuole in the field of Salmonella. SCV is a tight-fitting vacuole where the acquisition of nutrients is a key factor by Salmonella. The authors among many nutrients, focussed on beta-alanine. It is also known that Salmonella requires beta-alanine from many other studies. The authors have done in vitro RAW macrophage infection assays and In vivo mouse infection assays to see the life of Salmonella in the presence of beta-alanine. They concluded by comprehending that beta-alanine modulates the expression of many genes including zinc transporters which is required for pathogenesis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Made a couple of knockouts in Salmonella and did transcriptomic to understand the global gene expression pattern</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Transport of Beta-alanine to SCV is not yet elucidated. Is it possible to determine whether the Zn transporter is involved in B-alanine transport?</p>
<p>Beta-alanine can also be shuttled to form carnosine along with histidine. If beta-alanine is channelled to make more carnosine, then the virulence phenotypes may be very different.</p>
<p>Some amino acid transporters can be knocked out to see if beta-alanine uptake is perturbed. Like ArgT transport Arginine, and its mutation perturbs the uptake of beta-alanine. What is the beta-alanine concentration in the SCV? SCVS can be purified at different time points, and the Beta-alanine concentration can be measured</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Ma, Yang et al. report a new investigation aimed at elucidating one of the key nutrients S. Typhimurium (STM) utilizes with the nutrient-poor intracellular niche within the macrophage, focusing on the amino acid beta-alanine. From these data, the authors report that beta-alanine plays an important role in mediating STM infection and virulence. The authors employ a multidisciplinary approach that includes some mouse studies and ultimately propose a mechanism by which panD, involved in B-Ala synthesis, mediates the regulation of zinc homeostasis in Salmonella. The impact of this work is questionable. There are already many studies reporting Salmonella-effector interactions, and while this adds to that knowledge it is not a significant advance over previous studies. While the authors are investigating an interesting question, the work has two important weaknesses; if addressed, the conclusions of this work and broader relevance to bacterial pathogenesis would be enhanced.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This reviewer appreciates the multidisciplinary nature of the work. The overall presentation of the figure graphics are clear and organized.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>First, this study is very light on mechanistic investigations, even though a mechanism is proposed. Zinc homeostasis in cells, and roles in bacteria infections, are complex processes with many players. The authors have not thoroughly investigated the mechanisms underlying the roles of B-Ala and panD in impacting STM infection such that other factors cannot be ruled out. Defining the cellular content of Zn2+ STM in vivo would be one such route. With further mechanistic studies, the possibility cannot be ruled out that the authors have simply deleted two important genes and seen an infection defect - this may not relate directly to Zn2+ acquisition.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your patient and thoughtful reading, as well as the constructive comments and advice regarding our manuscript. We have revised the manuscript based on your comments and suggestions.</p>
<p>You are correct that this work has not thoroughly investigated the mechanisms underlying the roles of β-alanine, <italic>panD</italic>, and zinc in impacting <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection. It is challenging to isolate sufficient amounts of <italic>Salmonella</italic> from infected cells or tissues and then measure the zinc concentration in the bacteria, and we have attempted to do so without success. Therefore, we investigated the zinc content in mouse liver and RAW264.7 cells infected with <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium 14028s wild-type (WT) and <italic>panD</italic> mutant (Δ<italic>panD</italic>), which can indirectly reflect zinc acquisition by intracellular <italic>Salmonella</italic>. We observed that the zinc content in Δ<italic>panD</italic>-infected mouse liver macrophages and RAW264.7 cells was increased compared with that in WT-infected mouse liver macrophages and RAW264.7 cells, respectively (Figures 5E and 6A). This implies that the <italic>panD</italic> gene and β-alanine are important for <italic>Salmonella</italic> to absorb zinc from host cells. This information has been added to the revised manuscript (lines 325-329, 344-348).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we concur that additional, unknown mechanisms are involved in the virulence regulation by β-alanine in <italic>Salmonella</italic>. Our findings indicate that the double mutant Δ<italic>panD</italic>Δ<italic>znuA</italic>, which cannot synthesize β-alanine nor uptake zinc, is more attenuated than the single mutant Δ<italic>znuA</italic> (Figures 5D and 6B). This suggests that the contribution of β-alanine to <italic>Salmonella's</italic> virulence is partially dependent on zinc acquisition. We have revised the related descriptions throughout the manuscript for clarity (lines 31, 304, 341,1056, 1068).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Second, the authors hint at their newly described mechanism/pathway being important for disease and possibly a target for therapeutics. This claim is not justified given that they have employed a single STM strain, which was isolated from chickens and is not even a clinical isolate. The authors could enhance the impact of their findings and relevance to human disease by demonstrating it occurs in human clinical isolates and possibly other serovars. Further, the use of mouse macrophage as a model, and mice, have limited translatability to human STM infections.</p>

<p>We thank you for your comments and advice on our manuscript and are delighted to accept them. <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium causes systemic disease in mice, which is similar to the symptoms of typhoid fever in humans and has been widely used to explore the pathogenesis of <italic>Salmonella</italic>. Based on your comment, we have now performed additional experiments to confirm several key points of our findings in another typical <italic>Salmonella</italic> serovar, <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhi, which is a human-limited serovar and the cause of typhoid fever in humans (PLoS Pathog. 2012, 8(10):e1002933).</p>
<p>We constructed the <italic>panD</italic> mutant strain (Δ<italic>panD</italic>) in the <italic>S.</italic> Typhi strain Ty2 and  subsequently compared the replication of Δ<italic>panD</italic> with that of the Ty2 wild-type in the human THP-1 monocyte like cell line (ATCC TIB-22) using gentamicin protection assays. The results showed that the replication of Δ<italic>panD</italic> in THP-1cells was reduced by 2.6-fold at 20 h post-infection compared to the Ty2 wild-type strain  (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) (Figure 2_figure Supplement 3), suggesting that <italic>panD</italic> also facilitates <italic>S.</italic> Typhi replication in human macrophages and may be involved in the systemic infection of <italic>S.</italic> Typhi in humans. This result has been included in the revised manuscript. (lines 203-210).</p>
<p>Based on these results, we speculate that <italic>PanD</italic> may serve as a potential target for treating <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection.</p>

The authors need to explain this result more carefully and define their acronyms. What is VIP, Log2 FC, etc.? What do the colors in Figure 1C mean? They are not defined. If possible, it would be more approachable to list these as molar concentrations, weight/cell, or number of molecules/cell. The authors should calculate an effect size for each of these data to help assess if the differences are meaningful.

<p>Thank you for the comment. <italic>Salmonella</italic> can induce gastroenteritis or systemic infection, which are associated with its capacity to invade intestinal epithelial cells and replicate within macrophages, respectively. In this study, using gentamicin protection assays and immunofluorescence analysis, we demonstrated that β-alanine is crucial for <italic>Salmonella</italic> replication inside macrophages. Since replication in macrophages is a key determinant of systemic <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection, we hypothesized that β-alanine also affects <italic>Salmonella</italic> systemic infection in vivo. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection enables <italic>Salmonella</italic> to disseminate directly to systemic sites via the lymphatic and bloodstream systems, bypassing the need for intestinal invasion (Microbiol Res. 2023, 275:127460; Int Immunopharmacol. 2016, 31:233-8). Thus, we conducted the mice infection assays via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection to ascertain whether β-alanine affects systemic <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection. We have included the description in the revised manuscript to enhance clarity. (lines 217-221).</p>

Additional experiments are needed to support the claim that &quot;data indicate that β-alanine promotes in vivo virulence of Salmonella, partially by increasing the expression of zinc transporter genes.&quot; Gene up- or down-regulation does not necessarily have any meaningful impact on function or activity. The authors here need an assay that confirms that the function of znuA is disrupted, such as examining the cell Zn2+ content in vivo at different levels of B-Ala exposure and/or panD activity. Moreover, more Zn2+ is not necessarily beneficial for STM, at levels too high zinc can exert cell toxicity.

</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the comment. It is challenging to isolate sufficient amounts of <italic>Salmonella</italic> from infected cells or tissues and then measure the zinc concentration in the bacteria, and we have attempted to do so without success. Therefore, we investigated the zinc content in mouse liver and RAW264.7 cells infected with <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium 14028s wild-type (WT) and <italic>panD</italic> mutant (ΔpanD), which can indirectly reflect zinc acquisition by intracellular <italic>Salmonella</italic>. We observed that the zinc content in Δ<italic>panD</italic>-infected mouse liver macrophages and RAW264.7 cells was increased compared with that in WT-infected mouse liver macrophages and RAW264.7 cells, respectively (Figures 5E and 6A). This implies that the <italic>panD</italic> gene and β-alanine are important for <italic>Salmonella</italic> to absorb zinc from host cells. This information has been added to the revised manuscript (lines 325-329, 344-348).</p>
<p>Zinc is essential for bacterial survival and growth, as zinc-binding proteins constitute approximately 5% of the bacterial proteome and play crucial roles in bacterial metabolism and growth (J Proteome Res. 2006, 5(11):3173-8; Future Med Chem. 2017, 9(9):899-910). Regarding <italic>Salmonella</italic>, zinc is also employed to undermine the antimicrobial host defense mechanisms of macrophages, by inhibiting NF-кB activation and impairing NF-кB-dependent bacterial clearance (J Biol Chem. 2018, 293(39):15316-15329; Infect Immun. 2017, 85(12):e00418-17). Thus, the efficient acquisition of zinc may play a crucial role in the survival and replication of <italic>Salmonella</italic> within macrophages, where zinc availability is extremely limited (Infect Immun. 2007, 75(12):5867-76; Biochim Biophys Acta. 2016, 1860(3):534-41). It has been reported that <italic>Salmonella</italic> utilizes the high-affinity ZnuABC zinc transporter to maximize zinc availability within host cells (Infect Immun. 2007, 75(12):5867-76). Here, we discovered that β-alanine can enhance the expression of the zinc transporter genes <italic>znuABC</italic>, which might serve as a supplementary mechanism for the efficient uptake of zinc by <italic>Salmonella</italic> within macrophages.</p>
<p>You are correct that more zinc is not necessarily beneficial for <italic>Salmonella</italic>, as excessive zinc can inhibit the growth of <italic>Salmonella</italic>. Considering that zinc availability is limited within macrophages and the <italic>znuABC</italic> genes are significantly upregulated when <italic>Salmonella</italic> resides inside macrophages (PLoS Pathog. 2015, 11(11):e1005262; <italic>Science</italic>. 2018, 362(6419):1156-1160), it is likely that zinc acts as a limiting factor and may not attain very high concentrations during <italic>Salmonella</italic>'s growth within macrophages.

<p>Thank you for the comment. As stated in the previous response, we were unable to directly assess the bacterial zinc concentration during <italic>Salmonella</italic> growth within macrophages.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Salmonella exploits host- and bacteria-derived β-alanine to efficiently replicate in host macrophages and cause systemic disease. β-alanine executes this by increasing the expression of zinc transporter genes and therefore the uptake of zinc by intracellular Salmonella.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The experiments designed are thorough and the claims made are directly related to the outcome of the experiments. No overreaching claims were made.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A little deeper insight was expected, particularly towards the mechanistic aspects. For example, zinc transport was found to be the cause of the b-alanine-mediated effect on Salmonella intracellular replication. It would have been very interesting to see which are the governing factors that may get activated or inhibited due to Zn accumulation that supports such intracellular replication.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your review and advice. To further investigate the mechanisms by which β-alanine, <italic>panD</italic>, and zinc influence <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection, we have conducted additional experiments as suggested. For instance, we examined the zinc content in mouse liver and RAW264.7 cells infected with <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium 14028s wild-type (WT) and <italic>panD</italic> mutant (Δ<italic>panD</italic>). This approach indirectly reflects zinc acquisition by intracellular <italic>Salmonella</italic>, as it is challenging to isolate sufficient amounts of the bacteria from infected cells or tissues for zinc concentration measurement. We observed that the zinc content in Δ<italic>panD</italic>-infected mouse liver macrophages and RAW264.7 cells was increased compared to that in WT-infected counterparts (Figures 5E and 6A). This suggests that the <italic>panD</italic> gene and β-alanine are crucial for <italic>Salmonella</italic> to absorb zinc from host cells. This new information has been included in the revised manuscript (lines 325-329, 344-348).</p>

<p>A few general clarifications and suggested experiments:</p>
<p>(1) Metabolome analysis: Salmonella can itself produce b-alanine. Given that it is isolated from infected cells where salmonella has scavenged b-alanine from host cytosol as well as produced it, how b-alanine levels went down in metabolome analysis is confusing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the comment. The method for targeted metabolic profiling is conducted as outlined in a recently published paper by our group (Nat Commun. 2021, 12(1):879). To prevent delays and changes in metabolite concentrations during the separation of bacterial contents from macrophages, we determined the combined metabolite concentrations directly from infected cells and <italic>Salmonella</italic>. We observed that each <italic>Salmonella</italic> cell contained only 0.01%-0.02% of the concentration of each corresponding combined metabolite. Approximately 94% of the infected macrophages contained no more than ten bacteria at 8 hours post-infection, confirming that the combined metabolites were predominantly from the host. We have included an explanation of this issue in the method section. (lines 557-560).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) What is the basal level of b-alanine produced by macrophages? How was 1 mM conc. chosen?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>According to our results, the content of β-alanine in uninfected RAW264.7 cells is 26-33 μM/10<sup>7</sup> cell (700-900 ng/10<sup>7</sup> cell). The 1 mM concentration was chosen based on a published report (Appl Microbiol Biotechnol. 2004, 65(5):576-82).</p>
<p>Additionally, we have supplemented the culture medium (RPMI) of RAW264.7 cells with 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mM β-alanine and subsequently infected them with <italic>Salmonella</italic> to assess the impact of β-alanine supplementation on the bacterium's replication within macrophages. Our observations revealed that the supplementation with 1, 2, and 4 mM β-alanine significantly (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) enhanced <italic>Salmonella</italic> replication in RAW264.7 cells.

These findings further support the notion that host-derived β-alanine facilitates <italic>Salmonella</italic> replication within macrophages.

We have investigated the levels of ROS (reactive oxygen species) and RNS (reactive nitrogen species) in <italic>Salmonella</italic>-infected RAW264.7 cells, both in the presence and absence of 1 mM β-alanine.

<p>i) Mouse infection assays were conducted twice, with at least 2 mice (n ≥ 2) in each injection group. The combined data from the two experiments was used for statistical analysis. This information has been added to the revised manuscript. (lines 678-681).</p>
<p>ii) As suggested, mice infected with the <italic>panD</italic> mutant (Δ<italic>panD</italic>) were administered β-alanine (500 mg/kg/day, Behav Brain Res. 2014, 272:131-40; Physiol Behav. 2015, 145:29-37) orally on a daily basis. On the third day post-infection, the bacterial burden in the liver and spleen and the body weight of the infected mice were measured. The results indicated that administering β-alanine to mice did not affect the bacterial burden of Δ<italic>panD</italic> in the liver and spleen nor did it influence the body weight of the infected mice (please refer to Author response image 1 below). It has been reported that β-alanine is a rate-limiting precursor for the biosynthesis of carnosine in mammals (Med Sci Sports Exerc. 2010, 42(6):1162-73; Neurochem Int. 2010, 57(3):177-88). Following supplementation, β-alanine may be rapidly synthesized into carnosine in mice, and the free β-alanine, particularly that which enters the macrophages of the liver and spleen, may be limited and insufficient to enhance <italic>Salmonella</italic> replication.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Salmonella is interesting due to its life within a compact compartment, which we call SCV or Salmonella containing vacuole in the field of Salmonella. SCV is a tight-fitting vacuole where the acquisition of nutrients is a key factor by Salmonella. The authors among many nutrients, focussed on beta-alanine. It is also known from many other studies that Salmonella requires beta-alanine. The authors have done in vitro RAW macrophage infection assays and In vivo mouse infection assays to see the life of Salmonella in the presence of beta-alanine. They concluded by comprehending that beta-alanine modulates the expression of many genes including zinc transporters which are required for pathogenesis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study made a couple of knockouts in Salmonella and did a transcriptomic investigation to understand the global gene expression pattern.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the question.

<p>(2) It is not clear how the Beta-alanine from the cytosol of the macrophage enters the SCV.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>According to the published report, translocation of SPI2 effector proteins induces the formation of specific tubular membrane compartments extend from the SCV, known as <italic>Salmonella</italic>-induced filaments (SIFs) (Traffic. 2001, 2(9):643-53; Traffic. 2007, 8(3):212-25; Traffic. 2008, 9(12):2100-16; Microbiology (Reading). 2012, 158(Pt 5):1147-1161). The membranes and lumens of both SIFs and SCVs form a continuous network, allowing vacuolar <italic>Salmonella</italic> to access various types of endocytosed materials (Front Cell Infect Microbiol. 2021, 11:624650; Cell Host Microbe. 2017, 21(3):390-402). We hypothesize that β-alanine may enter SCVs from the cytoplasm of macrophages via SIFs. This information has been included in the revised manuscript (lines 56-61).</p>

We speculate that <italic>Salmonella</italic> relies on a large amount of β-alanine to efficiently replicate in macrophages, thereby highlighting the importance of β-alanine for <italic>Salmonella</italic> intracellular growth. We have discussed this issue in the revised manuscript. (lines 392-396).</p>

<p>(4) 100% survival of animals infected with panD mutant is a bit of concern. What happens when beta-alanine is fed to mice and infected with panD mutant?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the comment. As suggested, mice infected with the <italic>panD</italic> mutant (ΔpanD) were administered β-alanine (500 mg/kg/day, as reported in Behav Brain Res. 2014, 272:131-40; Physiol Behav. 2015, 145:29-37) orally on a daily basis. On the third day post-infection, the bacterial load in the liver and spleen, as well as the body weight of the infected mice, were measured. The results indicated that administering β-alanine did not affect the bacterial load of Δ<italic>panD</italic> in the liver and spleen nor did it influence the body weight of the infected mice (refer to Author response image 1). It has been reported that β-alanine is a rate-limiting precursor for the biosynthesis of carnosine in mammals (Med Sci Sports Exerc. 2010, 42(6):1162-73; Neurochem Int. 2010, 57(3):177-88). Following supplementation, β-alanine may be rapidly converted into carnosine in mice, and the free β-alanine, particularly that which enters the macrophages of the liver and spleen, may be limited and insufficient to enhance <italic>Salmonella</italic> replication.</p>

<p>(5) How does beta-alanine from macrophages' cytosol enter the SCV.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing it out. According to published reports, the translocation of SPI2 effectors triggers the formation of specialized tubular membrane compartments, known as <italic>Salmonella</italic>-induced filaments (SIFs), which extend from the SCV (Traffic. 2001, 2(9):643-53; Traffic. 2007, 8(3):212-25; Traffic. 2008, 9(12):2100-16; Microbiology. 2012, 158:1147-1161). The membranes and lumens of SIFs and SCVs create a continuous network, allowing vacuolar <italic>Salmonella</italic> to access various types of endocytosed materials (Front Cell Infect Microbiol. 2021, 11:624650; Cell Host Microbe. 2017, 21(3):390-402). Consequently, it is plausible that β-alanine enters SCVs from the macrophage cytoplasm via SIFs. This information has been included in the revised manuscript.(lines 56-61).</p>

<p>(6) It would be essential to dissect the role of exogenous beta-alanine and the use of de novo synthesized beta-alanine.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that it is essential to dissect the role of exogenous β-alanine and the use of <italic>de novo</italic> synthesized β-alanine. Our results indicate that <italic>Salmonella</italic>-infected macrophages exhibited lower levels of β-alanine compared to mock-infected macrophages. Furthermore, β-alanine supplementation in the cell medium enhanced <italic>Salmonella</italic> replication within macrophages in a dose-dependent manner, revealing that <italic>Salmonella</italic> utilizes host-derived β-alanine to promote intracellular replication. Additionally, a deficiency in the biosynthesis of β-alanine, resulting from mutation of the rate-limiting gene <italic>panD</italic>, led to reduced <italic>Salmonella</italic> replication in macrophages and systemic infection in mice. This suggests that <italic>Salmonella</italic> also employs bacterial-derived β-alanine to enhance intracellular replication and pathogenicity.</p>
<p>We sought to identify the main transporters responsible for β-alanine uptake in <italic>Salmonella</italic>. Unfortunately, we have not yet found the transporter. We will address this issue in our future work.</p>
