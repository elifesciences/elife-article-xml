<abstract>
<p>Bacterial motility is typically studied in bulk solution, while their natural habitats often are complex environments. Here, we produced microfluidic channels that contained sediment-mimicking obstacles to study swimming of magnetotactic bacteria in a near-realistic environment. Magnetotactic bacteria are microor-ganisms that form chains of nanomagnets and that orient in Earth’s magnetic field. The obstacles were produced based on micro-computer tomography reconstructions of bacteria-rich sediment samples. We characterized the swimming of the cells through these channels and found that swimming throughput was highest for physiological magnetic fields. This observation was confirmed by extensive computer simulations using an active Brownian particle model, which were parameterized based on experimental trajectories, in particular with the trajectories near the sediment-mimicking obstacles, from which the interactions of the swimming bacteria with the obstacles were determined. The simulations were used to quantify the swimming throughput in detail. They showed the behavior seen in experiments, but also exhibited considerable variability between different channel geometries. The simulations indicate that swimming at strong fields is impeded by the trapping of bacteria in “corners” that require transient swimming against the magnetic field for escape. At weak fields, the direction of swimming is almost random, making the process inefficient as well. We confirmed the trapping effect in our experiments and showed that lowering the field strength allows the bacteria to escape. We hypothesize that over the course of evolution, magnetotactic bacteria have thus evolved to produce magnetic properties that are adapted to the geomagnetic field in order to balance movement and orientation in such crowded environments.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The motility of microorganism and other self-propelled particles has been studied extensively over the last years, aiming at an understanding of the physical mechanisms of micron-scale self-propulsion and of the rich collective behavior shown by such active particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. In addition, biomedical and environmental applications of functionalized self-propelled particles or microrobots are being developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Often microorganisms in their natural habitats and microrobots in some of their envisioned applications move in complex environments rather than in a homogeneous space. Therefore, the interactions of self-propelled particles with walls and obstacles play a key role in their motility and have received considerable attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>].</p>
<p>The complexity of an environment may arise on multiple scales: specifically, an environment may be geometrically complex, e.g., a porous medium, a space filled with obstacles or a maze [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], or the interaction with walls and obstacles may itself be complex and reflect a combination of hydrodynamic and steric interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] or even behavioral responses to the encounter with an obstacle, such as direction reversals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>] and effects of population heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>].</p>
<p>Both steric and hydrodynamic interactions with walls have been the subject of numerous theoretical and computational as well as experimental studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. A useful approach to wall interactions is the trapping of microorganisms in specifically designed microfluidic channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] or in microfluidic chambers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>], which is also of interest in itself to understand their behavior in confinement, which is again a common feature of complex natural habits, e.g. in porous media. Surprisingly, the behavior of microorganisms with different hydrodynamic mechanisms was seen to be rather similar under such confinement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. The motility of microorganism through arrays of obstacles or through porous materials has also been addressed in several experimental and theoretical studies, but mostly in geometric arrays of pillars of the same morphologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>].</p>
<p>In addition to obstacles, the complexity of an environment may reflect directional cues such as chemical gradients or external fields, to which the microrganisms show a behavioral response such as chemotaxis, phototaxis or magnetotaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Yet another common factor of complexity is fluid flow for active particles that swim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Thus, understanding the motility of microrganisms in such environments requires an understanding of the interplay of these different influences, which in general could either have synergistic effects or compete with each other in determining the direction of motion of a microorganism.</p>
<p>Here, we study the navigation of magnetotactic bacteria through a disordered obstacle array as an example for motility in a complex environment. Specifically, we are interested in the interplay of directed motility due to the magnetic field and the randomization of motion required to navigate the obstacles.</p>
<p>Magnetotactic bacteria are a group of bacteria that form a chain of specific organelles called magnetosomes, which contain magnetic nanoparticles and equip the cells with a magnetic moment. As a consequence, the cells align with magnetic fields, resulting in directional swimming of the cells, powered by their flagella, along the field lines of the magnetic field. In their natural habitats, these bacteria follow the magnetic field of the Earth, so they align to fields of the order of 50 <italic>µ</italic>T. The swimming of magnetotactic bacteria has been studied in free space, in the presence of oxygen gradients, in hydrodynamic flow, and in confinement to small chambers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we study their swimming in obstacle arrays that mimic their natural environment: magnetotactic bacteria are predominantly found in micro-oxic aquatic environments, near the oxic-anoxic transition zone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. Often, these micro-oxic regions are found in the sediment rather than in open water, so that magnetotactic bacteria typically live in a sedimentary environment that is sand or mud. We thus prepare microfluiudic environments that mimic these sediments and consist of arrays of irregularly shaped obstacles. We study the swimming of magnetotactic bacteria through these environments and ask how a magnetic field influences their throughput, as the field directs and constrains their motion, while navigation in the obstacle array requires the exploration of other swimming directions. Based on a combination of swimming experiments in the microfluidic environments and extensive computer simulations of an active Brownian particle model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>], we show that intermediate magnetic field strength of the intensity of the geomagnetic field enhance throughput, while strong fields suppress it. We show that the suppression is due to trapping of bacteria in corners of the obstacle array from which the bacteria can only escape by transiently swimming against the magnetic field direction. This situation is reminiscent of escape problems from statistical physics, but is not driven by thermal fluctuations, but rather by the interplay of active motility and interactions with the obstacle surfaces.</p>

<title>Characterization of sediment and construction of sediment-mimicking microfluidic channels</title>
<p>To study swimming of magnetotactic bacteria in a near-realistic sediment environment that resembles their natural habitat, we produced microfluidic channels that contained sediment-mimicking obstacles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and Supporting Figure S1). To that end, we first characterized a sediment sample in water from the magnetotactic bacteria-rich lake Grosser Zernsee (Potsdam, Germany). We determined a 3D reconstruction of the sample using micro-computer tomography (<italic>µ</italic>CT) with a resolution of 1.56 <italic>µ</italic>m (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a-d</xref>) and analyzed the sizes of sediment particles (sand grains) and of water gaps. In total, the sample consists of 61% sand and 39% water. The distribution of particle sizes is approximately a log-normal distribution with a mean particle diameter of 46 <italic>µ</italic>m (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>), which classifies this sediment as silt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. The water gap sizes follow a normal distribution with a mean of 43 <italic>µ</italic>m (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="570788v2_fig2.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>We next analyzed two-dimensional slices of the <italic>µ</italic>CT images at various depths of the sample to study if any difference is observed. This analysis returns similar values of the sand to water percentage (62 – 66% from top to bottom, see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2g</xref>, with the small difference possibly due to sedimentation of the sediment under gravity). The mean radii of circular fits to the grains varies from 68 to 62 <italic>µ</italic>m from bottom to top (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>), further potentially indicating a slight effect of sedimentation by gravity. This analysis provides the basis for the construction of our 2D microfluidic channels.</p>
<p>To realistically represent the porous environment where magnetotactic bacteria live, we constructed quasitwodimensional microfluidic channels based on the 2D <italic>µ</italic>CT images at different depths (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). These images (shown in Supporting Figure S2) were used as masks (see Methods), such that each sediment grain becomes an irregularly shaped pillar in our quasi-2D structure. Bacteria thus swim through an array of pillars that act as obstacles for their motion. In addition, we generated channels with cylindrical pillars by fitting circles to the two-dimensional grain images (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and Supporting Figure S2). These rounded-shaped pillars of different diameters are used for a comparison of our experiments with computer simulations below.</p>

<title>Swimming of magnetotactic bacteria through sediment-mimicking obstacle channels</title>
<p>With the sediment-mimicking channels at hand, we studied the motion of magnetotactic bacteria through those channels. A droplet of culture medium containing bacteria was injected into the entrance channel, which is placed under a custom-designed microscope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>], with a controlled magnetic field of either 0 <italic>µ</italic>T (field cancelled), 50 <italic>µ</italic>T (intensity of the geomagnetic field) or 500 (one order of magnitude larger than the geomagnetic field) <italic>µ</italic>T (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>) and Supporting Figure S3). In all cases, no external flow was imposed.</p>

<p>A) View of a channel, in which the entrance (IN) and exit regions (OUT) are indicated, in which the bacterial density was monitored. Bacteria enter the IN region through an inlet that connects to a syringe containing bacteria. The magnetic field points to the left. B) Cumulative bacterial intensity (measuring the cumulative arrival of bacteria) in these two regions, for three different field strengths. C) Bacterial throughput, quantified by the ratio of the cumulative intensities in the OUT and IN regions as function of the magnetic field. The reduction of throughput by <italic>B</italic> = 500<italic>µ</italic>T compared to <italic>B</italic> = 50<italic>µ</italic>T is significant (Mann-Whitney test, <italic>p &lt;</italic> 10<sup>−3</sup>), the increase between <italic>B</italic> = 0 and <italic>B</italic> = 50<italic>µ</italic>T is weakly significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.028), but agrees with the observation for a channel without obstacles in which the throughput increases monotonically with increasing field strength (Supporting Figure S5).</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="570788v2_fig3.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>We then imaged the entrance and exit regions of the microfluidic channel in an alternating fashion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>), with snapshots every 20 s and counted the number of bacteria in these two regions. These counts are noisy and some bacteria pass the channel rapidly, within the first few snapshots. The delay time after which the first bacteria reach the exit region of the channel could therefore not be reliably quantified. Instead, we determined the cumulative density of bacteria in the exit and in the entrance regions of the channel (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>) and used their ratio, determined 30 min after injecting the bacteria, as a measure of the throughput of bacteria through the channel (see Methods). We determined the throughput in this way for 20 different channels, 10 with irregularly shaped obstacles and 10 with cylindrical pillars (Supporting Figure S2). We obtained very similar results for channels with cylindrical pillars and with irregularly shaped pillars (Supporting Figure S4). However, we found the strength of the magnetic field to have a strong impact on the throughput, with a non-monotonic dependence on the field strength (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>). The maximal throughput was obtained for the intermediate field strength of 50 <italic>µ</italic>T, while without a field as well as with a field of 500 <italic>µ</italic>T the throughput was smaller. By contrast, for a channel without obstacles, the throughput increased monotonically with the field strength (Supporting Figure S5). This observation suggests that a magnetic field of a similar strength of the Earth’s field enhances the flux of bacteria through the obstacle channel, but a too strong or null magnetic field inhibits it.</p>

<p>To gain further insight into how magnetotactic bacteria navigate through these complex environments, we compared our experimental findings to numerical simulations. To this end, we modeled the magnetotactic bacteria as dipolar active Brownian particles that align in an external magnetic field and interact with obstacles and walls present in the simulation box (see Methods).</p>
<p>Most parameters of the model have been directly measured, only the interactions with the obstacles have to be parameterized by matching simulations to experimental data. When interacting with an obstacle or a wall, the active particles are subject to a repulsive force as well as a reorienting torque [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. The latter is parameterized by an interaction parameter <italic>α</italic>, the only crucial free parameter of our model. <italic>α</italic> has the units of length and is expected to be a fraction of the size of a bacterium. To adjust this parameter, we observed the motion of magnetotactic bacteria near the obstacles. When a bacterium meets an obstacle, it slides along the contour of that obstacle for some distance before leaving it again, as shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>. Similar behavior has been observed in other microorganisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. We observe the same behavior in the numerical simulations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>). Here, the sliding distance along an obstacle is greatly influenced by the surface torque parameter <italic>α</italic> (Supporting Figure S6). Therefore, we calculated distributions of the sliding distances for different values of <italic>α</italic> and compared these distributions to the one obtained from the experimental observations (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>). A good match is obtained for <italic>α</italic> = 0.2 <italic>µ</italic>m. Therefore, all the following numerical simulations where carried out with the interaction parameter set to <italic>α</italic> = 0.2 <italic>µ</italic>m.</p>

<p>When analyzing sliding distances from obstacles of different sizes and thus different curvatures, we saw only a weak dependence on the curvature in both experimental and simulated trajectories (Supporting Figures S6 and S7). However, our obstacles are all much larger than the size of the bacteria, so we cannot exclude a curvature dependence for obstacles comparable to their size. We noticed that in the experiments, the bacteria appeared to be slower while sliding along the walls compared to free swimming. This effect was neglected in the simulations.</p>
<p>Next, we simulated the motion of active dipolar particles representing the bacteria through channels with arrays of spherical obstacles (which may overlap as in the experiments with cylindrical pillars). We varied the magnetic field strength and, to obtain a detailed picture of the swimming paths along which bacteria navigate through these channels, simulated channels with differently arranged obstacles, using the same obstacle arrays as in the experiments. In each simulation, we placed 1000 particles at the entrance end of the channel and calculated their individual trajectories for <italic>N</italic><sub>steps</sub> = 1 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>6</sup> steps (corresponding to approximately 30 minutes).</p>
<p><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> shows the time averaged local densities of bacteria during the simulation in one such channel with an external magnetic field of 50 <italic>µ</italic>T pointing from left to right. In this heat map, shades of blue show the density of bacteria that did not arrive at the exit (right end of the channel) within the simulation time, while shades of red show the density of bacteria that did arrive, with purple resulting from a superposition of both color maps. Overall, bacteria are seen to move in a directed fashion, in the direction of the magnetic field (left to right). When they encounter a (single) obstacle, they move along its surface and then leave it, typically tangentially to the surface and in the direction of the magnetic field. In this way, the channel’s geometry organizes the trajectories into “natural paths”. However, when bacteria encounter overlapping obstacles, they can get trapped. Some examples of such traps are marked by green boxes in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>. To escape a trap, bacteria need to reorient temporarily against the direction of the magnetic field. While some traps allow a fraction of the bacteria to escape and eventually arrive at the exit (purple trajectories that turn red), others do not (blue trajectories). Blue trajectories typically end in a trap of the latter type.</p>

</fig>
<p><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a</xref> shows corresponding trajectories (again plotted as heat maps) for different strengths of the magnetic field. Increasing the magnetic field strength has two opposing effects: On the one hand, bacteria are on average more aligned with the direction of the magnetic field and the observed paths through the channel become more focused as their persistence length increases with increasing field. As a consequence, the bacteria are expected to cross the channel faster. For very weak fields, the bacteria explore the channel in an effectively diffusive manner; for the case of 50 <italic>µ</italic>T, we observed one dominant path through most of the channel. On the other hand, bacteria become more susceptible to trapping with increasing field. For a field of 500 <italic>µ</italic>T, no simulated bacterium crossed the channel within the simulation time and the path that was dominant at 50 <italic>µ</italic>T now ends in a trap, from which the bacteria can no longer escape at 500 <italic>µ</italic>T. This negative effect of the magnetic field arises because escape from traps requires that the bacteria transiently orient against the field. These effects thus have opposing influences on the throughput of the channel and provide an explanation for our observation that intermediate field strengths generate the highest throughput.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="570788v2_fig6.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>To quantify these observations, we determined the cumulative arrival of bacteria in the exit area, <italic>ϕ</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub>, which is plotted in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b</xref> as a function of time. This quantity also exhibits the non-monotonic behavior as a function of the magnetic field. We then performed extensive numerical simulations for a wide range of field strengths and for 10 different channels with different obstacle arrangements. We quantified the time of the first arrival (indicated by circles in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b</xref>) and the overall fraction of bacteria that arrived until the end of the simulation time <italic>ϕ</italic><sub>tot</sub> (crosses in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b</xref>) as functions of the field strength (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 c</xref>). The first arrival time decreases with increasing field strength, however, the poor throughput for weak fields is mostly due to the slow arrival of the bulk of the bacteria, while some bacteria still cross the channel on an almost direct path. The fraction of arrivals, by contrast, shows the non-monotonic behavior indicated by our experimental results. Results for different channels (grey lines in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 c</xref>) are qualitatively similar. Quantitatively, the arrival fraction <italic>ϕ</italic><sub>tot</sub> shows considerable dependence on the channel geometry, with maximal arrival fractions between 50 and 100 % and maximal throughput in the range between a few and a few tens of <italic>µ</italic>T. By contrast, the first-arrival time <italic>t</italic> <sub><italic>f</italic></sub> seems not to be affected by channel geometry (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 c</xref>). The observation of a pronounced maximum in the throughput of the channel as well as of the variability in throughput between channels in our simulations agree well with the experimental observations. However, the simulations show lower throughput as well as lower variability in throughput than the experiments in the case without a magnetic field. We attribute this difference to different initial conditions in experiment and simulations. In the simulations all bacteria start simultaneously at the beginning of the obstacle channel, while in the experiments they enter from the inlet and continue to do so during the experiments. The difference is expected to be most pronounced in the case of non-directional motion, i.e., for <italic>B</italic> = 0.</p>

<title>Escape from traps</title>
<p>Our simulations indicate that trapping of bacteria in the corners between overlapping obstacle pillars plays a crucial role for the non-monotonic dependence of the bacterial throughput on the magnetic field. We therefore investigated the escape from traps in more detail by simulating a large number of trap configurations with different geometric features. We first considered symmetric traps as shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7a</xref> and varied the strengths of the magnetic field and the trap depth <italic>d</italic> (by varying the overlap between two circular pillars with fixed radius <italic>r</italic>). In this case, particles escape symmetrically in both directions, with an escape time that is, in a good approximation, exponentially distributed (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7b</xref>). Varying the magnetic field strength results in an exponential dependence of the escape time on the field strength (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7c</xref>). This result indicates that the escape from a trap is similar to the classical problem of an escape from a potential well due to thermal fluctuations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>], even though the underlying fluctuations that orient the particle against the field are not of thermal origin here, but mostly result from the interaction of the active particle with the obstacle wall. Indeed, thermal-like distributions have been found for a related problem, the sedimentation of active particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>], specifically an exponential density profile characterized by an effective temperature. Such a description is however not generally possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. Likewise, we see an approximately exponential dependence on the trap depth <italic>d</italic> (blue data points in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7e</xref>). We also generated a library of traps without the symmetry restriction by choosing the pillar radii and the distance of their centers (parallel and perpendicular to the field) randomly. An example with corresponding escape trajectories is shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7d</xref>). This set of traps also results in a roughly exponential increase of the escape time <italic>τ</italic> with trap depth, however with large variability between different traps of the same depth (grey data points in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7e</xref>).</p>

<p>Finally, we asked whether trapping of bacteria in corners is directly visible in our experiments. For that, we focused on one trap, indicated by the triangular area in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> (inset) and tracked the bacterial density in that area over time. Indeed, we could see bacteria trapped in this corner as indicated by a constant bacterial density in the trap. We then reduced the field strength in two steps, first from 500 <italic>µ</italic>T to 50 <italic>µ</italic>T and then to 0 <italic>µ</italic>T. After both steps, we could observe a reduction of the bacterial density (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>), indicating the expected release of bacteria from the trap upon reduction of the field and providing direct evidence for trapping in our experiments.</p>

<title>Concluding remarks</title>
<p>In this study, we have used experiments in microfluidic channels and particle-based simulations to address the swimming of magnetotactic bacteria through an obstacle channel mimicking their natural habitat, sediment of a lake. We have shown that the efficiency with which the bacteria navigate through the obstacle array depends on the strength of the magnetic field. For weak fields, the bacteria motion is effectively diffusive and throughput is low, as the bacteria explore the channel in a largely random motion. For high fields, bacteria do not cross the channel as they get trapped in the corners that are created by overlapping cylindrical pillars. To escape from traps, they need to swim against the field, which becomes prohibitively difficult for strong fields. At intermediate field strength, notably comparable to the magnetic field of the Earth that they encounter in the natural habitat, the bacterial throughput is maximal. Hopping between traps has been described as a generic feature of active motion in porous environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. In our case, however, the escape from the traps does not only depend on the intrinsic properties of the bacteria’s swimming, but also the strength of the magnetic field and their interaction with the obstacle walls.</p>
<p>Our observation suggests that the ability to swim against the magnetic field, which usually directs the motion of the magnetotactic bacteria may be essential under some conditions such as the escape from traps studied here. This ability requires that the interaction with the magnetic field is not too dominant. Since in the natural habitat, the strength of the field is given by the magnetic field of the Earth and thus fixed, this might constrain the magnetic moment of magnetotactic bacteria. As a consequence, their alignment with a magnetic field of the strength of the Earth’s field will not be perfect, thus reducing the efficiency of magnetic steering. Indeed, the alignment of different strains of magnetotactic bacteria with a field comparable to the Earth field has been observed to be considerably below 100% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>].</p>
<p>The ability to swim against the direction of a magnetic field is also important for magneto-areotactic band formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. Contrary to the situation here, band formation requires swimming against the field direction for an extended amount of time. This is achieved by directional reversals, i.e., backward swimming that allows the bacteria to swim against the magnetic field without antiparallel alignment of their magnetic moment and the field. For escape from a trap, only transient swimming against the field is needed, so direction reversals may be less important here, even though they can also provide a mechanism for escape. In our previous work, we have shown that reversals are rare in <italic>M. gryphiswaldense</italic> under confinement and that they are not induced by collisions with walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. This may however be different in different species and could for example depend on the mode of propulsion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], which is rather diverse in magnetotactic bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. In general, it will be interesting to see how the competition between magnetic directionality and trapping is resolved in different species. Our microfluidic obstacle channel and our simulations provide tools for such future studies.</p>

For the creation of an aerotactic band and the subsequent selection of swimming bacteria, the growth medium was supplemented with 0.1% agar. Briefly, 1 mL of bacteria was inoculated into the bottom of a 15 mL Hungate tube filled with 10 mL of MSR-1 growth medium with 0.1% agar. The tube was sealed with a rubber cap pierced with a needle capped with a 0.2 <italic>µ</italic>m filter (Whatman) to allow the formation of an oxygen gradient. To select the North-seeking bacteria (i.e. swimming with the North of their magnet at their front in oxic conditions) in the formed band, the tube was put inside a pair of coils to apply a magnetic field parallel to the oxygen gradient, but pointing downwards to the anoxic region (equivalent to the situation that the bacteria experience in their natural habitat in the Northern Hemisphere). The bacteria were grown at 28 <sup><italic>∘</italic></sup>C and allowed to form an aerotactic band. Once the band had formed, the motile bacteria were selected by aspirating the band with a needle and culturing them for two passes in standard MSR-1 growth medium and microaerobic conditions.

The final population of North-seeking bacteria was estimated to be about 80% of the population. In oxic conditions as the ones in our experiment (where oxygen can freely diffuse through the PDMS into the microchannel), these bacteria swim with the North of their magnet at their front.

<title>Operation of the chip</title>
<p>The microfluidic system was filled with a syringe pump with MSR-1 standard growth medium at a flow rate of 15<italic>µ</italic>L·min<sup>-1</sup> and was incubated at room temperature for 30 min prior to its use. Subsequently, 25 <italic>µ</italic>mL of MSR-1 standard growth medium containing bacteria at an OD<sub>565</sub> of 0.1 were placed in the inlet and the bacteria were allowed to swim into the microchannel, placed under a custom-designed magnetic microscope equipped with three pairs of Helmholtz coils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Different magnetic fields intensities (<italic>B</italic> = 0, 50, 500 <italic>µ</italic>T) were applied parallel to the microchannel length. Bacteria were imaged with a 10x objective using phase contrast microscopy.</p>

<title>Monitoring of bacterial throughput</title>
<p>We counted the number of bacteria in the entry and exit regions of the channels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>) in snapshots taken every 20s in alternating order and summed the number in the exit region over all snapshots up to 30 min to obtain an estimate of the cumulative arrivals. These were normalized to the likewise cumulated counts in the entry region to account for differences in bacterial loading, resulting in the OUT:IN ratio plotted as a measure of throughput. The cumulated count was used in the normalization, because bacteria continue to enter into the entry region from the inlet during the experiment (this is different in our simulations, where all bacteria start at time zero at the beginning of the channel). The distribution of IN:OUT ratios at different field strengths were compared with a Mann-Whitney U test, pooling the results for different channels and excluding outliers with z-score<italic>&gt;</italic> 2.</p>

<title>Equations of Motion</title>
<p>We model a magnetotactic bacterium as an active Brownian sphere in two dimensions that has a permanent dipole moment <bold><italic>µ</italic></bold> = <italic>µ</italic> <bold><italic>ê</italic></bold> with the magnetic strength <italic>µ</italic> at the particle center [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. The magnetic moment is aligned with the orientation of the particle <bold><italic>ê</italic></bold>, which defines the direction of self-propulsion with speed <italic>v</italic><sub>0</sub>. The orientation of the particle is described by an angle <italic>φ</italic> in the 2d plane. The orientation vector is then given by <bold><italic>ê</italic></bold> = (cos <italic>φ</italic>, sin <italic>φ</italic>) and the position vector is given by <bold><italic>r</italic></bold> = (<italic>x, y</italic>). The two-dimensional equations of motion are then

where <italic>γ</italic><sub>T</sub> and <italic>γ</italic><sub>R</sub> are the translational and rotational drag coefficients, <bold><italic>ξ</italic></bold><sup>T</sup> is the translational stochastic force, and <italic>ξ</italic><sup><italic>R</italic></sup> is the rotational stochastic torque.

<italic>D</italic><sub>T</sub> and <italic>D</italic><sub>R</sub> are the corresponding diffusion coefficients.</p>
<p><bold><italic>F</italic></bold> and <italic>τ</italic> describe forces and torques acting on the particle. In this study, we do not include particle-particle interactions. Forces <bold><italic>F</italic></bold> thus result solely from interactions with the obstacles representing the sand grains and with the confining walls of the channel. These forces are described by a Weeks-Chandler-Andersen potential between the particle and a virtual particle inside the obstacle (i.e. sand obstacle or wall). The virtual particle is located with its surface at shortest distance to the particle (i.e. with its center at a distance <italic>σ/</italic>2 from the surface). <bold><italic>r</italic></bold><sub>S</sub> connects the virtual particle to the particle. The repulsive surface force <bold><italic>F</italic></bold><sup>S</sup> is then derived from the potential:

</disp-formula>
Here, <italic>ε</italic> calibrates the strength of the force.</p>
<p>The torques <italic>τ</italic> acting on the particle result from interactions with the obstacles (<italic>τ</italic><sub>S</sub>) and the applied external magnetic field (<italic>τ</italic><sub>B</sub>). The external magnetic field has magnitude <italic>B</italic> and is applied in the direction of the exit of the channel. Because the field is homogeneous, particles experience no force but an aligning torque <italic>τ</italic><sub>B</sub> = <italic>µB</italic> sin <italic>φ</italic>. In addition, a torque arises from steric and hydrodynamic interactions with the surfaces of the obstacles and channel walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. To model the reorientation of the bacteria near a surface, we introduce a surface torque

</disp-formula>
with a tuning parameter <italic>α</italic> (with dimension of length), which we determine by matching the sliding distances along an obstacle wall to experimental observations.</p>

<title>Simulations</title>
<p>We solve the equations of motion in two dimensions by using overdamped Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations. The following reduced units were used: time <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="570788v2_inline1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="570788v2_inline2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is the translational diffusion constant; position <bold><italic>r</italic></bold><sup>*</sup> = <bold><italic>r</italic></bold><italic>/σ</italic>; <italic>ε</italic>* = <italic>ε/k</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub><italic>T</italic>; field strength <italic>B</italic><sup>*</sup> = <italic>B/B</italic><sub>0</sub>, where <italic>B</italic><sub>0</sub> = 1 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−5</sup> T is the order of magnitude of the magnetic field strength of the earth; dipole strength <italic>µ</italic><sup>*</sup> = <italic>µB</italic><sub>0</sub><italic>/k</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub><italic>T</italic>. The dimensionless equations of motion were integrated for <italic>N</italic><sub>steps</sub> = 5 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>6</sup> time steps using the Euler-Maruyama method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]with a time step Δ<italic>t</italic><sup>*</sup> = 2 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−5</sup>. We note that, with this choice of dimensionless units, the self-propulsion velocity <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="570788v2_inline3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is identical to the Péclet number.</p>
<p>For simulations of swimming through obstacle channels, we use spherical obstacles with the same positions and diameters as the cylindrical pillars in our microfluidic channels. We simulated all 10 different obstacle arrays. In each case, we initiated 2000 bacteria at position <italic>x</italic> = 0 corresponding to the IN region and tracked their motion until they arrived at the end of the channel (with <italic>x</italic> ≥ 3495 <italic>µ</italic>m) or until the maximal simulated time (of 30 min).</p>
<p>For simulations of the escape from traps, traps with random parameters were constructed from two spherical obstacles as shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7 (a)</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">(d)</xref>. We simulated the escape of 100 bacteria from each trap to determine the escape time.</p>

<title>Sliding measurements and parameterization of obstacle interactions in the simulations</title>
<p><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 b</xref>) illustrates how we determined the sliding distance. The sliding distance is defined as the arc length (solid green arrow) that is covered by the center of mass trajectory (solid blue line) inside the sliding region (dotted green line). The sliding region was chosen to be slightly larger than the interaction region (orange dotted line), where <italic>F</italic><sup><italic>S</italic></sup> <italic>&gt;</italic> 0 and thus <italic>τ</italic><sup><italic>S</italic></sup> <italic>&gt;</italic> 0. The sliding region was set to 2 <italic>µ</italic>m, when measured from the obstacles’ surface. This choice allows to compare data from numerical simulations to the experiments. It corresponds to the spatial resolution Δ<italic>x</italic> ≈ 2 <italic>µ</italic>m of the microscope, which limits the precision with which the beginning and the end of contact with an obstacle surface can be identified.</p>
<p>Following that protocol, we measured the sliding distances in the absence of a magnetic field (<italic>B</italic> = 0) in the numerical simulations and experiment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 c</xref>)) For <italic>α</italic> = 0.2 <italic>µ</italic>m, the simulations match the experimentally measured sliding distances (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors present experimental and numerical results on the motility Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense MSR-1, a magnetotactic bacterium living in sedimentary environments. The authors manufactured microfluidic chips containing three-dimensional obstacles of irregular shape, that match the statistical features of the grains observed in the sediment via micro-computer tomography. The bacteria are furthermore subject to an external magnetic field, whose intensity can be varied. The key quantity measured in the experiments is the throughput ratio, defined as the ratio between the number of bacteria that reach the end of the microfluidic channel and the number of bacteria entering it. The main result is that the throughput ratio is non-monotonic and exhibits a maximum at magnetic field strength comparable with Earth's magnetic field. The authors rationalize the throughput suppression at large magnetic fields by quantifying the number of bacteria trapped in corners between grains.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>While magnetotactic bacteria general motility in bulk has been characterized, we know much less about their dynamics in a realistic setting, such as a disordered porous material. The micro-computer tomography of sediments and their artificial reconstruction in a microfluidic channel is a powerful method that establishes the rigorous methodology of this work. This technique can give access to further characterization of the microbial motility. The coupling of experiments and computer simulations lends considerable strength to the claims of the authors, because the model parameters (with one exception) are directly measured in the experiments.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The main weakness of the manuscript pertains to the comparison between simulations and experiments due to limitations in the tracking of bacteria in the experiments.</p>
<p>Impact:</p>
<p>Building on the present work, and refining the experimental setup may shed light on the microbial interactions in an environment such as soil which deserves further studies.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript reports results of a combined experimental and simulation study of magnetotactic bacteria in microfluidic channels containing sediment-mimicking obstacles. The obstacles were produced based on micro-computer tomography reconstructions of bacteria-rich sediment samples. The swimming of bacteria through these channels is found experimentally to display the highest throughput for physiological magnetic fields. Computer simulations of active Brownian particles, parameterized based on experimental trajectories are used to quantify the swimming throughput in detail. Similar behavior as in experiments is obtained, but also considerable variability between different channel geometries. Swimming at strong field is impeded by the trapping of bacteria in corners, while at weak fields the direction of motion is almost random. The trapping effect is confirmed in the experiments, as well as the escape of bacteria with reducing field strength.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a very careful and detailed study, which draws its main strength from the fruitful combination of construction of novel microfluidic devives, their use in motility experiments, and simulations of active Brownian particles adapted to the experiment.</p>
<p>
Based on their results, the authors hypothesize that magnetotactic bacteria may have evolved to produce magnetic properties that are adapted to the geomagnetic field in order to balance movement and orientation in such crowded environments. They provide strong arguments in favor of such a hypothesis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some of the issues touched upon here have been studied also in other articles. It would be good to extend the list of references accordingly and discuss the relation briefly in the text.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>In their rebuttal letter, the authors have responded in detail to all points raised in my previous report. They have revised their manuscript accordingly.</p>

<p><bold>eLife Assessment</bold></p>
<p>This study presents valuable experimental and numerical results on the motility of a magnetotactic bacterium living in sedimentary environments, particularly in environments of varying magnetic field strengths. The evidence supporting the claims of the authors is solid, although the statistical significance comparing experiments with the numerical work is weak. The study will be of interest to biophysicists interested in bacterial motility.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewers and editors for their careful reading and the constructive comments. With respect to the statement about weak statistical significance, we think that this statement mixes two separate issues, the significance of the difference between experiments at 0 and 50µT and the comparison of experiments with simulations. We have amended our manuscript to address both points as described below. The difference between the experiments at 0 and 50µT is indeed significant, and the discrepancy between experiments and simulations can be explained by unavoidable differences in the way we quantify bacterial throughput.</p>

The authors rationalize the throughput suppression at large magnetic fields by quantifying the number of bacteria trapped in corners between grains.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>While magnetotactic bacteria's general motility in bulk has been characterized, we know much less about their dynamics in a realistic setting, such as a disordered porous material. The micro-computer tomography of sediments and their artificial reconstruction in a microfluidic channel is a powerful method that establishes the rigorous methodology of this work.

The coupling of experiments and computer simulations lends considerable strength to the claims of the authors, because the model parameters (with one exception) are directly measured in the experiments.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The main weakness of the manuscript pertains to the discussion of the statistical significance of the experimental throughput ratio. Especially when comparing results at zero and 50 micro Tesla. The simulations seem to predict a stronger effect than seen in the experiments. The authors do not address this discrepancy.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their positive assessment and the detailed constructive remarks.</p>
<p>The increase in bacterial throughput between 0 and 50 µT is indeed more pronounced in the simulations than in the experiments, partly due to the fact that there is considerably more variability in the experimental data. We did two things to address this issue: (1) We performed additional statistical test addressing the difference between the experimental results at 0 and 50 µT. Indeed, the difference is only weakly significant (in contrast to the difference of either to 500µT). The increase is however consistent with the observation in the absence of obstacles in the channel, where we see a monotonous increase from 0 to 500 µT (Supp. Figure S5). We have added the test results in the caption of Fig. 3. (2) To address the difference between simulations and experiments, we added a section in Methods on how we determine the throughput and a short discussion in the Results section. The key points are that the initial condition is different in simulations and experiments and that the throughput is therefore quantified differently. This difference is due to experimental limitations: we cannot track bacteria through the whole channel and we wanted to avoid pushing them into the channel with fluid flow to avoid effects of flow on the results. As a consequence, bacteria continue to enter the IN region of the channel from the inlet during the experiment, while in the simulation, they all start at the beginning of the channel simultaneously. We expect this to mostly affect the case with diffusive transport (B=0).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>simulation study of magnetotactic bacteria in microfluidic channels containing sediment-mimicking obstacles. The obstacles were produced based on micro-computer tomography reconstructions of bacteria-rich sediment samples. The swimming of bacteria through these channels is found experimentally to display the highest throughput for physiological magnetic fields. Computer simulations of active Brownian particles, parameterized based on experimental trajectories are used to quantify the swimming throughput in detail. Similar behavior as in experiments is obtained, but also considerable variability between different channel geometries. Swimming at strong field is impeded by the trapping of bacteria in corners, while at weak fields the direction of motion is almost random. The trapping effect is confirmed in the experiments, as well as the escape of bacteria with reducing field strength.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a very careful and detailed study, which draws its main strength from the fruitful combination of the construction of novel microfluidic devices, their use in motility experiments, and simulations of active Brownian particles adapted to the experiment.

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Here follows a list of points the authors should address.</p>
<p>(1) Are additional experiments feasible to decrease the statistical noise present in Fig. 3c? At the very least, the authors should discuss the statistical significance of the results at 50 muT vis-a-vis 0 T.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>See our response to Strengths/Weaknesses above</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The experimental setup is not immediately clear. I think that adding a panel from Fig. S1 (or a sketch thereof) would help clarify, especially in relation to the entry zone and end zone.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are not sure what you mean. Fig. 3A already contains exactly such a panel. We have however added another supplementary figure that shows an additional detailed view of the setup (Fig. S3). In addition, we revised several figures: We have replaced Fig. S1 with a better version and exchanged the schematic view of the obstacle channel in Fig 1, removing the additional inlets that were not used in this study (also in Fig 3A), Instead we added a comment in Methods explaining their presence. Hopefully this makes the setup clear.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) It should be also stated that there is no external flow imposed on the channel.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added such a statement in the description of the experiment (in section 2.2 Swimming of magnetotactic bacteria through sediment-mimicking obstacle channels.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Fig. 3c and Fig. 6c are seemingly showing the same quantity (or closely related ones). The authors should use the same symbol and give an explicit mathematical definition.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The two quantities are not exactly the same, as we cannot directly quantify the flux of bacteria through the channel in our experiments. On the one hand, we cannot track bacteria through the whole channel, on the other hand, the initial conditions are not exactly the same as in the simulations. In the simulations all bacteria start at the same time at the entrance to the channel. In the experiments, they enter from the inlet and do so at different times (pushing them in with fluid flow would be possible, but carries the risk of perturbing the results due to induced flow through the channel). We have added a new section in the Methods section that explains this difference and describes the procedure used to obtain the throughput from the experiments in detail. We have also added a corresponding comment in the Result section, where the simulations are compared with the experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor issues:</p>
<p>- Figures have different styles that should be unified. For example, the panel labels sometimes have round brackets and sometimes they don't.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>I have only a few comments and questions, which the authors should address:</p>
<p>(1) The observed exponential dependence of decay time on the &quot;well&quot; depth could be related to the exponential density distribution of active particles in a gravitational field, which has been derived previously. Might be interesting to discuss such a possible connection.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the suggestion, the two cases are indeed somewhat analogous with behaviors reminiscent of thermal processes with an effective temperature. Such a description is however not generally possible (even for sedimentation, only some features are described). We plan to address in future work whether it can be made more quantitative in our case of escape from the corner traps. We have included a short discussion of the analogy in the section on trapping and escape.</p>
