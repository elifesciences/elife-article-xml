<title>Abstract</title><p>Imidacloprid is a global health threat that severely poisons the economically and ecologically important honeybee pollinator, <italic>Apis mellifera</italic>. However, its effects on developing bee larvae remain largely unexplored. Our pilot study showed that imidacloprid causes developmental delay in bee larvae, but the underlying toxicological mechanisms remain incompletely understood. In this study, we exposed bee larvae to imidacloprid at environmentally relevant concentrations of 0.7, 1.2, 3.1, and 377 ppb. There was a marked dose-dependent delay in larval development, characterized by reductions in body mass, width, and growth index. However, imidacloprid did not affect on larval survival and food consumption. The primary toxicological effects induced by elevated concentrations of imidacloprid (377 ppb) included inhibition of neural transmission gene expression, induction of oxidative stress, gut structural damage, and apoptosis, inhibition of developmental regulatory hormones and genes, suppression of gene expression levels involved in proteolysis, amino acid transport, protein synthesis, carbohydrate catabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolysis energy production. In addition, we found that the larvae may use antioxidant defenses and P450 detoxification mechanisms to mitigate the effects of imidacloprid. Ultimately, this study provides the first evidence that environmentally exposed imidacloprid can affect the growth and development of bee larvae by disrupting molting regulation and limiting the metabolism and utilization of dietary nutrients and energy. These findings have broader implications for studies assessing pesticide hazards in other juvenile animals.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hazardous pesticides are used extensively around the world to protect crop production, particularly in agriculture-dependent developing countries. However, exposure to these chemicals has become a global health concern. Imidacloprid, introduced in 1991, is known for its high animal toxicity and has received international attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Jeschke et al., 2011</xref>). The World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have listed it as an acute oral and dermal toxicant for animals. The excessive use of imidacloprid can lead to environmental contamination, endangering human and animal health through food chains, poisoning non-target pollinators, and disrupting ecological balances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Tudi et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Imidacloprid is also known for its adverse effects on human health. Adults exposed to high doses of imidacloprid (9.6%) experience dizziness, apathy, movement disorders, labored breathing, and temporary growth retardation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Wu et al., 2001</xref>). Imidacloprid also causes adverse congenital, hematological, hepatic, and renal effects, along with degenerative changes in various organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Khan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Shaw et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). Imidacloprid even at low doses causes severe liver, thyroid, and body weight problems, reproductive toxicity, developmental retardation, and neurobehavioral deficits in rats and rabbits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anatra-Cordone M, 2005</xref>). Additionally, imidacloprid affects the singing ability of birds, making it difficult for them to attract mates and reproduce. It is a significant contributor to the decline in terrestrial insect populations since 1991, averaging 9% per decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cardoso et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Sánchez-Bayo and Wyckhuys, 2019</xref>). Honey bees (<italic>Apis mellifera</italic> L.) are valuable model organisms in insects with significant economic and ecological importance as crop pollinators and in maintaining ecological balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Zheng and Fu-Liang, 2009</xref>). However, the widespread use of pesticides, including imidacloprid, has resulted in colony collapse disorder (CCD), causing severe impacts on the beekeeping industry and ecological balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Mahé et al., 2021</xref>). Studies have shown that imidacloprid is applied as a seed coating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Simon-Delso et al., 2015</xref>) and accumulates in the plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Dively and Kamel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Rocha et al., 2022</xref>), exposing non-target bees to imidacloprid residues during pollen and nectar collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Tong et al., 2018</xref>). Even low levels of systemic imidacloprid cause sublethal effects in adult bees, including neurotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Belzunces et al., 2012</xref>), behavioural changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Karahan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Medrzycki et al., 2003</xref>), reproductive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chaimanee et al., 2016</xref>), reduced immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Pettis et al., 2013</xref>), apoptosis and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Carneiro et al., 2022</xref>), and shortened lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Anderson and Harmon-Threatt, 2021</xref>). A recent finding shows that imidacloprid induces oxidative stress in honey bees (Balieira et al., 2018). This oxidative stress is a result of the long-term synergistic effect between imidacloprid and its target receptors (nAChRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Makoto et al., 2020</xref>) in bees, which leads to an excessive influx of Ca into the bee brain (Tahirare, 2013), disrupting Ca homeostasis and ultimately causing mitochondrial dysfunction and increased mitochondrial ROS generation, exacerbating oxidative stress.</p>
<p>The development and health status of juvenile animals play a critical role in population structure and future growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Gill et al., 2012</xref>). However, they are more susceptible to the toxic effects of pesticides than adults. Despite this, there is limited information on the toxic effects of imidacloprid on juvenile animals. Available reports mainly focus on the epistatic effects of toxicity, with limited investigation into the involved biochemical mechanisms. Imidacloprid is known to pose a potential health risk to children through dietary exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Anderson and Harmon-Threatt, 2021</xref>), and may cause lead to developmental abnormalities in amphibians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Samojeden et al., 2022</xref>) and fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Islam et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, negative effects on pupal development in insects have been observed (Jia and Li, 2023). For instance, cat fleas (<italic>Ctenocephalides felis</italic>) larvae treated with imidacloprid become immobile, and their intestines show pulsatile movements for up to one hour, eventually dying after two hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Mehlhorn et al., 1999</xref>). Additionally, imidacloprid exposure can affect the average weight gain per day in <italic>Harmonia axyridis</italic> (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Vincent et al., 2000</xref>). It has also been found that imidacloprid exposure affects various cellular aspects, such as mitochondria, energy, lipids, and the transcriptome in Drosophila (Felipe et al., 2020), and prolongs the larval pupation duration and affects forewing development in the butterfly <italic>Pieris brassicae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Whitehorn et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>In bees, larvae play a crucial role in the growth and development of colonies. However, the broader toxic effects of imidacloprid on bee larvae remain to be investigated. Limited reports suggest that developing bee larvae are exposed to imidacloprid through contact with contaminated hives or ingestion of contaminated food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bhme et al., 2018</xref>). However, their survival, developmental rate, and body weight are not affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Dai et al., 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, other studies have shown that imidacloprid can lead to impaired olfactory learning behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Peng and Yang, 2016</xref>), and other behavioral abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). The current understanding is that honey bee larvae are more tolerant to imidacloprid than adults, as they can survive treatment and develop into adults (Dai et al., 2017). However, they may experience developmental delays, such as delayed plumage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Woyciechowski and Moroń, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Wu et al., 2011</xref>), and reduced rates of capping, pupation, and eclosion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). A recent study using next-generation sequencing has indicated that sublethal imidacloprid treatment during the larval stage causes changes in gene expression in larvae, pupae, and adults, suggesting a persistent sublethal impact on honey bee development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, a latest study has demonstrated that imidacloprid induces differential gene expression in bumble bee larvae, resulting in unique expression patterns related to various biological processes such as starvation response, cuticle genes, neural development, and cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Martín-Blázquez et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Although progress has been made in understanding the toxic effects of imidacloprid on honey bee larvae, the molecular basis of this toxicity remains poorly understood. Further research is needed to uncover the mechanisms and pathways involved in the developmental toxicity of imidacloprid in honey bee larvae. In our pilot study, we observed a significant developmental delay in bee larvae exposed to imidacloprid; However, the molecular and biochemical mechanisms underlying this delay have not been systematically investigated. Therefore, this study aims to comprehensively evaluate the toxicity of imidacloprid on honey bee larvae at multiple levels, including histology, neurotoxicity, molting regulation, oxidative stress, detoxification, nutrition, and energy metabolism. Our study provides first-hand evidence of the developmental delay caused by imidacloprid in bee larvae. Because these mechanisms involved are relatively conserved in animals, our findings have broader implications for understanding and assessing the potential risk of continuous exposure to imidacloprid during animal development.</p>

<title>Imidacloprid causes bee larval developmental retardation</title>
<p>The 96-hour observation period showed no significant difference in larval survival between the four groups exposed to imidacloprid and the control group. However, as the exposure concentration and duration increased, here was a significant decrease in larval developmental progress, weight, and width (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-E</xref>). Further analysis was conducted on the most adverse exposure level of 377 ppb, which is the highest reported environmental residue concentration detected in bee products, such as beeswax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kapoor et al., 2014</xref>). It is important to note that while the tested doses of the 377 ppb was found in bee products, it is likely that the bees themselves were exposed to even higher doses. Out result demonstrate that exposure to 377 ppb imidacloprid did not have a significant impact on survival (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and Figure 1 – Source Data 1), feeding (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref> and Figure 1– Source Data 4, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref> and Figure 1– Source Data 5) and the time required for larvae to enter the pupal stage successfully (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref> and Figure 1– Source Data 6). However, it did lead to slow developmental progress, a lower initial rate of successful pupation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref> and Figure 1– Source Data 7), and lower growth index (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref> and Figure 1– Source Data 8). Larval growth index gradual decrease from the 4th instar, and then stabilized by the 6th instar. At the 4th, 5th and 6th instars, the growth index of the imidacloprid-treated groups was significantly lower than that of the control group by an average of 1.35%, 4.49%, and 2.76%, respectively (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, source data 8). In addition, imidacloprid consistently resulted in reduced larval width (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> and Figure 1– Source Data 2) and weight (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> and Figure 1– Source Data 3) up to the pupal stage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Comparing the 377 ppb imidacloprid-exposed larvae to the control, the mean body weight and body width were significantly lower by 34.38% and 17.15%, respectively (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05).</p>

<title>Toxic effects and the molecular basis of environmental concentrations of imidacloprid on bee larvae</title>
<p>Previous research has shown that bee larvae are more susceptible to the adverse effects of pesticides than adult bees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Tomé et al., 2020</xref>). In this study, larvae were exposed to environmental concentrations of imidacloprid, resulting in sublethal effects such as decreased body weight, width, developmental rate, and growth index (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Our results support the notion that pesticides can affect larval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Dai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>). However, current research has primarily focused on characterizing the effects of imidacloprid on larval phenotype and behavior, and the molecular mechanisms underlying its ecotoxicological effects remain poorly understood.</p>
<p>To obtain molecular evidence of imidacloprid toxicity to bee larvae, we first examined the expression of acetylcholine receptors and AChE activity. The results showed that imidacloprid exposure increased the expression of the <italic>Alph2</italic> gene and inhibited AChE activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and Figure 2– Source Data 10). Normally, acetylcholine stimulates nerve impulses by binding to the Alph receptor, and AChE degrades acetylcholine to terminate nerve conduction. However, imidacloprid competitively binds to AChE receptors, inhibits AChE activity, and causes continuous excitation of nerve conduction, ultimately leading to paralysis and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Katić et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Shan et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, our results strongly suggest that imidacloprid is neurotoxic to bee larvae.</p>
<p>The growth and development of juvenile animals depends on the digestion, absorption and utilization of food nutrients. Therefore, we next investigated whether imidacloprid affects the digestion and utilization of dietary by larvae. The results indicate that exposure to imidacloprid suppressed the hydrolysis genes <italic>CPs</italic> and <italic>APs</italic> and the amino acid transport pathway genes <italic>Aats-Gly</italic> and <italic>Aats-Tyr</italic> in larvae (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B-C</xref> and Figure 6– Source Data 20-21). Since these genes are responsible for cleaving dietary proteins into absorbable peptides and amino acids and transporting them for metabolism (2019), inhibiting the expression of these genes would severely affect larval digestion, resulting in protein deficiency and impaired metabolic activity. In addition, imidacloprid also affected the expression of <italic>α-Am</italic> and <italic>α-Glu</italic> genes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref> and Figure 6– Source Data 19), which are involved in carbohydrate digestion, indicating that imidacloprid also affects the digestion of dietary carbohydrates. Indeed, histological observations also confirmed that a large amount of undigested food remained in the intestine of larvae exposed to imidacloprid (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref> and Figure 5– Source Data 18). In conclusion, imidacloprid inhibits the digestion and utilization of dietary proteins and carbohydrates by larvae, which is extremely detrimental to their growth and development.</p>
<p>In addition to nutrition, energy metabolism is critical for the maintenance of all life activities. In this study, imidacloprid exposure inhibited the expression of genes related to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (<italic>COX17</italic>, <italic>NDUFB7</italic>) and its alternative glycolytic pathway (<italic>Gapdh</italic>, <italic>Oscillin</italic>). Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is the central pathway for ATP generation during energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Tian et al., 2020a</xref>), while glycolysis is an alternative mechanism for ATP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>). Since both biochemical processes are essential for energy production, their inhibition resulted in reduced ATP levels in bee larvae (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref> and Figure 6– Source Data 25). These results strongly suggest that imidacloprid induces energy metabolism dysfunction leading to insufficient energy production in larvae. Since larval energy production is insufficient, this is likely to lead to a depletion of energy reserves. Indeed, further analysis revealed a significant decrease in glycogen and protein energy reserves in larvae exposed to imidacloprid (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H-I</xref> and Figure 6– Source Data 26-27). These findings are consistent with previous reports that exposure to pesticides such as endosulfan, chlorpyrifos, insecticides, and fipronil can lead to a reduction in energy reserves in organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bouayad et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Dutra et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Radwan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Rambabu and Rao, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Ribeiro et al., 2001</xref>). In conclusion, our results suggest that imidacloprid induces energy metabolism dysfunction and affects energy production and reserves in bee larvae.</p>
<p>Insects rely primarily on cytochrome P450 detoxification to resist toxic compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Li et al., 2007</xref>), and the level of CYP450 expression indicates the severity of pesticide toxicity. While adult worker bees have shown a positive response to imidacloprid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Mao et al., 2009</xref>), it is uncertain whether bee larvae can respond to pesticide toxicity. In this study, we found that seven cytochrome P450 family transcripts, including CYPq1, CYPq2, CYP450, CYP6AS14, CYP4G11, and CYP306A1, were significantly upregulated in bee larvae, with CYP9q1 being 94-fold higher than the control group (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> and Figure 4– Source Data 13). These results are consistent with previous findings that the CYP450 family genes CYP6AS3, CYP6AS4, and CYP9S1 were significantly upregulated in adult worker bees exposed to quercetin, coumaphos, and fluvalinate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Mao et al., 2011</xref>) and that CYP9Q1, CYP9Q2, and CYP9Q3 help bees detoxify fluvalinate and coumaphos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Gregorc et al., 2018</xref>). This suggests that the P450 detoxification system is already established in bee larvae and they respond positively by activating the detoxification function of CYP450 upon exposure to imidacloprid.</p>
<p>Oxidative stress is the excessive production of ROS in aerobic organisms (Felton, 1995; Ozcan and Ogun, 2015). Pesticides, including coumaphos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Gregorc et al., 2018</xref>), fipronil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Paris et al., 2017</xref>), organophosphorus, pyrethroid, organochlorinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chakrabarti et al., 2015</xref>), and chlorpyrifos (Shafiq-ur-Rehman et al., 2012), as well as paraquats such as paraquat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Li-Byarlay et al., 2016</xref>), have been shown to cause oxidative stress in bees. In this study, exposure to imidacloprid resulted in increased levels of ROS and MDA in larvae (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> and Figure 5– Source Data 14), indicating severe oxidative stress and lipid damage. Organisms have evolved antioxidant defense mechanisms to scavenge excessive ROS and resist oxidative stress, including increasing levels of antioxidants such as CAT, SOD, GSH, TrxR, and GSH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Dong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Tian et al., 2020b</xref>). In this regard, we have recently confirmed this in worker bees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Li et al., 2022</xref>), which is also well reflected in the present study. We observed a significant increase in the activities of antioxidant enzymes SOD and CAT, gene expression of Trx and Gpx, and GSH levels in larvae after exposure to imidacloprid (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B-C</xref> and Figure 5– Source Data 15-16). These results show that the antioxidant system in developing larvae is established and used to resist oxidative stress caused by imidacloprid, similar to that in adult worker bees. Notably, compared to our recent study in adult bees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Li et al., 2022</xref>), the larvae in this study exhibited more robust antioxidant activity when exposed to higher concentrations of imidacloprid toxicity than worker bees. However, the underlying mechanism requires further investigation. The underlying mechanisms involved require further study.</p>
<p>Notably, in addition to routine antioxidants, imidacloprid induces a 7-fold increase in Vg expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and Figure 3– Source Data 11). Vg is known to provide nutrition to developing embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Jorgensen et al., 2009</xref>) and to help animals cope with pollution-induced stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Matozzo et al., 2008</xref>). In bees, Vg plays an important antioxidant role by protecting other hemolymph molecules from ROS and increasing cellular oxidative stress tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Corona et al., 2007</xref>). Previous studies have shown a correlation between high Vg expression in adult worker bees and resistance to oxidative stress resulting from exposure to the pesticide paraquat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Seehuus et al., 2006</xref>). In this study, our results support this observation and suggest that larvae may also resist oxidative stress caused by imidacloprid through increased Vg production.</p>

<title>Mechanisms of imidacloprid-induced developmental retardation in bee larvae</title>
<p>Impaired juvenile development can have a significant impact on the growth and sustainability of entire populations. Deviations in juvenile development due to environmental stress have recently received considerable attention. <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> exposed to heat stress exhibit developmental delays due to the failure of early embryos to fully inhibit the synthesis of non-heat shock proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bergh and Arking, 1984</xref>). Similarly, exposure to nutrient and heavy metal stress can cause delayed or arrested development in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> due to altered gene expression and disruption of developmental signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Carranza-García and Navarro, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Rashid et al., 2021</xref>). In the present study, we also observed typical developmental delays in honeybee larvae exposed to imidacloprid, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.</p>
<p>Several mechanisms may be responsible for the delayed development of honey bee larvae, including endocrine disruption, altered gene expression of metabolic pathways, and increased energy expenditure due to detoxification mechanisms. Nonetheless, no evidence has been reported in detail to date. Insect development is regulated by the hormones JH and 20E, which control morphological remodeling events during molting. 20E promotes pupation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Yuan et al., 2020</xref>), while JH maintains juvenile characteristics and prevents metamorphosis by antagonizing the effects of 20E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Luo et al., 2021</xref>). Multiple studies show that neonicotinoid insecticides disrupt honey bee endocrine systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Christen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Cook 2019</xref>). This suggests that imidacloprid may affect molt-related endocrine hormones. Nevertheless, this phenomenon has not been reported in honeybees yet. Therefore, we first focused on the hormonal regulation of molting development and found that imidacloprid inhibits the expression of JHAMT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and Figure 3– Source Data 11), a positive regulator of JH synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Liu et al., 2018</xref>), but did not affect JH titer levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and Figure 3– Source Data 12). This suggests that the antagonistic effect of JH still restricts the developmental process, thereby maintaining larval morphology. In parallel, imidacloprid toxicity also resulted in reduced ecdysteroid 20E titer and Br-c expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and Figure 3– Source Data 11-12). The role of 20E is to induce larval molting and pupation by triggering downstream response factors, such as Br-c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Deng et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, our results suggest that larval developmental delay may be caused by imidacloprid reducing 20E titer and inhibiting <italic>Br-c</italic> expression, thereby blocking molting. Notably, we also observed that a decrease in 20E levels was accompanied by a decrease in AChE activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and Figure 2– Source Data 9), which is known to cause delayed pupation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">He et al., 2012</xref>) and developmental arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Desneux et al., 2007</xref>) in insect larvae. Therefore, our results suggest that imidacloprid neurotoxicity may cause developmental delay in bee larvae by inhibiting the molting hormone 20E. This conclusion is supported by a correlation analysis showing that decreases in 20E titer, <italic>Br-c</italic> expression and AChE activity were positively correlated with decreased developmental rates and growth index, weight and width growth (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> and Figure 7– Source Data 28). In conclusion, imidacloprid neurotoxicity inhibits the 20E and <italic>Br-c</italic> genes, thereby blocking molting, which may be an important cause of delayed larval development in bee larvae. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the decline in the growth index may be due to other factors, such as oxidative stress impairing mitochondria, dysregulated neuro-endocrine axis caused by imidacloprid targeting neurons, poor nutrient absorption, impaired movement, etc, as animal growth and development are collectively regulated by numerous physiological, biochemical, and genetic factors.</p>
<p>Animals employ selective foraging as a survival strategy to avoid ingesting toxic foods that may cause adverse physiological effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Berenbaum and Johnson, 2015</xref>). Although bees cannot actively reject toxins innately, postingestive malaise allows them to learn to avoid ingesting toxic-containing foods with adverse physiological effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hurst et al., 2014</xref>). Given this, we speculate that it is likely that the bee larvae in this study reduced their intake of toxic imidacloprid-containing foods, making it difficult to meet their nutritional and energy needs, which may have resulted in delayed development. However, monitoring of daily food intake did not show a significant difference between larvae exposed to imidacloprid and the control group (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F and G</xref>, Figure 1– Source Data 4 and 5), indicating that larval food intake was not reduced and larvae did not initiate avoidance behavior toward toxic food. Therefore, food intake was not a critical factor in the delayed larval development caused by imidacloprid.</p>
<p>Nutrition and energy are critical for the growth and development of juvenile animals. Exposure to heavy metals and neonicotinoid pesticides has been shown to affect digestion, energy reserves, production, and utilization in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Li et al., 2021</xref>). Given this, since the lack of the necessary correlation between delayed larval development and food intake in this study prompts us to consider potential problems in larval food and energy utilization that led to delayed development. Interestingly, we found severe pathological changes in the gut tissues of developmentally delayed larvae exposed to imidacloprid (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref> and Figure 5– Source Data 17). Imidacloprid caused a significant reduction in the tightness of the cell arrangement in the basal layer of the gut, and a drastic decrease in the number of cells. This inevitably impacts the larval digestion and absorption of food nutrients. Indeed, the peritrophic membrane was incompletely formed, and undigested food residues were found in the gut of imidacloprid-exposed larvae compared to controls. In addition, qRT-PCR evidence showed a significant decrease in digestion and catabolism of dietary proteins and carbohydrates, amino acid transport, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolysis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D-F</xref> and Figure 6– Source Data 22-24). Biochemical assays showed that imidacloprid stress also decreased ATP levels and total glycogen and protein content, resulting in inadequate energy reserves and increased energy expenditure (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G-I</xref> and Figure 6– Source Data 25-27). Furthermore, correlation analysis provided some support for a positive relationship between imidacloprid-induced impaired catabolism and dietary nutrient utilization and larval developmental delay (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> and Figure 7– Source Data 28). In conclusion, these findings clearly suggest that imidacloprid exposure affects the digestion and utilization of nutrients and energy in larvae, resulting in insufficient nutrients and energy for growth and development, which may be another important factor contributing to imidacloprid-induced larval developmental delay.</p>
<p>In addition, mitochondria are the main producers of ATP for cellular metabolism, accounting for approximately 90% of the total. However, mitochondria are also involved in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Excessive accumulation of ROS in mitochondria leads to oxidative stress, which in turn damages mitochondria and further increases ROS levels, creating a vicious cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Boovarahan and Kurian, 2018</xref>). In the present study, it was found that imidacloprid exposure led to increased ROS and MDA levels in larvae (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>-source data 14), indicating that imidacloprid induced severe oxidative stress and lipid damage, which may damage mitochondria and in turn affect mitochondrial ATP production, resulting in insufficient energy supply for larval development. This factor may also be an important explanation for the larval developmental delay caused by imidacloprid.</p>
<p>The Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory proposes that environmental stress can significantly affect the energy balance of organisms, leading to increased energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kooijman, 2009</xref>). To cope with stress, animals may deplete their energy reserves, such as glycogen and protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bouayad et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Matsukura et al., 2008</xref>). In this study, we found that larvae with delayed development caused by imidacloprid had lower energy reserves (ATP, total protein, and total glycogen). Furthermore, this decrease in energy reserves was negatively correlated with larval antioxidant and detoxification (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> and Figure 7– Source Data 28). It is commonly acknowledged that antioxidant defense and detoxification for stress resistance is an energy-consuming process. Therefore, our results indirectly imply that imidacloprid-induced reduction in energy reserves is likely associated with the energy-consuming activities of CYP450 detoxification and antioxidant defense. In nature, to meet the high energy cost demands of environmental stress, animals often have to allocate most of their food intake to defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Guedes et al., 2006</xref>), and this redistribution of energy resources will inevitably lead to an insufficient energy supply for growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Beyers et al., 1999</xref>). Consequently, the P450 detoxification and antioxidant defense used by the larvae in this study to resist imidacloprid toxicity most likely force them to consume more food resources that should have been used for growth and development, consequently resulting in a severe lack of energy needed for development. This may be another important factor contributing to delayed development in bee larvae caused by imidacloprid. However, on this point, it remains to be supported in the future by overexpression of P450 and antioxidant enzymes, combined with transcriptomic analysis of the overall expression of other P450s, antioxidant genes to obtain direct evidence that depletion of larval antioxidants and detoxification leads to a decrease in the growth index.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that our investigation into the causes of imidacloprid-induced developmental delay in honey bee larvae has provided limited answers. Future comparative analyses of different tissues and durations of exposure, using genetic manipulation and histochemical methods, would improve our understanding of the effects of sublethal doses of imidacloprid on larval development, growth and survival.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Imidacloprid toxicity caused growth and developmental delay in <italic>A. mellifera</italic> larvae. The toxic mechanism may include imidacloprid disrupting the regulatory balance of molt development, resulting in restricted development. In addition, the gut damage caused by imidacloprid restricts the metabolism and utilization of food nutrients and energy in the larvae. Third, the additional energy consumed by larval P450 detoxification and antioxidant defenses further reduces the supply of nutrients and energy for growth and development (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). This study is the first multi-level investigation of the toxic effects of imidacloprid on <italic>A. mellifera</italic> larvae. These findings have broader implications for understanding and assessing the threat of harmful pesticides to animal larvae.</p>

<title>Larval rearing</title>
<p>The protocol of the current research was approved by the Animal Bioethics Committee of the Chongqing Normal University, China (Protocol Number: 201001). The chosen colonies were healthy and not exposed to pathogens or pesticides. Two-day-old larvae from the same frames of the same hive were individually transferred to sterile 24-well cell culture plates. The plates contained standard food, which included royal jelly, glucose, fructose, water, and yeast extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Aupinel et al., 2005</xref>). The larvae were cultured in dark conditions at 35°C and 96% RH, with daily feeding volumes adjusted according to their age (20 μL for three-day-old larvae, 30 μL for four-day-old larvae, 40 μL for five-day-old larvae, and 50 μL for six-day-old larvae). Any remaining food was recorded and removed.</p>

<title>Experimental design</title>
<p>This study employed four different concentrations of imidacloprid, which were residual concentrations found in honey (0.7 ppb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Chauzat et al., 2009</xref>), bees (1.2 ppb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Chauzat et al., 2011</xref>), pollen (3.1 ppb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Mullin et al., 2010</xref>), and beeswax (377 ppb) (Pareja et al., 2011). The experiment was conducted with three treatment groups: control group (CK), solvent control group (CKac), and imidacloprid-treated group (IMI), each with three replicates. Each replicate contained 32 larvaes that were distributed in standard 24-well cell culture plates (1 bee/well). The CK group consisted of larvaes fed acetone-royal jelly glucose-fructose-yeast extract-distilled water (0.00377%-50%-6%-6%-1%-36.99623%, v/w/w/w/w/v). The IMI group consisted of the two-day-old larvae that were orally exposed to a control solution containing imidacloprid (99% active ingredient, Hubei Norna Technology Co. Ltd, Hubei, China) at 0.7 ppb, 1.2 ppb, 3.1 ppb, and 377 ppb, respectively, after which the larvae were fed a standard food from three-day-old. The CKac group served as a solvent control and contained only acetone at a concentration of 0.00377%. A total of 312 larvae were used for survival statistics (96 bees), body weight and width (96 bees), and gene expression, enzyme activity, histochemical content, and histopathologic analysis. Food was administered daily according to age (20 μL for three-day-old larvae, 30 μL for four-day-old larvae, 40 μL for five-day-old larvae, and 50 μL for six-day-old larvae). Dead individuals and food remain were recorded daily, and incubation conditions were 35°C and 96% RH. Surviving larvae were collected 72 h after consumption of the test solution and stored at −80°C for further analysis, including evaluations of gene expression, enzyme activity, and chemical content evaluations. Furthermore, HE-stained sections were used to evaluate any imidacloprid-induced tissue damage and apoptosis.</p>

<sec id="s5c">
<title>Developmental phenotypic traits</title>
<p>Larval individuals were randomly selected daily from the CK and IMI groups to measure body weight and width. Food residues, larval mortality, developmental progression, and the amount of time spent in the larval developmental stage (from the first imidacloprid exposure to before pupa) were recorded daily to calculate food consumption, survival rates, developmental rates, and development times. The growth index (GI) was calculated for larvae exposed to imidacloprid from the three-day-old to the six-day-old using the equations described by Zhang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Zhang et al., 1993</xref>). The experiment was conducted in three biological replicates, each containing 24 randomly selected larvae (24-well cell culture plate, 1 bee/well). The two-day-old larvae were administered imidacloprid orally (after which they were maintained on standard chow), and then the developmental progress of the larvae was monitored daily for 12 days starting at four-day-old, and the developmental time and developmental rate were counted. Sample data that died abnormally or failed to enter the pupal stage during this period were excluded. Developmental time was calculated as the length of time from four-day-old until the larvae entered the pupal stage after oral administration of imidacloprid to two-day-old larvae. Developmental rate was defined as the percentage of the number of larvae that developed into pupae out of 24 two-day-old larvae that received oral doses of imidacloprid.</p>
<p>The developmental rate was measured as the number of larvae successfully reaching the pupal stage as a percentage of the total initial sample size.</p>

<title>RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and real-time quantitative PCR analysis</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted from larvae using TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) a nd RNAex Pro Reagent (Accurate Biology, China) as instructed by the manufacturer. The RNA quality was evaluated by gel electrophoresis and absorbance determination using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, New York, USA). Genomic DNA was removed, and cDNA was synthesized using a reverse transcription kit (Evo M-MLV R T Mix Kit with gDNA Clean for qPCR, Accurate Biology, China) according to the manufact urer’s instructions. Briefly, 1 μg of RNA reacted with the 5X gDNA Clean Reaction Mix pr ovided in the kit at 42°C for 5 min to remove residual genomic DNA to ensure the accura cy of the quantitative results. After the reaction, 4 μL of 5X Evo M-MLV RT Reaction Mix and 4 μL of RNase-free water were added to the reaction tube for 20 μL. The mixture wa s incubated at 37°C for 15 min and 85°C for 5 sec to generate cDNA. Then, quantitative R T–PCR was performed with a Bio-Rad CFX96™ Real-time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) according to standard protocols and cycling conditions. RP49 (riboso mal protein 49, Accession no. AF441189) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lourenco et al., 2008</xref>) was used as the endoge nous control. The primers for target genes and RP49 are listed in Supplementary File 1. qPCR system (20 µL): EvaGreen Express 2X qPCR MasterMix (10 µL), each forward and re verse primer (0.4 µL, 0.2 µmol/L), cDNA (1 µL, 100 ng/µL), ddH<sub>2</sub>O (8.2 µL). The thermal c ycling program was as follows: 95°C for 30 sec, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 5 s and 60°C for 30 s. The qPCR products were sequenced by Shanghai Biological Engineering Te chnology Services Co., Ltd. to confirm whether the amplified fragments were the target sequences. Relative mRNA expression levels of target genes were calculated using the 2 <sup>ΔΔCt</sup>method.</p>

<title>Histochemical measurement</title>
<p>Juvenile hormone 3 (JH-III), 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) titers, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in larvae were determined using ELISA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (Jining, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the larva was homogenized on ice in 5 volumes (M: V) of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer, and the supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 20 min. Subsequently, 50 μL of reference standard solution or 10 μL of sample supernatant plus 40 μL of dilution were added to the microtiter wells and incubated at 37°C for 60 min with 100 μL of HRP-labeled detection antibody. Each well was washed five times with 400 μL of PBS buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20, pat dried, and left to stand at room temperature for 5 min. TMB chromogen solution A (50 μL) and solution B (50 μL) were added to each well, gently mixed, and incubated at 37°C for 15 min in the dark. Then, 50 μL of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (4 mol/L) was added to each well to terminate the reaction. Finally, the OD value was measured at 450 nm with a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, New York, USA), and the content of the detected substance was calculated from a calibration curve constructed by reference standards.</p>
<p>To prepare samples for analysis of protein carbonylation (PCO), acetylcholinesterase (AchE), catalase (CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione (GSH), larvae was weighed and homogenized on ice in 5 volumes (M: V) of PBS buffer, then centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 15 min to collect the supernatant. Subsequently, PCO content was measured using the 2,4-dinitrophenyl-hydrazine (DNPH) method with slight modifications. The above-prepared supernatant was mixed with streptomycin sulfate at a 9:1 volume (V: M), kept at room temperature for 10 min, and then centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 15 min. Then, 80 μL of supernatant was mixed with 160 μL of 10⍰mM DNPH in 2⍰M HCl and reacted at 37°C for 30 min. Sample controls were also prepared by adding an equal volume (500⍰μL) of 2⍰M HCl. Then, 200 μL of 20% TCA was added, mixed thoroughly, and centrifuged at 4°C for 10 min at 12,000 x g, and the precipitate was collected. Add 400 μL of ethanol: ethyl acetate mixture (1:1), vortex and mix, centrifuge at 4°C 12,000 x g for 10 min, and collect the precipitate to remove unbound DNPH. This DNPH removal step was repeated once. The pellet was mixed with 400⍰μL of 6⍰M guanidine hydrochloride, kept at room temperature for 15 min, and then centrifuged at 4°C 12,000 x g for 10 min to collect the supernatant. The carbonyl and protein contents were determined by reading the absorbance at λ⍰=⍰370⍰nm and 280 nm with a SpectraMax 190 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, California, USA) for each sample against an appropriate blank. Finally, the carbonyl content per unit of protein was calculated based on the protein content.</p>
<p>AChE activity was measured by the Ellman method as described by Orhan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Orhan et al., 2007</xref>) with slight modifications. Briefly, 20 μL of the prepared sample supernatant was mixed with 160 µL of 0.1 mM PBS buffer (pH 8.0) and 10 µL of an AChE (0.28 U mL<sup>-1</sup>) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Then, 10 µL of ATChI (acetylthiocholine iodide, 4 mg mL<sup>-1</sup>) was added together with 20 µL of DTNB (5,5-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid, 1.2 mg mL<sup>-1</sup>) and immediately mixed, and the absorbance was read at 412 nm. The results were expressed as activity percentages relative to the sample solvent negative control.</p>
<p>The CAT activity was determined using a kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with slight modifications. Briefly, 10 μL of the prepared sample supernatant was mixed with 30 μL of Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0, 50 mmol L<sup>-1</sup>), 10 µL of 250 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was added, and the mixture was immediately mixed and kept at 25°C for 5 min. Then, 450 μL of 1.8 mol L-1 H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> was added, and the mixture was vortexed to terminate the reaction. Subsequently, 10 µL of this termination reaction solution was mixed with 40 µL of Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0, 50 mmol L<sup>-1</sup>). Then, 10 µL of this mixture was added to a 96-well plate mixed with 200 µL of color development working solution containing peroxidase and incubated for 15 min at 25°C. Finally, the absorbance was measured at 520 nm, and the CAT activity was calculated using a calibration curve of 5 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>T-AOC was measured using the total antioxidant capacity assay kit with the ABTS (2,2’-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) method based on a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). Add 10 μL of the prepared sample supernatant to 200 μL of ABTS working solution. After 6 min of reaction, the absorbance was measured at 734 nm. Finally, the antioxidant activity was displayed by Trolox equivalents antioxidant capacity as mmol Trolox equivalents/g extract. The ABTS working solution was prepared as follows: 400 μL of potassium persulfate was added to 400 μL of ABTS to generate an ABTS stock solution, which was then incubated for 16 h at room temperature in the dark. Before use, the stock solution was diluted with phosphate buffer, and the absorbance at 734 nm was adjusted to 0.70 ± 0.05.</p>
<p>Additionally, MDA, SOD, and GSH levels were detected using ELISA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) according to our recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Li et al., 2022</xref>).</p>

<p>This study provides evidence on the ability of sublethal imidacloprid doses to affect growth and development of honeybee larva. While checking the effect of doses that do not impact survival or food intake, the authors found changes in the expression of genes related to energy metabolism, antioxidant response, and P450 metabolism. The authors also identified cell death in the alimentary canal, and disturbances in levels of ROS markers, molting hormones, weight, and growth ratio. The study strengths come from employing these different approaches to investigate the impacts of imidacloprid exposure. The study weaknesses come from the lack of a in depth investigation and drawing many conclusions solely from punctual gene expression, that are not representative of complete biological processes. Though relevant to understand the impacts on neonicotinoid contamination on insect pollinators, the study conclusions should be carefully weighted as they are often not fully substantiated. Follow up studies using in-depth investigation and more robust methodological design testing whether the impacts observed lead to post-metamorphosis effects and impacts in the colony would have a significant impact.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<p>On behalf of all the authors, I'd like to thank you for your insightful comments and valuable suggestions, which fully reflect your high level of scientific thinking and point the direction of our research and help us and other future researchers in the field to more comprehensively study and interpret the toxic effects of imidacloprid on honey bee larvae and its potential mechanisms, as well as the mechanisms of larval resistance and adaptations to imidacloprid. We have addressed each of the questions and revised the manuscript point-by-point in response to your comments. Below are detailed point-by-point responses to each question.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Review:</bold></p>
<p>This study provides evidence of the ability of sublethal imidacloprid doses to affect growth and development of honeybee larva. While checking the effect of doses that do not impact survival or food intake, the authors found changes in the expression of genes related to energy metabolism, antioxidant response, and metabolism of xenobiotics. The authors also identified cell death in the alimentary canal, and disturbances in levels of ROS markers, molting hormones, weight and growth ratio. The study strengths come from exploring different aspects and impacts of imidacloprid exposure on honeybee juvenile stages and for that it demonstrates potential for assessing the risks posed by pesticides. The study weaknesses come from the lack of in depth investigation and an incomplete methodological design. For instance, many of the study conclusions are based on RT-qPCR, which show only a partial snapshot of gene expression, which was performed at a single time point and using whole larvae. There is no understanding of how different organs/tissues might respond to exposure and how they change over time. That creates a problem to understand the mechanisms of damage caused by the pesticide in the situation studied here. There is no investigation of what happens after pupation. The authors show that the doses tested have no impact on survival, food consumption and time to pupation, and the growth index drops from ~0.96 to ~0.92 in exposed larvae, raising the question of its biological significance. The origin of ROS are not investigated, nor do the authors investigate if the larvae recover from the damage observed in the gut after pupation. That is important as it could affect the adult workers' health. One of the study's central claims is that the reduced growth index is due to the extra energy used to overexpress P450s and antioxidant enzymes, but that is based on RT-qPCR only. Other options are not well explored and whether the gut damage could be causing nutrient absorption problems, or the oxidative stress could be impairing mitochondrial energy production is not investigated. These alternatives may also affect the growth index. The authors also state that the honeybee larvae has 7 instars, which is an incorrect as Apis mellifera have 5 larval instars. It is not clear from methods which precise stage of larval development was used for gut preparations. That information is important because prior to pupation larvae defecate and undergo shedding of gut lining. That could profoundly affect some of the results in case gut preparations for microscopy were made close to this stage. A more in-depth investigation and more complete methodological design that investigates the mechanisms of damage and whether the exposures tested could affect adult bees may demonstrate the damage of low insecticide doses to a vital pollinator insect species.</p>
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p>This study presents a useful investigation on changes in gene expression by real time PCR and some of the physiological consequences of sublethal exposures to the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid in honeybee larvae. It offers preliminary evidence of imidacloprid impacts on the development of bee larvae by interfering with molting and metabolism. Whereas the study provides evidence that small doses of imidacloprid affect larval growth rate, there is no investigation on whether that could affect the overall colony health, and some of the results open the possibility that the larvae may overcome some of the impacts of the exposure. As the authors state, the doses tested show no impact on larvae survival, food consumption or time to pupation. The investigation and methodological design lack in depth to explain the findings and provide incomplete evidence to support the authors conclusions. The study would benefit from a more thorough mechanistic characterization to better sustain the findings and demonstrate their biological relevance.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: I would like to express, on behalf of all the authors, our sincere appreciation for your insightful and insightful comments and suggestions, which significantly enhanced the quality of the manuscript. Your incisive insights point the way for future research in the field of bee biology on the mechanisms underlying imidacloprid-induced delays in larval development.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated the effects of imidacloprid on honey bee larval development, including macro and micro changes and possible causes. This is the first of its kind in the field of honeybee biology research. However, we found that the underlying mechanism is extremely complex. The effects of toxic substances on animals and their interactions with larval development are complex and far-reaching. They include oxidative stress and damage; disruption of nutrient metabolic homeostasis; inhibition of detoxification and immunity; adverse effects on the nervous, circulatory, and digestive systems; inflammation, disease, and even organ failure; and subsequent effects on physiological activities such as development, reproduction, and behavior, and even death. These toxic effects interact in complex ways with the development of young animals, with some effects directly or indirectly affecting development while others do not.</p>
<p>Addressing this complex mechanistic issue based solely on the results of this study is a formidable challenge, which leads to some limitations of our study as pointed out by the reviewers. Although our study is not comprehensive enough in terms of mechanistic analysis and does not fully elucidate the mechanism, we believe it is an important and valuable first step in this area.</p>
<p>In the future, we will follow the reviewers' suggestions and deliberately redesign the experiments to focus on further research on the issues they raised. These include examining the effects of larval developmental delay on adult and colony health, investigating the post-pupal situation, identifying the source of ROS, and determining whether the larval gut damage observed after pupalization recovers.</p>
<p>In accordance with the reviewers' comments and suggestions, we have revised the manuscript to improve its rigor and scientific quality. We sincerely ask the reviewers to understand and accept this modification from us!</p>
<p>Next is our response to each of the questions and valuable suggestions provided by reviewers:</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Recommendations For The Authors:</bold></p>
<p>1. The authors found a reduction in growth index and body mass, but document no impact on survival, food consumption or time to pupariation. How much exactly is the reduction in growth index? It seems to be from ~0.96 to ~0.93. Is this biologically relevant? Would that be enough to impact the colony health?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Thank you for your comments. In this study, we observed a gradual decrease in larval growth index from day 4, which stabilized by day 6. At the 4th, 5th and 6th instars, the growth index of the imidacloprid-treated groups were significantly lower than those of the control group by an average of 1.35%, 4.49% and 2.76%, respectively (Figure 1, source data 8). Statistical analysis confirmed the significance of the difference in these results. We have incorporated the above description into the red text on lines 148-152 of the Results section. Regarding the reviewer's inquiry on colony health, including imidacloprid-induced delayed larval development and some reduction in growth index and body weight with no effect on survival, food consumption, or time develop to pupation, because we do not currently have the technical capabilities to culture larvae to adulthood in laboratory incubators, this has resulted in a failure to further investigate the effects of imidacloprid-induced delayed larval development on adult colony health. However, this is a very important scientific question for future colony health. We will design experiments to address this issue in a follow-up study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The authors find that P450s can help in detoxifying mechanisms to mitigate imidacloprid impacts. That however is a well-known fact. What is new about this claim?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: The point at which the ability to detoxify toxic substances is acquired during early development varies widely among animals. Although many studies have reported that the detoxification function of P450s helps mitigate the effects of imidacloprid in adult honey bees, there is no conclusive evidence as to whether or not honey bee larvae have acquired this ability at early stages of development. This ability is critical to the defense and health of honey bee larvae. Therefore, it is incumbent upon this study to clarify this issue, which is important in explaining the effects of imidacloprid on honey bee larvae.</p>

<p>Response: Thank you very much for pointing out this error, which we have corrected. Please see lines 92 and 889 in our revised version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. I still encounter important methodological flaws. The authors acknowledge my previous suggestions but only address a small fraction of them. The most relevant points regarding the understanding of the mechanisms behind the delayed growth rate remain unexplored. The expression levels of other nAChRs target of imidacloprid in honeybees were not investigated. The expression analyses are still based on a single time point and using whole larvae, which only superficially explore the problem and may lead to misinterpretations. I do not understand the authors claim that a technological breakthrough is required to address these issues, when performing more PCRs and doing dissections should cover the matter.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Thank you very much for your important comment. You point out several unexplored issues related to understanding the mechanisms behind delayed growth rates. For example, The most relevant points regarding the understanding of the mechanisms behind the delayed growth rate remain unexplored. The expression levels of other nAChRs target of imidacloprid in honeybees were not investigated. The expression analyses are still based on a single time point and using whole larvae. Please allow me to explain. Honeybees (Apis mellifera) have nine different α-subunits, Amelα1-9, and two β-subunits, Amelβ1-2. Amelα5, Amelα7, and Amelα8 are expressed in MB Kenyon cells and AL neurons, and the Amelβ2 subunit is present in Kenyon cells. Amelα2, Amelα3, and Amelα7-2 are expressed in the optic lobes. The aim of this study was to investigate whether imidacloprid induces larval neurotoxicity. Based on the above information, we selected the two most representative nAChRs (Alph1 and Alph2) for analysis. The results showed that exposure to imidacloprid increased the expression of the Alph2 gene and inhibited AChE activity, indicating that imidacloprid is neurotoxic to larvae. This result answered our question of whether imidacloprid induces neurotoxicity in larvae. Therefore, we did not further analyze the expression levels of other nAChRs. We believe that this does not affect the understanding of the mechanism behind the delayed growth rate and that it is not necessarily necessary to analyze all 11 nAChRs to find an answer. We sincerely hope that the reviewers will understand and agree with this.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the expression analysis based on a single time point and whole larvae. In this study, 72 h after imidacloprid exposure  Fig. 1J, 5 days of age) was chosen for sampling because this is when imidacloprid has the greatest and most representative effect on larval development. Therefore, analyzing samples at this time point did not interfere with our exploration of the mechanisms by which imidacloprid causes larval developmental retardation. We used whole larvae rather than individual tissues for sample selection, which is a shortcoming for us. This was mainly due to technical challenges where we were unable to  obtain pure single tissues through dissection. Nevertheless, we will make technical breakthroughs in the future so that we can sample and compare different tissues and developmental stages to obtain more comprehensive and accurate data. Thank you again for raising this important issue and for your valuable suggestions.</p>

<p>1. The authors could in many different ways explore what are the origin of ROS is. That is important to further develop their hypothesis on reduced energy levels.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Thank you very much for your insightful comment and suggestion, it gives us great insight. Mitochondria are the main producers of ATP for cellular metabolism, accounting for approximately 90% of the total. However, mitochondria are also involved in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Excessive accumulation of ROS in mitochondria leads to oxidative stress, which in turn damages mitochondria and further increases ROS levels, creating a vicious cycle (Boovarahan and Kurian, 2018). In the present study, it was found that imidacloprid exposure led to increased ROS and MDA levels in larvae (Figure 5A and Figure 5-source data 14), indicating that imidacloprid induced severe oxidative stress and lipid damage, which may damage mitochondria and in turn affect mitochondrial ATP production, resulting in insufficient energy supply for larval development. This factor may also be an important explanation for the larval developmental delay caused by imidacloprid. We have included the above text in our revised manuscript. Please see the lines 432-442 in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>1. If there is gut damage, is it restored in the adults? It is not clear from the methods which precise stage of larval development was used for gut preparations. That information is important because prior to pupation larvae defecate for the first time and undergo shedding of the gut lining. That could profoundly affect some of the results in case gut preparations for microscopy were made close to this stage. If no food residues are found in the gut of control larvae, does it mean that they are close to pupation? Could the apoptosis found in gut of exposed larvae be the natural shedding of gut lining prior to pupation? All these possibilities have to be discussed and authors should clarify the precise larval stage used in every assay.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Thank you for your important comments. In this study, all samples used for the assay were larvae that had developed to 5-day-old after oral administration imidacloprid at 2-day-old. This is described in detail in the Materials and Methods. See lines 507, 517-521 in the revised manuscript. In general, 6-day-old bee larvae cease feeding and begin their first defecation at approximately 7-day-old. However, in our study, intestinal sections were prepared from 5-day-old larvae that had not fasted or defecated, when the intestinal mucosa was normal and not undergoing shedding. In this case, we found that imidacloprid caused damage to intestinal structures, apoptosis of intestinal cells, incomplete formation of the peritrophic membrane, and undigested food residues in the intestine. We believe that these results are objective and reliable.</p>

<p>1. What is the evidence that imidacloprid reduces growth index by inhibiting 20E? The authors provide real time data and discuss the data in terms of correlation. But correlation does not mean causation. Reduction in growth index could come from multitude of factors such as ROS affecting mitochondrial energy metabolism.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We deeply appreciate your insightful comments and valuable suggestions. In this study, although we conducted an in-depth analysis of ecdysone regulation, which is crucial for insect larval development, and found some clues, as you pointed out, this is not the sole reason for larval developmental delay. In fact, animal growth and development are collectively regulated by numerous physiological, biochemical, and genetic factors. The the decline in the growth index may be due to other factors as you mentioned, such as oxidative stress impairing mitochondria, dysregulated neuro-endocrine axis caused by imidacloprid targeting neurons, poor nutrient absorption, impaired movement, etc, as animal growth and development are collectively regulated by numerous physiological, biochemical, and genetic factors. We have incorporated this understanding into the revised manuscript. Please see the lines 389-394 in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>1. The authors state that &quot;digestion and breakdown of nutrients is impaired by imidacloprid&quot;, the evidence discussed in the paragraph however supports only that imidacloprid impairs some of the genes involved in these processes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Thank you for your comments and valuable insights. In this paragraph, a lack of clarity and completeness in our writing may have led to the misconception that the evidence discussed only demonstrates the effects of imidacloprid on specific genes in these processes. In fact, our intent in this paragraph was to analyze and discuss the effects of imidacloprid on nutrient digestion and breakdown in larvae and to explore the causes of larval developmental delay. We demonstrated this using tissue sections, qRT-PCR and correlation analysis, which showed that the intestinal structure was disrupted and the expression of genes involved in nutrient digestion and catabolism was suppressed, resulting in defects in the catabolic utilization of food and consequently the presence of many food residues. In addition, there was a positive correlation between these genes and larval developmental delay. All this may be another important factor contributing to imidacloprid-induced larval developmental delay. We have revised and incorporate the above logic into the revised manuscript. Please see the lines 407-431 in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>1. There is no evidence for the claim that overexpressing P450s and antioxidant enzymes cause a reduction in growth index. No transcriptome analysis was performed so it is unknown under the circumstances presented here how all the other P450s, antioxidant genes and overall gene profiles are responding. Surely, some genes will be repressed. Reduction in growth index could stem from, oxidative stress impairing mitochondria, dysregulated neuro-endocrine axis caused by imidacloprid targeting neurons, poor nutrient absorption, impaired movement, etc.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Thank you for your comments and valuable insights. Indeed, as you have pointed out, drawing the conclusion that antioxidants and detoxification are significant contributors to larval developmental retardation solely based on correlation analysis is inherently flawed and lacks critical support, especially in the absence of P450 and antioxidant enzyme overexpression and comprehensive transcriptome analysis of other P450s, antioxidant genes, and the entire gene map. We have revised and included in the revised manuscript. Please see lines 461-467 in the red text in the revised manuscript.

<p>1. How come the decreased ATP and glycogen levels have no effect on time to pupation? Extra time points for gene expression, measurements of gut damage, ATP levels, ROS, etc, are vital to answer how the exposed larvae eventually catch up with the unexposed group. Also, it is vital to understand whether these larval impacts translate to impacts on adults.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We sincerely thank you for your insightful comments and suggestions! These important scientific issues you've raised are a good example of your high-level scientific thinking, and they will help us and other future researchers in the field to more comprehensively study and interpret the toxic effects of imidacloprid on honey bee larvae and their potential mechanisms, as well as the mechanisms of larval resistance and adaptation to imidacloprid. According to your comments, we will adapt our experiments and conduct more thorough research in the future to address the above issues.</p>

<p>1. I am confused about the author's definition of developmental rate; rate gives the notion of speed to achieve something. But the authors use developmental rate as a measure of viability (number of larvae that successfully pupated). There seems to be a significant decrease in their developmental rate plot (Fig 1i), but at the same time the authors show in Figure 1c (and mention throughout the manuscript) that there is no difference in probability of survival. This is quite confusing and the method section regarding these data is too concise and does little to help explain what the authors were trying to measure. The whole section on developmental traits would benefit of more details on how experiments were conducted and equipment used.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Thank you so much for your valuable comments. Yes, as you can see, there appears to be a significant decrease in developmental rate but no difference in survival probability, which is an intriguing finding of this study. This finding suggests that the 377 ppb imidacloprid dose is not as harmful to the larvae as previously thought. Imidacloprid appeared to limit the larval ability to molt and develop only to a certain extent, but had no effect on the developmental process, let alone survival. It's worth investigating the underlying mechanism. As a result, we have included this question in the design of future studies. In addition, following your suggestion, we have revised the description of the material and methods in this section, including the experimental method in more detail. For more information, please see the revised manuscript, lines 530-541.</p>

<p>1. The authors should try to make it clear what percentage of exposed larvae become adults? I am confused because the plot called developmental rate might be trying to convey this message, but developmental rate and viability are very distinct traits. What is the difference, if any, in the time it takes for exposed larvae to become adults in comparison to non-exposed ones? Is there a difference in adult body weight? The answers to these last two questions are important to start understanding if the impacts of imidacloprid on larvae alimentation would still impact these same individuals once they become adults, i.e., would there be impacts for the colony and workers activity?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Thank you very much for your insightful comments. Unfortunately, this is where the research falls short. Culturing larvae to adulthood in 24-well cell culture plates is a significant technical challenge that we have yet to overcome. As a result, the important questions you raise, such as what percentage of exposed larvae become adults? How does the time to adulthood differ (if at all) for exposed larvae versus non-exposed larvae? Is there a difference in adult weight? Do the effects of imidacloprid on larval feeding persist after these individuals reach adulthood? Does imidacloprid damage to larvae affect colony and adult activity? We do not have answers at this time. We are aware that answers to the above questions will help people better understand how serious the effects of imidacloprid environmental residues on honey bee larvae and adults, as well as bee colonies as a whole, are, and will draw sufficient attention to them. We intend to break through this technological bottleneck of culture larvae to adulthood in future studies and incorporate the above scientific questions into our next research design. Thank you again for your insightful comments! This gives us new research ideas.</p>
