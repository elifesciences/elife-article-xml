<title>Abstract</title><p>Degradation of many yeast mRNAs involves decapping by the Dcp1:Dcp2 complex. Previous studies on decapping activators Edc3 and Scd6 suggested their limited roles in mRNA decay. RNA-seq analysis of mutants lacking one or both proteins revealed that Scd6 and Edc3 have largely redundant activities in targeting numerous mRNAs for degradation that are masked in the single mutants. These transcripts also are frequently targeted by decapping activators Dhh1 and Pat1, and the collective evidence suggests that Scd6/Edc3 act interchangeably to recruit Dhh1 to Dcp2. Ribosome profiling shows that redundancy between Scd6 and Edc3 and their functional interactions with Dhh1 and Pat1 extend to translational repression of particular transcripts, including a cohort of poorly translated mRNAs displaying interdependent regulation by all four factors. Scd6/Edc3 also participate with Dhh1/Pat1 in post-transcriptional repression of proteins required for respiration and catabolism of alternative carbon sources, which are normally expressed only in limiting glucose. Simultaneously eliminating Scd6/Edc3 increases mitochondrial membrane potential and elevates metabolites of the tricarboxylic acid and glyoxylate cycles typically observed only during growth in low glucose. Thus, Scd6/Edc3 act redundantly, in parallel with Dhh1 and in cooperation with Pat1, to adjust gene expression to nutrient availability by controlling mRNA decapping and decay.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Degradation of mRNA is a key aspect of gene expression that can be regulated in response to nutrient availability, cell stress, and developmental pathways in eukaryotic cells and also serves to eliminate defective mRNAs. A major pathway of cytoplasmic mRNA turnover involves truncating the poly(A) tail by the Ccr4/Not and Pan2/Pan3 complexes, followed by removal of the m<sup>7</sup>G cap by the Dcp1/Dcp2 decapping complex and 5’ to 3’ exonucleolytic degradation by Xrn1. The decapping complex is activated by factors that interact with low-complexity sequence motifs in the C-terminal tail (CTT) of the catalytic subunit Dcp2, including Edc3, Scd6, DEAD-box helicase Dhh1, and Pat1, which also interact with one another extensively. There is evidence that Pat1 is recruited to oligoadenylate tails remaining on mRNAs following partial deadenylation, in association with the Lsm1-Lsm7 complex, and activates decapping via interactions with other decapping activators and with the Dcp2 CTT itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Parker 2012</xref>) (He and Jacobson 2023)</p>
<p>Genome-wide analysis of mRNA abundance (RNA-seq) in yeast mutants lacking Dhh1 or Pat1 suggested that only ∼40-50% of mRNAs up- or down-regulated in one mutant were also similarly dysregulated in the other mutant, suggesting that many mRNAs are targeted for degradation exclusively by Pat1 or Dhh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">He et al. 2018</xref>). By also determining mRNA changes in a <italic>pat1Δdhh1Δ</italic> double mutant, we uncovered more extensive functional cooperation by Pat1 and Dhh1 in targeting ∼75% of mRNAs up-regulated in the single mutants, as a fraction of mRNAs were derepressed only in the double mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Vijjamarri et al. 2023a</xref>). The majority of mRNAs derepressed by <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> or <italic>pat1Δ</italic> mutations are likewise up-regulated in <italic>dcp2Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">He et al. 2018</xref>), their derepression on eliminating Dhh1 is largely dependent on Dcp2, and they exhibit greater than average proportions of decapped mRNAs in WT cells but not in the <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> or <italic>pat1Δ</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Vijjamarri et al. 2023a</xref>)—all consistent with Dhh1/Pat1 targeting mRNAs for degradation via decapping. Moreover, more than half of the mRNAs up-regulated by <italic>dcp2Δ</italic> are likewise up-regulated by <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> and/or <italic>pat1Δ,</italic> whereas most of the remaining 45% of Dcp2-repressed transcripts are targeted primarily by the Upf factors responsible for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Vijjamarri et al. 2023b</xref>), which represses a large cohort of natural NMD targets in WT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Celik et al. 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>The cumulative contributions of Dhh1 and Pat1 to mRNA decay via decapping is consistent with their independent interactions with distinct segments of the Dcp2 CTT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">He et al. 2018</xref>), which appears to be direct for Pat1 but bridged by Edc3 or Scd6 for Dhh1. There is also evidence for distinct decapping complexes containing either Dhh1 or Pat1 in addition to Xrn1, Edc3 or Scd6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">He et al. 2022</xref>). However, Dhh1 occupancy determined by RIP-Seq analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Miller et al. 2018</xref>), tends to be elevated for mRNAs derepressed by either <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> (23) or <italic>pat1Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Vijjamarri et al. 2023a</xref>), consistent with Dhh1 contributing to degradation of many mRNAs targeted by Pat1. In accordance with overlapping roles for Pat1 and Dhh1, Pat1 binding to the Dcp2 CTT was required for degradation of certain Dhh1-targeted mRNAs only when Dhh1 recruitment to the CTT was compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">He et al. 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>There is evidence that Edc3 is a common constituent of decapping complexes containing Xrn1 and one or more of the decapping activators Dhh1, Pat1, Scd6, and Upf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">He et al. 2022</xref>). It is surprising therefore that Edc3 has been implicated in targeting only two transcripts for degradation, <italic>YRA1</italic> and <italic>RPS28B</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Badis et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dong et al. 2007</xref>). Edc3 shares sequence similarity with decapping activator Scd6 and both proteins contain an FDF motif shown to interact competitively with the Dhh1 homolog in animal systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Tritschler et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Tritschler et al. 2009</xref>). Yeast Edc3 contains two other segments besides the FDF motif that likely comprise a tripartite interaction surface for Dhh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sharif et al. 2013</xref>). Edc3 and Scd6 also share N-terminal LSm domains that compete for binding to helical-leucine-rich (HLM) motifs in the yeast Dcp2 CTT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fromm et al. 2012</xref>), an interaction that appears to activate decapping by overcoming an autoinhibitory element in Dcp2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">He and Jacobson 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Paquette et al. 2018</xref>). Analyzing effects of deleting the Edc3 interaction site in the Dcp2-CTT on levels of several Dhh1-repressed mRNAs suggested that recruitment of Dhh1 to Dcp2 can be mediated interchangeably by Edc3 or Scd6 bound to the same site in the Dcp2 CTT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">He et al. 2022</xref>). These findings, plus the fact that deleting <italic>SCD6</italic> and <italic>EDC3</italic> simultaneously confers a synthetic growth defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Decourty et al. 2008</xref>), suggest that Scd6 and Edc3 might function redundantly in targeting specific mRNAs for decapping and degradation.</p>
<p>Although tethering Dhh1 or Scd6 enhances degradation of reporter mRNAs via Dcp1/Dcp2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Carroll et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sweet et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Zeidan et al. 2018</xref>), it is not well understood how these factors are targeted to specific native mRNAs. Dhh1 has been implicated in accelerating degradation associated with non-optimal codons in yeast mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Presnyak et al. 2015</xref>), being required for the rapid turnover conferred by suboptimal codons inserted in reporter mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sweet et al. 2012</xref>). A queue of slowly elongating ribosomes upstream from non-optimal codons can be recognized by Dhh1, and overexpressing or tethering Dhh1 evokes ribosome stalling at non-optimal codons. Dhh1 association and Dhh1-dependent repression of mRNA abundance both correlate with codon non-optimality across the yeast transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Radhakrishnan et al. 2016</xref>). Structural evidence suggests that ribosomes stalled at suboptimal codons with an empty A site are recognized by Not5 binding to the ribosomal E-site to elicit Dhh1 recruitment and increased mRNA decapping and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Buschauer et al. 2020</xref>). Dcp2, Pat1, and the deadenylase subunits of the Ccr4/Not complex also contribute to this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Radhakrishnan et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Webster et al. 2018</xref>). Despite these findings, the sets of mRNAs found to be most highly up-regulated in <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> and <italic>pat1Δ</italic> cells are not enriched for suboptimal codons and are generally well-translated in WT cells, suggesting that other features of these transcripts are responsible for their preferential targeting by Dhh1 or Pat1 for decapping/decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Vijjamarri et al. 2023a</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to regulating mRNA degradation, there is evidence that Pat1, Dhh1, and Scd6 can repress mRNA translation. Tethering Dhh1 or Scd6 represses translation of reporter mRNAs in <italic>dcp2Δ</italic> mutant cells where the tethered transcripts cannot be decapped and degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Carroll et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sweet et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Zeidan et al. 2018</xref>), functioning either during elongation (Dhh1) or the initiation stage (Scd6) of translation. Deletion of Dhh1 and Pat1 simultaneously eliminated loss of bulk polysomes evoked by nutrient starvation and also increased initiation rates of certain mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Holmes et al. 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Coller and Parker 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arribere et al. 2011</xref>). Supporting a direct role in repressing translation, overexpressing Dhh1 or Pat1 in nonstarved cells evoked polysome disassembly and reduced the initiation rate of specific mRNAs; and addition of Dhh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Coller and Parker 2005</xref>) or N-terminally truncated Pat1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Nissan et al. 2010</xref>) to yeast extracts inhibited bulk translation and 48S preinitiation complex (PIC) assembly in vitro. Ribosome profiling studies of <italic>dhh1Δ, pat1Δ</italic> and <italic>pat1Δdhh1Δ</italic> mutants identified hundreds of mRNAs for particular genes that appear to be translationally repressed or activated by Dhh1 or Pat1 in nutrient-replete cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jungfleisch et al. 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Radhakrishnan et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Zeidan et al. 2018</xref>), which frequently involves cooperation between Dhh1 and Pat1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Vijjamarri et al. 2023a</xref>). Interestingly, a fraction of mRNAs showed translational repression by Dhh1 that required Dcp2 and exhibit high proportions of decapped degradation intermediates in WT cells, suggesting translational repression via Dhh1-stimulated decapping that precedes mRNA turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Vijjamarri et al. 2023b</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, we showed that Pat1 and Dhh1 function with the decapping enzyme in rich medium to repress the abundance or translation of numerous mRNAs encoding proteins required specifically in media containing an alternative carbon or nitrogen source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Vijjamarri et al. 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Vijjamarri et al. 2023b</xref>). These include many of the mitochondrial proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation (Ox. Phos.), and Pat1, Dhh1 and Dcp2 are required for the low mitochondrial membrane potential in glucose-replete cells expected from low electron transport chain (ETC) activity. Mutants lacking Dcp2, Dhh1, or Pat1 also display impaired mRNA turnover or elevated translation of mRNAs subject to carbon or nitrogen catabolite transcriptional repression in WT cells in rich medium. Related to this, Pat1 cooperates with Dhh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hu et al. 2015</xref>) in repressing mRNAs encoding factors for autophagy and helps to suppress this pathway in rich medium. Pat1 further assists Dcp2 in post-transcriptional repression of mRNAs encoding cell adhesion proteins, critical for forming adhesion-linked chains of elongated cells able to penetrate substrates, thereby repressing invasive cell growth on nutrient-rich agar medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Vijjamarri et al. 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Vijjamarri et al. 2023b</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we employed RNA-Seq and ribosome profiling to determine whether Edc3 and Scd6 have largely redundant functions in targeting mRNAs for decapping and attendant degradation, and whether they functionally cooperate with Pat1 or Dhh1 in repressing the abundance or translation of particular mRNAs. We also sought to determine whether Edc3/Scd6 participate with Pat1/Dhh1 and the decapping enzyme in conferring post-transcriptional repression in rich medium of genes normally well-expressed only in nutrient-deprived cells. We find that a mutant lacking both Edc3 and Scd6 exhibits increased abundance of a cohort of mRNAs that are up-regulated only when both factors are eliminated, and which occurs without increased transcription of the cognate genes, signifying reduced decapping and degradation in mutant cells lacking both factors. These transcripts are also generally derepressed in <italic>dcp2Δ</italic> cells, and in cells lacking Pat1 or Dhh1, and show enrichment for Dhh1 occupancy. A strikingly similar pattern of mRNA derepression observed in the <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> and <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> mutants supports the notion that Edc3/Scd6 act redundantly to recruit Dhh1 to Dcp2 for activation of decapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">He et al. 2022</xref>). We also observed functional redundancy between Scd6 and Edc3 and cooperation with Dhh1/Pat1 in repressing translation of particular mRNAs, with evidence for interdependent repression by all four decapping factors. Importantly, Edc3/Scd6 also contribute to the post-transcriptional repression of proteins required for catabolism of non-preferred carbon or nitrogen sources on rich medium, including Ox. Phos. proteins, acting collectively to enhance glucose repression, maintain low-level mitochondrial electron transport and reduce levels of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) and glyoxylate cycle intermediates in glucose-replete cells. Together, our findings indicate that Edc3 and Scd6 have redundant functions in stimulating degradation or translational repression of transcripts targeted in parallel by Dhh1 and Pat1 to promote post-transcriptional repression in rich medium of factors normally up-regulated only in nutrient-deprived cells.</p>

<p>The following yeast strains were employed for all experiments: WT strain HFY114 (W303: <italic>MATa ade2-1 ura3-1 his3-11,15 trp1-1 leu2-3,112 can1-100</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">He et al. 2003</xref>), <italic>scd6Δ</italic> strain SYY2352 (<italic>MATa ade2-1 ura3-1 his3-11,15 trp1-1 leu2-3,112 can1-100 scd6Δ::kanMX6</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">He and Jacobson 2015</xref>), <italic>edc3Δ</italic> strain FZY862 (<italic>MATa ade2-1 ura3-1 his3-11,15 trp1-1 leu2-3,112 can1-100 edc3Δ::kanMX4</italic>), and <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> strain FZY858 (<italic>MATa ade2-1 ura3-1 his3-11,15 trp1-1 leu2-3,112 can1-100 scd6Δ::hphMX4 edc3Δ::kanMX4</italic>).</p>
<p>Strains FZY858 and FZY862 were generated by replacing chromosomal <italic>EDC3</italic> in strains FZY855 and HFY114, respectively, with the <italic>edc3Δ::kanMX4</italic> allele amplified by PCR from the chromosomal DNA of strain 255 (<italic>MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 edc3Δ::kanMX4</italic>) obtained from Research Genetics. DNA sequences up to 310 bp upstream and 340 bp downstream of the <italic>EDC3</italic> coding sequence were included in the amplified fragment used for transformation of FZY855 and HFY114 to G418-resistance. FZY855 was derived from SYY2352 by transforming with marker-swap plasmid pAG32 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Goldstein and McCusker 1999</xref>) to replace <italic>scd6Δ::kanMX6</italic> with <italic>scd6Δ::hphMX6,</italic> selecting for resistance to hygromycin and screening for loss of G418-resistance. The presence of all deletion alleles was verified by PCR analysis of chromosomal DNA. A complete list of yeast strains employed is given in Table S1.</p>
<p>Plasmids pLfz614-7 and pLfz635-5 contain the <italic>EDC3</italic> CDS with 420 bp upstream and 490 bp downstream, on a ∼2.6 kb fragment, and plasmids pL615-5 and pLfz636-1 contain the <italic>SCD6</italic> CDS with 500 bp upstream and 180 bp downstream on a ∼1.7 kb fragment, amplified by PCR from yeast genomic DNA and inserted between the XhoI and EcoRI sites of YCplac33 or YCplac111, respectively. The inserted yeast DNA fragments were verified by sequencing in their entirety. A complete list of plasmids employed is given in Table S2.</p>

<p><italic>Extraction of metabolites.</italic> Frozen cell pellets were thawed on wet ice. Extraction buffer, consisting of 80% methanol (Fisher Scientific) and 500 nM metabolomics amino acid mix standard (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.), was prepared and placed on dry ice. Samples were extracted by mixing cell pellets with extraction buffer at 10mg/mL (determined by sample OD measurements) in 2.0 mL screw-cap vials containing ∼100 µL of disruption beads (Research Products International, Mount Prospect, IL). Each sample was homogenized for 10 cycles on a bead blaster homogenizer (Benchmark Scientific, Edison, NJ), with each cycle consisting of 30 sec homogenization at 6 m/s followed by a 30 sec pause. Samples were centrifuged at 21,000 g for 3 min at 4°C.

<p><italic>LC-MS/MS with the hybrid metabolomics method.</italic> Samples were subjected to an LC-MS analysis to detect and quantify known peaks. Extraction of polar metabolites was carried out on each sample based on a previously described method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jones et al. 2014</xref>). LC was conducted using a Millipore™ ZIC-pHILIC (2.1 x150 mm, 5 μm) column coupled to a Dionex Ultimate 3000™ system with gradient elution conducted at 25°C with a flow rate of 100 μL/min using the following buffers A) 10 mM ammonium carbonate in water, pH 9.0, and B) neat acetonitrile. The gradient profile was as follows; 80-20% B (0-30 min), 20-80% B (30-31 min), 80-80% B (31-42 min). Injection volume was set to 2 μL for all analyses with a 42 min total run time per injection.</p>
<p>MS was conducted by coupling the LC system to a Thermo Q Exactive HF™ mass spectrometer operating in heated electrospray ionization mode (HESI). Method duration was 30 min with a polarity switching data-dependent Top 5 method for both positive and negative modes. Spray voltage for both positive and negative modes was 3.5kV and capillary temperature was set to 320 °C with a sheath gas rate of 35, aux gas of 10, and max spray current of 100 μA. The full MS scan for both polarities utilized 120,000 resolution with an AGC target of 3e6 and a maximum IT of 100 ms, and the scan range was from 67-1000 m/z. Tandem MS spectra for both positive and negative mode used a resolution of 15,000, AGC target of 1e5, maximum IT of 50 ms, isolation window of 0.4 m/z, isolation offset of 0.1 m/z, fixed first mass of 50 m/z, and 3-way multiplexed normalized collision energies (nCE) of 10, 35, 80.

<p>Coverage of a library of polar metabolites of major pathways of intermediary metabolism allowed detection of 130 of the 147 metabolites examined in at least 4 samples, and 91 detected in all 20 samples after background threshold correction. Instrument performance was assessed using the internal standards added to the samples during metabolite extraction and instrument mass accuracy was within tolerance (-2.0 ppm), LC column performance was stable (0.16 min RT range) and internal standard response variability was 13% across the samples.

<title>Evidence that Scd6 and Edc3 functionally cooperate to control the abundance of many individual mRNAs</title>
<p>To determine whether Scd6 and Edc3 function redundantly in post-transcriptional control of gene expression, we constructed a <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> double mutant isogenic to the <italic>scd6Δ</italic> and <italic>edc3Δ</italic> single mutants we examined previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Zeidan et al. 2018</xref>). Only the double mutant exhibits a marked slow-growth (Slg<sup>-</sup>) phenotype on synthetic complete medium (SC), which was largely complemented by introducing either <italic>SCD6</italic> or <italic>EDC3</italic> on a single copy plasmid (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. S1A</xref>). Analysis of polysome assembly revealed a ∼40% reduction in ratio of polysomes to monosomes (P/M) in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> double mutant, whereas the single mutants showed little (<italic>scd6Δ</italic>) or no (<italic>edc3Δ</italic>) reduction in bulk translation by this assay (Fig. S1B). These results suggest that Scd6 and Edc3 function redundantly to carry out one or more functions required for WT levels of bulk translation and cell growth in nutrient replete cells.</p>
<p>To examine the effects of the <italic>scd6Δ, edc3Δ,</italic> and <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> mutations on the abundance and translation of individual mRNAs, we conducted RNA-Seq and ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq) of the mutant and WT strains following growth in liquid rich medium (YPD) at 30°C (processed data compiled in supplementary File S1). Ribo-Seq entails deep-sequencing of ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs, or ribosome footprints), and cycloheximide was added to the lysates to arrest elongating ribosomes on the mRNA following cell breakage. The ratio of RPF sequencing reads summed over the coding sequences (CDS) to the total mRNA reads from RNA-Seq for the corresponding transcript provides a measure of translational efficiency (TE) for each mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ingolia et al. 2009</xref>). The ribosome profiling and RNA-Seq results between two biological replicates for each strain were highly reproducible with Pearson correlation coefficients (r) ranging between 0.95-1.0 for different pairwise comparisons of replicates (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A-B</xref>). We employed DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Love et al. 2014</xref>) to identify statistically significant differences in relative mRNA abundance, RPF abundance, or TE for all expressed mRNAs between WT and mutant strains (see Methods for details).</p>
<p>Analysis of the RNA-Seq results identified 81 mRNAs that were significantly derepressed in the <italic>edc3Δ</italic> mutant vs. WT by &gt;1.5-fold at a false discovery rate (FDR) of &lt;0.05 (mRNA_up_e3; <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A</xref>), and 123 mRNAs reduced in abundance by <italic>edc3Δ</italic> by &gt;1.5-fold at the same FDR (mRNA_dn_e3, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3B</xref>). Applying the same criteria, only 14 mRNAs were up-regulated and only 34 down-regulated by the <italic>scd6Δ</italic> single mutation (mRNA_up_s6 &amp; mRNA_dn_s6, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A-B</xref>). Importantly, much greater numbers of mRNAs were dysregulated by the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> double mutation: 741 in the mRNA_up_s6,e3 group and 793 in the mRNA_dn_s6,e3 (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A-B</xref>), indicating that the two factors have highly overlapping functions in controlling mRNA abundance with either one sufficient for nearly WT levels of most mRNAs dysregulated in the double mutant. <italic>CIT1</italic> mRNA, encoding a mitochondrial enzyme of the TCA cycle is representative of a transcript significantly up-regulated in both mRNA and RPF abundance only in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> double mutant (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3C</xref>).</p>
<p>Many yeast mutants with Slg<sup>-</sup> phenotypes, including <italic>pat1Δ, dhh1Δ,</italic> and <italic>dcp2Δ</italic> deletion mutants, exhibit altered expression of most mRNAs belonging to the Environmental Stress Response (ESR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">O’Duibhir et al. 2014</xref>), which includes ∼300 induced (iESR) and ∼600 repressed (rESR) mRNAs dysregulated in WT cells by various stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gasch et al. 2000</xref>). In keeping with its Slg<sup>-</sup> phenotype, the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> mutation conferred a marked reduction in median expression of rESR mRNAs, and increased expression of the iESR mRNAs, which exceeded in magnitude the changes observed for the slowest growing yeast deletion mutants analyzed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">O’Duibhir et al. 2014</xref>) (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3D-E</xref>). The two single mutations, by contrast, conferred much smaller changes in ESR mRNAs (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3D-E</xref>). (In all box plots, when notches do not overlap between adjacent boxes, their two medians differ with 95% confidence; and when notches do not overlap 0 in log<sub>2</sub> plots, the median differs significantly from that of all mRNAs, which is invariably close to 1.0.) Consistent with these results, the transcripts up-regulated in the double mutant are enriched for iESR mRNAs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), making it possible that the 187 iESR transcripts up-regulated in this strain are responding indirectly to cell stress. The remaining 75% of the mRNAs up-regulated in <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> cells are not iESR mRNAs however (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), suggesting that the increased abundance of these 554 transcripts arises from eliminating Edc3/Scd6 functions in mRNA decay. Below, we excluded the ESR mRNAs from analyses of mRNA changes in an effort to focus on mRNAs whose abundance is controlled directly by Scd6 and Edc3.</p>

<p>Considering only mRNAs not governed by the ESR, we identified 591 non-iESR mRNAs significantly up-regulated in any of the three mutants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Examining the ΔRNA values for the majority fraction of 521 transcripts up-regulated only in the double mutant confirms little change in median abundance in each single mutant and a strong synthetic derepression in the double mutant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1B</xref> &amp; 1C sector (iii))—as expected for redundant repressive functions of Scd6 and Edc3. <italic>MDH2,</italic> encoding an enzyme of the glyoxylate cycle, exemplifies a non-iESR transcript up-regulated in both mRNA and RPF abundance exclusively in the double mutant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>).

Interestingly, the small set of 37 mRNAs significantly derepressed only in the <italic>edc3Δ</italic> single mutant shows reduced rather than increased abundance in the <italic>scd6Δ</italic> single mutant, and lower derepression in the double mutant vs. the <italic>edc3Δ</italic> single mutant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> &amp; C sector (i)), suggesting that Scd6 enhances rather than represses these mRNAs, especially in <italic>edc3Δ</italic> cells.</p>

<title>Evidence that Dhh1 and Pat1 functionally cooperate with Scd6/Edc3 in repressing mRNA abundance</title>
<p>We recently identified a large group of 1018 non-iESR mRNAs derepressed by either the <italic>pat1Δ, dhh1Δ,</italic> or <italic>pat1Δdhh1Δ</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Vijjamarri et al. 2023a</xref>). Importantly, this group is highly enriched for the 591 mRNAs derepressed by the <italic>scd6Δ, edc3Δ,</italic> or <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> mutations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Indeed, ∼70% of the transcripts derepressed by <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> are also derepressed in one of the three <italic>pat1Δ/dhh1Δ</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, sector (ii)), showing comparable up-regulation in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ, pat1Δ,</italic> and <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> mutants, but little change in the <italic>scd6Δ</italic> and <italic>edc3Δ</italic> single mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>(ii)). These mRNAs generally exhibit the greatest derepression in the <italic>pat1Δdhh1Δ</italic> double mutant, indicating cumulative contributions of Dhh1 and Pat1 to their repression, in contrast to the largely redundant roles played by Scd6 and Edc3 in repressing these mRNAs. Thus, efficient repression of these 411 mRNAs requires a combination of Pat1, Dhh1 and either Edc3 or Scd6. As expected, the smaller group of 180 mRNAs significantly derepressed exclusively by <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> (sector (i) of <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) show strong derepression only in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> double mutant; but they are appreciably up-regulated by <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> while being largely unaffected by <italic>pat1Δ</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, sector (i)). Finally, the majority group of 607 mRNAs significantly derepressed by only <italic>pat1Δ</italic> or <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> display the largest increases in the two mutants lacking Pat1, but display smaller and similar increases in response to the <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> and <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> mutations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2A</xref> &amp; 2B, sector (iii)). Overall, these findings suggest that Dhh1 and Pat1 both contribute to repressing the majority of mRNAs repressed by Scd6/Edc3, but with Dhh1 contributing more extensively than Pat1.</p>

<p>Further evidence for this last point comes from a k-means cluster analysis of mRNA changes in different mutants for the group of 431 non-iESR mRNAs derepressed by <italic>dhh1Δ,</italic> which revealed a stronger correlation between the changes conferred by <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> and <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> (ρ = 0.90) than between <italic>pat1Δ</italic> with either <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> (ρ = 0.74) or <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> (ρ = 0.71) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Consistent with this, the <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> mutations up-regulate a considerably larger proportion of the mRNAs significantly derepressed by <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> (∼70%) vs. those derepressed by <italic>pat1Δ</italic> (∼41%) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Furthermore, the majority of mRNAs up-regulated by <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> exhibit redundant repression by Scd6 and Edc3, showing marked derepression comparable to that given by <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> itself only in the <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> double mutant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). These findings are consistent with the involvement of Edc3/Scd6 in the degradation of most mRNAs targeted by Dhh1, which are more variably and less extensively repressed by Pat1.</p>

<title>Evidence that Scd6/Edc3 repress mRNA abundance by enhancing decapping and degradation rather than suppressing transcription</title>
<p>We next examined whether the mRNAs significantly repressed by Edc3/Scd6 are also regulated by the decapping enzyme Dcp1/Dcp2. Supporting this, cluster analysis of mRNA changes revealed that the majority of non-iESR mRNAs derepressed in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> double mutant are also derepressed by <italic>dcp2Δ</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, blue colors in cols. 1 &amp; 3), with a strong correlation between the abundance changes conferred by these mutations relative to WT (ρ=0.74, P≈0). In addition, <italic>dcp2Δ</italic> increased the median abundance of this group of mRNAs similarly to that given by <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, cols. 1 &amp; 4). These findings implicate decapping by Dcp1:Dcp2 as an important driver of the repression of mRNA levels directed by Scd6/Edc3. The cluster analysis in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> once again reveals greater similarity between the mRNA changes conferred by <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> and those given by <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> (ρ = 0.90) versus <italic>pat1Δ</italic> (ρ = 0.69); and <italic>pat1Δ</italic> also confers a smaller median reduction than <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> of the Scd6/Edc3-repressed mRNAs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>

<p>Additional support for the conclusion that Scd6/Edc3 target mRNAs for decapping came from evidence that the mRNAs up-regulated in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> mutant tend to accumulate in WT cells as decapped isoforms. It is known that following decapping by Dcp1/Dcp2 mRNAs frequently undergo 5’ to 3’ decay co-translationally, with Xrn1 following behind the last translating ribosome loaded prior to decapping, and such decapped intermediates associated with ribosomes account for ∼12% of the mRNAs in WT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Pelechano et al. 2015</xref>). We reasoned that mRNAs preferentially targeted by Scd6/Edc3 for decapping and attendant degradation by Xrn1 should exhibit a greater than average proportion of decapped intermediates in WT cells. To test this, we interrogated our previous cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) data providing the abundance of all capped mRNA 5’ ends and compared it to the abundance of total RNA transcripts determined by RNA-Seq conducted in parallel on biological replicates of mRNA samples prepared from the WT and <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> strains described above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Vijjamarri et al. 2023a</xref>). Transcript numbers per million reads (TPMs) from CAGE (C) and RNA-Seq (T) were determined and C/T ratios calculated as a proxy for the proportion of capped molecules for each transcript (File S1). (Because the CAGE and RNA-Seq data were normalized separately, the C/T ratios are relative, not absolute, proportions of capped transcripts.) Importantly, the C/T ratios are lower in WT cells for the 448 non-iESR mRNAs up-regulated in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> double mutant (from <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) compared to all expressed mRNAs for which CAGE data was obtained (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, cols. 1 &amp; 5). By contrast, the C/T ratios are higher than average for the non-rESR mRNAs that are down-regulated in relative abundance in <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> cells, as expected for an unusually low degree of decapping in WT cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, cols 3 &amp; 5).</p>
<p>Importantly, these C/T ratios were elevated above their values in WT cells to nearly the same level for all groups of mRNAs, in the manner expected from eliminating Dhh1-stimulated decapping (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, cf. cols. 2,4,6). These results are consistent with the notion that impaired Dhh1-stimulated decapping and attendant 5’ to 3’ degradation is an important driver of increased mRNA abundance in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> mutant.</p>
<p>Independent evidence that derepression of mRNA abundance in <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> cells results from reduced decapping was provided by analyzing the codon protection indices (CPI) of the mRNA_up_s6,e3 transcripts, an indicator of co-translational decay by Xrn1. Decapped degradation intermediates exhibit three-nucleotide periodicity generated by precise Xrn1 cleavage up to the last translating ribosome at the 5’ end of mRNA, and the CPI quantifies the prevalence of such intermediates for each mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Pelechano et al. 2015</xref>). The results in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref> show that the mRNA_up_s6,e3 transcripts (including or excluding ESR mRNAs) exhibit higher than average median CPIs, indicating a greater than average involvement of decapping and co-translational degradation by Xrn1 in their decay, whereas mRNA_dn_s6,e3 transcripts exhibit lower than average CPI values, consistent with an alternative degradation pathway controlling their abundance.</p>
<p>To determine whether increased transcription contributes to increased abundance of any mRNAs derepressed by <italic>pat1Δ</italic> or <italic>dhh1Δ</italic>, we performed ChIP-Seq analysis of Rpb1 to measure RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) occupancies averaged across the CDS of every gene. We obtained highly reproducible results for the three biological replicates analyzed for each strain (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2D</xref> &amp; <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4A</xref>). To quantify absolute changes in Pol II occupancies, <italic>S. pombe</italic> chromatin was added as a spike-in to each <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> chromatin sample prior to immunoprecipitation of Rpb1. To measure absolute changes in mRNA abundance, we re-analyzed the RNA-Seq data taking into account the recovery of External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCC) transcripts that had been spiked-in prior to the replicate total RNA samples prior to preparation of the cDNA libraries. The results for ERCC-normalized RNA-Seq were highly reproducible among the replicates (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2C</xref>).</p>
<p>Considering all expressed mRNAs, the spike-in normalized RNA-Seq data (File S3) revealed a 46% increase in median total mRNA abundance in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> mutant vs. WT that was accompanied by only a 4% increase in median Rpb1 occupancy in the double mutant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3E</xref>_alt, cols. 3 &amp; 6), indicating that a reduced rate of mRNA decay associated with little change in transcription rate across the transcriptome leads to a net increase in total mRNA levels in the double mutant. Interrogating the two groups of non-ESR mRNAs found to be up- or down-regulated by <italic>scd6Δedc3</italic> revealed a 2.79-fold increase in spike-in normalized median mRNA abundance for the non-iESR mRNA_up_s6,e3 group that was associated with only a 1.2-fold increase in normalized Rpb1 occupancies, indicating a small contribution of increased transcription to the elevated mRNA abundance of these transcripts in the double mutant. The down-regulated non-rESR mRNA_dn_s6,e3 transcripts showed 12% and 7% decreases in spike-in normalized median mRNA abundance and Rpb1 occupancies, respectively, indicating a larger contribution of transcriptional changes to the diminished transcript levels of these mRNAs in the double mutant. It should be noted that spike-in normalization of the RNA-Seq data reveals that the group of mRNAs up-regulated in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> mutant show larger increases in absolute compared to relative transcript levels (2.79-fold vs. 1.84-fold median increases) but show smaller absolute vs. relative reductions of the group of down-regulated transcripts (0.88-fold vs. 0.57-fold) (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4B</xref>, cf. cols. 1 vs. 4 and 2 vs. 5). This reflects the fact that the absolute changes conferred by <italic>scd6Δedc3</italic> for most transcripts involve the increased abundance expected from reduced decapping/decay in cells lacking Scd6/Edc3 (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4B</xref>, col. 3).</p>
<p>Codon nonoptimality has been linked with Dhh1-mediated mRNA decay partly by demonstrating that the sTAI values of mRNAs, which quantify their overall codon optimality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sabi and Tuller 2014</xref>), are inversely correlated with the changes in mRNA abundance observed in <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> versus WT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Radhakrishnan et al. 2016</xref>). Similarly, analyzing the mRNA changes conferred by the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> mutation for all non-ESR transcripts reveals a small but statistically significant negative correlation with sTAI values (Pearson r of -0.085, P = 2 x 10<sup>-9</sup>) similar to that observed for the <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> mutation (r = -0.071, P = 6 x 10<sup>-6</sup>) (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A</xref>, cyan vs. orange), indicating a tendency for mRNAs with lower codon optimality/sTAI scores to show greater increases in relative abundance in response to <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> or <italic>dhh1Δ</italic>. However, the group of 591 non-iESR mRNAs most significantly up-regulated by the <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> mutations (from <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) have a median sTAI value (0.35) nearly identical to that of all nonESR mRNAs, which is also the case for the group of 1018 mRNAs derepressed by the <italic>pat1Δ</italic> or <italic>dhh1</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Vijjamarri et al. 2023a</xref>) (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5B</xref>). The same results were obtained for other metrics of codon optimality, tAI and average CSC (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5B</xref>), suggesting that poor codon optimality is not a key property defining the mRNAs repressed in abundance most extensively by these decapping activators in WT cells. It has also been proposed that competition between translation initiation and mRNA decay, rather than codon optimality and elongation, is a major determinant of mRNA stability in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Muhlrad et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">LaGrandeur and Parker 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Schwartz and Parker 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chan et al. 2018</xref>). However, the mRNAs derepressed in the <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> or <italic>pat1Δ/dhh1</italic> mutants have slightly greater than average median translational efficiencies (TEs) in WT cells (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5C</xref>), as determined by ribosome profiling experiments described below. Thus, mRNA features besides slow rates of translation initiation or elongation likely dictate preferential targeting by these four decapping activators.</p>

<title>Scd6 and Edc3 function redundantly and cooperate more extensively with Dhh1 than Pat1 in controlling the translation of individual mRNAs</title>
<p>The changes in mRNA abundance were highly correlated with changes in RPF abundance for the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> mutant compared to WT for all expressed transcripts, with an r value of 0.81 (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2F</xref>), providing strong mutual validation of the RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq data for these strains. Nevertheless, the fact that this correlation is weaker than that observed between biological replicates of RNA-Seq or Ribo-Seq data for each strain (r values &gt;0.95, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A-B</xref>), suggests that certain mRNAs exhibit altered translational efficiencies in the double mutant. To identify specific mRNAs showing evidence of translational control by Scd6 and Edc3, we used DESeq2 to analyze our Ribo-Seq data on the <italic>edc3Δ, scd6Δ</italic> and <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> mutants, comparing each to WT. We identified 42 mRNAs showing TE increases of &gt;1.41-fold at FDR &lt; 0.10 in the <italic>scd6Δ</italic> mutant, but only one such mRNA in the <italic>edc3Δ</italic> strain. Importantly, a larger number of mRNAs (N=184) were identified in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> double mutant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), suggesting that Scd6 and Edc3 have overlapping functions in repressing the translation of particular mRNAs. Indeed, a group of 169 mRNAs that are translationally derepressed exclusively in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> double mutant (TE_up_s6,e3) exhibit only modest TE increases in the two single mutants compared to their marked derepression in the double mutant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-B</xref> sector (iii)). <italic>SPI1,</italic> encoding a cell wall protein, is a representative transcript exhibiting increased TE only in the double mutant, displaying increased mRNA abundance coupled with an even greater increase in RPF abundance, both exclusively in the double mutant, to confer the observed TE increase of 3.2-fold (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). As expected, the 28 mRNAs showing substantial TE increases only in <italic>scd6Δ</italic> cells show no increase in median TE in the <italic>edc3Δ</italic> strain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-B</xref> sector (i)), and thus appear to be translationally repressed by Scd6 alone.</p>

<p>We asked next whether the increased ribosome occupancies observed in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> double mutant are generally associated with increased synthesis of the encoded proteins. To this end, we carried out TMT mass spectrometry (TMT-MS) of total cellular proteins to obtain ratios of peptide abundance in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> double and WT strain mutant for &gt;4000 different proteins, obtaining highly correlated results from three biological replicates (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2E</xref>). Importantly, we observed significant correlations between these changes in protein abundance and changes in ribosome occupancies (RPFs) for mRNAs across the translatome (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Moreover, the groups of mRNAs showing significantly increased or decreased RPFs in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> double mutant vs. WT (&gt;1.5-fold, FDR&lt;0.05, Ribo_up and Ribo_dn) likewise exhibit increased or decreased median protein abundance determined by TMT-MS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). These results suggest that increased ribosome occupancies measured by Ribo-Seq, which could occur by increases in mRNA, TE, or both, are generally associated with increased synthesis of the encoded proteins in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> double mutant.</p>
<p>It was possible that translational repression by Edc3/Scd6 generally occurs by slowing the rate of elongation, leading to increased ribosome densities (RPF/mRNA ratios, ie. calculated TEs) in WT cells and decreased TE values in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> mutant that would be associated with increased protein expression in the mutant. In this scenario, changes in TEs would be inversely associated with changes in protein expression. At odds with this possibility, the groups of mRNAs showing increased or decreased TEs in the double mutant vs. WT (TE_up_s6,e3 and TE_dn_s6,e3 transcripts defined above) also exhibit increased or decreased protein expression in <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> vs. WT cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). These findings imply that Scd6/Edc3 generally influence translation at the level of initiation rather than elongation.</p>
<p>We previously identified a group of 274 mRNAs whose TEs are derepressed by the same criteria employed here (&gt;1.41-fold at FDR &lt; 0.10) in either the <italic>pat1Δ, dhh1Δ,</italic> or <italic>pat1Δdhh1Δ</italic> mutants versus WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Vijjamarri et al. 2023a</xref>). Interestingly, we found a significant overlap between this group of mRNAs and those translationally derepressed in either the single or double <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> mutants identified here (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). The 76 mRNAs common to both groups show considerably larger TE increases in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> double mutant compared to the 136 transcripts whose TE was up-regulated only in the <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A-B</xref> sector (ii) vs. sector (i)). The former 76 mRNAs also show marked TE increases in the <italic>dhh1Δ, pat1Δ</italic>, and <italic>pat1Δdhh1Δ</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>(ii)), indicating that all four decapping activators are required for efficient translational repression of these mRNAs in WT cells. The 136 mRNAs significantly derepressed only in the <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> mutants show a moderate increase in median TE in <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> cells, but little response to <italic>pat1Δ</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>(i)). The 198 mRNAs substantially derepressed only in the <italic>pat1Δ/dhh1Δ</italic> mutants show only a small TE increase in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> strain, a somewhat greater response to the <italic>pat1Δ</italic> vs. <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> single mutation, and cumulative TE increases in the <italic>pat1Δdhh1Δ</italic> double mutant (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>(iii)). In summary, similar to our findings for repression of mRNA abundance, efficient translational repression of certain mRNAs requires the combined functions of Pat1, Dhh1, and either Scd6 or Edc3, whereas other mRNAs are translationally repressed primarily by either Edc3/Scd6 or Pat1, with appreciable contributions from Dhh1 for both of these latter groups.</p>

<p>Greater cooperation of Scd6/Edc3 with Dhh1 vs. Pat1 in controlling translation is also revealed by clustering analysis of TE changes in different mutants for the mRNAs exhibiting significantly increased or decreased TEs in the <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> mutants, which reveals a greater similarity between TE changes conferred by <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> vs. <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> (ρ = 0.82) compared to <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> vs. <italic>pat1Δ</italic> (ρ = 0.68) or <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> vs. <italic>pat1Δdhh1Δ</italic> (ρ = 0.69) cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). However, as noted above, the group showing the strongest derepression of TEs in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> double mutant also tends to be highly derepressed in all three of the other mutants lacking Dhh1 or Pat1 (bracketed mRNAs at the top of <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). This behavior is illustrated in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref> for a group of 54 mRNAs whose TEs are derepressed by 2.0-fold or more in both the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> and <italic>pat1Δdhh1Δ</italic> double mutants, displaying marked TE increases in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ, pat1Δ, dhh1Δ,</italic> and <italic>pat1Δdhh1Δ</italic> double mutants, but not in the <italic>scd6Δ</italic> and <italic>edc3Δ</italic> single mutants. Thus, although Scd6/Edc3 appear to cooperate more extensively with Dhh1 than with Pat1 in translational control, the subset of 50-60 mRNAs exhibiting the strongest repression by Scd6/Edc3 or Pat1/Dhh1 require the concerted functions of Pat1, Dhh1, and either Scd6 or Edc3 to achieve their strong translational repression in WT cells.</p>
<p>We wondered whether the mRNAs translationally repressed by the decapping activators are also targeted for degradation by these factors. To assess this, we examined the mRNA changes in the four mutants for the groups of mRNAs defined above exhibiting TE derepression in the <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> or <italic>pat1Δ/dhh1Δ</italic> mutants (sectors (i) to (iii) of <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). The group of mRNAs showing increased TEs only in the <italic>pat1Δ/dhh1Δ</italic> strains show little change in mRNA abundance in these mutants (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6A</xref>(iii)), indicating selective repression of translation vs degradation of these mRNAs. Similarly, the mRNAs translationally up-regulated only in the <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> mutants show little change in mRNA abundance in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> strain, while showing modest derepression in the <italic>pat1Δ/dhh1Δ</italic> mutants (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6A</xref>(i)). In contrast, the group of transcripts showing increased TEs in all of the mutants also show marked increases in mRNA abundance in all four mutants (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6A</xref>(ii)). Thus, coupled repression of translation and abundance by the decapping factors occurs only for the subset of transcripts exhibiting concerted translational repression by the four decapping activators. In contrast, the much larger groups of transcripts defined above showing increased mRNA abundance in the mutants (described in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) exhibit little change in median TE in all four mutants (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6B</xref>), suggesting that most mRNAs targeted for enhanced turnover do not exhibit translational repression of the fraction of undegraded transcripts still detectable in WT cells.</p>
<p>We next asked how well the mRNAs translationally repressed by Scd6/Edc3 are translated in WT cells. The group of mRNAs translationally repressed by Scd6/Edc3 acting in concert with Pat1/Dhh1 tend to be poorly translated in WT cells on rich medium, having a substantially lower median relative TE compared to the TE of all mRNAs (0.24 vs. 0.95), as assessed using ribosome profiling results for the WT strain (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6C</xref>, col. 2), thus resembling the mRNAs translationally repressed exclusively by Dhh1/Pat1 (col. 3). In contrast, the subset of transcripts translationally repressed exclusively by Edc3/Scd6 are generally well translated, exhibiting a ∼2.5-fold greater than average median TE in WT cells on rich medium (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6C</xref>, col. 1). Consistent with this distinction, we found by gene ontology (GO) analysis that products of the 136 mRNAs translationally repressed exclusively by Scd6/Edc3 are enriched for cytoplasmic or mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (P = 1 x 10<sup>-7</sup>), whereas products of the 76 transcripts repressed by Scd6/Edc3 and Pat1/Dhh1 acting in concert are enriched for factors involved in fermentation (P = 2 x 10<sup>-7</sup>), carbohydrate metabolism (P = 1 x 10<sup>-6</sup>) or metabolism of non-protein amino acids (P = 3 x 10<sup>-6</sup>). Thus, Scd6/Edc3 translationally repress distinct groups of mRNAs depending on whether Dhh1/Pat1 participate in the repression.</p>
<p>We showed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Zeidan et al. 2018</xref>) that mRNAs up-regulated by <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> and thus deemed to be targeted by Dhh1 for enhanced turnover are enriched for Dhh1 protein association in vivo as judged by RIP-Seq analysis of yeast mRNAs using antibodies against Dhh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Miller et al. 2018</xref>), thus providing evidence for a direct role of Dhh1 in stimulating decapping/degradation of these transcripts. The same was observed for the mRNAs up-regulated by <italic>pat1Δ,</italic> consistent with widespread cooperation between Dhh1 and Pat1 in repressing mRNA abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Vijjamarri et al. 2023a</xref>). Interestingly, here we observed greater than average Dhh1 occupancies for all four mRNA groups defined above (in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2A</xref> or 5A) that are up-regulated in transcript abundance or TE by the <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> or <italic>dhh1Δ/pat1Δ</italic> mutations (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). This finding is consistent with the fact that Dhh1 contributes to repressing the abundance or TE of the majority of transcripts in these groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2B</xref> &amp; 5B). It is possible that Dhh1 is recruited to nearly all of these mRNAs in a complex with Dcp1:Dcp2 and other decapping activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">He et al. 2022</xref>), but makes differential contributions to their degradation or translational repression.</p>

<title>Scd6/Edc3 repress post-transcriptionally repress mRNAs encoding enzymes of respiration and catabolism of non-glucose carbon sources in rich medium</title>
<p>Recently, we reported that mRNAs up-regulated in abundance or TE in the <italic>dcp2Δ, pat1Δ</italic> and <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> mutants are enriched for mitochondrial proteins that function in Ox. Phos. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Vijjamarri et al. 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Vijjamarri et al. 2023b</xref>). GO analysis led to the same finding here for the non-iESR mRNAs up-regulated in abundance by the <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> mutations, including many of the same categories of mitochondrial functions enriched among the mRNAs derepressed by the <italic>dhh1Δ/pat1Δ</italic> mutations (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7A-B</xref>, green entries). GO analysis of genes showing increased ribosome occupancies (RPFs), indicating either increased mRNA abundance or TE, confirms that the <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> mutations derepress the translation of Ox. Phos. gene transcripts (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7C-D</xref>). Examining a collection of Ox. Phos. genes functioning in electron transport, the TCA cycle or mitochondrial ATP synthase for changes in mRNA abundance, RPFs, and TEs reveals that the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> and <italic>pat1Δdhh1Δ</italic> double mutations up-regulate expression of these genes primarily at the level of mRNA abundance, with small additional increases in TE (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Western blot analysis revealed increased expression of four Ox. Phos. proteins (Qcr8, Atp20, Idh1, and Sdh4), two proteins (Cox14 and Cox20) involved in cytochrome c oxidase assembly, and mitochondrial cytochrome b2 (Cyb2) required for lactate utilization in <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> cells, relative to Gcd6 examined as loading control (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B-C</xref>). Results similar to those in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B-C</xref> were obtained for the same set of mitochondrial proteins in the <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> and <italic>pat1Δ</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Vijjamarri et al. 2023a</xref>) and for a subset of these proteins in <italic>dcp2Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Vijjamarri et al. 2023b</xref>). Importantly, we also observed increased expression of Cox2, one of three mitochondrially encoded subunits of mitochondrial cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase, terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial ETC, whose expression correlates well with mitochondrial activity (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/90293">https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/90293</ext-link>). Except for <italic>dcp2Δ</italic>, all the decapping mutants tested had significantly increased amounts of Cox2 protein (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>), suggesting an increase in ETC activity in these mutants. Derepression of mRNA and RPF abundance in <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> and <italic>pat1Δdhh1Δ</italic> double mutants also occurred for enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>), which catalyze certain reactions of the TCA cycle in the cytoplasm to support gluconeogenesis during respiratory growth on two-carbon compounds; and increased expression of one such enzyme, Cit2, was confirmed by Western analysis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6B-C</xref>). Both Ox. Phos. and the glyoxylate cycle normally operate at low levels in yeast growing with abundant glucose, as in our experiments, suggesting that Scd6/Edc3 cooperate with Dhh1/Pat1 to help suppress these pathways in glucose-replete cells.</p>

<p>Consistent with post-transcriptional control of Ox. Phos. genes, the median relative RPF levels were up-regulated in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> mutant substantially more than the increases in relative Pol II occupancies observed at the cognate genes by ChIP-Seq analysis of Rpb1 (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8B</xref>, cols. 1-2). Moreover, the transcription factors responsible for induction of Ox. Phos. genes, the Hap2/Hap3/Hap4/Hap5 complex, were not activated in <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> cells: expression of a <italic>CYC1-lacZ</italic> reporter known to be activated by this Hap complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Forsburg and Guarente 1989</xref>) was not elevated in the <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> mutants vs. WT in glucose-containing medium (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>(ii)) but showed the expected induction in WT cells grown with glycerol/ethanol versus glucose (6F(i)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Broach 2012</xref>). These findings support the notion that reduced decapping stabilizes Ox. Phos. gene transcripts in <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> cells.</p>
<p>In addition to Ox. Phos. genes, GO analysis revealed enrichment for genes involved in utilization of alternative carbon sources among those up-regulated at the level of mRNA or RPFs in the <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> mutants (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7A-D</xref>), as we observed recently for <italic>dhh1Δ,pat1Δ</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Vijjamarri et al. 2023a</xref>). Consistent with this, a group of 83 carbon catabolite repressed (CCR) genes, known to be glucose-repressed or activated by transcription factors Adr1 or Cat8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Young et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Tachibana et al. 2005</xref>), exhibit increased translation (RPFs) largely through increased mRNA abundance in both <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> and <italic>pat1Δdhh1Δ</italic> double mutants (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8A</xref>). This group includes enzymes for β-oxidation of fatty acids in addition to the glyoxylate cycle, which allow cells to synthesize precursors that can feed into gluconeogenesis or amino acid biosynthesis, or produce acetyl-CoA and generate NADH by respiration when growing on non-fermentable carbon sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Young et al. 2003</xref>). The CCR genes exhibit larger increases in RPFs compared to Pol II occupancies at the cognate genes in <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> vs. WT cells (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8B</xref>, cols. 3-4), consistent with post-transcriptional repression of these genes by Scd6/Edc3. Supporting this, expression of an <italic>ADH2-lacZ</italic> reporter transcriptionally induced by activated Adr1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sloan et al. 1999</xref>) displayed the expected large induction in our WT strain cultured with glycerol/ethanol versus glucose as carbon source (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8C</xref>(i)), but its expression was actually reduced in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> mutant versus WT in glucose-grown cells (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8C</xref>(ii)).</p>

<title>Functional evidence that Scd6/Edc3 repress oxidative phosphorylation</title>
<p>We examined the effects of eliminating Scd6/Edc3 on mitochondrial electron transport by measuring mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ<sub>m</sub>) generated by the ETC using the probe tetramethylrhodamine (TMRM)—a cationic fluorescent dye that accumulates in mitochondria as a function of ΔΨ<sub>m</sub>. Quantifying dye fluorescence by flow cytometry revealed increased TMRM fluorescence in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> mutant containing an empty vector compared to both the isogenic WT strain and the mutant complemented by WT <italic>EDC3</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>). These results are consistent with increased mitochondrial ETC activity in glucose-grown <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> cells.</p>
<p>To determine whether derepression of Ox. Phos. and other glucose-repressed genes in the decapping activator mutants alters cellular metabolites, we used targeted, quantitative LC-MS/MS based approaches (see Methods) to quantify levels of 147 polar metabolites in the isogenic <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic>, <italic>dhh1Δ, pat1Δ, dcp2Δ</italic> and WT strains described above, cultured in YPD medium. Principle component analysis revealed clustering of results from biological replicates in the manner expected for reproducible differences in metabolite levels among different strains, with results for the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> mutant most closely resemble those for <italic>dhh1Δ,</italic> which in turn were more similar to the results for <italic>pat1Δ</italic> vs. the <italic>dcp2Δ</italic> mutant or WT strains (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). This conclusion was borne out by cluster and correlation analyses of the changes in metabolites between each mutant compared to WT, with the strongest correlation observed for <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> vs. <italic>dhh1Δ</italic>, followed by <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> vs. <italic>pat1Δ</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Considering the subset of 46 metabolites up-regulated in any two of the four mutants again showed greatest similarity between changes conferred by <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> vs. <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> followed by <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> vs. <italic>pat1Δ</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). These findings mirror the results from RNA-seq and ribosome profiling in which the up-regulation of mRNA levels or translation was most similar between the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> and <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> mutants. Pathway analysis of the 46 up-regulated metabolites (at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/MetaboAnalyst/Secure/pathway">https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/MetaboAnalyst/Secure/pathway</ext-link>) revealed a significant enrichment for metabolites of both the TCA and glyoxylate cycles (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>), with five of six TCA cycle intermediates detected (fumarate, malate, α-ketoglutarate, cis-aconitate and citrate) being elevated in the decapping mutants (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>). These results are consistent with the possibility that up-regulation of Ox. Phos. proteins (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A-D</xref>) and ETC function (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>) in the decapping mutants leads to increased flux from glucose towards the TCA cycle.</p>
<p>To determine unambiguously if there was indeed increased flux through the TCA cycle coming from glucose breakdown, we utilized a pulse label of <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-glucose and then traced the <sup>13</sup>C label incorporation from glucose breakdown into intermediates of the TCA cycle. Specifically, WT and mutant cells were grown in high glucose, pulsed with <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub> glucose, and relative label incorporation into TCA cycle intermediates was estimated for each carbon molecule derived from glucose (as indicated schematically in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>) eight min following the pulse. In all mutants, <sup>13</sup>C label incorporation in all TCA cycle intermediates was significantly higher than in WT cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>), demonstrating that carbon flux from glucose into the TCA cycle was elevated in the decapping mutants. These results, along with increased ETC activity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>), indicate that mitochondria are functionally derepressed in glucose in these mutants. If so, we might expect the mutants to show increased ATP production from respiration versus glycolysis. Measuring total ATP levels in glucose-grown cells revealed that, although all of the decapping mutants except <italic>pat1Δ</italic> showed some reduction in total levels of ATP per cell (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>), the proportion of ATP produced from respiration, and thus eliminated by sodium azide treatment (by inhibiting the ETC), is elevated in all of the decapping mutants (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>).</p>

<p>Interestingly, amino acids are also up-regulated in the decapping mutants (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>), particularly in <italic>pat1Δ</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>), as well as intermediates in amino acid biosynthesis and amino acid derivatives (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). The expression of amino acid biosynthetic enzymes is unaffected or reduced in the mutants however (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8D</xref>), suggesting that increased amino acid abundance results from metabolic reprogramming rather than increased biosynthetic capacity. One possibility is that accumulation of the TCA cycle intermediate α-ketoglutarate leads to increased production of glutamate and glutamine, which are precursors in all amino acid biosynthetic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ljungdahl and Daignan-Fornier 2012</xref>). The two 3-phosphotrioses generated in glycolysis (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate) are also elevated in the mutants, possibly owing to increased glyoxylate shunt function, which can lead to precursors of these intermediates and stimulate synthesis of amino acids serine and glycine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ljungdahl and Daignan-Fornier 2012</xref>) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>, Methane metabolism category.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>RNA-seq analysis of single and double <italic>scd6Δ</italic> and <italic>edc3Δ</italic> mutants has revealed that Scd6 and Edc3 have largely overlapping functions in repressing mRNA abundance, as the presence of either protein alone is sufficient for nearly WT levels of most mRNAs found derepressed in the double mutant (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-C</xref>(ii)-(iii)). The mRNAs dysregulated in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> mutant are significantly enriched for ESR mRNAs; however, the majority are not ESR transcripts and are most likely repressed more directly by Scd6/Edc3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-B</xref>). Scd6/Edc3 redundancy in regulating mRNA abundance is consistent with their similarities in sequence and domain structure, including shared FDF motifs that interact competitively with Dhh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Tritschler et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Tritschler et al. 2009</xref>) and N-terminal LSm domains that compete for binding motifs in the Dcp2 CTT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fromm et al. 2012</xref>), as well as the synthetic growth defect produced by deleting both genes simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Decourty et al. 2008</xref>) (Fig. S1A). Interestingly, a set of 37 mRNAs appears to be repressed exclusively by Edc3 with little contribution from Scd6, or with even an opposing stimulatory effect of Scd6, on their abundance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-C</xref>(i)). This last group includes the canonical Edc3 targets identified previously, <italic>YRA1</italic> and <italic>RPS28B</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">He et al. 2022</xref>) and, interestingly, is enriched for genes belonging to the GO category “mitochondrion” (22/37 genes) and the Ox. Phos. categories of electron transport and mitochondrial ATP synthesis (11/37 genes: <italic>ATP3 ATP16 ATP5 TIM11 ATP17 COX4 QCR9 CYC1 COX12 ATP18 COX5A</italic>). The fact that deleting <italic>SCD6</italic> in the double mutant frequently diminishes the up-regulation of these transcripts conferred by deleting <italic>EDC3</italic> alone (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>(i)) might indicate that eliminating both Scd6 and Edc3 together enables a distinct degradation pathway that compensates for loss of Edc3-stimulated decapping/decay.</p>
<p>Several lines of evidence support the conclusion that most of the changes in mRNA abundance in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> double mutant result from impaired decapping and attendant 5’-3’ degradation by Xrn1. ChIP-seq analysis of Rpb1 shows that Pol II occupancies in the coding sequences increase by a much smaller amount compared to the increased transcript levels for non-iESR mRNAs derepressed in <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>), indicating a minor contribution of increased transcription to their up-regulation. Consistent with mRNA turnover via decapping, most of these transcripts are up-regulated similarly by <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> and deletion of <italic>DCP2</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>-B), they exhibit a heightened proportion of decapped isoforms in WT cells that is eliminated by deleting <italic>DHH1</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>), and they show evidence of co-translational 5’-3’ decay of decapped intermediates by Xrn1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>); none of which was observed for the mRNAs down-regulated in <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> cells. Similar findings were reported previously for sets of mRNAs up-regulated by <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> or <italic>pat1Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Vijjamarri et al. 2023a</xref>), consistent with the widespread involvement of Dhh1 and Pat1 in controlling the levels of mRNAs preferentially targeted by Scd6/Edc3.</p>
<p>Supporting this last assertion, most (∼70%) of the mRNAs repressed in abundance by Edc3/Scd6 are also repressed by Dhh1 and Pat1, and their efficient repression in WT cells involves independent contributions of similar magnitude by Pat1, Dhh1 and either Edc3 or Scd6 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>-B(ii)). Another large set of mRNAs is repressed predominantly by Pat1 with lesser comparable contributions by Dhh1 and Scd6/Edc3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-B</xref>(iii)). Our finding of extensive cooperation among these four decapping factors in repressing a common set of mRNAs is consistent with our recent finding that ∼55% of the mRNAs derepressed in the <italic>dcp2Δ</italic> mutant, and thus targeted by Dcp2 for enhanced degradation, tend to be derepressed in the <italic>pat1Δdhh1Δ</italic> and <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> mutants, whereas the remaining 45% are generally derepressed by <italic>upf1Δ</italic> instead. This finding suggested a major bifurcation of Dcp2-activation by either Pat1/Dhh1/Scd6/Edc3 or the Upf factors responsible for NMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Vijjamarri et al. 2023b</xref>).</p>
<p>Closer examination of the effects of individual mutations on mRNA levels revealed a greater overlap between the mRNAs dysregulated by <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> and <italic>scd6Δ/edc3Δ</italic> versus those altered by <italic>pat1Δ</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C-E</xref>), consistent with the aforementioned FDF motifs in both Scd6 and Edc3 that interact with Dhh1, and with evidence for distinct complexes of the decapping enzyme Dcp1:Dcp2 containing Dhh1 and Edc3 or Scd6 but lacking Pat1. It also supports the recent suggestion that Edc3 and Scd6 act interchangeably to recruit Dhh1 to the Edc3-interaction site in the Dcp2 CTT to stimulate turnover of several Dhh1 target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">He et al. 2022</xref>). Our RNA-seq results support this last proposal in revealing that all four Dhh1 target mRNAs examined there (<italic>EDC1, SDS23, HXT6,</italic> and <italic>HSP12</italic>) are derepressed in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> double mutant while showing little derepression in either single mutant (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9</xref>), as expected for redundant targeting of Dhh1 to the Dcp2-CTT by Scd6/Edc3. Finding here that this behavior applies to most mRNAs up-regulated in the <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> mutant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>), we propose that redundant Scd6/Edc3 targeting is the predominant mechanism of Dhh1-enhanced mRNA degradation in the yeast transcriptome (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite strong evidence for the involvement of decapping in mRNA turnover directed by either Scd6/Edc3 or Pat1/Dhh1, it appears that neither enrichment for non-optimal codons nor low translational efficiencies are principal determinants of preferential targeting of mRNAs by these proteins (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A-B</xref>). There are probably exceptions to these generalizations among the hundreds of transcripts repressed by these factors; nor can we rule out the involvement of clusters of non-optimal codons in transcripts of average overall codon optimality that generate a queue of slowly elongating ribosomes that triggers decapping. Nevertheless, it seems likely that other sequences or properties of the transcripts most strongly repressed by Scd6/Edc3 or Dhh1/Pat1 frequently underlie their preferential targeting by these factors for decapping/decay. Sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins that actively recruit these decapping activators is an attractive potential mechanism (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10</xref>). For example, there is evidence that Dhh1 is recruited to mRNAs in association with the Ccr4-NOT deadenylase via RNA-binding protein Puf5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Goldstrohm et al. 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Ribosome profiling of the single and double <italic>scd6Δ</italic> and <italic>edc3Δ</italic> mutants provided evidence that Scd6 and Edc3 also have highly overlapping functions in repressing the translation of ∼200 mRNAs, whose TE values are up-regulated substantially only in the double mutant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-B</xref>(iii)). The observation that changes in TE (RPF density) generally correlate with changes in protein abundance conferred by <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>) implies that Scd6/Edc3 generally repress translation at the stage of initiation rather than elongation. Many mRNAs translationally repressed by Scd6/Edc3 additionally require Dhh1, and the subset most strongly repressed also requires Pat1 for efficient translational repression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>(ii) and 5D). This last group of mRNAs is translated at very low levels in WT cells on rich medium (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6C</xref>), which might reflect the concerted action of all four decapping activators in suppressing their translation. The transcript abundance of these mRNAs is also derepressed in each of the mutants (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6A</xref>(ii)), indicating enhanced degradation coupled with translational repression by the four decapping activators. One possibility is that a complex of Dcp1:Dcp2 containing Scd6/Edc3, Pat1/Dhh1, or different combinations of these factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">He et al. 2022</xref>), is recruited to these mRNAs and impedes recruitment of PICs to diminish translation in parallel with stimulating decapping and 5’-3’ degradation by Xrn1 (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10</xref>(i) &amp; (ii)-(iv)).</p>
<p>The additional sets of mRNAs identified here that are translationally repressed exclusively by Scd6/Edc3 or Pat1/Dhh1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>(i) &amp; (iii)) show much less evidence of transcript degradation promoted by these factors (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6A</xref>(i) &amp; (iii)), suggesting that inhibition of PIC recruitment for translation initiation occurs without decapping, or that it involves decapping uncoupled from degradation by Xrn1 (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10</xref> (ii)-(iii)). In the latter scenario, the decapped mRNAs would be unable to recruit the cap-binding initiation factors necessary for PIC recruitment and hence persist in WT cells as translationally-inert degradation intermediates. Eliminating the decapping activators would then diminish decapping and eliminate these fractions of poorly translated transcript isoforms to confer the increased TE values we observed for the cognate genes in the decapping mutants. This hypothetical mechanism of translational repression via decapping is consistent with the lower than average capped to total mRNA (C/T) ratios observed in WT cells for the mRNAs translationally repressed by all four decapping activators or by Pat1/Dhh1 (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6D</xref> (ii)-(iii)), indicating their high rates of decapping and accumulation of decapped isoforms in WT cells. Previously, we suggested that such translational repression via decapping could account for a subset of poorly translated mRNAs exhibiting TE increases in both <italic>dcp2Δ</italic> and <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> mutants and showing Dhh1-dependent lower than average C/T ratios in WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Vijjamarri et al. 2023b</xref>). In contrast, the group of mRNAs identified here that are translationally repressed exclusively by Scd6/Edc3 display higher than average C/T ratios in WT (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6D</xref>(i)), which is more compatible with the inhibition of PIC recruitment independently of decapping (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10</xref>(iii)). Translational repression without decapping or decay could also occur if transcripts bound by the decapping complexes are sequestered from the translation initiation machinery in RNA granules in a state where mRNA decapping or degradation by Xrn1 occurs inefficiently (Fig S9(iv)). Finally, it is important to note that mRNA decay occurs apparently without translational control for the much larger groups of ∼600 and ∼1000 transcripts showing derepressed mRNA abundance but little evidence of TE changes in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> and <italic>pat1Δdhh1Δ</italic> mutants, respectively (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6B</xref>). It is unclear whether these mRNAs escape translational repression and are targeted exclusively for decapping and degradation (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10</xref>(i)), or if they are simply degraded too fast to allow translational repression to be detected by ribosomal profiling of steady-state mRNAs.</p>
<p>Recently, we reported that Pat1 and Dhh1 functionally collaborate with the decapping enzyme to repress genes and cellular pathways that are normally repressed in rich medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Vijjamarri et al. 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Vijjamarri et al. 2023b</xref>). Here we found evidence that Scd6 and Edc3 broadly cooperate with Pat1/Dhh1 in this post-transcriptional control, acting redundantly to down-regulate the abundance, translation, or both, of mRNAs encoding numerous proteins involved in respiration or utilization of alternative carbon sources (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6A-C</xref>, S6C, S7A-B), without affecting transcription of the cognate genes <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>, S7A-C). This derepression includes multiple nucleus-encoded mitochondrial proteins that function in Ox. Phos. (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7C-D</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>-B), including mitochondrially encoded subunit II of ETC component cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). Evidence that derepression of Ox. Phos. mRNAs/proteins in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> mutant is sufficient to elevate respiration in glucose-replete cells came from our finding of elevated mitochondrial membrane potential in the <italic>scd6Δedc3Δ</italic> mutant, extending similar findings we made previously for <italic>dcp2Δ, dhh1Δ</italic> and <italic>pat1Δ</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Vijjamarri et al. 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Vijjamarri et al. 2023b</xref>). Consistent with this, our metabolomics analysis here revealed elevated steady-state levels of TCA cycle intermediates in all four decapping mutants (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>), and metabolic flux experiments on cells pulse-labeled with <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-glucose demonstrated increased carbon incorporation from glucose breakdown into TCA cycle intermediates in the same mutant strains (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>). Analysis of ATP levels further revealed increased proportions of ATP derived from Ox. Phos. in the decapping mutants (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>). Together, these findings provide strong evidence that mitochondrial respiration is inappropriately elevated in glucose-replete cells of the decapping activator mutants. It is well established that the enzymes involved in respiration and catabolism of non-glucose carbon sources are repressed at the transcriptional level in glucose-replete yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zaman et al. 2008</xref>). Our findings demonstrate that Scd6/Edc3 collaborate with Dhh1/Pat1 to provide an additional layer of post-transcriptional control of these enzymes through enhanced decapping/decay or translational repression to help ensure their complete suppression in glucose-replete cells.</p>

<caption><title>Hypothetical model to explain concerted repression of mRNA abundance or translation of particular mRNAs by decapping activators Scd6, Edc3, Dhh1, and Pat1.</title>
<p>A complex of Dcp1:Dcp2 containing Scd6/Edc3, Pat1/Dhh1, or different combinations of these factors, is recruited to target mRNAs, possibly by a sequence-specific RNA-binding protein (RBP) binding to the 3’UTR. In agreement with a recent proposal (10), the recruitment of Dhh1 is enhanced by its redundant interactions with Scd6 or Edc3, which interact with the same segment of the Dcp2 CTT, whereas Pat1 is recruited independently to a distinct region of the CTT. One outcome of association of the decapping complex with an mRNA is activation of decapping with attendant 5’-3’ degradation by Xrn1 occurring without detectable repression of translation (i). A different outcome is translational repression by decapping wherein degradation by Xrn1 is inefficient and decapped intermediates accumulate that cannot bind the cap-binding initiation factors eIF4E and eIF4G (depicted as subunits of eIF4F excluded from the m<sup>7</sup>G mRNA cap) and thus persist as translationally inert isoforms (ii). Alternatively, decapping may not occur and the decapping complex competes with the cap-binding initiation factors to selectively inhibit translation initiation (iii), a fate that could be favored by sequestration of the transcript in RNA granules in a manner facilitated by the decapping activator proteins (iv).</p></caption>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>mRNA decapping and decay factors play critical roles in post-transcriptionally regulating gene expression. Here, Kumar and colleagues investigate how deleting two yeast decapping enhancer proteins (Edc3 and Scd6), either alone or in tandem, influences the transcriptome. Using RNA-Seq and ribosome profiling, they come to the conclusion that these factors generally act in a redundant fashion, with a mutant lacking both proteins showing an increased abundance of select mRNAs. As these upregulated transcripts are also upregulated in mutants lacking the decapping enzyme, Dcp2, and show no increases in transcription of their cognate genes, they come to the conclusion that this is at the level of mRNA decapping and decay. Their ribosome profiling data also led them to conclude that Scd6 and Edc3 display functional redundancy and cooperativity with Dhh1/Pat1 in repressing the translation of specific transcripts. Finally, as their data suggest that Scd6 and Edc3 repress mRNAs coding for proteins involved in cellular respiration, as well as proteins involved in the catabolism of alternative carbon sources, they go on to show that these decapping activators play a role in repressing oxidative phosphorylation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, this manuscript is well-written and contains a large amount of high-quality data and analyses. At its core, it helps to shed light on the overlapping roles of Edc3 and Scd6 in sculpting the yeast transcriptome.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) While the data presented makes conclusions about mRNA stability based on corresponding ChIP-Seq analyses and analyzing other mutants (e.g. Dcp2 knockout), at no point is mRNA stability actually ever directly assessed. This direct assessment, even for select transcripts, would further strengthen their conclusions.</p>
<p>(2) Scd6 and Edc3 show a high level of functional redundancy, as demonstrated by the double mutant. As these proteins form complexes with other decapping factors/activators, I'm curious if depleting both proteins in the double mutant destabilizes any of these other factors. Have the authors ever assessed the levels of other key decapping factors in the double mutants (i.e. Dhh1, Pat1, Dcp2...etc)? I wonder if depleting both proteins leads to a general destabilization of key complexes. It would also be interesting to see if depleting Edc3 or Scd6 leads to a concomitant increase in the other protein as a compensatory mechanism.</p>
<p>(3) While not essential, it would be interesting if the authors carried out add-back experiments to determine which domain within Scd6/Edce3 plays a critical role in enforcing the regulation that they see. Their double mutant now puts them in a perfect position to carry out such experiments.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript by Kumar and Zhang presents compelling evidence that Edc3 and Scd6 decapping activators present a high degree of redundancy that can only be overcome by a double mutant. In addition, the authors provide strong evidence of these complexes in regulating starvation-induced pathways as evidenced by measurements of mitochondrial membrane potential, metabolomics, and analysis of the flux of Krebs cycle intermediates.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Kumar and Zhang et al provide multiple sources of evidence of the direct mechanism of Edc3 and Scd6 function, by using and comparing different approaches such as mRNA-seq, ribosome occupancies, and translational efficiencies. By extensive analysis, the authors show that this complex can also regulate genes outside the Environmental Stress Response (non-iESR), which are significantly up-regulated in all three mutants. Remarkably, the gene ontology analysis of these non-iESR genes identifies enrichment for mitochondrial proteins that are implicated in the Krebs cycle. Overall, this study adds novel mechanistic insight into how nutrients control gene expression by modulating decapping and translational repression.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors show very nicely in Figure S1A that growth phenotypes from scd6Δedc3∆ can be rescued by transformation of EDC3 (pLfz614-7) or SCD6 (pLfz615-5). The manuscript might benefit from using these rescue strategies in the analysis performed (e.g. RNA-seq, ribosome occupancies, and translational efficiencies). Also, these rescue assays could provide a good platform to further characterise the protein-protein interactions between Edc3, Scd6, and Dhh1.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, Kumar et al aimed to investigate the roles of two decapping activators, Edc3 and Scd6, in regulating mRNA decay and translation in yeast. Previous research suggested limited individual roles for these proteins in mRNA decay. The authors hypothesized that Edc3 and Scd6 act redundantly and explored how these proteins interact with two other factors involved in mRNA decapping and translational repression, with Dhh1 and Pat1, particularly in response to nutrient availability. The study aims to identify mRNAs targeted by these proteins for degradation and translation repression and assess their impact on metabolic pathways including mitochondrial function and alternative carbon source utilization.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The paper has several strengths including the comprehensive approach taken by the authors using multiple experimental techniques (RNA-seq, ribosome profiling, Western blotting, TMT-MS, and polysome profiling) to examine both mRNA abundance and translation efficiency, thereby providing multiple lines of evidence to support their conclusions. The authors demonstrate clear redundancy of the factors by using single and double mutants for Edc3 and Scd6 and their global approach enables an understanding of these factors' roles across the yeast transcriptome. The work connects post-transcriptional processes to nutrient-dependent gene regulation, providing insights into how cells adapt to changes in their environment. The authors demonstrate the redundant roles of Edc3 and Scd6 in mRNA decapping and translation repression. Their RNA-seq and ribosome profiling results convincingly show that many mRNAs are derepressed only in the double mutants, confirming their hypothesis of redundancy. Furthermore, the functional cooperation between Edc3/Scd6 and Dhh1/Pat1 in regulating specific metabolic pathways, like mitochondrial function and carbon source utilization, is supported by the data. The results therefore support the authors' conclusions that these decapping factors work together to fine-tune gene expression in response to nutrient availability.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The limitations of the study include the use of indirect evidence to support claims that Edc3 and Scd6 recruit Dhh1 to the Dcp2 complex, which is inferred from correlations in mRNA abundance and ribosome profiling data rather than direct biochemical evidence. Also, there is limited exploration of other signals as the study is focused on glucose availability, and it is unclear whether the findings would apply broadly across different environmental stresses or metabolic pathways.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the study provides new insights into how mRNA decapping and degradation are tightly linked to metabolic regulation and nutrient responses in yeast. The RNA-seq and ribosome profiling datasets are valuable resources for the scientific community, providing quantitative information on the role of decapping activators in mRNA stability and translation control.</p>
