<title>Abstract</title><p><italic>Salmonella</italic> is an important foodborne pathogen which comprises strains that exhibit varied virulence phenotypes and the capability of causing invasive human infection. In this study, the gene expression profile of foodborne and clinical <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains that exhibit high- and low-level virulence was investigated, with results showing that the expression level of a number of genes, including the <italic>rnc</italic> gene which encodes the RNase III ribonuclease, were exceptionally high in the high virulence strains. Investigation of the role of <italic>rnc</italic> in mediating expression of virulence phenotypes in <italic>Salmonella</italic> showed that the product of this gene could enhance expression of the superoxide dismutase SodA, which is an essential determinant of survival fitness of <italic>Salmonella</italic> under the oxidative stress elicited by the host immunity. On the other hand, we also discovered that the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) released from <italic>Salmonella</italic> could trigger immune response of the host, and that the high-level expression of the <italic>rnc</italic> gene enabled <italic>Salmonella</italic> to evade the host immunity by reducing the amount of dsRNA accumulated in the bacterial cell. These findings provide insightful understanding of the regulation of <italic>Salmonella</italic> virulence and facilitate development of novel antimicrobial treatments through suppression of virulence expression and survival fitness of this important pathogen.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> is one of the most important foodborne pathogens, causing over one million cases of infection in the United States annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Non-typhoidal <italic>Salmonella</italic> account for the majority of infections. To date, about 2500 serovars of <italic>S. enterica</italic> have been recognized, two of which, namely Typhimurium and Enteritidis, are responsible for most cases of non-typhoidal Salmonellosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Non-typhoidal <italic>Salmonella</italic> infections are mostly associated with self-limiting diarrhea. However, invasion of the pathogen into normally sterile sites, including bloodstream and meninges, is possible, resulting in focal infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Invasiveness of non-typhoidal <italic>S. enterica</italic> into various body sites has been observed worldwide, however, the mechanisms underlying this invasion process remain poorly understood.</p>
<p>We have observed that <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains collected from food and clinical samples exhibited a highly diverse range of invasion and survival ability on RAW264.7 macrophage cells (<bold>Figure S1</bold>). When subjected to comprehensive genetic analysis and different virulotyping assays to investigate the relationships between the genetic profiles of the test strains and their virulence level, we found that genetically identical strains might exhibit highly variable virulence levels, and that the molecular basis of such differences was due to variation in expression levels of specific gene clusters. Among these over-expressed gene clusters associated with higher virulence, we found that the <italic>rnc</italic>-<italic>era</italic>-<italic>recO</italic> operon was up-regulated in the highly virulent <italic>Salmonella</italic> isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). The <italic>rnc</italic>-<italic>era</italic>-<italic>recO</italic> operon has been identified in various types of bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). In this operon, the <italic>rnc</italic> gene encodes the RNase III ribonuclease, which specifically cleaves double stranded RNA (dsRNA), resulting in the formation of a two-nucleotide 3â overhang at each end of the cleaved dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). It was reported that the <italic>rnc</italic> gene in <italic>E. coli</italic> played an important role in regulation of protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>) and degradation of structured RNAs and dsRNAs formed by overlapping sense and antisense RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). However, the exact function of the <italic>rnc</italic> gene in regulating <italic>Salmonella</italic> virulence is unknown.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated the role of <italic>rnc</italic> gene in mediating virulence phenotype in <italic>Salmonella.</italic> Two potential functions of RNase III were tested firstly in regulating gene expression and secondly in mediating enhanced resistance to the host immune response. We found that the <italic>rnc</italic> gene is the key determinant of virulence in <italic>Salmonella</italic>. Findings in this work could facilitate development of novel strategies to suppress the virulence level of <italic>Salmonella</italic>.</p>

<title>The rnc gene was over-expressed in high virulence strains</title>
<p>A total six <italic>S.</italic> Enteritidis strains were recovered from food and clinical samples. Their virulence phenotypes were characterized by determining the internalization and intracellular replication rate of these strains in macrophage RAW264.7 (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The macrophage internalization and intracellular replication rate of the food isolates (654, 2992 and 3046) ranged from 0.0075 to 0.0152, and 0.0370 to 1.0150 respectively. Those of the clinical isolates (SE 12-5, SE 11-72 and SE 09-1889) ranged from 0.2189 to 0.2925, and 4.4744 to 15.3199 respectively. The results indicated that the food isolates generally exhibited a lower level of virulence when compared to the clinical isolates. However, it should be noted that strain 654 exhibited exceptionally high virulence among the three food isolates tested, suggesting that the high-virulence <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains exist in the natural environment.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>All tested strains were further subjected to RNA sequencing and the results showing that specific genes were over-expressed in the high virulence isolates recovered from the clinical samples as well as the food isolate 654. These highly expressed genes include a number of virulence determinants (e.g. Type-3 secretion system and fimbriae protein-encoding genes), transcription regulators (e.g. <italic>araC</italic> family transcription regulators and the <italic>rnc-era-recO</italic> operon) and various genes involved in cellular functions related to metabolism. Among those genetic elements, the <italic>rnc</italic> gene which encodes RNase III was found to be over-expressed in all clinical <italic>S</italic>. Enteritidis isolates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). Observation of high intracellular replication rate of the tested isolates (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) was highly consistent with high expression level of the <italic>rnc</italic> gene. These findings suggest that the <italic>rnc</italic> gene may play a role in mediating expression of virulence in <italic>S</italic>. Enteritidis. However, the RNA sequencing data couldnât reveal the genetic basis of the significant differences in <italic>rnc</italic> gene expression level among the high and low virulence strains at this stage.</p>

<p>Since the function of <italic>rnc</italic> gene product RNase III ribonuclease involves degradation of dsRNA, we hypothesized that the alteration of virulence level in <italic>Salmonella rnc</italic> mutant might be due to intracellular accumulation of dsRNA. In order to test whether dsRNA was accumulated in the <italic>rnc</italic> knockout mutant, immunoblotting against dsRNA was performed. The <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains, SEBL, SEST, SEBLÎ<italic>rnc</italic> and SESTÎ<italic>rnc</italic> were tested in this experiment. Upon being cultured for 3 h and 12 h, total RNAs were extracted and the dsRNA was detected using the dsRNA specific J2 antibody (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). The results showed that dsRNA was not detectable in both 3 and 12 h culture samples from the wildtype SEBL and SEST strains. However, dsRNA could be detected in the 3 h culture samples of the SEBLÎ<italic>rnc</italic> and SESTÎ<italic>rnc</italic> mutant strains and the quantity of dsRNA was much higher in the 12 h culture samples. These findings indicate that RNase III was responsible for the degradation of intracellular dsRNAs in <italic>Salmonella</italic> and that the low level of dsRNA correlated with high level virulence in wildtype <italic>Salmonella</italic>.</p>

<title>The rnc gene was essential for virulence phenotype in Salmonella</title>
<p>To further confirm the role of the <italic>rnc</italic> gene product in regulating virulence expression in <italic>Salmonella</italic>, the <italic>rnc</italic> gene was deleted from the high virulence foodborne isolate 654 to create the 654Î<italic>rnc</italic> mutant, which was then subjected to internalization and replication assay in RAW264.7 macrophage cell line (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a, b</xref>). The result showed that both internalization and intracellular replication rate of <italic>S</italic>. Enteritidis 654 in macrophage cells were reduced by up to 80% when the <italic>rnc</italic> gene was deleted from the genome (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). Consistently, the internalization and intracellular replication rates of the 654Î<italic>rnc</italic>/p-<italic>rnc</italic> strain, which was created by transformation of a <italic>rnc</italic> gene-bearing plasmid into 654Î<italic>rnc</italic> mutant to complement the lack of <italic>rnc</italic> in the mutant, were found to have reverted back to the similar virulence level as <italic>S</italic>. Enteritidis 654. These findings confirmed that <italic>rnc</italic> gene was important for <italic>Salmonella</italic> survival inside macrophage cells and the overall infection ability of this important pathogen. In summary, <italic>rnc</italic> gene is a key virulence determinant of <italic>Salmonella</italic>.</p>

<title>Double-stranded RNA in Salmonella could induce immune response in the host</title>
<p>Detection of double-stranded RNA is an important feature of innate immune system in many organisms, especially for defense against viruses which frequently employed double-stranded RNA as their genetic materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). A known function of the gene product of <italic>rnc</italic> in bacteria is to digest double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and we showed <italic>Salmonella rnc</italic> mutants that contained higher levels of dsRNAs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). We hypothesized the high expression of <italic>rnc</italic> gene in high virulence <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains could promote the elimination of dsRNA to minimize the activation of host immune response to dsRNA during infection. To investigate whether the host immune response could be triggered by dsRNA of <italic>Salmonella</italic>, total RNA extracted from <italic>S</italic>. <italic>Enteritids</italic> 654 strains carrying different constructs were used to transfect different mammalian cell lines, followed by monitoring the changes in immune factors. Expression levels of TNF-Î± (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>), IL-1Î² (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>), MDA-5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>) and IFN-Î² (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>) could be detected in RAW264.7 macrophage cells; on the other hand, expression of IFN-Î² (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref>), MDA-5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3f</xref>), and RIG-I (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3g</xref>) were detectable in Caco-2 colon epithelial cells. The results showed that all the immune related genes tested were inducible in both RAW264.7 and Caco-2 cells when they were transfected with total RNA extracted from strains bearing different constructs, suggesting that the RNA from <italic>Salmonella</italic> would stimulate the host immune response. The RAW264.7 cells transfected with total RNAs extracted from <italic>S</italic>. Enteritidis strain 654 and 654Î<italic>rnc</italic>/p-<italic>rnc</italic> exhibited similar expression levels of TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², MDA-5 and IFN-Î² (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a-d</xref>). However, cells transfected with total RNAs from 654Î<italic>rnc</italic> exhibited significantly higher expression of immune factors; in particular, the level of expression of IL-1Î² and IFN-Î² was more than 50% higher in 654Î<italic>rnc</italic> RNA transfected RAW264.7 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b,d</xref>). The expression of IFN-Î² and RIG-I in Caco-2 cells transfected with total RNA extracted from strain 654Î<italic>rnc</italic> was 4-fold that of the cells transfected with total RNA of strain 654 and 654Î<italic>rnc</italic>/p-<italic>rnc</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e, g</xref>). The expression level of MDA-5 in Caco-2 cells was increased for 10-fold in 654Î<italic>rnc</italic> RNA transfected cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3f</xref>). These findings showed that total bacterial RNAs containing abundant dsRNAs from strain 654Î<italic>rnc</italic> could induce strong innate immune responses in both RAW264.7 and Caco-2 cells.</p>

</fig>
<p>To further confirm that the host immune responses were triggered by dsRNAs of <italic>Salmonella</italic>, total RNAs extracted from two clinical isolates, namely SEBL and SEST, and their corresponding <italic>rnc</italic> knockout mutants SEBLÎ<italic>rnc</italic> and SESTÎ<italic>rnc</italic>, were used to transfect the RAW264.7 macrophage cells and Caco-2 colon epithelial cells. Consistent with the above-described results from experiment involving the 654Î<italic>rnc</italic> and 654Î<italic>rnc</italic>/p-<italic>rnc</italic> strains, the mRNA expression level of IFN-Î² in RAW264.7 transfected with the total RNAs of SEBLÎ<italic>rnc</italic> and SESTÎ<italic>rnc</italic> was 100-fold and 200-fold higher than that of transfected with RNAs from wildtype SEBL and SEST, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>). Similarly, an around two-fold increase in mRNA expression of both MDA-5 and RIG-I was observed in cells transfected with total RNAs comparing SEBLÎ<italic>rnc</italic> with SEBL and comparing SESTÎ<italic>rnc</italic> with SEST, an around three-fold such increase was observed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b, c</xref>). The expression level of IFN-Î² in Caco2 cells was also increased for 30-folds after transfection with total RNAs extracted comparing <italic>rnc</italic> mutants (SEBLÎ<italic>rnc</italic> or SESTÎ<italic>rnc</italic>) with wildtypes (SEBL and SEST).</p>

The cells treated with Lipofectamine 2000 only were used as control.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="611193v1_fig4.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>To further confirm that the increased immune responses in RAW264.7 and Caco-2 cells were triggered by the dsRNA instead of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) from <italic>Salmonella</italic>, total RNAs from SEBL, SEBLÎ<italic>rnc</italic>, SEST and SESTÎ<italic>rnc</italic> were treated with dsRNA-specific RNase III and ssRNA-specific Exonuclease T respectively, followed by transfection into RAW264.7 cells and measurement of IFN-Î² expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4e</xref>). The result showed that the expression levels of IFN-Î² in cells transfected with Rnase III-treated RNA samples from <italic>rnc</italic> mutants were reduced to the level of WT RNA. However, total RNAs from <italic>rnc</italic> mutants treated with exonuclease T could still induce high expression of <italic>IFN-Î²</italic> in RAW264.7 cells in a manner resembling the no-treatment group (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4e</xref>). These findings strongly support that the induction of <italic>IFN-Î²</italic> expression in RAW264.7 cells was mainly due to dsRNA, not ssRNA of <italic>Salmonella</italic>.</p>
<p>In summary, these findings confirm that the total RNAs and particularly dsRNAs from <italic>rnc</italic> knockout mutants could stimulate significant immune responses in both RAW264.7 and Caco-2 cells. The expression of the <italic>rnc</italic> gene in WT resulted in reduced immune stimulatory effects of bacterial RNAs, thereby facilitating bacterial infection process.</p>

<title>The rnc gene regulates expression of the superoxide dismutase SodA</title>
<p>The results of macrophage infection assays indicated that intracellular survival and replication of <italic>S</italic>. Enteritidis 654 in macrophages were regulated by the <italic>rnc</italic> gene product (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Since the survival of <italic>Salmonella</italic> in macrophage was reported to be highly dependent on its ability of reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification, we further tested the ROS level in the six <italic>Salmonella</italic> isolates upon the treatment with hydrogen peroxide (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). A significantly lower level of ROS was detectable in the high virulence strains SE09-1889, SE11-72 and SE12-5 when compared to the low virulence strains 2992 and 3046, whereas intermediate level of ROS was recorded in strain 654, suggesting that the ROS level in <italic>Salmonella</italic> was inversely correlated with their virulence level as well as the expression level of <italic>rnc</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Based on these observations, we hypothesize that RNase III expression may enhance the expression of superoxide dismutase in <italic>Salmonella</italic> and that this is one of the reasons why <italic>rnc</italic> is important for survival of <italic>Salmonella</italic> against the host defense systems. To test this hypothesis, qPCR was performed to investigate the expression of the <italic>sodA</italic> gene in strain 654Î<italic>rnc</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>). The level of mRNA transcript of <italic>sodA</italic> in <underline>rnc</underline> mutant strain was much higher than that in the parental strain <italic>S.</italic> Enteritidis 654. On the other hand, the level of <italic>sodA</italic> mRNA transcript in 654Î<italic>rnc</italic>/p-<italic>rnc</italic> was similar to that of WT strain <italic>S</italic>. Enteritidis 654. These findings therefore showed that the absence of <italic>rnc</italic> gene actually resulted in an increase of <italic>sodA</italic> mRNA level in <italic>S</italic>. Enteritidis. To further test the level of production of SodA protein in strains carrying various constructs, Western blot was performed on the total cell lysates of these strains (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref>). The result showed that production of SodA protein was actually reduced in the 654Î<italic>rnc</italic> strain when compared to the parental wildtype strain 654; hence this finding was inconsistent with the observation that this strain produced a large amount of the <italic>sodA</italic> mRNA transcript. On the other hand, the quantity of SodA detectable in strain 654Î<italic>rnc</italic>/p-<italic>rnc</italic> was similar to that of 654. Taken together, we found that, although the deletion of <italic>rnc</italic> gene caused an increase in the amount of mRNA transcript of the <italic>sodA</italic> gene in <italic>Salmonella</italic>, the production of SodA protein was reduced. This apparent paradox could be due to the stabilization of paired antisense and sense RNAs from the <italic>sodA</italic> gene resulting in the inhibition of <italic>sodA</italic> mRNA translation in 654Î<italic>rnc</italic> mutant. <italic>sodA</italic> gene knockout mutant 654Î<italic>sodA</italic> produced an ROS level similarly to that produced in 654Î<italic>rnc</italic>, which was significantly higher than that in 654 and 654Î<italic>rnc</italic>/p-<italic>rnc</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d</xref>). Based on these findings, we conclude that the <italic>rnc</italic> gene played an important role in mediating the translation of SodA protein, resulting in the regulation of ROS metabolism, in <italic>S</italic>. Enteritidis. ROS is a major weapon utilized by phagocytes to destroy internalized pathogens. A reduction in the ability to neutralize ROS in <italic>Salmonella</italic> could result in severe impairment in bacterial virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>).</p>

<p>To further confirm that the reduced virulence of strain 654Î<italic>rnc</italic> was due to the reduced production of SodA, the p-<italic>sodA</italic> vector was transformed into strain 654Î<italic>rnc</italic> to produce 654Î<italic>rnc</italic>/p-<italic>sodA</italic>. The <italic>sodA</italic> gene in the vector was over-expressed to produce SodA protein. The RAW264.7 cell invasion and survival and replication assay were carried out to determine the virulence level of strains carrying various constructs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5e</xref>). Deletion of the <italic>rnc</italic> gene from <italic>S</italic>. <italic>Enteritidis</italic> 654 was found to dramatically lower the invasiveness, as well as the survival fitness and replication rate to level about 1/5 of that of the wild-type strain. The deletion of the <italic>sodA</italic> gene did not affect invasiveness of <italic>Sallmonella</italic> into RAW264.7 cels, while causing a 50% reduction of survival and replication rate. These results confirm that SodA plays an important role in the survival of <italic>Salmonella</italic> in the macrophage. The transformation of a <italic>rnc</italic>-bearing plasmid to the knockout mutant 654Î<italic>rnc</italic> restored its intracellular survival and replication rate similarly to wild-type strain. The intracellular survival and replication rate of strain 654Î<italic>rnc/</italic>p-<italic>sodA</italic> was about 3-fold that of 654Î<italic>rnc</italic>, suggesting that introduction of the <italic>sodA</italic> gene can partially restore the function of <italic>rnc</italic>. Similar results were observed in mouse infection assay (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5f</xref>), in which the virulence level of strain 654Î<italic>rnc</italic>/p-<italic>sodA</italic> was comparable to the parental strain 654. These findings further confirmed that reduction in the virulence level of strain 654Î<italic>rnc</italic> could be at least partly due to the lowered level of SodA protein.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Antisense RNA (asRNA) is known to ubiquitously exist in bacterial genome and can be transcribed from the negative strands of protein-encoding genes. This type of RNA exhibits perfect complementation to RNA transcripts of the sense strand of the gene and form double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) by base-pairing with the mRNAs to regulate expression of specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). RNase III, a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-specific riboendonuclease encoded by the <italic>rnc</italic> gene, is implicated in cleavage of dsRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). The molecular mechanisms and biological significance of asRNAs in bacteria are still poorly defined. The widespread presence of asRNAs in bacteria could be transcription noises which are rapidly degraded by RNases; alternatively, these molecules may play a role as gene regulators that fine-tune the expression level of specific genes. Recently, cellular activities that determine the degree of accumulation of dsRNA have been reported to be involved in regulation of both bacterial infectivity and host immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Currently available data also suggest that the functional roles of RNase III in <italic>Salmonella</italic> involve regulation of the level of specific asRNA to control bacterial gene expression; such function, which may be mediated through non-specific regulation of the dsRNA level, may indirectly cause changes in the virulence level of <italic>Salmonella</italic>. We therefore investigated the mechanisms of RNase III in regulating <italic>Salmonella</italic> virulence.</p>
<p>In this study, we first observed that the <italic>rnc</italic> gene which encodes RNase III was over-expressed in the high virulence strains of <italic>Salmonella</italic>. We generated the <italic>rnc</italic> knockout mutants to investigate its role in expression of the virulence phenotype and found that the Î<italic>rnc</italic> mutants indeed exhibited decreased intracellular survival and replication rate in macrophage cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). Reduction in virulence level in <italic>Salmonella,</italic> when <italic>rnc</italic> was deleted, was confirmed by testing in murine sepsis model (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>). It is known that <italic>Salmonella</italic> is exposed to an abundance of ROSs produced by the host during infection, including superoxide (O<sup>2â</sup>), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and hydroxyl radical (OH<sup>3â</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). These ROSs were important tools by which the immune system of the host utilizes to eradicate pathogens via exerting strong oxidative effects. It was reported in previous studies that the ability of <italic>Salmonella</italic> to neutralize ROS was important for its survival and propagation in the host, and that such function was mediated through production of the enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Our results confirmed that the production of Mn-SOD in the Î<italic>rnc</italic> mutant was indeed altered (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d</xref>). The transcription of <italic>sodA</italic> gene, encoding a kind of Mn-SOD, in the 654Î<italic>rnc</italic> strain was significantly higher than its parental strain 654 but western blot showed that the production of SodA protein was significantly reduced in 654Î<italic>rnc</italic>. These contradictory findings appear to suggest that deletion of <italic>rnc</italic> in <italic>Salmonella</italic> results in reduced RNase III production, which may cause accumulation of dsRNA including that of the transcription product of <italic>sodA</italic>, hence high transcript level of <italic>sodA</italic> was detectable. On the other hand, the asRNA of <italic>sodA</italic> could not be removed due to the lack of RNase III. Hence, the translation of <italic>sodA</italic> transcript would be inhibited, resulting in decreased production of SodA protein (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a</xref>). In this study, we performed an ROS assay and confirmed that the ROS content in <italic>Salmonella</italic> significantly increased when the <italic>rnc</italic> gene was deleted. This finding supports the idea that deletion of the <italic>rnc</italic> gene exhibits the effect of suppressing production of SodA protein production by inhibiting translation of the <italic>sodA</italic> transcript, hence, indirectly affect survival of <italic>Salmonella</italic> in the host cells.</p>

</fig>
<p>Apart from demonstrating the role of RNase III in regulating the expression of the SodA protein, we also tested the role of RNAse III in regulating the host immune response to RNAs of bacterial origin. Firstly, we found that the RNAs extracted from the <italic>rnc</italic> knockout mutant indeed induced significantly higher levels of immune responses in the host, including the innate immune factors IFN-Î², RIG-I and MDA-5, when compared to RNAs from the wild-type strain. Secondly, we showed that dsRNAs were only detectable in <italic>rnc</italic> knockout mutant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>), suggesting that bacterial dsRNAs can be recognized by intracellular innate immune sensors of the cells and trigger immune responses in the host. The retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA-5) were known to be responsible for combating viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Double stranded RNA is commonly found in RNA viruses as their genetic materials. The innate immunity elicited against dsRNAs plays an essential role in protecting human against various viral infections. Our experimental results showed that the dsRNAs in <italic>Salmonella</italic> could also trigger the activation of both RIG-I and MDA-5 pathways. A previous study showed that the alpha/beta interferon-based immune defenses could be triggered by RIG-I and MDA-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Our qPCR data showed that expression of IFN-Î² in RAW264.7 and Caco-2 cells significantly increased when the cells were transfected with RNA extracted from the <italic>rnc</italic> knockout mutant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b-e</xref>). Importantly, testing the effect of treatment by RNase III and Exonuclease T enzymes confirmed that such response was only triggered by bacterial dsRNAs but not ssRNAs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4e</xref>). We therefore conclude that the dsRNA from <italic>Salmonella</italic> may act in a manner similar to that of viral dsRNAs by triggering the RIG-I and MDA-5 pathways in the host. Particularly, the generation of interferons in non-phagocytes may serve as the defense signal for the host to restrict the spreading of intracellular bacteria, like <italic>Salmonella</italic>. Over-expression of RNase III in the high virulence <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains could therefore remove excess dsRNAs and help the bacteria to evade the host immunity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6b</xref>).</p>
<p>To conclude, findings in this work suggest that RNase III played an important role in regulating the expression of Mn-SOD and bacterial resistance to oxidative stress which is important for survival of <italic>Salmonella</italic> in the host during the infection process. On the other hand, we also found that dsRNA was responsible for induction of the host immune response which is suppressed by RNase III. Over-expression of RNase III in <italic>Salmonella</italic> may result in a lower dsRNA level, leading to a milder innate immune response inducible by <italic>Salmonella</italic>. These novel findings pave the way to devise effective approaches to attenuate bacterial virulence by suppressing specific housekeeping and stress response genes including RNase III, which degrades dsRNA, a key factor that triggers the host immune response.</p>

<p>This <bold>useful</bold> study examines the function of the rnc gene, which encodes the RNase III ribonuclease, as it relates to virulence of Salmonella Enteritidis. The authors demonstrate that the rnc gene is markedly upregulated in strains proposed to exhibit high virulence and that the product of the rnc gene promotes the expression of SodA, which contributes to the survival of Salmonella Enteritidis in the face of oxidative stress. The study also suggests that elevated levels of rnc gene expression assist Salmonella Enteritidis in evading immune responses by diminishing the presence of accumulated double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), although the evidence substantiating this and the above assertions remains <bold>incomplete</bold>.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The central question of this manuscript is the role of RNase III in supporting Salmonella infection. The authors begin with an RNAseq analysis of a collection of food or clinical Salmonella isolates from China, identifying RNase III (encoded by rnc) as an upregulated gene in clinical (&quot;high virulence&quot;) isolates. Based on follow-up studies with knockout and complemented strains, the authors propose that RNase III has two roles - one in the upregulation of sodA expression to counter host-derived ROS, and the other in general degradation of dsRNA to dampen host immune responses. Overall, the manuscript is logical and the authors make largely reasonable interpretations of their data. However, the depth of supporting evidence limits the breadth of the authors' conclusions in their current form. Thus, this manuscript will be useful to researchers in directly related fields of study, but more work is required to understand how these proposed mechanisms function during infection.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The use of comparative RNAseq between different isolates to identify potential virulence mechanisms is a powerful approach to understanding what makes certain strains more likely to cause infection over others.</p>
<p>(2) The experiments identifying dsRNA as the factor contributing to increased innate immune induction in the rnc knockout strain are particularly thorough.</p>
<p>(3) The authors observed an in vivo mammalian infection defect for RNase III-deficient Salmonella, a novel finding for the field and strong evidence that this protein is required to support pathogen fitness.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The strengths of the manuscript are in places obscured by a lack of clarity and justification in the manuscript about strain selection and rationale for using some backgrounds over others. Moreover, several aspects of the organization and flow of the manuscript could be improved, as data is described out of order and the text description of results does not always align with the data presented.</p>
<p>(2) The specific claim that the relatively modest increase in expression of RNase III in some isolates (Figure 1A) accounts for their &quot;virulence&quot; is not well-supported, since the only comparisons in the study are between total knockouts or wild-type (and not overexpression) and the actual protein levels of RNase III are not quantified.</p>
<p>(3) Although the experiments on dsRNA are strong, they would have benefited from measurements of cytokine production/immune responses during infection with the actual knockout strains instead of transfected RNA along with quantification of Salmonella burdens.</p>
<p>(4) The contribution of RNase III catalytic activity (i.e., through the use of a catalytically dead mutant) was not assessed, which means that a role for general RNA binding or protein-protein interactions cannot be ruled out from this study.</p>
<p>(5) The in vivo work was limited to survival analysis, so whether the proposed mechanisms account for the defects observed could not be resolved.</p>
<p>(6) Statistical analysis throughout the manuscript is inconsistently applied, making it hard in places to determine whether the differences seen in phenotypes are biologically significant.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work attempted to investigate how the gene rnc, which showed higher expression in clinical strains of Salmonella Enteritidis compared to those isolated from food, affects the virulence of this bacteria through modulating dsRNA levels and the immune response of host cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors clearly demonstrated that the deletion of rnc Salmonella Enteritidis leads to an accumulation of dsRNA inside the cells, which further activates the immune response of host cells. It is also well demonstrated that the rnc gene deletion results in an increased ROS level through regulating the SodA protein.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) It is unclear whether the higher rnc expression in clinical strains of Salmonella Enteritidis is universal or just specific to several strains, because of the inadequate data provided and different strains used for different tests in this study.</p>
<p>(2) A lot of specific information is missing in the Figure legends and Method section, which makes it hard to understand some of the key results in the manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Chan et al. evaluated the role of RNase III, encoded by the rnc gene, in Salmonella virulence. Chan et al. first identified rnc among the genes with upregulated mRNA levels in virulent Salmonella isolates. The authors further showed that deletion of rnc resulted in increased double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and reduced invasion rate and replication rate in an in vitro macrophage model. The authors then showed that transfection of total RNA of rnc knock-out strains upregulates (with respect to a WT Salmonella strain) expression levels of immune-related genes (e.g., TNF-a, IL-1B, etc.) in a dsRNA-dependent manner. The authors reported reduced SodA protein accumulation in the rnc knock-out strains, despite higher levels of sodA mRNA, suggesting a role of SodA in the protection against reactive oxygen species. Finally, the authors showed, using a mice model, the partial contribution of sodA in the restoration of virulence levels in the rnc knock-out strains.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript is well written.</p>
<p>(2) The authors evaluated the impact of rnc deletion in both in vitro and mice infection models. Both experiment setups supported the contribution of rnc to Salmonella virulence.</p>
<p>(3) The authors tested the effect of rnc deletion in different genetic backgrounds (i.e., different bacterial isolates) offering additional support to their claims.</p>
<p>(4) Measurement of SodA protein levels nicely complemented and informed initial findings at the mRNA level.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors failed to discuss how their work differentiates from recent studies of rnc deletion strains in Salmonella (NIH PMID: 38182942) and Escherichia coli (NIH PMID: 35456749). Remarkably, the first publication performed genome-wide transcriptional profiling of a rnc deletion Salmonella strain. The second publication explored the link between rnc and sodA in E. coli.</p>
<p>(2) The authors should explain what the criteria for selecting food and clinical isolates for molecular characterization were. This information is valuable for the reader as they may wonder about the impact of isolate selection in the study's conclusions. Similarly, the authors need to explain how they selected their controls for baseline gene expression, virulence, etc.. Furthermore, I wondered if they could use an avirulent Salmonella strain as an additional control.</p>
<p>(3) The authors do not perform any analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified in their study. They should leverage DEGs to expand their mechanistic insights of other genes or functional processes putatively linked to rnc activity and virulence. Additionally, authors should make transcriptional data and the output of their differential expression analysis (and the list of differentially expressed genes-DEGs) available to the readers. In fact, it is not clear how the DEGS were defined.</p>
