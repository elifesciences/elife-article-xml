<title>Abstract</title><p>Photoreceptor loss results in vision loss in many blinding diseases, and metabolic dysfunction underlies photoreceptor degeneration. So, exploiting photoreceptor metabolism is an attractive strategy to prevent vision loss. Yet, the metabolic pathways that maintain photoreceptor health remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the dependence of photoreceptors on Gln catabolism. Gln is converted to glutamate via glutaminase (GLS), so mice lacking GLS in rod photoreceptors were generated to inhibit Gln catabolism. Loss of GLS produced rapid rod photoreceptor degeneration. In vivo metabolomic methodologies and metabolic supplementation identified Gln catabolism as critical for glutamate and aspartate biosynthesis. Concordant with this amino acid deprivation, the integrated stress response (ISR) was activated with protein synthesis attenuation, and inhibiting the ISR delayed photoreceptor loss. Furthermore, supplementing asparagine, which is synthesized from aspartate, delayed photoreceptor degeneration. Hence, Gln catabolism is integral to photoreceptor health, and these data reveal a novel metabolic axis in these metabolically-demanding neurons.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Photoreceptor (PR) death is the cause of vision loss in many retinal diseases. A paucity of effective therapies exist that prevent PR death, so there is an unmet need for therapeutics that improve or prolong PR survival. The retina has a significant energetic demand, driven in large part by PRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pan et al., 2021</xref>). The prodigious bioenergetic requirements of photoreceptors (PRs) are due to the need to conduct phototransduction and neurotransmission as well as manufacture the lipid- and protein-rich outer segment, which is shed daily and phagocytosed by the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Young, 1967</xref>). PRs have little reserve capacity to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and as a result, are adversely affected by small changes in energy homeostasis. As such, metabolic dysfunction has been shown to underlie PR cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bowne et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Du et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hartong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kooragayala et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pan et al., 2021</xref>), and exploiting PR metabolism to make these cells more robust to stress is an attractive neuroprotective strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pan et al., 2021</xref>). Yet, beyond glucose, the metabolic pathways integral to PR health remain largely unknown. This is a critical knowledge gap as identification of these pathways is likely to reveal new strategies for therapeutic intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Duncan et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Glucose is central to PR metabolism as these cells utilize aerobic glycolysis, or the conversion of glucose to lactate despite the presence of oxygen, for the production of both energy and anabolic building blocks, similar to cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ait-Ali et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chinchore et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kanow et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Petit et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Swarup et al., 2019</xref>). Previous studies have shown that genetic knockdown of enzymes key to aerobic glycolysis leads to PR dysfunction and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chinchore et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Petit et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Rajala, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Weh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wubben et al., 2017</xref>). However, like other metabolically-demanding cells, recent work has demonstrated that PRs have the flexibility to utilize fuel sources beyond glucose to meet their metabolic needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Adler et al., 2014</xref>; Du, Cleghorn, Contreras, Linton, et al., 2013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Grenell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Joyal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Xu et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Glutamine (Gln) is the most abundant amino acid found in the body and circulating within the blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Yang et al., 2017</xref>), and many rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells, which utilize aerobic glycolysis, depend on Gln for their survival and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). Gln can serve as a substrate for multiple pathways, providing a carbon and nitrogen source for biosynthesis, energetics, and cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Adler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Xu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). These features potentially make Gln an ideal alternative fuel source for PRs, whose bioenergetic demand rivals that of cancer cells despite being terminally differentiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ng et al., 2015</xref>). To this end, over half of the Gln in the retina is found in the outer retina, which is primarily composed of PRs (Du, Cleghorn, Contreras, Linton, et al., 2013). <italic>Ex</italic> vivo experiments have shown that Gln can be a source of carbons for TCA cycle intermediates in the retina and contribute to amino acid biosynthesis (Du, Cleghorn, Contreras, Linton, et al., 2013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Grenell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Tsantilas et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, Gln was demonstrated to support nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) generation in the absence of glucose <italic>in vitro</italic> in isolated PRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Adler et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, in a genetically altered mouse model that disrupts glucose transport to the PRs, both Gln and its transporter were upregulated in the retina, implying that metabolism of this amino acid may be supporting PR survival when glucose is limiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Swarup et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Glutaminolysis is the process by which Gln is metabolized into TCA cycle intermediates for critical biosynthetic precursors. This process is initiated by the catabolism of Gln to glutamate (Glu) via one of two glutaminase enzymes: kidney-type glutaminase (GLS) or liver-type glutaminase (GLS2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). Single-cell RNA sequencing data has demonstrated that GLS is the predominant isoform in the retina and PRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Voigt et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, it has been shown that glutaminase activity is at least two-fold higher in mitochondria-rich PR inner segments. Since the inner segments of PRs are responsible for supporting the majority of energy production and metabolism, GLS activity is likely critical for metabolic functions in PRs.</p>
<p>Glutaminolysis via GLS is indispensable to the metabolism of many cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Altman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Yang et al., 2017</xref>), and a variety of data show the similarities between cancer cell metabolism and retinal metabolism, and specifically, metabolism of the PRs in the outer retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chinchore et al., 2017</xref>; Du, Cleghorn, Contreras, Linton, et al., 2013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Rajala, 2020</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that GLS-initiated Gln catabolism may also be essential to PR metabolism, function, and survival. Previous studies utilizing <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>ex vivo</italic> methods with whole retinas from wild-type mice or mice with genetic perturbations not confined to PRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Adler et al., 2014</xref>; Du, Cleghorn, Contreras, Linton, et al., 2013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Grenell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Xu et al., 2020</xref>) have provided a foundation for this governing hypothesis, but none have examined the role of Gln catabolism specifically in PRs <italic>in vivo.</italic> In this study, we generated a rod photoreceptor-specific knockout of GLS to comprehensively study the importance of GLS-driven Gln catabolism in PRs.</p>

<title>Generation of a rod photoreceptor-specific, <italic>Gls</italic> knockout mouse</title>
<p>Single-cell RNA sequencing data has demonstrated that <italic>Gls</italic> is expressed throughout the human and mouse retina and to a much greater degree than <italic>Gls2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Voigt et al., 2020</xref>). To confirm these findings, we conducted real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) with primers specific for either <italic>Gls</italic> or <italic>Gls2</italic> (Supplementary File 1). These data show that <italic>Gls</italic> expression is 14 times greater than that of <italic>Gls2</italic> in the mouse retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating that GLS is indeed the predominant isoform in murine retina. Furthermore, retinal sections stained for GLS using immunofluorescence showed that GLS is expressed throughout the retina with enrichment in the PR inner segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1B</xref>). It has been shown that GLS activity is at least two-fold higher in the PR inner segments, which are rich in mitochondria and support energy production and metabolism, than any other layer in the retina.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Ross et al., 1987</xref>) In accordance with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Campos-Sandoval et al., 2015</xref>), GLS segregated to the mitochondrial-enriched fraction more than the cytosolic fraction in the retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p>

<p>With the understanding that <italic>Gls</italic> is the predominant glutaminase enzyme in the murine retina and PRs, similar to humans, a rod PR-specific, <italic>Gls</italic> conditional knockout mouse was created to determine the role of GLS activity in PR survival and function. Animals homozygous for a floxed <italic>Gls</italic> allele and expressing a Cre-recombinase under the control of the rhodopsin promoter (<italic>Gls<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Rho-Cre<sup>+</sup>,</italic> cKO) as well as animals expressing only the Cre-recombinase (<italic>Gls<sup>wt/wt</sup>;Rho-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic>, WT) were generated. Total retinal lysate was collected from cKO and WT animals at postnatal day 14 (P14) and GLS expression was measured (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). These data show that cKO animals have significantly less GLS expression compared to WT animals. Whole eyes were collected at P14 and stained for GLS using immunofluorescence. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> shows significant loss of GLS expression in PR inner segments of cKO animals compared to WT animals. The remaining GLS in the inner segment layer is found within cone PRs, as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> (arrows), confirming the knockout is specific to rod PRs. A lack of compensatory upregulation of <italic>Gls2</italic> in the retina was confirmed via qRT-PCR and in PRs using immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1D-E</xref>).</p>

<title>Loss of GLS causes rapid PR degeneration</title>
<p>These data clearly show that GLS is significantly downregulated in cKO animals. To determine if loss of GLS effects PR survival, optical coherence tomography (OCT) was used to measure the <italic>in vivo</italic> thickness of each retinal layer at various timepoints in cKO and WT animals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). At P14, cKO and WT animals are indistinguishable in total retinal and outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>). However, by P21 a significant loss in total retinal, ONL, and IS/OS thickness is observed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1D</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>) and cKO animals continue to experience loss of retinal, ONL and IS/OS thickness out to P84. Considering mice open their eyes around P14, we assessed if light exposure was contributing to PR degeneration. cKO mice were reared in the dark, but no change in the rate of ONL degeneration was observed when comparing dark-reared mice to those reared in 12-hour light/12-hour dark cyclic lighting conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1 – figure supplement 2</xref>). Histology at P14, P21, and P42 confirmed loss of PR cell bodies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1G</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1H</xref>). As has been seen in other models of PR degeneration, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which is a marker of stress-induced Müller glial cell activation, was increased in the retina of the cKO mouse at P21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1 – figure supplement 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Grenell et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, to assess the cell death pathways contributing to PR degeneration in the cKO mouse, retinal sections from P21 animals were stained for TUNEL (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). At P21, there is a significant increase in TUNEL positive outer retinal cells in cKO mice compared to WT mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>). qRT-PCR analysis of cell death-related gene expression at P14 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1K</xref>) demonstrated an increase in genes involved in apoptosis, necroptosis, and ferroptosis. These data coincide with the thought that apoptosis is the predominant mechanism of PR death in many retinal diseases, considering <italic>Casp8</italic> showed the greatest increase in expression in the cKO retina, but also that other cell death mechanisms can contribute to PR cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wubben et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Retinas were stained for RHO expression using immunofluorescence, which indicated rod OSs were shorter after <italic>Gls</italic> knockout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1 – figure supplement 4A</xref>). Because cKO mice demonstrated shorter OSs, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to investigate the ultrastructure of cKO rod OSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figures 1 – figure supplement 4B-C</xref>). The rod OSs in the cKO mouse appeared largely normal with well-organized, stacked disc membranes that maintained interdigitation with the RPE similar to the WT mouse, just shorter than WT rod OSs.</p>
<p>A deficiency in GLS activity could lead to a significant decrease in Glu, the main neurotransmitter used by PRs. To evaluate the synaptic connectivity between PRs and the inner retina, retinal sections from cKO and WT mice at P14 were labeled with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), a plant lectin that binds N-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid residues, to highlight PR synaptic membranes and non-synaptic membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">McLaughlin et al., 1980</xref>). Retinal sections from P14 WT and cKO mice stained with WGA did not demonstrate significant differences in the labeling of PR synaptic membranes in the outer plexiform layer (OPL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1 – figure supplement 5A</xref>). Staining of P14 retinal sections from WT and cKO mice with an antibody against Bassoon, which labels the ribbon synapses of rods and cones in the OPL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kutsyr et al., 2021</xref>), did not demonstrate differences in the synaptic connectivity between PRs and second-order neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1 – figure supplement 5B</xref>). Additionally, retinal sections at P14, P21, and P42 were stained with antibodies against major cell-types in the inner retina, such as amacrine, ganglion, and bipolar cells, and no significant alterations in immunofluorescent patterns to suggest an inner retinal developmental abnormality were observed between cKO and WT animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1 – figure supplement 5C</xref>). Accordingly, inner retinal thinning was not observed until P42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1 – figure supplement 5D</xref>), when approximately 25% of cells remained in the ONL (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). This thinning of the inner retinal area is likely secondary to the primary PR degeneration similar to that seen in other mouse models of retinal degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ueta et al., 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>GLS is necessary for maintenance of mature photoreceptors</title>
<p>In mice expressing a Cre-recombinase under the control of the rhodopsin promoter, Cre-mediated excision of floxed genomic DNA has been observed as early as P7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Li et al., 2005</xref>).

<title>GLS knockout does not alter nucleotide metabolism</title>
<p>Gln, and its breakdown product, Glu, have several fates in cellular metabolism (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), which may underly the rapid and significant PR degeneration observed when GLS is knocked out of rod PRs. Beyond its use in protein synthesis, Gln has been shown to maintain mitochondrial function by supplying TCA cycle intermediates, generating antioxidants to maintain redox balance, synthesizing other nonessential amino acids (NEAAs), and contributing to nucleotide biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). With regards to the latter, PRs require nucleotides to support phototransduction as well as transcriptional efforts for the continued synthesis of OSs. The catabolism of Gln to Glu by GLS produces an ammonium ion that can be used for the synthesis of nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yoo et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, inhibition of GLS has previously been demonstrated to inhibit pyrimidine and purine biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Alkan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Okazaki et al., 2017</xref>). To explore the role of GLS-initiated Gln catabolism in nucleotide metabolism, <italic>in vivo</italic> targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) metabolomics were performed on P14 retina from WT and cKO animals (Supplementary File 2). No differences in key purine or pyrimidine metabolism intermediates, such as ribose 5-phosphate (R5P), inosine monophosphate (IMP), and uridine monophosphate (UMP), were observed between the WT and cKO retina (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting that GLS-mediated catabolism of Gln is not a critical pathway for nucleotide synthesis in rod PRs.</p>

<title>Redox balance is altered upon knockout of GLS in rod photoreceptors</title>
<p>Gln can also be used for the generation of the antioxidant molecule glutathione as well as in a non-canonical NADPH generating pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Son et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yoo et al., 2020</xref>). Glutathione is a tripeptide of glutamate, glycine, and cysteine. Glutamate is a product of the GLS reaction, and previous studies have demonstrated that inhibiting GLS reduces glutathione levels and increases reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Li et al., 2015</xref>). As such, the NADP<sup>+</sup>/NADPH ratio was statistically significantly increased by 16% in the P14 cKO retina as compared to WT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), and the relative abundance of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) was decreased in the P14 cKO retina as compared to WT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). While an increased NADP<sup>+</sup>/NADPH ratio in the cKO retina may imply that the abundance of GSSG should be increased in the cKO retina since reduced glutathione can be recovered from the oxidized form by the conversion of NADPH to NADP<sup>+</sup>, the levels of GSSG have been seen to be reduced in other models where GLS is pharmacologically inhibited or genetically knocked down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Daemen et al., 2018</xref>). The lower levels of GSSG may signal an overall reduction in the biosynthesis of glutathione considering the product of the GLS reaction, glutamate, is directly necessary for its synthesis as well as indirectly responsible for cysteine via the SLC7A11 (xCT) cystine/glutamate antiporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yoo et al., 2020</xref>). The expression of <italic>Slc7a11</italic> was reduced in the P14 cKO retina (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Hence, the biosynthesis of glutathione in rod PRs may be affected directly and indirectly when GLS is knocked out. In accordance with the antioxidants NADPH and glutathione potentially being reduced, the expression of the antioxidant enzymes <italic>Sod1</italic> and <italic>Sod2</italic>, which detoxify superoxide radicals, were increased in the P14 cKO retina (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). These data suggest that GLS-mediated Gln catabolism regulates redox balance in rod PRs, and the altered redox balance that is a consequence of its knockout may be one factor contributing to PR degeneration in the GLS cKO mouse.</p>

<title>Relative abundance of TCA cycle intermediates and mitochondrial function mostly unchanged in <italic>Gls</italic> cKO retina</title>
<p>While the changes in certain redox elements were statistically significant, they were modest alterations and may not account in full for the significant and rapid PR degeneration noted in the GLS cKO mouse. Many cancer cells that utilize aerobic glycolysis rely on Gln to replenish TCA cycle intermediates, which maintain oxidative metabolism and provide biosynthetic precursors. Glutaminolysis is the process by which Gln is metabolized into TCA cycle intermediates, and GLS initiates this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). Considering PRs utilize aerobic glycolysis, similar to cancer cells, and have significant bioenergetic demands secondary to the need to conduct phototransduction and neurotransmission as well as constantly manufacture OSs, we next sought to determine if rod PRs also depend on GLS-initiated glutaminolysis for TCA cycle metabolites and oxidative metabolism. Interestingly, LC-MS/MS-based targeted metabolomics demonstrated very few changes in the relative pool sizes of TCA cycle metabolites in the cKO compared to WT retina at P14 with only malate showing a statistically significant decrease (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Since GLS is enriched in the PR mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1B</xref>) and previous studies demonstrated that inhibiting GLS in certain cell lines reduces mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Alkan et al., 2018</xref>), mitochondrial stress tests were also performed on P14 cKO and WT retina, prior to PR loss, using the BaroFuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kamat et al., 2023</xref>). The basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) as well as the changes in OCR in response to oligomycin or carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP) were not statistically significantly different between WT and cKO retina (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4G</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4H</xref>). The expression of complexes involved in oxidative phosphorylation were also unchanged between the WT and cKO retina at P14 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>).</p>
<p>As stated earlier, a Cre-recombinase under the control of the rhodopsin has been shown to be activated as early as P7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Li et al., 2005</xref>). To circumvent this early knockout of GLS, rod PRs may rewire their metabolism, as has been seen in other conditional knockout mouse models with this Cre-recombinase system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Subramanya et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wubben et al., 2017</xref>), to utilize different fuel sources for the maintenance of the TCA cycle and mitochondrial function. To this end, the expression of genes involved in glycolysis, pyruvate metabolism, and the TCA cycle were examined in the P14 cKO and WT retina before PR degeneration. Numerous genes were significantly altered in the cKO retina across the metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4 – figure supplement 1</xref>). The expression of multiple genes in glycolysis and pyruvate metabolism were increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4 – figure supplement 1A</xref>), possibly suggesting that rod PRs are stimulating glucose oxidation to maintain the TCA cycle and mitochondrial function similar to that seen in certain cancer cells when GLS is inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Okazaki et al., 2017</xref>). However, targeted metabolomics demonstrated only a minor change in glycolytic intermediates between the cKO and WT retina at P14 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). As targeted metabolomics at the P14 timepoint provides only a snapshot of the pool size, additional analyses with stable isotope tracing metabolomics are necessary to assess nutrient utilization, in this case glucose. Uniformly-labeled, <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-glucose was intraperitoneally injected in P14 WT and cKO mice, and the retina harvested 45 minutes later for metabolomic analysis via LC-MS/MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Yuan et al., 2019</xref>). No change in the fractional labeling of glycolytic intermediates was observed between the WT and cKO retina, and more so, an increase in the fractional labeling of TCA cycle intermediates was not observed in the cKO retina (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5A, 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5 – figure supplement 1</xref>). Hence, it is unlikely rod PRs are increasing glucose oxidation to maintain the levels of TCA cycle intermediates and mitochondrial function. PRs may have the flexibility to use other fuel sources, such as fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Joyal et al., 2016</xref>), to supplement the TCA cycle. Regardless of the fuel source being utilized to maintain the levels of TCA cycle metabolites, it is not circumventing the significant and rapid PR degeneration observed in the GLS cKO retina.</p>

<title><italic>Gls</italic> cKO in rod photoreceptors decreases the utilization of Gln in the TCA cycle</title>
<p>We initially anticipated that GLS knockout in rod PRs would significantly alter the relative TCA cycle metabolite pools in the cKO retina, similar to what is seen in Gln-dependent cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Daemen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Yang et al., 2017</xref>), as PRs and cancer cells having common metabolic relationships (Du, Cleghorn, Contreras, Linton, et al., 2013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Rajala, 2020</xref>), and previous <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies demonstrated Gln can supplement the TCA cycle in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Grenell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Tsantilas et al., 2021</xref>). However, as observed in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>, very few changes were observed in the relative pool sizes of TCA cycle metabolites in the cKO compared to WT retina. To delineate how Gln is metabolized, we used LC-MS/MS to trace the metabolic fate of uniformly-labeled <sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>-Gln in the WT and cKO retina <italic>in vivo</italic> at P14. Uniformly-labeled <sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>-Gln was intraperitoneally injected into the mice and the retina harvested 45 minutes later. In accordance with GLS being the enzyme that initiates glutaminolysis, or the process by which cells convert Gln into TCA cycle intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Yang et al., 2017</xref>), the fractional labeling of glutamate, TCA cycle intermediates, and pyruvate was decreased in the P14 cKO retina as compared to WT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5C, 5D</xref> and <xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 – figure supplement 2</xref>). Previous <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies have also observed that isotopically labeled <sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>-Gln can contribute to m+3 pyruvate in the retina possibly via the decarboxylation of m+4 malate by malic enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Grenell et al., 2019</xref>). A more recent <italic>ex vivo</italic> study postulated that PRs can utilize different metabolic cycles, such as the Cahill cycle or mini-Krebs cycle, to uncouple glycolysis from oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2024</xref>). These cycles are fueled by Gln and require phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) to replenish pyruvate from oxaloacetate (OAA). So, m+4 OAA can be converted to m+3 pyruvate by PEPCK. While the lack of m+4 citrate in both the P14 WT and cKO retina and decrease in m+2 citrate in the cKO retina (<xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 – figure supplement 2</xref>) may further support the existence of these previously postulated metabolic cycles, which avoid the citrate synthase step of the TCA cycle as well as others, further studies are needed to confirm the activity of these pathways in the retina and specifically, the PRs.</p>
<p>a-ketoglutarate (α-KG) is the main entry point for Gln into the TCA cycle (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>) and has been shown to be a key metabolite in Gln metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic> stable isotope tracing demonstrated decreased incorporation of Gln carbons into α-KG in the cKO retina compared to the WT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Furthermore, supplementation with α-KG has been shown to improve PR survival in mouse models of inherited retinal disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wert et al., 2020</xref>). So, we attempted to rescue the PR degeneration phenotype in the GLS cKO mouse by supplementing cKO animals with 10 mg/mL of α-KG in the drinking water starting at P4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Rowe et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wert et al., 2020</xref>). A small, but significant increase in ONL thickness was identified in α-KG-treated animals at P22 using OCT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). These data further suggest that Gln’s role in supporting the TCA cycle is not the major mechanism by which PRs utilize Gln to suppress PR apoptosis.</p>

<p>Deprivation of amino acids can activate the integrated stress response (ISR), which responds to an array of stressors to maintain cellular homeostasis and particularly, protein homeostasis. Acutely, ISR activation can protect cells by temporarily halting protein synthesis. However, chronic ISR activation and global protein synthesis inhibition can trigger apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>). ISR activation leads to phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α), which reduces global protein synthesis while preferentially allowing for the translation of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>). Considering the reduced levels of NEAAs Glu and Asp, retinas from P14 GLS cKO animals were assayed for these ISR components using Western blotting (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>), which demonstrated increased levels of both phosphorylated eIF2α and total ATF4, suggesting ISR activation. To determine if global protein synthesis was affected in GLS cKO retinas, we applied the SUnSET (SUrface SEnsing of Translation) method to quantify protein synthesis in WT and cKO retinas at P14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fort et al., 2022</xref>). These data show a significant decrease of puromycin incorporation into nascent polypeptide chains, indicating a decrease in global protein synthesis consistent with ISR activation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6E</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>). To determine if PR degeneration could be rescued by inhibiting the ISR, ISRIB (2.5 mg/kg) was administered systemically daily starting at P5. At P21, ISRIB treatment significantly increased ONL thickness compared to vehicle using OCT (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). These results suggest that ISR activation is downstream of Gln catabolism and contributes to PR degeneration in the cKO mouse retina.</p>
<p>Previous work has demonstrated that when certain cancer cell lines are faced with Gln deprivation, α-KG alone does not restore cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Pavlova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Son et al., 2013</xref>). Rather, NEAA supplementation is necessary to restore proliferation in these reports. Similarly, α-KG supplementation had an incomplete survival impact on PR survival, showing approximately 10% increase in ONL thickness in cKO animals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Since systemic or intravitreal glutamate supplementation has demonstrated retinal toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sisk &amp; Kuwabara, 1985</xref>), and Asp concentration is normally low in plasma with poor cellular membrane permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Sullivan et al., 2018</xref>), we investigated other NEAA approaches to rescue the PR degeneration observed in the GLS cKO mouse. The potential of asparagine (Asn) to rescue PR degeneration was chosen due to the growing list of Asn-mediated cellular processes that improve cancer cell survival and growth under metabolic stress, such as Gln deprivation. These Asn-mediated cellular processes include inhibiting ISR-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), promoting protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Pavlova et al., 2018</xref>), and maintaining Asp pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Halbrook et al., 2022</xref>). All these processes may be relevant to the PR degeneration observed in the cKO mouse. Following administration of systemic Asn (200 mg/kg) daily starting at P5, <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis of retinal structure via OCT at P21 demonstrated a significant improvement in ONL thickness compared to animals treated with vehicle, with a 22-26% increase in ONL thickness in some retinal locations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate for the first time the importance of Gln catabolism in PR metabolism, function, and survival <italic>in vivo</italic>. Rod PRs lacking GLS demonstrated rapid and complete degeneration with concomitant functional loss. Mechanistically, lack of GLS-initiated Gln catabolism in rod PRs, specifically, resulted in changes in redox homeostasis and a decrease in the fractional labeling of TCA cycle intermediates from stable isotope-labeled Gln <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, Gln anaplerosis did not appear to be driving the TCA cycle as targeted metabolomics showed few changes in the relative levels of TCA cycle intermediates, and supplementation with αKG showed a modest rescue effect in PR degeneration. The NEAAs Glu and Asp were found to be significantly decreased in the cKO mouse retina, and in accordance with this AA deprivation, the ISR was upregulated with a reduction in global protein synthesis suggesting Gln catabolism in rod PRs plays a significant role in supporting biomass production via NEAA synthesis. Interestingly, supplementing cKO mice with Asn significantly rescued PR degeneration, revealing a novel link between Gln and Asn metabolism in PRs. This work further demonstrates that PRs have the flexibility to utilize fuel sources other than glucose to meet their metabolic needs and that Gln is a critical amino acid that supports PR cell biomass, redox balance, and survival.</p>
<p>The rapid degenerative phenotype observed with conditional deletion of <italic>Gls</italic> in rod PRs was unexpected considering glucose is viewed as the primary substrate for the retina and PRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Swarup et al., 2019</xref>). The <italic>Gls</italic> cKO mouse demonstrated comparable ONL thickness to WT controls at P14 with approximately 50% loss of PR cell bodies by P21 (<xref rid="fig1s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 3A-B</xref>) and near complete PR degeneration by P84 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, conditional deletion of numerous enzymes within central glucose metabolism, including hexokinase 2 (HK2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Weh et al., 2020</xref>), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wubben et al., 2017</xref>), glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Daniele et al., 2022</xref>), mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 (MPC1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Grenell et al., 2019</xref>), and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Rajala et al., 2023</xref>), results in a slower, age-related degeneration. For example, loss of GLUT1 in the retina and rod PRs does not demonstrate 50% thinning of the ONL until approximately 4 months of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Daniele et al., 2022</xref>), and the others noted above demonstrate even slower outer retinal degeneration. It has also been shown that PRs can utilize fatty acid β-oxidation for energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Joyal et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, in retinas lacking the very-low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), which facilitates fatty acid uptake, the PRs remained largely intact. In any of these transgenic mouse models, PRs may use other transporters to take up fatty acids or glucose or rewire their metabolism to maintain metabolic homeostasis and stave off degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Subramanya et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wubben et al., 2017</xref>). Our data show that any metabolic reprogramming that is occurring in the cKO mouse retina appears unable to significantly circumvent the significant and rapid PR degeneration suggesting the importance of Gln catabolism in rod PRs. Furthermore, inducing GLS knockdown in mature PRs also demonstrated rapid PR degeneration (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Traditionally, it has been thought that Gln maintains cell survival through Gln-derived α-KG and maintenance of the TCA cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). While stable isotope tracing with uniformly labeled Gln demonstrated a reduction in fractional labeling of the TCA cycle intermediates (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>), targeted metabolomics showed few changes in the relative levels of the intermediates (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>) and supplementation with αKG did not rescue PR degeneration to a large degree (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Gln is also required for the biosynthesis of NEAAs, and the NEAAs Glu and Asp were reduced nearly two-fold in the retina of cKO mouse (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Glu is the product of the GLS reaction so it is not surprising that Glu was substantially reduced. Glu is involved in glutathione biosynthesis directly and indirectly, can be converted into α-KG to enter the TCA cycle, and is crucial for the biosynthesis of NEAAs including Asp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yoo et al., 2020</xref>). Alterations in redox homeostasis were observed in the retina of the cKO mouse in accordance with the reduced level of Glu (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4C</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref>). While these redox imbalances likely contribute to the PR degeneration observed, it is unlikely these small but statistically significant changes fully account for the rapid and complete PR degeneration. Future rescue studies with antioxidants, such as N-acetylcysteine, are needed to shed light on the role of redox imbalance in this novel transgenic mouse model.</p>
<p>Previous <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies demonstrated that Gln can contribute carbons to Asp synthesis via the TCA cycle and/or contribute a nitrogen via glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminases (Du, Cleghorn, Contreras, Lindsay, et al., 2013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Xu et al., 2020</xref>), the latter of which have been shown to be critical in the Gln metabolic rewiring of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Son et al., 2013</xref>) and more recently, in rod PR metabolism, function, and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Subramanya et al., 2023</xref>). Our data shows that Gln-derived carbons via Glu are entering the TCA cycle <italic>in vivo</italic> and contributing to the synthesis of Asp (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), and this contribution is reduced in the cKO mouse retina. Based on the previous studies noted above, Gln may also be contributing to Asp synthesis via the glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase catalyzed transfer of a nitrogen from Glu. Future studies using amine-labeled Gln are needed to dissect the contributions of Gln-derived carbon versus nitrogen to the synthesis of Asp in the retina <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Asp is a proteinogenic amino acid that has many biosynthetic roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Alkan et al., 2018</xref>), and <italic>ex vivo</italic> neural retina studies have suggested that the retina needs Asp to maintain its metabolic homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Li et al., 2020</xref>). In accordance with this data, Asp was one of the few metabolites that was significantly reduced in the retina of cKO mouse prior to rapid PR degeneration (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Based on <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies, it has been postulated that Asp utilization in the retina is necessary to maintain aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism through the recycling of NADH to NAD<sup>+</sup>, shuttling electrons into the mitochondria via the malate-aspartate shuttle, replenishing oxaloacetate for biosynthesis and/or producing pyruvate via malic enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Our <italic>in vivo</italic> metabolomics data further support this last point as uniformly labeled Gln contributed to m+3 pyruvate in the retina possibly via the decarboxylation of m+4 malate by malic enzyme (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). The m+4 isotopologue of malate could arise from m+4 Asp via glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) as part of the malate-aspartate shuttle. Furthermore, the decarboxylation of malate by malic enzyme produces pyruvate and also NADPH. A previous study revealed high malic enzyme activity in the retina and suggested it is capable of producing NADPH in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Winkler et al., 1986</xref>). The observation that malate was reduced (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>) and the NADP<sup>+</sup>/NADPH ratio was increased (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>) in the cKO retina further supports a metabolic pathway in PRs where the Gln carbon skeleton is converted into Asp, then OAA, malate, and finally, pyruvate via the cytosolic enzymes of the malate-aspartate shuttle and malic enzyme. This non-canonical Gln metabolism pathway is also necessary to sustain cancer cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Son et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, we did not observe any significant changes in glycolysis or mitochondrial function in the cKO retina despite a reduction in the relative level of Asp. It is hypothesized that Asp catabolism sustains glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in the retina by recycling NADH to NAD<sup>+</sup> and shuttling electrons into the mitochondria via the malate-aspartate shuttle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Li et al., 2020</xref>). However, in the GLS cKO retina, the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio (<italic>P</italic> = 0.125) and its oft-used proxy, the pyruvate/lactate ratio (<italic>P</italic> = 0.192), were not statistically significantly altered. Compensatory metabolic rewiring, which has been seen in other conditional knockout mouse models using the same Cre-recombinase system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Subramanya et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wubben et al., 2017</xref>), may be maintaining the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio in the cKO retina at P14 when there are equal numbers of PRs in the WT and cKO retina. To this end, the expression of the <italic>Mdh1</italic> gene, which is a component of the malate-aspartate shuttle that recycles NADH to NAD<sup>+</sup> in the cytoplasm, was upregulated in the cKO retina (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1</xref>). The conversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) to glycerol 3-phosphate via glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase is an alternative pathway to regenerate NAD<sup>+</sup>. DHAP levels were significantly reduced in the cKO retina possibly suggesting increased activity of this pathway (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Yet, the gene expression and activity of glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase in the retina has been shown to be low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adler &amp; Klucznik, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Voigt et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Asp is also the immediate precursor to Asn. Intracellular levels of Asn are the lowest among the NEAAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), so it was not surprising that Asn was below the level of confident detection in our targeted metabolomics analyses on the WT or cKO retina. Asn had been shown to rescue cancer cells from ISR-induced apoptosis, increase protein synthesis during Gln deprivation, and protect the Asp pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Halbrook et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Pavlova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). As metabolic similarities exist between PRs and cancer cells (Du, Cleghorn, Contreras, Linton, et al., 2013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ng et al., 2015</xref>), and the <italic>Gls</italic> cKO mouse retina demonstrated ISR activation and apoptosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1G</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1I</xref> and 6C-6D), decreased protein synthesis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>), and decreased Asp (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), Asn supplementation was explored and proved effective as observed in the rescue of PR degeneration in the cKO mouse (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>). These results offer the first evidence for a role of Asn downstream of Gln metabolism in PR survival, but further studies are necessary to define which of the Asn-mediated processes is crucial for PR neuroprotection following targeted <italic>Gls</italic> knockout. Of note, while Asn supplementation provided a greater PR neuroprotective effect than α-KG, the two supplements had different routes of administration with Asn being provided intraperitoneally as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Xu et al., 2021</xref>) and α-KG being provided in the drinking water as had previously improved PR survival in a mouse model of inherited retinal disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wert et al., 2020</xref>). It is unclear if supplementing α-KG to GLS cKO animals intraperitoneally would further boost retinal protection. Yet, the relative abundance of α-KG and most other TCA cycle intermediates were unchanged between WT and cKO retinas suggesting Gln may not be driving the TCA cycle in PRs.</p>
<p>The ISR is activated with reduced global protein synthesis in the <italic>Gls</italic> cKO mouse retina (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6C</xref>-<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>) and inhibiting the ISR with ISRIB delayed PR degeneration (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). ISR activation is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases including retinal degenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gorbatyuk et al., 2020</xref>). Chronic activation of the ISR and protein synthesis attenuation has been observed in a multitude of preclinical models of retinal degeneration and shown to contribute to PR degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gorbatyuk et al., 2020</xref>). Metabolic dysfunction and deprivation of key nutrients, such as glucose and amino acids, are not only known stressors that activate the ISR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>), but also underlying mechanisms of PR degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ait-Ali et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Caruso et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pan et al., 2021</xref>). There is a paucity of studies that examine the link between metabolism and the ISR in retinal degenerative disease, which is a critical gap in our knowledge since identification of molecular and metabolic pathways triggering PR death is likely to reveal novel targets for therapeutic intervention. A recent study demonstrated that imbalanced pro-apoptotic ISR signaling contributes to deoxysphingolipid-mediated toxicity in retinal disease and identified potential therapeutic strategies, such as pharmacologic enhancement of ATF6 activity or treatment with ATF6-regulated neurotrophic factor MANF, that attenuate the associated retinal degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rosarda et al., 2023</xref>). The novel transgenic mouse model of retinal degeneration described here provides a unique tool to obtain further insight on the nexus of metabolism, ISR activation, and protein synthesis attenuation in PR degeneration to identify pharmacologically and metabolically tractable nodes for therapeutic intervention.</p>
<p>Collectively, our results indicate that Gln is critical for maintaining the pools of key biosynthetic precursors, Glu and Asp, in rod PRs and disrupting Gln catabolism results in profound loss of PR function and survival in part secondary to an imbalance in ISR activation and protein synthesis attenuation. Glucose remains central in PR metabolism, but improving our understanding of other metabolic pathways that support PR function and survival and how these metabolic pathways connect with cell death mechanisms could be transformative for preventing PR degeneration and vision loss in a multitude of retinal degenerative diseases.</p>

<title>Ideas and Speculation</title>
<p>Beyond glucose, the metabolic pathways integral to photoreceptor health remain largely unknown. This is a critical knowledge gap as identification of these pathways is likely to reveal new strategies for therapeutic intervention. This work demonstrates that rod photoreceptors depend on glutamine catabolism and suggests a metabolic axis where glutamine catabolism in rod photoreceptors supports the production of aspartate and asparagine to promote anabolism and prevent signaling through the pro-apoptotic integrated stress response pathway. Considering activation of the integrated stress response is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic dysfunction underlies photoreceptor degeneration, defining the pathways by which glutamine catabolism contributes to photoreceptor health is likely to identify nodes that may be targeted to make photoreceptors less vulnerable to stress.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>All animals were treated in accordance with the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. The protocol was approved by the University Committee on Use and Care of Animals of the University of Michigan (PRO00011133). All animals were housed under standard husbandry conditions at room temperature in 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycles unless explicitly stated in the text. Both male and female mice were used for all experiments. A transgenic mouse where <italic>Gls</italic> is selectively deleted from rod photoreceptors was created by crossing mice with Lox-P sites flanking exon 1 of the <italic>Gls</italic> gene (<italic>Gls<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>, courtesy of Dr. Stephen Rayport, Columbia University) with Rho-Cre mice, in which Cre-recombinase expression is driven specifically in rod PRs. <italic>Gls<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and Rho-Cre mice have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Le et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mingote et al., 2015</xref>). Animals were screened for the <italic>rd8</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mattapallil et al., 2012</xref>). Alpha-ketoglutarate (α-KG, Millipore-Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA, Cat # K1128) was provided to mice in their drinking water (10 mg/mL) starting at P4. Asparagine (200 mg/kg, Millipore-Sigma, Cat # A4159) or vehicle (PBS) was injected IP starting at P5.

The Cre-recombinase was activated via IP injection of tamoxifen (Millipore-Sigma, Cat # T5648) at a concentration of 100 mg/kg bodyweight for 5 consecutive days. Whole retinas were extracted from animals using the “cut-and-pick” method as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Winkler, 1981</xref>), being careful to remove any adherent ciliary body or RPE before processing. Total retina was then either snap frozen on dry ice (Western blotting, metabolomics), immersed in RNAlater (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany, Cat # 76104) for qRT-PCR, or used immediately (BaroFuse or NADP<sup>+</sup>/NADPH bioluminescent assay).</p>

<title>Quantitative real-time PCR</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted from whole retina using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Cat # 74104) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Isolated RNA was assayed for quantity and quality with a Nanodrop 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1 µg of RNA was used as input for cDNA synthesis using the RNA QuantiTect transcription kit (Qiagen, Cat # 205311). Approximately 100 ng of cDNA was used as a template for each qRT-PCR reaction using the PowerTrack SYBR Green supermix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat # 46109) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Subramanya et al., 2023</xref>). The Ct values for <italic>Actb</italic> were used to determine relative transcript expression levels using the 2<sup>-ΔΔCt</sup> method with a cycle threshold cutoff of 35 cycles for the presence of transcript.

<title>Metabolomics</title>
<p>For unlabeled targeted metabolomics, both retinas from a single animal were rinsed in PBS, combined, and snap-frozen on dry ice. Metabolites were extracted using 80% methanol at -80°C and an OMNI Bead Ruptor (OMNI International, Kennesaw, GA, USA, Cat # 19-050A). Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 x RCF for 10 minutes at 4°C, and the supernatant stored at -80°C until being processed in the SpeedVac. The pellet from each sample was saved for protein estimation. To determine the protein concentration for each sample, 150 µL of 0.1 M NaOH was added to the pellet for 24 hours at 37°C. The sample was then vortexed and centrifuged at 5000 x RCF at room temperature. The protein estimation was performed as described above. The protein concentration of each sample was used to normalize amount of sample for lyophilization with a SpeedVac concentrator (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat # 13875355). Dried metabolite pellets were resuspended for liquid chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis using an Agilent Technologies Triple Quad 6470 instrument (Santa Clara, CA, USA) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wubben et al., 2020</xref>). Previously published parameters were used for data collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Yuan et al., 2012</xref>). Agilent MassHunter Workstation Quantitative Analysis Software (B0900) was used to process raw data. Additional statistical analyses were performed in Microsoft Excel. Each sample was normalized by the total intensity of all metabolites to reflect sample protein content. To obtain relative metabolites, each metabolite abundance level in each sample was divided by the mean of the abundance levels across all control samples.</p>
<p>To analyze the incorporation of non-radioactive stable isotope carbon-13 (<sup>13</sup>C) into metabolites in central carbon metabolism and related pathways, mice were intraperitoneally injected with 2g/kg of uniformly labeled <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Cat # CLM-1396) or 300 mg/kg of uniformly labeled <sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>-glutamine (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Cat # CLM-1822-H) and retinas were harvested 45 minutes later and snap-frozen as described above.

<p>Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was determine as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kamat et al., 2023</xref>). Briefly, a BaroFuse (Entox Sciences, Mercer Island, WA) was used to determine the OCR of freshly isolated retinas. Single, whole retinas were dissected into Hank’s Balanced salt solution supplemented with 0.1 g/ 100 mL BSA (HBSS, Cytiva, Marlborough, MA, USA, Cat # SH30031FS). Perifusion media consisted of commercial Krebs-Ringer Bicarbonate buffer (KRB, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat # J67795.K2) supplemented with 0.1g /100 mL fatty-acid free BSA (Millipore-Sigma, Cat # A9647) and 4.4 mM glucose, for a final concentration of 5.5 mM glucose (Millipore-Sigma, Cat # G8270). The oxygen and CO<sub>2</sub> concentration of the perifusion media is maintained by saturating the solution in a 21% oxygen, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere, and the temperature was maintained at 37°C throughout the experiment. At various times throughout the experiment Oligomycin-A (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, Cat # 11342), FCCP (Trifluoromethoxy carbonylcyanide phenylhydrazone, Cayman Chemical, Cat# 15218), and KCN (Potassium Cyanide, Thermo Fisher, Cat # 012136) were added to the perifusion media through an injection port.

Briefly, two fresh retina per mouse were harvested for each sample in 150 µL of PBS/Bicarbonate/0.5%dodecyltrimethylammonimum bromide (DTAB) buffer. DTAB is used in the buffer to preserve dinucleotide stability. The samples were sonicated (20% strength and 1sec/10 iterations) to create a uniform suspension and diluted with 150 µL of PBS/Bicarbonate/0.5% DTAB buffer (lysate). For measuring NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADP<sup>+</sup>, 150 µL of lysate was mixed with 75 µL of 0.4N HCl (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat # A144) and heated to 60°C for 15 minutes. The lysate mixture was cooled to room temperature for 10 min and then neutralized by adding 150 µL 0.5M Trizma base (Millipore-Sigma, Cat # T1503). For measuring NADH/NADPH, the remaining 150 µL of lysate was heated to 60°C for 15 minutes, cooled to room temperature for 10 min and 150 µL 0.5M Trizma base was added to the sample. Following lysate preparation, 50 µL of lysate was incubated at room temperature for 30 min with 50 µL of either the NAD+/NADP+-Glo or NADH/NAPDH-Glo detection reagent in a 96-well white walled tissue culture plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat # 3610).

<p>Goswami and colleagues used rod-specific Gls1 (the gene encoding glutaminase 1) knockout mice to investigate the role of GLS1 in photoreceptor health when GLS1 was deleted from developing or adult photoreceptor cells. This study is <bold>important</bold> as it shows the critical role of glutamine catabolism in photoreceptor cell health using in vivo model systems. The evidence supporting the authors' claims is <bold>convincing</bold>. The current manuscript would further benefit from validating the evidence with additional supporting data from IND-cKO with tamoxifen induction at adult age, testing GLS1 activity to provide glutamate for synaptic transmission, and examining metabolic crosstalk between RPE and neural retinas.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors show for the first time that deleting GLS from rod photoreceptors results in the rapid death of these cells. The death of photoreceptor cells could result from loss of synaptic activity because of a decrease in glutamate, as has been shown in neurons, changes in redox balance, or nutrient deprivation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strength of this manuscript is that the author shows a similar phenotype in the mice when Gls was knocked out early in rod development or the adult rod. They showed that rapid cell death is through apoptosis, and there is an increase in the expression of genes responsive to oxidative stress.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors show a &quot;metabolic dependency of photoreceptors on glutamine catabolism in vivo&quot;. However, there is a potential bias in their thinking that glutamine metabolism in rods is similar to cancer cells where it feeds into the TCA cycle. They should consider that as in neurons, GLS1 activity provides glutamate for synaptic transmission. The modest rescue shown by providing α-ketoglutarate in the drinking water suggests that glutamine isn't a key metabolic substrate for rods when glucose is plentiful. The ERG studies performed on the iCre-Glsflox/flox mice showed a large decrease in the scotopic b wave at saturating flashes which could indicate a decrease in glutamate at the rod synapse as stated by the authors. While EM micrographs of wt and iCre-Glsflox/flox mice were shown for the outer retina at p14, the synapse of the rods needs to be examined by EM.</p>
<p>The authors note that the outer segments are shorter but they do not address whether there is a decrease in the number of cones.</p>
<p>Rod-specific Gls ko mice with an inducible promoter were generated by crossing the Pde6g-CreERT2 and homozygous for either the WT or floxed Gls allele (IND-cKO). In Figure 3 the authors document that by western blots and antibody labeling the GLS1 expression is lost in the IND-cKO 10 days post tamoxifen. OCT images show a decrease in the thickness of the outer nuclear layer between 17 and 38 days post-TAM. Ergs should be performed on the animals at 10 and 30 days post TAM, before and after major structural changes in rod photoreceptor cells, to determine if changes in light-stimulated responses are observed. These studies could help to parse out the cause of photoreceptor cell death.</p>
<p>The studies in Figure 4 were all performed on iCre-Glsflox/flox and control mice at p14, why weren't the IND-cKO mice used for these studies since the findings would not be confounded by development?</p>
<p>In all rescue studies, the endpoint was an ONL thickness, which only addressed rod cell death. The authors should also determine whether there are small improvements in the ERG, which would distinguish the role of GLS in preventing oxidative stress.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Photoreceptor neurons are crucial for vision, and discovering pathways necessary for photoreceptor health and survival can open new avenues for therapeutics. Studies have shown that metabolic dysfunction can cause photoreceptor degeneration and vision loss, but the metabolic pathways maintaining photoreceptor health are not well understood. This is a fundamental study that shows that glutamine catabolism is critical for photoreceptor cell health using in vivo model systems.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The data are compelling, and the consideration of potential confounding factors (such as glutaminase 2 expression) and additional experiments to examine the synaptic connectivity and inner retina added strength to this work. The authors were also careful not to overstate their claims, but to provide solid conclusions that fit the results and data provided in their study. The findings linking asparagine supplementation and the inhibition of the integrated stress response to glutamine catabolism within the rod photoreceptor cell are intriguing and innovative. Overall, the authors provide convincing data to highlight that photoreceptors utilize various fuel sources to meet their metabolic needs, and that glutamine is critical to these cells for their biomass, redox balance, function, and survival.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Recent studies have explored the metabolic &quot;crosstalk&quot; that exists within the mammalian retina, where metabolites are transferred between the various retinal cells and the retinal pigment epithelium. It would be of interest to test whether the conditional knockout mice have changes in metabolism (via qPCR such as shown in Figure 4 - Supplemental Figure 1) within the retinal pigment epithelium that may be contributing to the authors' findings in the neural retina. Additionally, the authors have very compelling data to show that inhibition of eIF2a or supplementation with asparagine can delay photoreceptor death via OCT measurements in their conditional knockout mouse model (Figure 6G, H). However, does inhibition of eIF2a or asparagine adversely impact the WT retina? It would also be impactful to know whether this has a prolonged effect, or if it is short-term, as this would provide strength to potential therapeutic targeting of these pathways to maintain photoreceptor health.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors explored the role of GLS, a glutaminase, which is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of glutamine to glutamate, in rod photoreceptor function and survival. The loss of GLS was found to cause rapid autonomous death of rod photoreceptors.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Interesting and novel phenotype. Two types of cre-lines were rigorously used to knockout the Gls gene in rods. Both of the conditional knockouts led to a similar phenotype, i.e. rod death. Histology and ERG were carefully done to characterize the loss of rods over specific ages. A necessary metabolomic study was performed and appreciated. Some rescue experiments were performed and revealed possible mechanisms.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>No major weaknesses were identified. The mechanism of GLS-loss-induced rod death seems not fully elucidated by this study but could be followed up in the future, and the same for GLS's role in cones.</p>

<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors show for the first time that deleting GLS from rod photoreceptors results in the rapid death of these cells. The death of photoreceptor cells could result from loss of synaptic activity because of a decrease in glutamate, as has been shown in neurons, changes in redox balance, or nutrient deprivation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strength of this manuscript is that the author shows a similar phenotype in the mice when Gls was knocked out early in rod development or the adult rod. They showed that rapid cell death is through apoptosis, and there is an increase in the expression of genes responsive to oxidative stress.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their time reviewing the manuscript and their comments regarding the potential mechanism(s) by which rod photoreceptors rapidly degenerate upon knockout of GLS.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors show a &quot;metabolic dependency of photoreceptors on glutamine catabolism in vivo&quot;. However, there is a potential bias in their thinking that glutamine metabolism in rods is similar to cancer cells where it feeds into the TCA cycle. They should consider that as in neurons, GLS1 activity provides glutamate for synaptic transmission. The modest rescue shown by providing α-ketoglutarate in the drinking water suggests that glutamine isn't a key metabolic substrate for rods when glucose is plentiful. The ERG studies performed on the iCre-Glsflox/flox mice showed a large decrease in the scotopic b wave at saturating flashes which could indicate a decrease in glutamate at the rod synapse as stated by the authors. While EM micrographs of wt and iCre-Glsflox/flox mice were shown for the outer retina at p14, the synapse of the rods needs to be examined by EM.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that in the presence of sufficient glucose, it appears a lack of GLS-driven glutamine (Gln) catabolism does not drastically alter the levels of TCA cycle metabolites or mitochondrial function as we demonstrated in Figure 4, and supplementation with alpha-ketoglutarate improved outer nuclear layer thickness by only a small amount as observed in Figure 5e. Hence, as we stated in the Results and Discussion, at least in the mouse where <italic>Gls</italic> is selectively deleted from rod photoreceptors by crossing <italic>Glsfl/fl</italic> mice with Rho-Cre mice (<italic>Glsfl/fl; Rho-Cre+,</italic> cKO), Gln’s role in supporting the TCA cycle is not the major mechanism by which rod photoreceptors utilize Gln to suppress apoptosis.</p>
<p>With regards to GLS-driven Gln catabolism providing glutamate (Glu) for synaptic transmission, we again agree with the reviewer that Glu is an important excitatory neurotransmitter, but it is also a key metabolite necessary for the synthesis of glutathione, amino acids, and proteins. As noted and discussed at length in the manuscript, a lack of GLS-driven Gln catabolism in rod photoreceptors leads to reduced levels of oxidized glutathione (Figure 4D) possibly signaling an overall reduction in the biosynthesis of glutathione as Glu is directly and indirectly responsible for its synthesis. Furthermore, Gln and GLS-derived Glu play a central role in the biosynthesis of several nonessential amino acids and proteins. To this end, we see a reduction in the level of Glu, which is the product of the GLS reaction and further confirms the loss of GLS function. We also noted a significant decrease in aspartate (Asp), which can be constructed from the carbons and nitrogens of Gln as discussed at length in the manuscript (Figure 6A). Finally, we noted a significant decrease in global protein synthesis in the cKO retina as compared to the wild-type animal as well (Figure 6E). Therefore, the data suggest that GLS-driven Gln catabolism is critical for amino acid metabolism and protein synthesis and to some degree redox balance; although, the small but statistically significant changes in oxidized glutathione, NADP/NADPH, and redox gene expression may not fully account for the rapid and complete photoreceptor degeneration observed. Future studies are necessary to shed light on the role of redox imbalance in this novel transgenic mouse model.</p>
<p>Glu also plays a role in synaptic transmission, and we considered this scenario as described in Figure 1 – figure supplement 5. Here, the synaptic connectivity between photoreceptors and the inner retina did not demonstrate significant differences in the labeling of photoreceptor synaptic membranes in the outer plexiform layer nor alterations in the labeling of a key protein (Bassoon) in ribbon synapses. These data suggest that the synaptic connectivity between photoreceptors and second-order neurons was unaltered at P14 in the cKO retina, which is the time just prior to rapid photoreceptor degeneration. We agree, though, that to obtain greater insight into the alterations in the ribbon synapse, EM images can be examined. The EM images shown in Figure 1 – figure supplement 4 are from P21 and will be utilized to assess the ribbon synapse for the revised version of the article.</p>
<p>With regards to the ERG changes noted in Figure 2, we agree with the reviewer that a large decrease was noted in the scotopic b-wave at P21 and P42 in the cKO. However, an even larger reduction in the scotopic a-wave was noted at these ages as well. In animal models that disrupt photoreceptor synaptic function (Dick et al. Neuron. 2003; Johnson et al. J Neuroscience. 2007; Haeseleer et al. Nature Neuroscience. 2004; Chang et al. Vis Neurosci. 2006), a more negative ERG pattern is typically observed with the b-wave altered to a much larger degree than the a-wave. Additionally, in these models that disrupt photoreceptor synaptic transmission, the overall structure of the retina with respect to thickness is maintained (Dick et al. Neuron. 2003) or noted to have modest changes in the outer plexiform layer within the first two months of age with the outer nuclear layer not significantly altered until 8-10 months of age (Haeseleer et al. Nature Neuroscience. 2004). In contrast, a rapid decline in the outer nuclear layer thickness was observed in the cKO retina after P14 likely contributing to the ERG changes noted in Figure 2.  Also, Gln is catabolized to Glu primarily by GLS as suggested by the approximately 50% reduction in Glu levels in the cKO retina (Figure 6A), but other enzymes are also capable of catabolizing Gln to Glu, so Glu levels in the rod photoreceptors are unlikely to be zero. Coupling this with the fact that rods are equipped with a self-sufficient Glu recollecting system at their synaptic terminals (Hasegawa et al. Neuron. 2006; Winkler et al. Vis Neurosci. 1999) and that GLS activity is at least two-fold higher in the photoreceptor inner segments, which support energy production and metabolism, than any other layer in the retina (Ross et al. Brain Res. 1987) suggests that altered synaptic transmission secondary to reduced levels of Glu likely does not account in full for the rapid and robust photoreceptor degeneration observed in the cKO retina.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors note that the outer segments are shorter but they do not address whether there is a decrease in the number of cones.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The number of cones will be assessed and provided in the revised version of the article.</p>

<p>Rod-specific Gls ko mice with an inducible promoter were generated by crossing the Pde6g-CreERT2 and homozygous for either the WT or floxed Gls allele (IND-cKO). In Figure 3 the authors document that by western blots and antibody labeling the GLS1 expression is lost in the IND-cKO 10 days post tamoxifen. OCT images show a decrease in the thickness of the outer nuclear layer between 17 and 38 days post-TAM. Ergs should be performed on the animals at 10 and 30 days post TAM, before and after major structural changes in rod photoreceptor cells, to determine if changes in light-stimulated responses are observed. These studies could help to parse out the cause of photoreceptor cell death.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that the IND-cKO is a useful tool to help parse out the cause of photoreceptor cell death in this model as well as shed light on the role of GLS-driven Gln catabolism in photoreceptor synaptic transmission as discussed at length above. Hence, ERG analyses will be provided for these animals in the revised version of the article.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The studies in Figure 4 were all performed on iCre-Glsflox/flox and control mice at p14, why weren't the IND-cKO mice used for these studies since the findings would not be confounded by development?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To gain further insight into the role of GLS-driven Gln catabolism in the maintenance of rod photoreceptors as compared to their development/maturation, we will provide ERG and targeted metabolomic analyses of the IND-cKO retina in the revised version of the article.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In all rescue studies, the endpoint was an ONL thickness, which only addressed rod cell death. The authors should also determine whether there are small improvements in the ERG, which would distinguish the role of GLS in preventing oxidative stress.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Optical coherence tomography (OCT) provides a sensitive in vivo method to detect small changes in retinal thickness without potential artifacts incurred through histological processing. Considering the <italic>Gls</italic> cKO retina demonstrates significant and rapid photoreceptor degeneration, we wanted to assess pathways that may be critical to photoreceptor survival downstream of GLS-driven Gln catabolism using rescue experiments with pharmacologic treatment or metabolite supplementation. That said, disruption of GLS-driven Gln catabolism may also significantly alter rod photoreceptor function beyond that which is secondary to photoreceptor cell death. As such, changes in ERG will be examined and provided in the revised version of the article for certain rescue experiments that demonstrated a robust change in ONL thickness.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Photoreceptor neurons are crucial for vision, and discovering pathways necessary for photoreceptor health and survival can open new avenues for therapeutics. Studies have shown that metabolic dysfunction can cause photoreceptor degeneration and vision loss, but the metabolic pathways maintaining photoreceptor health are not well understood. This is a fundamental study that shows that glutamine catabolism is critical for photoreceptor cell health using in vivo model systems.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The data are compelling, and the consideration of potential confounding factors (such as glutaminase 2 expression) and additional experiments to examine the synaptic connectivity and inner retina added strength to this work. The authors were also careful not to overstate their claims, but to provide solid conclusions that fit the results and data provided in their study. The findings linking asparagine supplementation and the inhibition of the integrated stress response to glutamine catabolism within the rod photoreceptor cell are intriguing and innovative. Overall, the authors provide convincing data to highlight that photoreceptors utilize various fuel sources to meet their metabolic needs, and that glutamine is critical to these cells for their biomass, redox balance, function, and survival.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate the reviewer’s thoughtful comments and time spent reviewing this manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Recent studies have explored the metabolic &quot;crosstalk&quot; that exists within the mammalian retina, where metabolites are transferred between the various retinal cells and the retinal pigment epithelium. It would be of interest to test whether the conditional knockout mice have changes in metabolism (via qPCR such as shown in Figure 4 - Supplemental Figure 1) within the retinal pigment epithelium that may be contributing to the authors' findings in the neural retina. Additionally, the authors have very compelling data to show that inhibition of eIF2a or supplementation with asparagine can delay photoreceptor death via OCT measurements in their conditional knockout mouse model (Figure 6G, H). However, does inhibition of eIF2a or asparagine adversely impact the WT retina? It would also be impactful to know whether this has a prolonged effect, or if it is short-term, as this would provide strength to potential therapeutic targeting of these pathways to maintain photoreceptor health.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that metabolic communication in the outer retina is crucial to the function and survival of both photoreceptors and RPE. We will perform qRT-PCR on the eyecups of these mice to assess any changes in the expression of metabolic genes. This data will be provided in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>We have data demonstrating systemic treatment with ISRIB does not adversely impact the anatomy of the wild-type retina; this data will be included in the revised manuscript as a supplement to Figure 6. Additionally, we have recent data to suggest that the effect of ISRIB extends beyond P21 in the cKO mouse. This data will be included in the revised manuscript.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that the downstream metabolic and molecular mechanisms by which Gln catabolism impacts rod photoreceptor health are not fully elucidated. Defining these mechanisms will advance our understanding of photoreceptor metabolism and identify therapeutic targets promoting photoreceptor resistance to stress. Future studies are underway to uncover these mechanisms. Additionally, while outside the scope of the current manuscript, we have generated mice lacking GLS in cone photoreceptors specifically and are currently elucidating the role of GLS in cone photoreceptor metabolism, function, and survival. These results will be published in a separate manuscript.</p>
