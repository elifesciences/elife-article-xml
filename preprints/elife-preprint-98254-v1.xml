<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Encoding of several sensory modalities into neural signals is mediated by ribbon synapses. The synaptic ribbon tethers synaptic vesicles at the presynaptic active zone (AZ) and might act as a super-scaffold organizing AZ topography. Here we employed a synthetic biology approach to reconstitute ribbon-type AZs in HEK293 cells for probing their minimal molecular requirements and studying presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clustering. Co-expressing a membrane-targeted version of the AZ-protein Bassoon and the ribbon core protein RIBEYE, we observed structures recapitulating basic aspects of ribbon-type AZs, which we call <italic>synthetic</italic> ribbons or <italic>SyRibbons</italic>. <italic>SyRibbons</italic> with Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clusters formed upon additional expression of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and RIM-binding protein 2 (RBP2), known to promote presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clustering. Confocal and super-resolution microscopy along with functional analysis by patch-clamp and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-imaging revealed striking similarities and interesting differences of <italic>SyRibbons</italic> in comparison to native IHC ribbon-type AZs. In summary, we identify Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, RBP, membrane-anchored Bassoon, and RIBEYE as minimal components for reconstituting a basic ribbon-type AZ. <italic>SyRibbons</italic> might complement animal studies on molecular interactions of AZ proteins.</p>

<title>Significance Statement</title>
<p>Encoding of sensory information in our eyes and ears builds on specialized ribbon synapses of sensory cells. Elucidating the molecular underpinning of their fascinating structure and function is an ongoing effort to which we add a bottom-up reconstitution approach in cultured cells. Aiming to recapitulate basic properties of ribbon-type presynaptic active zones of cochlear inner hair cells, we identified a minimal set of proteins that assemble in cellular nanodomains, structurally and functionally alike active zones. While not yet reconstituting synaptic vesicle exocytosis, we consider the established synthetic ribbon-type active zones a valuable platform for studying molecular interactions of active zone proteins. We expect the approach to complement, refine, and reduce experiments on native ribbon synapses asserted from animals.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Synapses of sensory receptor cells of the inner ear and the retina are hallmarked by the presence of an electron-dense structure called the synaptic ribbon, which tethers synaptic vesicles (SVs) at the presynaptic active zone (AZ, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Moser <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Matthews &amp; Fuchs, 2010</xref>]). Proposed functional roles of the ribbon include (i) its role as a SV replenishment machine for tireless neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bunt, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Holt <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Khimich <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Frank <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Snellman <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Graydon <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Vaithianathan <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>), (ii) “super-scaffold” regulating the abundance, topography, and function of AZ players such Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and release sites and their tight coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Khimich <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Frank <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wong <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Maxeiner <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jean <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Grabner &amp; Moser, 2021</xref>), and iii) coordination of SV release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Heidelberger <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Glowatzki &amp; Fuchs, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Singer <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Edmonds, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Mehta <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). Yet, our molecular understanding of how these postulated functions are executed by synaptic ribbons is still limited.</p>
<p>Likewise, the clustering of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at the AZ, how it is varied among different or even the same synapse types and how the ribbon contributes towards this, remain active areas of research. For example, ribbon synapses of mature inner hair cells (IHC) assemble Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at the base of the ribbon, but vary in shape, size and channel complement (20-330) of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Frank <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wong <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Neef <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>) partially dependent on the position within the IHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Ohn <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Özçete &amp; Moser, 2021</xref>). IHC synapses lacking AZ-anchored ribbons in Bassoon mutant mice showed fewer Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels with altered topography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Frank <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Neef <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). While genetic disruption of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel-tethering AZ proteins RIM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jung <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>) and RBP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Krinner <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>) reduced the abundance of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at IHC synapses, their topography retained the typical stripe-like shape of Ca<sup>2+</sup> clusters. Constitutive deletion of RIBEYE, the core scaffold protein of the synaptic ribbon, provided, so far, the most direct test of the scaffolding role of the ribbon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Maxeiner <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jean <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Becker <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Grabner &amp; Moser, 2021</xref>). Here, ribbon-less synapses of IHCs showed an altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel topography with a more spatially widespread presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal but intact Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel complement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jean <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). Moreover, the voltage-dependence of activation as well as the inactivation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels appeared to be altered, suggesting a possible role of the synaptic ribbon in also regulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jean <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). Changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel physiology upon deletion of RIBEYE were also found for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.4 at ribbon-less rod photoreceptor AZs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Grabner &amp; Moser, 2021</xref>). Finally, IHCs lacking piccolino, a ribbon-synapse specific isoform of the AZ protein piccolo, show AZs with smaller synaptic ribbons and altered clustering yet normal complement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Michanski <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>So how does the synaptic ribbon tune into the orchestra of AZ proteins that collectively organize Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel abundance, topography, and function? To what extent can the effects observed upon disruption of Bassoon be attributed to the concomitant loss of the ribbon? These questions seem even more relevant given that, so far to our knowledge, no direct interactions between Bassoon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Frank <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>) or RIBEYE and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel have been described. Here, we adopted a bottom-up synthetic biology approach to assemble a minimal presynaptic protein machinery required to bring together RIBEYE and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in a heterologous expression system to assess the role of the synaptic ribbon in regulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clustering and physiology. Similar approaches have previously been employed for reconstituting aspects of conventional synapses, for instance in “hemisynapses” between co-cultured neurons and non-neuronal cells overexpressing presynaptic or postsynaptic components (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Craig <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). More recently, Munc13-1 supra-molecular assemblies which recruit release machinery proteins were reconstituted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sakamoto <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Expression of RIBEYE in synapse-naïve cell lines such as COS-7 cells led to large cytosolic assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Schmitz <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). Membrane-proximal RIBEYE clusters and ribbon-like electron dense structures with vesicles could be found in a retinal progenitor cell-line (R28, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Magupalli <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>]) yet, these cells might not be considered synapse-naïve. Regardless, the presence and function of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at synthetic ribbon synapses have not yet been studied. The need for co-expressing at least three Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel subunits (Ca<sub>V</sub>α<sub>x</sub>, Ca<sub>V</sub>β<sub>x</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>α<sub>2</sub>δ<sub>x</sub>) in synapse-naïve cell lines renders acute co-expression of AZ multidomain proteins cumbersome. Here we took advantage of synapse-naïve Human Embryonic Kidney 293 (HEK293) cells stably expressing inducible Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3α<sub>1</sub>, which is the predominant subtype of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at IHC ribbon synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brandt <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Platzer <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dou <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>), as well as constitutively expressed Ca<sub>V</sub>β<sub>3</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>α<sub>2</sub>δ<sub>1</sub>. We co-expressed RIBEYE along with membrane targeted Bassoon and observed structures with striking resemblance to IHC synaptic ribbon-type AZs. We characterized the structure and function of these synthetic ribbon-type AZs and identified Bassoon, RBP2, RIBEYE and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels as the minimal components required for assembling a basic ribbon-type AZ. We observed that synthetic ribbons recruit Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels in large clusters and show localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx upon stimulation. Our results support the role of synaptic ribbons in promoting Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channel clustering. Synthetic ribbon-type AZs offer a novel approach for functionally studying protein-protein interaction and will likely complement, refine and reduce experiments on native ribbon synapses.</p>

<title>Membrane-targeted Bassoon recruits RIBEYE to the cell membrane in HEK293 cells where structures alike inner hair cell synaptic ribbons are formed</title>
<p>Human epithelial HEK293 cells have the advantage of not expressing the synaptic machinery components studied here. This provides a clean background for reconstituting synthetic synapses from a minimal set of synaptic proteins. Our first step towards assembling a ribbon-type AZ in a heterologous expression system was to express RIBEYE, the core scaffold protein of the synaptic ribbon, and target it to the cell membrane. We performed transient transfection of a RIBEYE construct with a C-terminal EGFP tag in HEK293 cells and observed large spherical clusters of RIBEYE that appeared largely cytosolic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1Aii</xref>), in contrast to a diffuse cytosolic distribution when merely expressing EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1Ai</xref>). These RIBEYE clusters form due to self-assembling properties of RIBEYE via multiple sites of homophilic interaction as have been demonstrated before in several cell lines. They do not colocalize with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, or lysosomes and hence, are unlikely to reflect RIBEYE entrapped in protein trafficking pathways or to represent degradation products of overexpressed RIBEYE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figEv1">Fig EV1 A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figEv1">B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figEv1">C</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, for membrane targeting of these cytosolic RIBEYE clusters, we co-expressed Bassoon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1Aiii</xref>). Prior work on the molecular underpinnings of ribbon synapses had identified the multidomain cytomatrix of the active zone protein Bassoon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">tom Dieck <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>) to critically contribute to anchoring the synaptic ribbon to the AZ membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Khimich <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dick <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">tom Dieck <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Co-expression of full-length Bassoon along with RIBEYE in HEK293 cells showed colocalizing clusters of the two proteins that, however, remained largely cytosolic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1Aiv</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, for plasma membrane-targeting of Bassoon, we generated a construct by removing the first 95 N-terminal amino acids of Bassoon and replacing these with a palmitoylation consensus sequence of the neuronal Growth Associated Protein 43 (GAP43). We refer to this as palm-Bassoon throughout, and we used constructs with and without a C-terminal EGFP tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1B</xref>). Expression of either of these palm-Bassoon constructs in HEK293 cells showed comparable immunofluorescence patterns with Bassoon puncta spread across the periphery of the cell, largely colocalizing with the endogenously expressed membrane protein Na, K-ATPase α<sub>1</sub> (data representative of 3 transfections, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">D</xref>). Comparing the ratio of Bassoon signal intensity at the periphery <italic>versus</italic> inside of the cell in randomly selected single sections from confocal stacks of palm-Bassoon and Bassoon transfected cells (N = 10 cells, 3 transfections per group, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1E</xref>) demonstrated a higher Bassoon signal intensity at the periphery of cells expressing the palm-Bassoon construct (<italic>****P</italic> &lt; 0.0001, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test), implying successful plasma membrane targeting of Bassoon.</p>
<p>Next, we co-expressed palm-Bassoon and RIBEYE in HEK293 cells and observed colocalizing RIBEYE and Bassoon immunofluorescent puncta at the periphery of cells (7 transfections; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 2Ai</xref>). Closer inspection of these immunofluorescent puncta with STimulated Emission Depletion (STED) nanoscopy (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 2Aii</xref>) revealed discrete structures typically consisting of ellipsoidal RIBEYE clusters juxtaposing on top of plate-like palm-Bassoon structures which seemingly anchor the RIBEYE clusters to the plasma membrane. Interestingly, we found the morphology of the RIBEYE + palm-Bassoon structures to be strikingly reminiscent of the arrangement of the two proteins in IHC ribbon synapses, where an ellipsoid/spherical synaptic ribbon composed of RIBEYE is found seated on a Bassoon plate that anchors it to the presynaptic AZ membrane (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wong <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Michanski <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">2023</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>, i and ii; data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Michanski <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>).</p>

<p>We compared the RIBEYE and Bassoon signal intensities at the periphery <italic>versus</italic> inside of the cell in randomly selected single sections from confocal stacks of HEK cells expressing RIBEYE and palm-Bassoon (N = 9 cells) and HEK cells expressing RIBEYE and full-length Bassoon (N=9 cells). We found an increased peripheral distribution of both RIBEYE and Bassoon when using palm-Bassoon (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>, <italic>****P</italic> &lt; 0.0001, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test), implying successful membrane targeting of RIBEYE by palm-Bassoon. In each transfection, ∼10% cells showed co-expression of both RIBEYE and palm-Bassoon (for representative sample overview see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figEv2">Fig EV2</xref>). Of those, cells expressing discrete RIBEYE-palm Bassoon structures were discernible by the characteristic RIBEYE distribution along the periphery of the cell. This peripheral distribution in turn seemingly depends upon RIBEYE and palm-Bassoon expression ratios (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figEv2">Figure EV2B</xref>) as cells with little to no palm-Bassoon expression show predominantly cytosolic RIBEYE puncta and were not used for analysis. For simplicity, we henceforth refer to the structures composed of RIBEYE and palm-Bassoon in HEK293 cells as <italic>SyRibbons</italic> (for <italic>synthetic</italic> ribbons). We next performed three-dimensional surface renderings using <italic>Imaris</italic> 9.6 (Oxford Instruments) to assess these structures. In a given cell, only structures with colocalizing RIBEYE and palm-Bassoon immunofluorescence were considered for analysis to exclude the occasional non-membrane localized spots (on average 51.75 ± 40.84 RIBEYE surfaces colocalizing with Bassoon surfaces per cell; N = 20 cells). The volumes of RIBEYE and palm-Bassoon surfaces of <italic>SyRibbons</italic> were smaller on average and more variable (average volume ± standard deviation (SD) = 0.19 ± 0.23 µm<sup>3</sup> with a coefficient of variation (CV) = 1.23 for RIBEYE; n<sub>spots</sub> = 864 and volume = 0.17 ± 0.18 µm<sup>3</sup> with CV = 1.10 for Bassoon; n<sub>spots</sub> = 951; data from N = 20 cells, quantifications from 5 sample transfections) than volumes of synaptic ribbons and Bassoon immunofluorescent puncta from rat IHCs (volume = 0.29 ± 0.17 µm<sup>3</sup>, CV = 0.59 for RIBEYE; n<sub>spots</sub> = 290, and volume = 0.27 ± 0.18 µm<sup>3</sup>, CV = 0.67 for Bassoon; n<sub>spots</sub> = 314, data from N = 29 cells), (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, E). Moreover, volumes of RIBEYE surfaces show a high positive correlation to volumes of corresponding palm-Bassoon surfaces (<italic>P<sub>r</sub></italic> = 0.778, <italic>****P</italic> &lt; 0.0001), implying larger palm-Bassoon structures may recruit bigger RIBEYE structures to the plasma membrane. We also note that volume of RIBEYE surfaces in <italic>SyRibbons</italic> appears smaller and well-regulated in contrast to the predominantly large, cytosolic RIBEYE assemblies in cells co-expressing RIBEYE and full-length Bassoon (volume = 0.30 ± 0.36 µm<sup>3</sup>, n<sub>spots</sub> = 460, N = 10 cells, <italic>****P</italic> &lt; 0.001, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test). In turn, Bassoon clusters seemed regulated by co-expressed RIBEYE: Bassoon surfaces at the plasma membrane were larger at <italic>SyRibbons</italic> than in the absence of RIBEYE in cells only expressing palm-Bassoon (volume = 0.14 ± 0.21 µm<sup>3</sup>, n<sub>spots</sub> = 2217, N = 13 cells, <italic>****P</italic> &lt; 0.001, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the fact that next to structures with volumes comparable to IHC ribbons, we also encountered smaller and larger structures, likely reflects poorer regulation of RIBEYE and palm-Bassoon expression in the heterologous system. RIBEYE clusters constituting <italic>SyRibbons</italic> appeared more spherical than the plate-like Bassoon structures in the same cells (sphericity Ψ = 0.91 ± 0.05, n<sub>spots</sub> = 864 for RIBEYE versus Ψ = 0.86 ± 0.07, n<sub>spots</sub>= 951 for Bassoon, data from N = 20 cells; <italic>****P</italic> &lt; 0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis test with <italic>post hoc</italic> Dunn’s multiple comparison test). This follows the same trend as in rat IHCs where RIBEYE spots indeed appear more spherical (Ψ = 0.90 ± 0.05, n<sub>spots</sub> = 290) compared to Bassoon spots (Ψ = 0.76 ± 0.10, n<sub>spots</sub> = 314); <italic>****P</italic> &lt; 0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis test with <italic>post hoc</italic> Dunn’s multiple comparison test, data from N = 29 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we reconstituted and characterized a minimal ribbon-type AZ model system using heterologous expression. Co-expressing Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels with membrane targeted Bassoon for RIBEYE anchorage to the plasma membrane and attracting exogenous RBP2 for clustering Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in HEK293 cells led to structures recapitulating basic aspects of IHC ribbon synapses. Despite the poor regulation of transgene expression in the synapse-naïve HEK293 cells, the AZ-like structures, in the subset of cells were similar in morphology to the native IHC AZs. This applied to the <italic>synthetic</italic> ribbons as well as to the AZ-like clusters of Bassoon, RBP2 and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. However, all three components exhibited variability beyond the substantial natural heterogeneity found among the IHC AZs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Moser <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). Functionally, Bassoon and RBP2 co-expression resulted in larger whole-cell Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 currents. While additional expression of RIBEYE does not seem to enhance whole-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents, we demonstrate a stronger, localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx at <italic>SyRibbons</italic>. As <italic>SyRibbons</italic> partially resemble native hair cell AZs, we expect this easily available and experimentally accessible system to serve as an advanced testbed for functional interactions of AZ proteins and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Further efforts towards reconstituting synaptic vesicles and their release sites will help to enhance the utility of these synthetic AZs.</p>

<title>Synthetic active zone reconstitution model to study ribbon synapse assembly</title>
<p>By demonstrating that membrane-targeted Bassoon suffices to anchor ribbon-like RIBEYE assemblies, this work adds to the top-down and bottom-up evidence for a key role of Bassoon in attracting RIBEYE to the presynaptic density at the AZ in photoreceptors and hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dick <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Khimich <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jing <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">tom Dieck <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Additional expression of multi-domain proteins of the presynaptic density such as CAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Ohtsuka <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Inoue <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) might replace the need for artificial palmitoylation of Bassoon for membrane targeting. Furthermore, our results support a model of a bidirectional control of AZ size and shape by RIBEYE and proteins of the presynaptic density. The amount of RIBEYE assembled in membrane localized <italic>SyRibbons</italic> appeared regulated strongly contrasting the seemingly unregulated cytosolic RIBEYE assemblies dominating HEK293 cells in the absence of membrane-targeted Bassoon. Vice versa, clusters of Bassoon at the plasma membrane were larger at <italic>SyRibbons</italic> than in the absence of RIBEYE. Finally, the size of <italic>SyRibbons</italic> seemingly scaled with the size of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 and Bassoon clusters similar to what is observed in IHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Ohn <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). Such a model is consistent with results from genetic perturbation of native ribbon synapses: i) disruption of RIBEYE leads to a disintegration of Bassoon into smaller subclusters in IHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jean <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>), and ii) disruption of CAST and ELKS reduces the size of the ribbon-type AZs in rod photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">tom Dieck <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hagiwara <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). We speculate that achieving the full extent of large ribbon-type AZs such as in rod photoreceptors as well as regulating the size of ribbon-type AZs at a specific synapse according to the precise functional demands requires such a functional interplay between proteins of the presynaptic density and RIBEYE. We note that other ribbon-resident proteins such as piccolino likely contribute to this fine-tuning of the size and shape of ribbon-type AZs. Indeed, disruption of piccolino in IHCs reduced the average ribbon size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Müller <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Michanski <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). One exciting example of ribbon synapse heterogeneity manifests itself in IHCs where synapses show a spatial size gradient that likely relates to the diverse molecular and functional properties of the postsynaptic SGNs (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Moser <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>).</p>

<title>Insights into presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clustering and function</title>
<p>Current discussion of the clustering of Ca<sub>V</sub> Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels offers two different models: low affinity protein-protein interactions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hibino <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kaeser <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>) via specific domains and liquid-liquid phase separation involving intrinsically disordered domains (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Heck <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). Work on ribbon synapses has considered several layers of organizing Ca<sub>V</sub> Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at the AZ that seem more compatible with the former model: i) macro-clustering to which the synaptic ribbon contributes as a “super-scaffold” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jean <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Neef <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Frank <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Maxeiner <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>), ii) tethering and micro-clustering by RBPs, RIMs, CAST and ELKS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Liu <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Grabner <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jung <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Krinner <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Luo <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hagiwara <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>) and iii) nanoscale coupling of Ca<sub>V</sub> Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and SV release sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Brandt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Jarsky <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wong <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Maxeiner <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Özçete &amp; Moser, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Grabner &amp; Moser, 2021</xref>; Jaime Tobón &amp; Moser, 2023) for which a role of the ribbon has been more controversial (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Maxeiner <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Grabner &amp; Moser, 2021</xref>). MINFLUX nanoscopy of rod photoreceptor AZs recently revealed a well-ordered double-line array topography of Ca<sub>V</sub> Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, RIM, Bassoon and ubMunc13-2 at the presynaptic membrane on both sides of the ribbon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Grabner <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). Clearly, we could not fully reconstitute this complex organization with the minimal set of molecular players at <italic>syRibbons</italic> in HEK293 cells. Yet, we demonstrate augmentation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents and clusters by co-expression of RBP and Bassoon and a positive effect of <italic>syRibbons</italic> on local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, recapitulating micro- and macro-clustering of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. However, we note that the functional impact of ribbon-mediated macro-clustering of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels remains unclear at the moment. Our Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data seems more reminiscent of previous work on ribbon-type AZs of immature IHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wong <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>) where a broader distribution of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 and ribbons go along with an immature state of the IHC AZs. One clear limitation of the synthetic AZ system in HEK293 cells is the lack of SVs and the molecular machinery required for SV release. Nonetheless, our work paves the way for future studies including stable co-expression of AZ proteins including of the release site marker Munc13-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sakamoto <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Böhme <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>) and potential delivery of SV machinery via co-expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Park <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>) or from synaptosomes. Alternatively, using neurosecretory cells such as pheochromocytoma cells (PC12) or adrenal chromaffin cells in primary culture, offer the advantage of providing synaptic-like microvesicles and a large set of components of the presynaptic machinery such that expression of exogenous proteins might be limited to RIBEYE. On the other hand, the complex molecular background involving various types of Ca<sub>V</sub> channels will likely complicate the interpretation. Regardless, <italic>SyRibbons</italic> in cultured cells offer great availability and as adherent cells, are well accessible to sophisticated analysis by techniques such MINFLUX nanoscopy and cryo-electron tomography. Future use of polycistronic gene expression or stable cell lines expressing all components could help make the system become even more widely applicable.</p>

The cells were cultured as per product protocols in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing GlutaMax, high glucose and pyruvate (Gibco, Life Tech., 31966047), supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS; Gibco, Life Tech., A5256701) and 100 units/ml of Penicillin-Streptomycin (Gibco, Life Tech., 15070063). Additionally, the media was supplemented with 0.6 µM of Isradipine (Sigma Aldrich, I6658) and the following selection antibiotics (in mg/ml): 0.005 Blasticidin (Invivogen, ant-bl-05), 0.50 Geneticin (G418 Sulfate; Gibco, Life Tech., 10131027), 0.10 Zeocin (InvivoGen, ant-zn-05) and 0.04 Hygromycin (Thermo Fisher, 10687010). Cells were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% (v/v) CO<sub>2</sub> saturation. Cells were split at ∼70% confluency every 3-4 days to prevent adverse effects on cell growth and channel expression, by dissociating the cell using Accutase (Sigma-Aldrich, A6964). The passage number did not exceed more than 26 passages. For experiments, cells were grown in media lacking selection antibiotics. For induction of α<sub>1</sub>-D subunit expression, cells were treated with selection antibiotic-free medium containing 3 µg/ml tetracycline. For transfection, 6.8 µg polyethylenimine (PEI, 25kDa linear, Polysciences, 23966) was added along with a total of 2 µg of DNA to a final volume of 100 µl of DMEM (without FBS). The PEI/DNA mixture was thoroughly mixed and allowed to incubate for 30 min at room temperature before being added to the cells (30 µl/well in a 24-well-plate containing 500 µl media, cell confluency ∼50-70%). For all experiments with co-transfections, we used an equimolar ratio of DNA (total amount of DNA was kept 2 µg in a 100 µl transfection mix). After 18-24 hours, transfection media was replaced with fresh media devoid of selection antibiotics. Cells were used for experiments (immunocytochemistry, patch clamp and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging) 24-48 hours after changing the media or as specified. If cell confluency was too high, cells were reseeded to an appropriate confluency and allowed to settle for at least 12 hours before commencement of experiments.</p>

<p>The RIBEYE-GFP construct used consisted of a human RIBEYE cDNA cloned inframe into a pAAV-GFP vector driven by a hybrid CMV-enhancer-human-beta-actin promoter (CMV-HBA) and containing a downstream Woodchuck Hepatitis Virus (WHV) Posttranscriptional Regulatory Element (WPRE) for mRNA stabilization. All Bassoon constructs encode rat Bassoon. The untagged full-length constructs were cloned in the pCS2+ vector. For the generation of palm-Bassoon constructs, we used a pEGFP-C1 vector backbone with a CMV promoter and kanamycin resistance cassette. The insert comprised of a palmitoylation consensus sequence of GAP43 (ATGCTGTGCTGTATGAGAAGAACCAAACAGGTTGAAAAGAATGATGAGGACCAAAAGATTTCCGGACTCAGA TCTCGAG), followed by a cDNA sequence encoding amino acids 95-3938 of rat Bassoon, and a C-terminal monomeric GFP. For the untagged version, the GFP tag was replaced by a STOP codon. To generate the Halo-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Schwenzer <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>), human Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 cDNA (accession number NM_001128840.2) was de-novo synthesized and assembled into a HaloTag vector (Promega G7721) using restriction cloning, thus encoding an N-terminal fusion of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 to HaloTag linked by a ‘GGS’ sequence. The analogous GFP-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 plasmid was generated by exchanging the HaloTag sequence for mEGFP using restriction cloning.

Blocking and permeabilization was performed with GSDB (goat serum dilution buffer: 16% normal goat serum, 450 mM NaCl, 0.3% Triton X-100, 20mM phosphate buffer, pH ∼7.4) for 45-60 minutes at room temperature. Samples were incubated with respective primary antibodies (diluted in GSDB, refer to <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblEv2">Table EV2</xref>) overnight at 4°C or for 2 hours at RT. The samples were then washed three times (5–10 minutes each) with wash buffer (450 mM NaCl, 0.3% Triton X-100, 20mM phosphate buffer, pH ∼ 7.4). Incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies (also diluted in GSDB refer to <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblEv2">Table EV2</xref>) was performed for 1 hour at room temperature in a light-protected wet chamber. Lastly, the coverslips were washed three times with wash buffer (5-10 minutes each) and one final time with PBS, before mounting onto glass slides with a drop of fluorescence mounting medium (Mowiol 4-88, Carl Roth). For live cell imaging of cells transfected with Halo-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">C</xref>), cells plated on glass-bottomed dishes were treated with Janelia Fluor 646 HaloTag Ligand (Promega, Cat. No. GA1120) at a final labelling concentration of 200nM (in cell culture media). Cells were incubated with the ligand for ∼60 min at 37°C with 5% (v/v) CO<sub>2</sub> saturation, after which the media was replaced with an equal volume of fresh warm culture media.</p>
<p>Images from fixed and live samples were acquired in confocal/ STED mode using an Olympus IX83 inverted microscope combined with an Abberior Instruments Expert Line STED microscope (Abberior Instruments GmbH). We used lasers at 488, 561, and 633 nm for excitation and a 775 nm (1.2W) laser for stimulated emission depletion. 1.4 NA 100X or 20X oil immersion objectives were used for fixed samples, and a water immersion 60X objective was used for live samples. Confocal stacks or single sections were acquired using <italic>Imspector</italic> Software (pixel size = 80 X 80 nm along xy, 200 nm along z). For 2D-STED images, a pixel size of 15 X 15 nm (in xy) was used. Images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figEv2">figure EV2A</xref> were acquired using a Leica SP8 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Germany). All acquired images were visualized using NIH ImageJ software and adjusted for brightness and contrast. Samples and their corresponding controls were processed in parallel using identical staining protocols, laser excitation powers and microscope settings.</p>

<title>Patch clamp and calcium imaging</title>
<p>Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 stably expressing HEK293 cells were plated on coverslips till about 40-50% confluency was achieved, following which they were induced for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3α1-D expression by incubating them for 24-48 hours in induction media supplemented with tetracycline. For transfected cells, transfection was performed after 24hrs of induction in the induction media as explained above. Cells were recorded in extracellular solution containing (in mM): 150 choline-Cl, 10 HEPES, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 10 CaCl<sub>2</sub>; pH was adjusted to 7.3 with CsOH and osmolality was 300-310 mOsm/kg. For electrophysiological recordings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and Figure S4, pipette solution contained (in mM): 140 NMDG, 10 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 5 EGTA, 3 Mg-ATP and 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>. pH was adjusted to 7.3 with methanesulfonic acid and osmolality was around 290 mOsm/kg. For Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>, the pipette solution contained (in mM): 111 Cs-glutamate, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 EGTA, 13 TEA-Cl, 20 HEPES, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, 1 L-glutathione, 0.1 Calbryte590 (AAT Bioquest, Cat. No. 20706); pH was adjusted to 7.3, osmolality to 290 mOsm/kg. Resistance of patch pipettes was 3–7 MΩ. HEK293 cells were rupture patch clamped with EPC-10 amplifier (HEKA electronics, Germany) controlled by <italic>Patchmaster</italic> software at room temperature, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Picher <italic>et al</italic>, 2017b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">2017a</xref>). Cells were kept at a holding potential of −91.2 or −88 mV. All voltages were corrected for liquid junction potential offline (21.2 mV or 18 mV). Currents were leak corrected using a p/10 protocol. Recordings were discarded when leak current exceeded −50 pA, R<sub>s</sub> exceeded 15 MΩ or offset potential fluctuated more than 5 mV. Current voltage (IV) relations were recorded around 1 minute after rupturing the cell, by applying increasing step-depolarisation pulses of voltage ranging from −86.2 mV to 58.8 mV, in steps of 5 mV. Depolarisation pulses of 500 ms were used for measure Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 inactivation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figEv4">Figure EV4A</xref>.</p>
<p>For Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments, we used a Yokogawa CSU-X1A spinning-disk confocal scanner, mounted on an upright microscope (Zeiss Examiner) with a 63X, 1.0 NA objective (W Plan-Apochromat, Zeiss). Images were acquired using an Andor Zyla sCMOS 4.2 camera, controlled by <italic>VisiView</italic> 5.0 software (Visitron Systems GmbH). GFP, mKATE2 and the low-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator Calbryte590 were excited by a VS Laser Merge System (Visitron Systems) with 488 and 561 nm laser lines. Spinning disk was set to 5000 rpm. mKATE2 positive cells showing peripheral GFP expression (indicative of RIBEYE and palm-Bassoon co-expression) were identified and used for recordings. The cell was loaded for approximately a minute with Calbryte590 dye, after which we applied step depolarizations of 20 ms from −83 to +62 mV in 5-mV step increments to measure Ca<sup>2+</sup> current (density)–voltage relations. Next, a central plane of the cell was selected and the GFP fluorescence (green channel) of the cell showing <italic>SyRibbons</italic> was imaged. This was immediately followed by imaging of the increments of Calbryte590 fluorescence (red channel) in the same plane triggered by a depolarizing pulse to +2 mV for 500 ms (frame rate = 20 Hz). For Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments, we also included occasionally occurring HEK293 cells which were electrically coupled with other neighbouring HEK293 cells. For such cells, we could not fully compensate for the slow capacitive currents and we did not use them for electrophysiological analysis.</p>

<sec id="s4e1">
<title>Analysis of confocal images</title>
<p>All images were processed using NIH ImageJ software to make z-projections and multi-channel composites, and figures were created using Adobe Illustrator. For analysis of membrane distribution, a region of interest (ROI) of 1 µm thickness was drawn along the periphery of the cell which was identified either using Na, K ATPase α<sub>1</sub> immunofluorescence or by enhancing the contrast in images of transfected cells so that the cell boundary becomes distinguishable. Mean pixel intensity was measured along this ROI and for the area enclosed within the ROI. The ratio of the mean pixel intensity (periphery: inside) per cell was reported as an average from at least three central planes; we did not use the basal and top plane. For volumetric fits of <italic>SyRibbons,</italic> IHC ribbons and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clusters, we used the inbuilt surface detection algorithm from Imaris 9.6 (Oxford Instruments). The surface detail was set to 0.16 µm and largest sphere diameters for background subtraction were set as follows: for RIBEYE/CtBP2 0.3 µm, for Bassoon 0.1 µm and for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 0.08 µm. Thresholding was performed based on the quality of immunofluorescence to ensure all discernible surfaces were detected. All surfaces with less than 10 voxels were filtered out. A manual check was done to include undetected surfaces, remove surfaces not localizing within cell of interest, and split surfaces that would occasionally be clubbed together. For analysis of <italic>SyRibbons</italic>, only RIBEYE surfaces colocalizing with palm-Bassoon surfaces were used for quantifications (at 0.06 µm or less). Occasionally we would detect surfaces with volumes larger than 2 µm<sup>3</sup> (usually cytosolic) or smaller than 0.02 µm<sup>3</sup>, which were not considered for analysis. For Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 cluster volumetric analysis, clusters classified as <italic>+SyRibbons</italic> were at 0.045 µm or less from palm-Bassoon positive RIBEYE surfaces. All other clusters were classified as <italic>–SyRibbons</italic>. Only clusters localized at the periphery of the cell were used for analysis.</p>

<title>Analysis of patch clamp and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data</title>
<p>Analysis of electrophysiology data and figure preparation was performed using Igor Pro 6 and 7 (WaveMetrics Inc.) and final figures were compiled using Adobe Illustrator. For analyzing current density-voltage relations (IVs), the evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> current was averaged from 5 to 10 ms after depolarization start. Cells expressing current amplitudes less than −49 pA and with current density greater than −60 pA/pF were not taken into account for analysis.</p>
<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data analysis was performed using a customized script in ImageJ. Briefly, we performed background subtraction in time series with Calbryte590 signal and then averaged 5 frames before stimulation and subtracted these from an average of three frames during stimulation to obtain ΔF images. For visualization, the images were smoothened (3 X 3 unweighted smoothening) and a composite was created by overlaying the ΔF images and the RIBEYE-GFP channel. For analyzing ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>, we drew circular regions of interest (ROIs) of 2µm diameter at sites with and without <italic>SyRibbons</italic> in the background subtracted time series. The ΔF<sub>max</sub>/F<sub>0</sub> was calculated as the of average ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> in first three frames of peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal intensity at stimulation onset in each ROI. To minimize bias while assigning regions as with or without <italic>SyRibbons</italic>, ROIs were assigned in the RIBEYE-GFP channel, without looking at the corresponding Calbryte590 signal.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>Data sorting and statistics were performed using MS Excel, <italic>Igor Pro 7</italic> and/or <italic>GraphPad Prism 10</italic>. Numerical data is represented mainly as mean ± standard deviation (SD). The normality of data was assessed using Jarque-Bera test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and the equality of variances was checked using <italic>F</italic>-test. When comparing two samples, a two-tailed unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test (or paired <italic>t</italic>-test for <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 7J</xref>) was performed for normally distributed samples with equal variances. If the conditions for normality and equality of variances were not met, an unpaired Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test was performed. When comparing multiple samples, a one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey’s test was used for normally distributed data with equal variances. For samples which were not normally distributed, we used Kruskal-Wallis test with <italic>post hoc</italic> Dunn’s multi-comparison correction. All box plots are depicted with crosses representing mean values, central bands indicating median, whiskers for 90/10 percentiles, boxes for 75/25 percentiles and individual data points overlaid.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors attempt to reconstitute some active zone properties by introducing synaptic ribbon proteins into HEK cells. This &quot;ground-up&quot; approach can be valuable for assessing the necessity of specific proteins in synaptic function. Here, the authors co-transfect a membrane-targeted bassoon, RBP2, calcium channel subunits and Ribeye to generate what they call &quot;synthetic ribbons&quot;. The resultant structures show an ability to cluster calcium channels (Figure 4B) and a modest ability to concentrate calcium entry locations (figure 7J). At the light level, the ribeye aggregates look spherical and localize to the membrane through its interaction with the membrane-targeted bassoon. It is a nice proof-of-principle in establishing a useful experimental system for studying calcium channel localization. However, the impact of the study is modest. No new biology is discovered and to call these structures &quot;synthetic ribbons&quot; is an overstatement in the absence of an ultrastructural analysis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The authors establish a new experimental system for the study of calcium channel localization to active zones.</p>
<p>
(2) The clustering of calcium channels to bassoon via RBP2 is a nice confirmation of a previously described interaction between bassoon and calcium channels in a cell-based system</p>
<p>
(3) The &quot;ground-up&quot; approach is an attractive one and theoretically allows one to learn a lot about the essential interactions for building a ribbon structure.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Are these truly &quot;synthetic ribbons&quot;. The ribbon synapse is traditionally defined by its morphology at the EM level. To what extent these structures recapitulate ribbons is not shown. It has been previously shown that Ribeye forms aggregates on its own. Do these structures look any more ribbon-like than ribeye aggregates in the absence of its binding partners?</p>
<p>
(2) No new biology is discovered here. The clustering of channels is accomplished by taking advantage of previously described interactions between RBP2, Ca channels and bassoon. The localization of Ribeye to bassoon takes advantage of a previously described interaction between the two. Even the membrane localization of the complexes required the introduction of a membrane-anchoring motif.</p>
<p>
(3) The only thing ribbon-specific about these &quot;syn-ribbons&quot; is the expression of ribeye and ribeye does not seem to participate in the localization of other proteins in these complexes. Bsn, Cav1.3 and RBP2 can be found in other neurons.</p>
<p>
(4) As the authors point out, RBP2 is not necessary for some Ca channel clustering in hair cells, yet seems to be essential for clustering to bassoon here.</p>

(5) The difference in Ca imaging between SyRibbons and other locations is extremely subtle.</p>
<p>
(6) The effect of the expression of palm-Bsn, RBP2 and the combination of the two on Ca-current is ambiguous. It appears that while the combination is larger than the control, it probably isn't significantly different from either of the other two alone (Fig 5). Moreover, expression of Ribeye + the other two showed no effect on Ca current (Figure 7). Also, why is the IV curve right shifted in Figure 7 vs Figure 5?</p>
<p>
(7) While some of the IHC is quantified, some of it is simply shown as single images. EV2, EV3 and Figure 4a in particular (4b looks convincing enough on its own, but could also benefit from a larger sample size and quantification)</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors show that co-expression of bassoon, RIBEYE, Cav1.3-alpha1, Cav-beta3, Cav-alpha2delta1, and RBP2 in a heterologus system (HEK293 cells) is sufficient to generate a protein complex resembling a presyanptic ribbon-type active zone both in morphology and in function (in clustering voltage-gated Ca channels and creating sites for localized Ca2+ entry). If the 3 separate Cav gene products are taken as a single protein (i.e. a Ca channel), the conclusion is that the core of a ribbon synapse comprises 4 proteins: bassoon holds the RIBEYE-containing ribbon to the plasma membrane, and RPB2 binds to bassoon and Ca channels, tethering the Ca channels to the presynaptic active zone.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Good use of a heterologous system with generally appropriate controls provides convincing evidence that a presynaptic ribbon-type active zone (without the ability to support exocytosis), with the ability to support localized Ca2+ entry (a key feature of ribbon-type pre-synapses) can be assembled from a few proteins.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Relies on over-expression, which almost certainly diminishes the experimentally-measured parameters (e.g. pre-synapse clustering, localization of Ca2+ entry).</p>
<p>
(2) Are HEK cells the best model? HEK cells secrete substances and have a studied-endocytitic pathway, but they do not create neurosecretory vesicles. Why didn't the authors try to reconstitute a ribbon synapse in a cell that makes neurosecretory vesicles like a PC12 cell?</p>
<p>
(3) Related to 1 and 2: the Ca channel localization observed is significant but not so striking given the presence of Cav protein and measurements of Ca2+ influx distributed across the membrane. Presumably, this is the result of overexpression and an absence of pathways for pre-synaptic targeting of Ca channels. But, still, it was surprising that Ca channel localization was so diffuse. I suppose that the authors tried to reduce the effect of over-expression by using an inducible Cav1.3? Even so, the accessory subunits were constitutively over-expressed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Ribbon synapses are complex molecular assemblies responsible for synaptic vesicle trafficking in sensory cells of the eye and the inner ear. The Ca2+-dependent exocytosis occurs at the active zone (AZ), however, the molecular mechanisms orchestrating the structure and function of the AZs of ribbon synapses are not well understood. To advance in the understanding of those mechanisms, the authors present a novel and interesting experimental strategy pursuing the reconstitution of a minimal active zone of a ribbon synapse within a synapse-naïve cell line: HEK293 cells. The authors have used stably transfected HEK293 cells that express voltage-gated Ca2+ channels subunits (constitutive -CaV beta3 and CaV alpha2 beta1- and inducible CaV1.3 alpha1). They have expressed in those cells several proteins of the ribbon synapse active zone: (1) RIBEYE, (2) a modified version of Bassoon that binds to the plasma membrane through artificial palmitoylation (Palm-Bassoon) and (3) RIM-binding protein 2 (RBP2) to induce the formation of a minimal active zone that they called SyRibbons. The formation of such structures is convincing, however, the evidence of such structures having an impact enhancing Ca2+-currents, as the authors claim, is rather weak in the present version of the study.</p>
<p>Strengths of the study:</p>
<p>(1) The study is carefully carried out using a remarkable combination of (1) superresolution microscopy, to analyze the formation and subcellular distribution of molecular assemblies and (2) functional assessment of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels using patch-clamp recording of Ca2+-currents and fluorometry to correlate Ca2+ influx with the molecular assemblies formed by AZ proteins. The results are of high quality and are in general accompanied of required control experiments.</p>
<p>
(2) The method opens new opportunities to further investigate the minimal and basic properties of AZ proteins that are difficult to study using in vivo systems. The cells that operate through ribbon synapses (e.g. photoreceptors and hair cells) are particularly difficult to manipulate, so setting up and validating the use of a heterologous system more suitable for molecular manipulations is highly valuable.</p>
<p>
(3) The structures formed by RIBEYE and Palm-Bassoon in HEK293 cells identified by STED nanoscopy are strikingly similar to the AZs of ribbon synapses found in rat inner hair cells (Figure 2).</p>
<p>Weaknesses of the study:</p>
<p>(1) The results obtained in a heterologous system (HEK293 cells) need to be interpreted with caution. They will importantly speed the generation of models and hypothesis that will, however, require in vivo validation.</p>
<p>
(2) The authors analyzed the distribution of RIBEYE clusters in different membrane compartments and correctly conclude that RIBEYE clusters are not trapped in any of those compartments, but it is soluble instead. The authors, however, did not carry out a similar analysis for Palm-Bassoon. It is therefore unknown if Palm-Bassoon binds to other membrane compartments besides the plasma membrane. That could occur because in non-neuronal cells GAP43 has been described to be in internal membrane compartments. This should be investigated to document the existence of ectopic internal Synribbons beyond the plasma membrane because it might have implications for interpreting functional data in case Ca2+-channels become part of those internal Synribbons.</p>
<p>
(3) The co-expression of RBP2 and Palm-Bassoon induces a rather minor but significant increase in Ca2+-currents (Figure 5). Such an increase does not occur upon expression of (1) Palm-Bassoon alone, (2) RBP2 alone or (3) RIBEYE alone (Figure 5). Intriguingly, the concomitant expression of Palm-Bassoon, RBP2 and RIBEYE does not translate into an increase of Ca2+-currents either (Figure 7).</p>
<p>
(4) The authors claim that Ca2+-imaging reveals increased CA2+-signal intensity at synthetic ribbon-type AZs. That claim is a subject of concern because the increase is rather small and it does not correlate with an increase in Ca2+-currents.</p>
