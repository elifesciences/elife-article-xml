<title>Abstract</title><p>The slow-intrinsic-pacemaker dopaminergic (DA) neurons originating in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) is implicated in various mood- and emotion-related disorders, such as anxiety, fear, stress and depression. Abnormal activity of projection-specific VTA DA neurons is the key factor in the development of these disorders. Here, we describe the crucial role for the NALCN and TRPC6, non-selective cation channels in mediating the subthreshold inward depolarizing current and driving the firing of action potentials of VTA DA neurons in physiological condition. Otherwise, we demonstrate that downregulation of TRPC6 protein expression in the VTA DA neurons likely contributes to the reduced activity of projection-specific VTA DA neuron in CMUS depressive mice. Furthermore, selective knockdown of TRPC6 channels in the VTA DA neurons conferred mice with depression-like behavior. This current study suggests down-regulation of TRPC6 expression/function is involved in reduced VTA DA neuron firing and depression-like behavior in the mouse models of depression.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play a key role in mood, reward and addictive behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. These DA neurons project, through mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system, to brain regions including the nucleus accumbens (NAc), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA), and modulate these target neuronal circuits through their regulated activity (firing of action potentials)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. As such, understandably, the altered functional activity of the VTA DA neurons is found to be the key determinants in abnormal behaviors related to the diseased conditions such as depression states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Thus, the mechanism underlying the firing activity of the VTA DA neurons is crucial for understanding the function of the DA circuitry and the pathogenesis of related mental diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The VTA DA neurons are slow intrinsic pacemakers, which are further modulated by synaptic inputs from multiple excitatory and inhibitory projections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Firing activity controls the release of DA, thus function of the VTA DA neurons. The altered activity of the VTA DA neurons in a pathological state includes altered firing frequency and switch of the firing patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Mechanism for spontaneous firing of action potential (AP) is the key to understand functional regulation of the VTA DA neurons. A variety of ion channels (e.g. voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels, high-threshold-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, Kv2, large conductance calcium-activated potassium channels, A- and M-type potassium channels) are reported to be involved in regulation of the autonomic firing activity of midbrain DA neurons (including the substantial nigra compact par, SNc and VTA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. However, it is not completely clear how this spontaneous firing is initiated. AP fires when the resting membrane potential (RMP) is depolarized to the activation threshold for the voltage-dependent Na<sup>+</sup> channels, which results in opening of Na<sup>+</sup> channel and the upstroke of AP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Therefore, a controlled depolarization of the RMP to the activation threshold of AP is the first key step in a cascade leading to firing of AP. In the VTA DA neurons, the identity of ion channels contributing to this subthreshold depolarization has not been unambiguously established.</p>
<p>In some cells with spontaneous firing of AP, such as cardiomyocytes and certain neurons (including a subset of midbrain SNc DA neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>), the ionic mechanism for the auto-rhythmicity is the HCN, a non-selective cation channel that would depolarize the membrane potential after being activated at a hyperpolarized membrane potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. However, in the VTA DA neurons, results concerning the HCN channels to the spontaneous firing are controversial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Another non-selective cation channel, NALCN, which unlike HCN, is a non-voltage dependent channel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, and is reported to be among the candidates for molecular correlates of the persistent background Na<sup>+</sup> leak currents in the VTA DA neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. The NALCN-mediated background Na<sup>+</sup> leak currents are found to be involved in modulation of firing activity in a variety of neurons including DA neurons in the SNc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. However, it has not been reported if NALCN play a role in spontaneous firing of the VTA DA neurons, although the VTA DA neurons have larger Na<sup>+</sup> leak currents than SNc DA neurons do <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>TRP channels are a large class of non-selective cation channels, and are widely distributed in the peripheral and central nervous system. TRPC3, which has a high homology with TRPC6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, is found to be involved in the regulation of cardiac and SNc DA neuronal excitability, generating depolarizing currents, triggering action potentials and participating in cellular rhythmic firing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. The role of TRP channels in the regulation of VTA DA neuronal excitability has not been described.</p>
<p>In this study, we drove to find channel conductance which contribute to the subthreshold depolarization and thus the spontaneous firing of the VTA DA neurons. And further more we investigated if these channels are the molecular mechanism for the altered function activity of the VTA DA neurons related to depression-like behaviors in mouse model of depression. We started by profiling the expression of non-selective cation channels (NSCCs) of the VTA DA neurons using method of Patch-Seq from midbrain DA neurons projecting to different brain regions, and then focused on HCN, NALCN, TRPC6 and TRPV2 channels which are dominantly expressed in these DA neurons.</p>

<title>Inflow of extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> contribute to the subthreshold depolarization of the VTA DA neurons</title>
<p>One key feature of the midbrain DA neurons is that these neurons are relatively depolarized in the resting condition; the resting membrane potential (RMP) is far from the K<sup>+</sup> equilibrium potential (∼-55 mV <italic>vs</italic> ∼-90 mV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, which enable the spontaneous firing possibly. Thus there must exist persistent inward depolarizing conductance counterbalancing the hyperpolarizing K<sup>+</sup> conductance which otherwise would maintain the RMP at a hyperpolarized level. The main aim of this study is to identify the subthreshold depolarizing conductances which contribute to the spontaneous firing of the VTA DA neurons. For this, we first observed firing frequency and the RMP of the VTA DA neurons using patch clamp recordings. The midbrain DA neurons, marked by dopamine transporter (DAT), mainly located in the VTA and SNc (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref><bold>i</bold>). We recorded neurons from the VTA brain slices of mice, and performed single-cell PCR post electrophysiologic recordings to identify the DA neurons with established markers for DA neurons (TH, DAT, D<sub>2</sub>R (type 2 dopamine receptor), and GIRK2 (G protein-gated inward rectifier K inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channels)). Although the majority of cells in the VTA area are DA neurons (∼60%), there are still about 30% GABA neurons and a small number of glutamatergic neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Glutamatergic- and GABAergic neurons were also single-cell PCR typed by using markers of vGluT2 (vesicular glutamate transporter 2) and GAD1 (glutamic acid decarboxylase 1), respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref><bold>ii</bold>).</p>

<p>To focus on the intrinsic channel conductance for spontaneous firing, potential input modulation from fast-type transmitter transmission to the VTA DA neurons, namely activation of AMPA/kainite/NMDA receptor and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor were blocked by receptor antagonists CNQX, DL-AP5 and picrotoxin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, respectively, in the following experiments.</p>
<p>We first studied whether inflow of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> contributed to initiation of spontaneous firing in the VTA DA neurons. It has been shown that, unlike the SNc DA neurons, the VTA DA neurons do not have subthreshold Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillatory waves <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, suggesting that subthreshold Ca<sup>2+</sup> should not be an important component of subthreshold depolarizing conductance in the VTA DA neurons. In line with this finding, we found in our study, replacing Ca<sup>2+</sup> with Mg<sup>2+</sup> from the extracellular recording solution (ACSF, artificial cerebral spinal solution) did not reduce, but rather instead, increased the firing frequency of the VTA DA neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 1B</bold></xref>, from 1.90 ± 0.22 Hz to 3.05 ± 0.33 Hz, n = 6, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). In consistent with this, the RMP of the VTA DA neurons was also not affected by replacing Ca<sup>2+</sup> with Mg<sup>2+</sup> from ACSF (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 1C</bold></xref>, from -50.76 ± 1.16 mV to -48.83 ± 1.76 mV, n = 6, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05).</p>
<p>We then, in comparison with Ca<sup>2+</sup>, observed the role of extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> in the RMP of the VTA DA neurons. For this, we followed the method of a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, by replacing Na<sup>+</sup> in ACSF with NMDG (N-methyl-d-glucamine); TTX (Tetrodotoxin) was also added to block the TTX-sensitive Na<sup>+</sup> currents, which is known to be the main contributor to the suprathreshold depolarization component of the action potential. Replacement of the extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> with NMDG resulted in a hyperpolarization of the RMP, from -46.00 ± 2.92 mV to -66.80 ± 1.53 mV (n = 5, P &lt; 0.05, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1D</bold></xref>), indicating a persistent inflow of Na<sup>+</sup> through a TTX-insensitive conductance which caused significant depolarization of the neurons, contributing significantly to the subthreshold depolarization of the VTA DA neurons.</p>
<p>Taken together, above results indicate persistent Na<sup>+</sup> influx contribute to the subthreshold depolarization of the VTA DA neurons.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Potential candidates of channel conductance contributing to subthreshold depolarization of the VTA DA neurons</title>
<p>The channel conductance mediating the above-described persistent Na<sup>+</sup> influx should come from a cation channel(s) permeating to Na<sup>+</sup>. We thus investigated the presence and expression level of non-selective cation channels (NSCCs) in the VTA DA neurons using a combination of patch clamp and single-cell RNA-Seq (Patch-seq) technology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. In this part of the study, we considered the heterogeneity and projection-specificity of the VTA DA neurons, i.e. VTA DA neurons projecting to different brain regions have different electrophysiological characteristics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Using retrograde labelling techniques using retrobeads, sixty VTA neurons projecting to five different brain regions (medial prefrontal cortex, mPFC; basal lateral amygdala, BLA; nucleus accumben core, NAc c; nucleus accumben lateral shell, NAc ls; nucleus accumben medial shell, NAc ms) (<bold>sFig.1</bold>) were collected for RNA-Seq, using patch-clamp electrodes. Consistent with previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, the VTA DA neurons projected to above different brain regions were anatomically congregated into subregions of the VTA (<bold>sFig.2)</bold>. The high expression of biomarkers (TH, Ddc and DAT) in the 45 cells of 60 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 2A</bold></xref>) indicates that these are DA neurons. In addition, a significant proportion of neurons (predominantly those projecting to NAc ms, BLA, and mPFC) have biomarkers (VGluT1-3) of glutamatergic neurons, predicting a possible coexistence of neurotransmitters (DA and glutamate)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. In contrast, fewer GABAergic neuronal markers (GAD1/2 and VGAT) co-expressed with the DA neurons, which is consistent with previous studies that VTA DA neurons coexpressing GABAergic neuronal markers mainly project to the lateral habenula<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. It needs to be noted that some neurons in the VTA only expressed markers for glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons, these neurons were excluded from further analysis as we focused our study on the DA neurons.</p>

<p>Expression files of NSCCs in the VTA DA neurons classified by projection specificity were analyzed and shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 2B</bold></xref>. Different colored strips on the top of the figure corresponded to the projection specificity coded by the same colors in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 2A</bold></xref>. Multiple transient receptor potential channels (TRP) were present in the VTA DA neurons, with prominent expression level of TRPC6 and TRPV2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 2B</bold></xref><bold>i</bold>). Other prominently expressed NSCCs included HCN2, HCN3, NALCN and pannexin 1 (Panx1) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 2B</bold></xref><bold>ii</bold>). Summarized averaged relative expression levels for eight most richly expressed NSCCs were shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 2B</bold></xref><bold>iii</bold>. Furthermore, projection-specific expression of these dominantly expressed NSCCs were analyzed and shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig 2C</bold></xref>; interestingly only TRPC6 seemed expressed in a projection-specific manner, namely, the VTA DA neurons projecting to the NAc have higher TRPC6 expression than the VTA DA neurons projecting to the BLA and the mPFC <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig 2C</bold></xref>). In our subsequent study, we focused our study on HCN, NALCN, TRPC6 and TRPV2, one for they are the prominently expression channels, and two for some of these channels have been indicated in modulation of excitability of different neuron types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, 28–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>.

<title>HCN does not contribute to the spontaneous firing of the VTA DA neurons</title>
<p>We mainly used two pharmacological tools of HCN channel blockers, CsCl and ZD7288<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> to explore the role of HCN channels in the spontaneous firing of the VTA DA neurons. Efficient blocking effect of these blockers on HCN channel were first verified. For this, the sag potential produced by a hyperpolarizing current (-100 pA) injection was used to assess HCN activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Both CsCl (3 mM) and ZD7288 (60 μM) effectively reduced the sag potential (from 16.43 ± 2.96 mV to 3.84 ± 1.92 mV, n = 4, P &lt; 0.05; from 19.38 ± 3.14 mV to 4.18 ± 2.60 mV, n = 4, respectively, P &lt; 0.05) (<bold>sFig. 3A and B</bold>).</p>
<p>However, these same HCN blockers did not inhibit the spontaneous firing of the VTA DA neurons; CsCl slightly increased (1.96 ± 0.19 Hz to 2.14 ± 0.34 Hz, n = 7) whereas ZD7288 slightly decreased the firing frequency (1.65 ± 0.25 Hz to 1.50 ± 0.24 Hz, n = 13), but none of these effects were statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) (<bold>sFig. 3C and D)</bold>. It has been reported that VTA DA neurons projecting to the NAc lateral shell have more pronounced HCN/Ih currents than other VTA DA neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. However, even the VTA DA neurons projecting to the NAc lateral shell (retrogradely labelled by retrobeads), no effect of CsCl or ZD7288 on the spontaneous firing of the VTA DA neurons were observed (from 2.04 ± 0.24 Hz to 1.93 ± 0.22 Hz, n = 5, by CsCl, and from 1.71 ± 0.29 Hz to 1.65 ± 0.33 Hz, n = 5, by ZD7288, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) (<bold>sFig. 4</bold>).</p>
<p>HCN are activated by membrane hyperpolarization, with an activation threshold around -70∼-90 mV (HCN2, HCN3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. At a depolarized RMP like these in the VTA DA neurons (-51.28 ± 1.85 mV, n = 8; e.g. -54.50 mV, <bold>sFig 3Ai</bold>, and -53.50mV, <bold>sFig. 3Bi</bold>), HCH are mostly likely not activated thus would not participate in generation of spontaneous firing. To further prove this, we tested if a more hyperpolarized RMP would involve HCN in the spontaneous firing of the VTA DA neurons. For this, we first lowered the K<sup>+</sup> concentration in the extracellular ACSF from 3 mM to 1.5 mM to increase the gradient between inside and outside cellular K<sup>+</sup>; this maneuver indeed hyperpolarized the cell membrane from -55.00 ± 2.74 mV to -66.40 ± 3.28 mV (n = 5, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 mV) (<bold>sFig. 4C</bold>). Interestingly, under 1.5 mM extracellular K<sup>+</sup>, the spontaneous firing of the VTA DA neurons was almost totally blocked by ZD7288 (<bold>sFig. 4D</bold>), although an initial enhancement was seen in some neurons (<bold>sFig. 4Di</bold>).</p>
<p>We tested another possible mechanism for HCN’s failure to participate in generation of VTA DA firing. It has been reported that in the midbrain SNc DA neurons, HCN is involved in the spontaneous firing in young but not in adult mice, due to a more hyperpolarization-shifted activation threshold of HCN in SNc DA neurons in adult mice. We tested if this could also be the case in the VTA DA neurons. Indeed, as shown in <bold>sFig. 4E</bold>, in contrast to what we saw in adult mice, the spontaneous firing frequency of the VTA DA neurons in young mice (less than 15 days postnatal) was significantly reduced by ZD7288 (from 1.86 ± 0.29 Hz to 0.98 ± 0.24 Hz, n = 9, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01).</p>
<p>Taken together, above results suggest HCN is not involved in the spontaneous firing of the VTA DA neurons in adult mice, due to a depolarized RMP and a hyperpolarization-shifted activation property.</p>

<p>To observe a more specific effect on NALCN, a shRNA against NALCN was used to knockdown NALCN.

<p>General roles of TRP channels in subthreshold depolarization and spontaneous firing of the VTA DA neurons were first assessed using two non-specific broad-spectrum TRP channel blockers, 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborane (2-APB; 100 μM) and flufenamicacid (FFA; 100 μM). Both TRP channel blockers significantly reduced the firing frequency of the VTA DA neurons (2-APB: from 1.32 ± 0.27 Hz to 0.06 ± 0.02 Hz, n = 12, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; FFA: from 1.38 ± 0.17 Hz to 0.52 ± 0.06 Hz, n = 13, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref></bold>). Accordingly, both blockers also significantly hyperpolarized the RMP of the VTA DA neurons (2-APB: from -51.01 ± 2.20 mV to -61.64 ± 1.28 mV, n = 6, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01; FFA: from -50.50 ± 2.36 mV to -69.65 ± 2.06 mV, n = 6, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01; <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>We then tested a more TRPV channel-specific blocker ruthenium red (RR), to study possible role of TRPV2 (and other TRPV) in the spontaneous firing of the VTA DA neurons. RR (60 μM), on average statistically, did not affect the spontaneous firing of the VTA DA neurons (from 2.30 ± 0.31 Hz to 2.18 ± 0.32 Hz, n = 9, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) (<bold>sFig. 5</bold>). However, it needs to be noted that among the nine VTA DA neurons we tested, both increase (<bold>sFig. 5B</bold>) and decrease (<bold>sFig. 5C</bold>) of firing frequency by RR were seen, thus with opposite changes of firing frequency in different populations of neurons (<bold>sFig. 5A</bold>), no overall effect of RR was obtained from the current analysis.</p>
<p>We then focused our next study on TRPC6. In consistent with both RNA-Seq (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 2B</bold></xref>) and single-cell PCR (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 4A</bold></xref>) results, the mRNA level of TRPC6 in mPFC-projecting VTA single DA neuron is significantly lower than that in NAc c-projecting VTA single DA neuron (0.56 ± 0.12, n = 25 for mPFC-projecting TH-positive cells <italic>vs</italic> 1.09 ± 0.10, n = 28 for NAc c-projecting TH-positive cells, ** <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 5A</bold></xref>) The immunofluorescence results also demonstrated strong expression of TRPC6 protein in the VTA DA neurons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 5B</bold></xref>, TH-positive). A AAV viral construct with shRNA against TRPC6 (AAV9-U6-shRNA (TRPC6)-CMV-GFP) was injected into the VTA of mice, to knockdown TRPC6; efficiency of this knockdown was assessed by using qPCR measuring the mRNA level of TRPC6 in the VTA tissue (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 5C</bold></xref>), and efficiency of viral infection into the VTA DA neurons (marked by DAT) was observed through visualization of GFP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 5D</bold></xref>). Both qPCR (Fig. <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref></bold>) and immunofluorescence (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 5D</bold></xref>) results indicated a sufficient repression of TRPC6 in the VTA DA neurons. Indicative of a significant role in the spontaneous firing and subthreshold depolarization, knockdown of TRPC6 (TRPC6-KD) resulted in a substantial reduction in the spontaneous firing frequency (0.80 ± 0.25 Hz, n = 9 for TRPC6-KD <italic>vs</italic> 1.90 ± 0.27 Hz, n = 9 for scramble-shRNA, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 5E</bold></xref>), and hyperpolarization of the RMP (-58.21 ± 1.79 mV, n = 10 for TRPC6-KD <italic>vs</italic> -50.02 ± 0.67 mV, n = 10 scramble-shRNA, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 5G</bold></xref>) of the VTA DA neurons. In addition, the inhibitory effect of 2-APB on the firing of VTA DA neurons infected with TRPC6-shRNA largely diminished, with no statistical difference in firing frequency before and after dosing (from 0.58 ± 0.15 Hz to 0.40 ± 0.15 Hz, n = 7, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 5F</bold></xref>).</p>

<p>It has been shown that a reduced firing activity in the VTA DA neurons is responsible for the depression-like behavior in the CMUS model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. In consistent with this finding, we also found the firing frequency of the VTA DA neurons from the CMUS mice was significantly reduced as compared with that from the control mice (2.83 ± 0.42 Hz, n = 18 for control mice <italic>vs</italic> 1.30 ± 0.14 Hz, n = 28 for CMUS mice, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 6C</bold></xref>). In agreement with a role for TRPC6 in this reduced firing activity, TRPC6 protein in the VTA tissue was found to be down-regulated in western blot experiments (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 6D</bold></xref>). On the other hand, NALCN protein in the VTA was not altered in the CMUS mice model of depression (<bold>sFig. 7</bold>).</p>
<p>We also tested if this down-regulation of TRPC6 protein could also be found in a similar but different model of depression. For this, a chronic restraint stress (CRS) model was used. After 3 weeks of restraint stress stimulation, the CRS mice developed similar depression/anxiety behavior in the behavior tests like these similarly performed in the CMUS model (<bold>sFig. 8A-G</bold>). Importantly, mice with CRS-induced depression also showed a significant downregulation of TRPC6 protein in the VTA (0.43 ± 0.09-fold, n = 6 for control and n = 9 for CRS, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, <bold>sFig. 8H</bold>).</p>
<p>It is known that CMUS mainly decreases the activity of VTA dopamine neurons that project to mPFC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. To prove further that the decreased firing activity of the mPFC-projecting VTA DA neurons in the CMUS mice was associated with the down-regulation of TRPC6 expression, we reasoned that a down-regulated TRPC6 would play a less role in a reduced firing activity like that found in the CMUS mice, thus the firing activity in these mice would respond less to the TRP channel inhibitors. Indeed, TRP channel inhibitor 2-APB lost its inhibitory effect on the firing activity of the mPFC-projecting VTA DA neurons from the CMUS mice (1.61 ± 0.23Hz to 1.19 ± 0.22 Hz, n = 15, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) but not from the control mice (3.74 ± 0.42 Hz to 0.17 ± 0.09 Hz, n = 12, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 6E</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>Down-regulation of TRPC6 in the VTA DA neurons confer the mice with depression-like behavior</title>
<p>If down-regulation of TRPC6 is crucial for the depression-like behaviors, like that indicated above in the CMUS and the CRS depression models, then down regulation of TRPC6 in non-stressfully treated mice should also develop depression-like behavior. We tested this possibility by selectively knocking down TRPC6 in the VTA DA neurons, using DAT-Cre mice injected with a AAV viral construct (AAV9-hSyn-DIO-shRNA (TRPC6) -RFP) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 7A</bold></xref>), driving the expression of shRNA against TRPC6 selectively in the VTA DA neurons.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we made a systematic study on the molecular mechanism for the subthreshold depolarization that drive spontaneous firing of the VTA DA neurons. We identified TRPC6 channels, alongside NALCN, as major contributors to this subthreshold depolarization and related spontaneous firing, and further importantly, we also demonstrated that TRPC6 contributed to the altered firing activity of the VTA DA neurons under states of depression behaviors.</p>
<p>The featured nature of a relatively depolarized resting membrane potential in the VTA DA neurons imposes a need for a full understanding of the channel conductance underlying this depolarization. It is first clear from this current and previous studies that this conductance is mediated by a persistent Na<sup>+</sup> influx. Unlike the DA neurons in the SNc, where Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is needed for the spontaneous firing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, the results in our and others’ studies indicate Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx are not necessary for the spontaneous firing of the VTA DA neurons, rather, replacement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions in the extracellular fluid with Mg<sup>2+</sup> accelerates the frequency of spontaneous firing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, possibly due to a reduced activity of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> currents. In consistent with these finding and more precisely for a role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx on the subthreshold depolarization, removing extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> did not hyperpolarize the RMP. On the other hand, in consistent the previous study <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, a TTX-insensitive Na<sup>+</sup> influx clearly contributed to the subthreshold depolarization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>A TTX-insensitive nature of this Na<sup>+</sup> conductance suggests it is likely that cation conductance permeable to Na<sup>+</sup> are the molecular correlates. We first focused on the HCN channels because, (1) it has been suggested HCN channels are important regulators for the spontaneous firing of VTA DA neurons under states of depression behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>; (2) HCN are among most highly expressed NSCCs in the VTA DA neurons in our single cell RNA-Seq study; (3) HCN are permeable to Na<sup>+</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. However, it is clear from our study that HCN does not contribute to the spontaneous firing of the VTA DA neurons in the adult mice; none of the known HCN blockers we used had any significant effects on the firing activity. Presence of HCN has long been used as a signature of DA neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, also as a differentiating factor for the projection-specificity of the VTA DA neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, contribution of HCN to the spontaneous firing of the VTA DA neurons has been controversial; the HCN blockers ZD7288 and CsCl have been reported as both effective<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> and non-effective <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> on the spontaneous firing of the VTA DA neurons. A closer inspection into our and others’ results present a possible explanation for these different results: in the younger rodents (less than one month old) (sFig. 4) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, the HCN in the DA neurons play a more important role whereas in the adult mice (∼ 8 weeks)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, like the ones we used in this study, the HCN do not contribute to the spontaneous firing of the VTA DA neurons. This is likely due to a shift of activation gating of HCN channels in a hyperpolarization direction with age, thus the modulation of HCN on the firing activity diminishes with age, as it is described in the SNc DA neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. In consistent with this, we found hyperpolarizing the RMP rendered the VTA DA neurons of the adult mice with sensitivity to the HCN blockers. Thus, the VTA DA neurons in adult mice do not use HCN to depolarize the membrane to generate action potentials.</p>
<p>NALCN is widely expressed in central neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>, and is a popular candidate considered for the ion mechanism of the subthreshold depolarization currents and Na<sup>+</sup> leaky currents. NALCN has been shown to be an important component of background Na<sup>+</sup> currents and to be important for neuronal excitability in the hippocampal neurons, posterior rhomboid nucleus (Retrotrapezoid nucleus/RTN)) chemo-sensitive neurons (CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-sensitive neurons), GABA neurons and DA neurons in the substantia nigra, spinal projection neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, 28–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Our results with single cell RNA-Seq and immunofluorescence methods validated high level expression of NALCN in the VTA DA neurons; both the pharmacological and the NALCN-gene-knockout experiments demonstrated convincingly involvement of NALCN in subthreshold depolarization and spontaneous firing of the VTA DA neurons.</p>
<p>We did not detect alteration of NALCN protein expression in the depression model of CMUS in the VTA tissue. However, this does not completely exclude a possible contribution of NALCN to the altered functional activity of the VTA DA neurons which underlies the depression behaviors. Future study focusing on the functional property of NALCN in the cellular level of the VTA DA neurons under a state of depression is needed to clarify this issue. NALCN is after all a potential drug target in consideration of its important contribution to the resting membrane potential and functional activity of neurons.</p>
<p>The most interesting and important finding of this study is the role of TRPC6 in regulation of the firing activity of the VTA DA neurons in both physiological and depression-state conditions, and its involvement in depression-like behaviors; the experimental evidence from pharmacological, gene silencing, electrophysiological and behavior results unambiguously support this conclusion. It is interesting to note, although with an unclear neuronal circuit mechanism of action, the TRPC6 channel opener hyperforin was previously reported to have antidepressant effects in corticosterone-depressed mice, which were reversed by prior administration of the TRPC6 blocker larixyl acetate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Also, in a CMUS rat model, TRPC6 expression was found to be downregulated in the hippocampus, and administration of the TRPC6 opener hyperforin was effective in alleviating depression-like behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Our study provides strong and convincing evidence that TRPC6 is a key regulator of the VTA DA neurons which are known to be a key player in depression states <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, 57–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned role for TRPC6 should come from its contribution to the subthreshold depolarization, through a persistent permeation to the influx of Na<sup>+</sup>. Although TRPC channels has been better recognized for their permeability to Ca<sup>2+</sup> and their regulation on cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, the importance of TRPC channels for the permeability of monovalent cations, especially Na<sup>+</sup>, is now gradually being appreciated <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. In the substantial nigra GABA and DA neurons, TRPC3 has been reported to play an important role in maintaining depolarization membrane potential, pacemaking, and firing regularity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. TRPC6 and TRPC3 belong to the same TRPC family subclass and TRPC6 is more than 75% homologous to TRPC3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Interestingly, our results with RNA-Seq and single-cell PCR demonstrated the rich expression of TRPC6 in the VTA DA neurons among all TRP channels but no expression of TRPC3 was found in these neurons. These results present an opportunity for selectively targeting a single TRPC channel to exert selective pharmacological results.</p>
<p>It has also been demonstrated in cell types other than neurons, such as rat portal vein smooth muscle cells, the activation of α-adrenergic receptor can open TRPC6, which leads to cell depolarization, activation of voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, and ultimately the contraction of smooth muscle cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>; it is also shown that angiotensin II and endothelin I can activate TRPC3/C6 heterodimers via vascular G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), thereby depolarizing cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. Following this line, it would be very interesting to know if TRPC6 in the VTA DA neurons, where multiple GPCR reside receiving input and auto modulation by neuronal transmitters <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>, could also be a target of modulation with similar mechanism. In consideration of the important role we described here in this study, this type of modulation will present possible explanations for some unsolved mechanism for physiological and pathophysiological functions of the VTA DA neurons.</p>
<p>The facts that downregulation of TRPC6 proteins was correlated with reduced firing activity of the VTA DA neurons, the depression-like behaviors, and that knocking down of TRPC6 in the VTA DA neurons confer the mice with depression behaviors strongly suggest a crucial role for TRPC6 in the development of depression-like behaviors under stressful conditions like CMUS. To reinforce this, downregulation of TRPC6 was also found in another depression model of CRS, a model with similar neuronal alteration of reduced firing activity in the VTA DA neurons to that described in the CMUS model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. These facts with the fact that TRPC6 activator hyperforin is an effective antidepressant in multiple depression model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>, and that hyperforin is the principal component of St. John’s wort, a well-known antidepressant herb<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>, present TRPC6 as very attractive drug target for new lines of antidepressants.</p>

<title>Brain slice preparation</title>
<p>The details for the preparation of coronal brain slice containing VTA were the same as described in our previously published work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (200 mg/kg, i.p.). After intracardial perfusion with ice-cold sucrose solution, the brains of the mice were removed quickly and placed into the slicing solution. The ice-cold sucrose-cutting solution contained (in mM): sucrose 260, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 25, KCl 2.5, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.25, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 2, and D-glucose 10; osmolarity, 295-305 mOsm). Using the vibratome (VT1200S; Leica, Germany), the coronal midbrain slices (250 µm-thick) containing VTA were sectioned. The slices were incubated for 30 min at 36°C in oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) (in mM: NaCl 130, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 2, KCl 3, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>-2H<sub>2</sub>O 1.25, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2, D-Glucose 10, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 26; osmolarity, 280-300 mOsm), and were then left for recovery for 60 min at room temperature (23-25°C) until use.</p>

<title>Identification of DA neurons and electrophysiological recordings</title>
<p>Recordings in the slices were performed in whole-cell current-clamp and voltage-clamp configurations on the Axoclamp 700B preamplifier (Molecular Devices, USA) coupled with a Digidata 1550B AD converter (Molecular Devices, USA). Neurons in the VTA were visualized with a 40X water-immersion objective equipped by an optiMOS microscope camera (Qimaging, Canada) on an Olympus-BX51 microscope (Olympus, Japan). Projection-specific or GFP-positive VTA neurons were identified by infrared-differential interference contrast (IR-DIC) video microscopy and epifluorescence (Olympus, Japan) for detection of retrobeads (red) positive or GFP-positive neurons.</p>
<p>For whole-cell recording, glass electrodes (3-5 MΩ) were filled with internal solution (in mM): K-methylsulfate 115, KCl 20, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1, HEPES 10, EGTA 0.1, MgATP 2 and Na<sub>2</sub>GTP 0.3, pH adjusted to 7.4 with KOH. And the extracellular solution was the ACSF.</p>
<p>In whole-cell current-clamp mode, HCN function was judged by the inwardly rectifying characteristic sag potential generated by giving a hyperpolarizing current (-100 pA).</p>
<p>When recording the effect of removing extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> on spontaneous cell discharge, CaCl<sub>2</sub> in the ACSF was replaced with MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and the final MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentration was 4 mM.</p>
<p>The resting membrane potential (RMP) was measured in current clamp mode (I = 0); the composition of the recording solution (mM) contained: NaCl 151, KCl 3.5, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1, glucose 10, and HEPES 10, and the pH was adjusted to about 7.35 with NaOH. 1 μM tetrodotoxin was added to the extracellular solution to abolish action potential during measurement of the RMP.</p>
<p>To observe the effect of extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> on the RMP, NaCl in the original recording solution was replaced with equimolar NMDG, and the NMDG-recording solution (mM) contained: NMDG 151, KCl 3.5, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1, glucose 10, and HEPES 10, and the pH was adjusted to 7.35 with KOH.</p>
<p>For recording spontaneous firing of the neurons, cell-attached “loose-patch” (100-300 MΩ) recordings were used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. In this case, patch-pipettes (2-4 MΩ) were filled with ACSF, and the spontaneous activity was recorded in the current-clamp mode (I = 0). The synaptic blockers (CNQX, 10 μM; APV, 50 μM and gabazine, 10 μM) were added to isolate the intrinsic firing properties.</p>

Red retrobeads (100 nl for single injection; Lumafluor Inc., Naples, FL, USA) were injected into the following sites using KD scientific syringe pump (KD scientific, Holliston MA, USA): bilaterally into NAc core (NAc c), NAc lateral shell (NAc ls), NAc medial shell (NAc ms) and basolateral amygdala (BLA), 4 separate sites (2 per hemisphere) into medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Coordinates for infusions were as follows: NAc c (AP +1.50, LM 0.84, DV -4.0; 100 nl beads); NAc ls (AP +0.86, LM 1.72, DV -4.0; 100 nl beads); NAc ms (AP +1.70, LM 0.53, DV -4.0; 100 nl beads); mPFC (AP +2.05 and 2.15, LM 0.27, DV -2.1 + 1.7; 200 nl beads); BLA (AP -1.46, LM 2.85, DV -4.3; 100 nL beads). Retrobeads were delivered through a pulled glass pipette using a PAP107 Multipipette Puller (MicroData Instrument, Inc., USA) and at a rate of 100 nl/min; the injection needle was left in place for at least 5 minutes after each infusion. Following surgery, mice were returned to single housing. For sufficient labelling, survival periods for retrograde tracer transport depended on respective injection areas: NAc c, NAc ls, NAc ms, 14 days; mPFC, 21 days; BLA 14 days.

<title>Single cell PCR</title>
<p>mRNA was reversely transcribed to cDNA by PrimeScript<sup>TM</sup>II1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Takara-Clontech, Kyoto, Japan). At the end of electrophysiological recordings, the recorded neuron was aspirated into a pipette and then expelled into a PCR sterile tube containing 1 µl oligo-dT Primer and 1 µl dNTP mixture. The mixture was heated to 65°C for 5 min to denature the nucleic acids and then cooled on ice for 2 min. Reverse transcription from mRNA into cDNA was performed at 50°C for 50 min and then 85°C for 5 sec. cDNA was stored at -40°C. Then two rounds of conventional PCR with pairs of gene-specific outside (first round) and inner primers (second round) for GAPDH (positive control), TH, DAT, D2, GIRK2, Vgult2, GAD1, NALCN, TRPC6, TRPV2 and TRPC3 using GoTaq Green Master Mix (Promega, Madison, USA) were performed. After adding the specific outside primer pairs into each PCR tube, first-round synthesis conditions were as follows: 95 °C (5 min); 30 cycles of 95 °C (50 s), 58-62 °C (50 s), 72 °C (50 s); 72 °C (5 min). Then, the product of the first PCR was added in the second amplification round by using specific inner primer (final volume 25 μl). The second amplification round consisted of the following: 95 °C (5 min); 35 cycles of 95 °C (50 s), 58 °C-62 °C (45 s), 72 °C (50 s) and 5 min elongation at 72 °C.

<title>Single cell RT-qPCR</title>
<p>Following the retrograde labelling and VTA brain slice preparation, projection-specific VTA neurons were identified by infrared-differential interference contrast (IR-DIC) video microscopy and epifluorescence (Olympus, Japan) for detection of retrobeads (red) positive neurons. mRNA was reversely transcribed to cDNA by PrimeScript<sup>TM</sup>II1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Takara-Clontech, Kyoto, Japan). The projection-specific neurons was aspirated into a pipette and then expelled into a PCR sterile tube containing 1 µl oligo-dT Primer and 1 µl dNTP mixture. The mixture was heated to 65°C for 5 min to denature the nucleic acids and then cooled on ice for 2 min. Reverse transcription from mRNA into cDNA was performed at 50°C for 50 min and then 85°C for 5 sec. cDNA was stored at -40°C. The targeted pre-amplification was done, with pairs of targeted primers for GAPDH, TH and TRPC6, to quantify multiple targets per cell. After adding the targeted primer pairs into each PCR tube, the synthesis conditions were as follows: 95 °C (5 min); 10 cycles of 95 °C (50 s), 58-62 °C (50 s), 72 °C (50 s); 72 °C (5 min). After targeted pre-amplification, Quantitative PCR (qPCR) is the final laboratory step of the scRT-qPCR workflow with the SYBR Green Master Mix (TaKaRa).</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study examined the mechanisms underlying reduced excitability of ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons in mice that underwent a chronic mild unpredictable stress treatment. The authors identify NALCN and TRPC6 channels as key mechanisms that regulate spontaneous firing of ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons and examined their roles in reduced firing in mice that underwent a chronic mild unpredictable stress treatment. The evidence supporting the authors' conclusions are <bold>solid</bold> yet the reviewers pointed out some limitations in the study including statistics, specificity in pharmacological and gene knockdown experiments, and the relevance to depressions.</p>

<p>Wang et al., present a paper aiming to identify NALCN and TRPC6 channels as key mechanisms regulating VTA dopaminergic neuron spontaneous firing and investigating whether these mechanisms are disrupted in a chronic unpredictable stress model mouse.</p>
<p>Major strengths:</p>
<p>-This paper uses multiple approaches to investigate the role of NALCN and TRPC6 channels in VTA dopaminergic neurons.</p>
<p>Major weaknesses:</p>
<p>-The pharmacological tools used in this study are highly non-selective. Gd3+, used here to block NALCN is actually more commonly used to block TRP channels. 2-APB inhibits not only TRPC channels, but also TRPM and IP3 receptors while stimulating TRPV channels (Bon and Beech, 2013), while FFA actually stimulates TRPC6 channels while inhibiting other TRPCs (Foster et al., 2009).</p>
<p>Are the author's claims supported by the data?</p>
<p>-The multimodal approach including shRNA knockdown experiments alleviates much of the concern about the non-specific pharmacological agents. Therefore, the author's claim that NALCN is involved in VTA dopaminergic neuron pacemaking is well-supported.</p>
<p>-However, the claim that TRPC6 is the key TRPC channel in VTA spontaneous firing is somewhat, but not completely supported. As with NALCN above, the pharmacology alone is much too non-specific to support the claim that TRPC6 is the TRP channel responsible for pacemaking. However, unlike the NALCN condition, there is an issue with interpreting the shRNA knockdown experiments. The issue is that TRPC channels often form heteromers with TRPC channels of other types (Goel, Sinkins and Schilling, 2002; Strübing et al., 2003). Therefore, it is possible that knocking down TRPC6 is interfering with the normal function of another TRPC channel, such as TRPC7 or TRPC4.</p>
<p>-The claim that TRPC6 channels in the VTA are involved in the depressive-like symptoms of CMUS is supported.</p>
<p>- However, the connection between the mPFC-projecting VTA neurons, TRPC6 channels, and the chronic unpredictable stress model (CMUS) of depression is not well supported. In Figure 2, it appears that the mPFC-projecting VTA neurons have very low TRPC6 expression compared to VTA neurons projecting to other targets. However, in figure 6, the authors focus on the mPFC-projecting neurons in their CMUS model and show that it is these neurons that are no longer sensitive to pharmacological agents non-specifically blocking TRPC channels (2-APB, see above comment). Finally, in figure 7, the authors show that shRNA knockdown of TRPC6 channels (in all VTA dopaminergic neurons) results in depressive-like symptoms in CMUS mice. Due to the low expression of TRPC6 in mPFC-projecting VTA neurons, the author's claims of &quot;broad and strong expression of TRPC6 channels across VTA DA neurons&quot; is not fully supported. Because of the messy pharmacological tools used, it cannot be clamed that TRPC6 in the mPFC-projecting VTA neurons is altered after CMUS. And because the knockdown experiments are not specific to mPFC-projecting VTA neurons, it cannot be claimed that reducing TRPC6 in these specific neurons is causing depressive symptoms.</p>
<p>Impact:</p>
<p>It is valuable to compare pacemaking mechanisms in VTA and SNc neurons and this paper convincingly shows that NALCN contributes to VTA pacemaking, as it is known to contribute to SNc pacemaking. It also shows that TRPC6 channels in VTA dopamine neurons contribute to the depressive-like symptoms associated with CMUS.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the experiments presented in Figure 1 have all been previously performed in VTA dopaminergic neurons (Khaliq and Bean, 2010) including showing that low calcium increases VTA neuron spontaneous firing frequency and that replacement of sodium with NMDG hyperpolarizes the membrane potential.</p>
<p>Additional context:</p>
<p>-The authors explanation for the increase in firing frequency in 0 calcium conditions is that calcium-activated potassium channels would no longer be activated. However, there is a highly relevant finding that low calcium enhances the NALCN conductance through the calcium sensing receptor from Dejian Ren's lab (Lu et al., 2010) which is not cited in this paper. This increase in NALCN conductance with low calcium has been shown in SNc dopaminergic neurons (Philippart and Khaliq, 2018), and is likely a factor contributing to the low-calcium-mediated increase in spontaneous VTA neuron firing.</p>
<p>-One of the only demonstrations of the expression and physiological significance of TRPCs in VTA DA neurons was published by (Rasmus et al., 2011; Klipec et al., 2016) which are not cited in this paper. In their study, TRPC4 expression was detected in a uniformly distributed subset of VTA DA neurons, and TRPC4 KO rats showed decreased VTA DA neuron tonic firing and deficits in cocaine reward and social behaviors.</p>
<p>- Out of all seven TRPCs, TRPC5 is the only one reported to have basal/constitutive activity in heterologous expression systems (Schaefer et al., 2000; Jeon et al., 2012). Others TRPCs such as TRPC6 are typically activated by Gq-coupled GPCRs. Why would TRPC6 be spontaneously/constitutively active in VTA DA neurons?</p>
<p>-A new paper from the group of Myoung Kyu Park (Hahn et al., 2023) shows in great detail the interactions between NALCN and TRPC3 channels in pacemaking of SNc DA neurons.</p>

<p>This paper describes the results of a set of complementary and convergent experiments aimed at describing roles for the non-selective cation channels NALCN and TRPC6 in mediating subthreshold inward depolarizing currents and action potential generation in VTA DA neurons under normal physiological conditions. That said, some datasets are underpowered, and general flaws in statistical reporting make assessment difficult. There is also a lack of clarity at various points throughout the manuscript, as well as overinterpretation of the data generated in these experiments. Specific comments follow:</p>
<p>1. These results do not show that TRPC6 mediates stress effects on depression-like behavior. As stated by the authors in the first sentence of the final paragraph, &quot;downregulation of TRPC6 proteins was correlated with reduced firing activity of the VTA DA neurons, the depression-like behaviors, and that knocking down of TRPC6 in the VTA DA neurons confer the mice with depression behaviors.&quot; Therefore, the results show associations between TRPC6 downregulation and stress effects on behavior, occlusion of the effects of one by the other on some outcome measures, and cell manipulation effects that resemble stress effects. There is no experiment that shows reversal of stress effects with cell/circuit-specific TRPC6 manipulations. Please adjust the title, abstract and interpretation accordingly.</p>
<p>
2. Statistical tests and results are unclear throughout. For all analyses, please report specific tests used, factors/groups, test statistic and p-value for all data analyses reported. In some cases, the chosen test is not appropriate. For example, in Figure 6E, it is not clear how an experiment with 2 factors (stress and drug) can be analyzed with a 1-way RM ANOVA. The potential impact of inappropriate statistical tests on results makes it difficult to assess the accuracy of data interpretation.</p>
<p>
3. Why were only male mice used? Please justify and discuss in the manuscript. Also, change the title to reflect this.</p>
<p>
4. Number of recorded cells is very low in Figure 1. Where in VTA did recordings occur? Given the heterogeneity in this brain region, this n may be insufficient. Additional information (e.g., location within VTA, criteria used to identify neurons) should be included. Report the number of mice (i.e., n = 6 cells from X mice) in all figures.</p>
<p>
5. Authors refer to VTA DA neurons as those that are DAT+ in line 276, although TH expression is considered the standard of DAergic identity, and studies (e.g., Lammel et al, 2008) have shown that a subset of VTA DA neurons have low levels of DAT expression. Authors should reword/clarify that these are DAT-expressing VTA DA neurons.</p>
<p>
6. Neuronal subtype proportions should be quantified and reported (Fig. 1Aii).</p>
<p>
7. In addition to reporting projection specificity of neurons expressing specific channels, it would be ideal to report these data according to spatial location in VTA.</p>
<p>
8. The authors state that there are a small number of Glut neurons in VTA, then they state that a &quot;significant proportion&quot; of VTA neurons are glutamatergic.</p>
<p>
9. It is an overstatement that VTA DA neurons are the key determinant of abnormal behaviors in affective disorders.</p>

<p>The authors of this study have examined which cation channels specifically confer to ventral tegmental area dopaminergic neurons their autonomic (spontaneous) firing properties. Having brought evidence for the key role played by NALCN and TRPC6 channels therein, the authors aimed at measuring whether these channels play some role in so-called depression-like (but see below) behaviors triggered by chronic exposure to different stressors. Following evidence for a down-regulation of TRPC6 protein expression in ventral tegmental area dopaminergic cells of stressed animals, the authors provide evidence through viral expression protocols for a causal link between such a down-regulation and so-called depression-like behaviors. The main strength of this study lies on a comprehensive bottom-up approach ranging from patch-clamp recordings to behavioral tasks. However, the interpretation of the results gathered from these behavioral tasks might also be considered one main weakness of the abovementioned approach. Thus, the authors make a confusion (widely observed in numerous publications) with regard to the use of paradigms (forced swim test, tail suspension test) initially aimed (and hence validated) at detecting the antidepressant effects of drugs and which by no means provide clues on &quot;depression&quot; in their subjects. Indeed, in their hands, the authors report that stress elicits changes in these tests which are opposed to those theoretically seen after antidepressant medication. However, these results do not imply that these changes reflect &quot;depression&quot; but rather that the individuals under scrutiny simply show different responses from those seen in nonstressed animals. These limits are even more valid in nonstressed animals injected with TRPC6 shRNAs (how can 5-min tests be compared to a complex and chronic pathological state such as depression?). With regard to anxiety, as investigated with the elevated plus-maze and the open field, the data, as reported, do not allow to check the author's interpretation as anxiety indices are either not correctly provided (e.g. absolute open arm data instead of percents of open arm visits without mention of closed arm behaviors) or subjected to possible biases (lack of distinction between central and peripheral components of the apparatus).</p>

<p>Comment 1:</p>
<p>The pharmacological tools used in this study are highly non-selective. Gd3+, used here to block NALCN is actually more commonly used to block TRP channels. 2-APB inhibits not only TRPC channels, but also TRPM and IP3 receptors while stimulating TRPV channels (Bon and Beech, 2013), while FFA actually stimulates TRPC6 channels while inhibiting other TRPCs (Foster et al., 2009).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that the substances mentioned are not specific. Although we performed shRNA experiments against NALCN and TRPC6, we do plan to use more specific pharmacological modulators for these two channels; for this, L703,606 (the antagonist of NALCN) [1] and larixyl acetate (a potent TRPC6 inhibitor) [2] will be used. Actually, we have completed experiments of using larixyl acetate and the results are shown in Author response image 1.</p>

<p>Comment 2:</p>
<p>The multimodal approach including shRNA knockdown experiments alleviates much of the concern about the non-specific pharmacological agents. Therefore, the author's claim that NALCN is involved in VTA dopaminergic neuron pacemaking is well-supported.</p>
<p>However, the claim that TRPC6 is the key TRPC channel in VTA spontaneous firing is somewhat, but not completely supported. As with NALCN above, the pharmacology alone is much too non-specific to support the claim that TRPC6 is the TRP channel responsible for pacemaking. However, unlike the NALCN condition, there is an issue with interpreting the shRNA knockdown experiments. The issue is that TRPC channels often form heteromers with TRPC channels of other types (Goel, Sinkins and Schilling, 2002; Strübing et al., 2003). Therefore, it is possible that knocking down TRPC6 is interfering with the normal function of another TRPC channel, such as TRPC7 or TRPC4.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>According with your advice, we plan to perform single-cell qPCR experiments to check the expression level of other TRPC channels, after selective knockdown of TRPC6 in VTA DAT+ neurons, results will be shown later in the revised version. From our single-cell RNA-seq results, TRPC7 and TRPC4 are found not to be present broadly like TRPC6 in the VTA DA neurons, therefore it is possible that knocking down TRPC6 maybe not interfering with the normal function of another TRPC channel, such as TRPC7 or TRPC4.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 3:</p>
<p>The claim that TRPC6 channels in the VTA are involved in the depressive-like symptoms of CMUS is supported.</p>
<p>However, the connection between the mPFC-projecting VTA neurons, TRPC6 channels, and the chronic unpredictable stress model (CMUS) of depression is not well supported. In Figure 2, it appears that the mPFC-projecting VTA neurons have very low TRPC6 expression compared to VTA neurons projecting to other targets. However, in figure 6, the authors focus on the mPFC-projecting neurons in their CMUS model and show that it is these neurons that are no longer sensitive to pharmacological agents non-specifically blocking TRPC channels (2-APB, see above comment). Finally, in figure 7, the authors show that shRNA knockdown of TRPC6 channels (in all VTA dopaminergic neurons) results in depressive-like symptoms in CMUS mice. Due to the low expression of TRPC6 in mPFC-projecting VTA neurons, the author's claims of &quot;broad and strong expression of TRPC6 channels across VTA DA neurons&quot; is not fully supported. Because of the messy pharmacological tools used, it cannot be clamed that TRPC6 in the mPFC-projecting VTA neurons is altered after CMUS. And because the knockdown experiments are not specific to mPFC-projecting VTA neurons, it cannot be claimed that reducing TRPC6 in these specific neurons is causing depressive symptoms.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reason we focused on the mPFC-projecting VTA DA neurons is that this pathway is indicated in depressive-like behaviors of the CMUS model[3-5]. Although mPFC-projecting VTA DA neurons seem have lower level of TRPC6, we reason they are still functional there. However, we do agree with the reviewer that the statement “broad and strong expression of TRPC6 channels across VTA DA neurons&quot; is not fully supported. We have changed the statements based on the reviewer suggestion. Furthermore, we also plan to selectively knockdown TRPC6 in the mPFC-projecting VTA DA neurons, and then study the behavior.</p>

<p>Comment 4:</p>
<p>It is important to note that the experiments presented in Figure 1 have all been previously performed in VTA dopaminergic neurons (Khaliq and Bean, 2010) including showing that low calcium increases VTA neuron spontaneous firing frequency and that replacement of sodium with NMDG hyperpolarizes the membrane potential.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with reviewer that similar experiments have been performed previously [6]for the flow of our manuscript and for general readers.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 5:</p>
<p>The authors explanation for the increase in firing frequency in 0 calcium conditions is that calcium-activated potassium channels would no longer be activated. However, there is a highly relevant finding that low calcium enhances the NALCN conductance through the calcium sensing receptor from Dejian Ren's lab (Lu et al., 2010) which is not cited in this paper. This increase in NALCN conductance with low calcium has been shown in SNc dopaminergic neurons (Philippart and Khaliq, 2018), and is likely a factor contributing to the low-calcium-mediated increase in spontaneous VTA neuron firing.</p>

<p>We agree with the reviewer and thanks for the suggestions. A discussion for this has been added.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 6:</p>
<p>One of the only demonstrations of the expression and physiological significance of TRPCs in VTA DA neurons was published by (Rasmus et al., 2011; Klipec et al., 2016) which are not cited in this paper. In their study, TRPC4 expression was detected in a uniformly distributed subset of VTA DA neurons, and TRPC4 KO rats showed decreased VTA DA neuron tonic firing and deficits in cocaine reward and social behaviors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion.The references and a discussion for this has been added.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 7:</p>
<p>Out of all seven TRPCs, TRPC5 is the only one reported to have basal/constitutive activity in heterologous expression systems (Schaefer et al., 2000; Jeon et al., 2012). Others TRPCs such as TRPC6 are typically activated by Gq-coupled GPCRs. Why would TRPC6 be spontaneously/constitutively active in VTA DA neurons?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In a complex neuronal environment where VTA DA neurons are located, multiple modulatory factors including the GPCRs could be dynamically active, this could lead to the activation of TRP channels including TRPC6.</p>

<p>Yes indeed, the number here is not high. More experiments will be performed to increase the N/n number.

<p>The study published by Lammel[9] in 2015 has shown the low dopamine specificity of transgene expression in ventral midbrain of TH-Cre mice; on the other hand, DAT-Cre mice exhibit dopamine-specific Cre expression patterns, although DAT-Cre mice are likely to suffer from their own limitations (for example, low DAT expression in mesocortical DA neurons may make it difficult to target this subpopulation, see Lammel et al., 2008[10]).

<p>We agree with the reviewer that behavior tests we used here is debatable whether they represent a real depression state, and this is an open question that could be discussed from different respective. Since these testes (forced swimming and tail suspension), as the reviewer noted, were “widely observed in numerous publications”, we used these seemly only options to reflect a “depression-like” state. One could argue that since these testes were initially used for testing antidepressants (“validated”), with decreased immobility time as indications of anti-depressive effects, why not an increased immobility time reflect a “depression-like” state.
As for anxiety tests, both absolute time in open and closed arms are now provided.</p>
