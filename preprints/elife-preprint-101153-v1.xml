<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) occur primarily in the small intestine, lung and pancreas. Due to their rarity compared to other malignancies in these organs, their complex biology remains poorly understood, including their oncogenesis, tumor composition and the intriguing phenomena of mixed neuroendocrine non-neuroendocrine neoplasms (MiNEN). Here we profiled ten low-grade small intestine NET (SiNET) tumor samples as well as one mixed lung tumor by single-cell or single-nuclei RNA-seq. We find that SiNETs are largely separated into two distinct subtypes, in which the neuroendocrine cells upregulate epithelial or neuronal markers, respectively. Surprisingly, in both subtypes the neuroendocrine cells are largely non-proliferative while higher proliferation is observed in multiple non-malignant cell types. Specifically, B and plasma cells are highly proliferative in the epithelial-like SiNET subtype, potentially reflecting the outcome of high Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) expression in those tumors, which may constitute a relevant target. Finally, our analysis of a mixed lung neuroendocrine tumor identifies a population of putative progenitor cells that may give rise to both neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine (squamous) cells, potentially explaining the origin of the mixed histology. Taken together, our results provide important insights and hypotheses regarding the biology of neuroendocrine neoplasms.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neuroendocrine cells are present throughout the body and are thought to give rise to neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) in multiple organs. Small intestine NETs (SiNETs) have the second highest incidence, after lung NETs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Histopathological grading of SiNET is based on mitoses rate and on the Ki67 proliferation index, with low-grade comprising G1 and G2, and high-grade comprising G3. In addition, neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) are included in the G3 category, and have poorly differentiated histopathological appearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>].</p>
<p>The majority of SiNETs are low grade well-differentiated tumors, usually diagnosed at advanced stages and often present with metastases and stage IV tumor, highlighting their high metastatic potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Interestingly, SiNETs are often multifocal, with a common finding of synchronous multiple primaries along the small intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Two recent studies demonstrated that synchronous SiNETs primaries within the same individual usually do not share somatic alterations, indicating that they arise from different cell clones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>].</p>
<p>SiNETs are usually sporadic, with a surprisingly low mutational burden or recurrent mutations, and show mainly chromosomal alterations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. The most frequent chromosomal aberration found in SiNETs is the loss of chromosome 18 as seen in 61-89% of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. In a cohort of 180 SiNETs, the most frequent mutation (found in 8% of tumors) were heterozygous frameshift mutations of <italic>CDKN1B</italic>, encoding the p27 cyclin regulator, suggesting a role of cell cycle deregulation in the progression of SiNETs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Further studies reported heterogeneity of the <italic>CDKN1B</italic> mutations even among lesions of the same patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Overall, there is a limited frequency and consistency of genetic aberrations in SiNETs, of which mechanisms of initiation and progression remain poorly understood.</p>
<p>Another intriguing phenomenon with respect to the large group of neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) is that they are sometimes accompanied by a carcinoma component, resulting in “mixed” neuroendocrine non-neuroendocrine neoplasms (MiNEN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. For a NEN to be termed mixed, it is necessary for each component to comprise at least 30% of the tumor, suggesting that many additional tumors may have both components but are not recognized as MiNEN. The origin of MiNENs remains unknown, and their complexity hinders conventional treatment approaches.</p>
<p>In this study, we sought to investigate the molecular characteristics of SiNETs to uncover novel insights into their oncogenic transformation, the resulting tumor ecosystems, and potential vulnerabilities. To this end, we applied single-cell transcriptomics to SiNETs a well as to one MiNEN.</p>

<title>Single cell and single nuclei RNA-seq profiling of SiNETs</title>
<p>To understand the tumor ecosystem of low-grade SiNETs, we generated scRNA-seq profiles for ten primary tumor samples from eight patients using 10x Chromium (<bold>Table S1</bold>). We profiled single cells from three fresh surgical samples (SiNET1-3) and single nuclei from the remaining seven frozen samples (SiNET4-10). After initial quality controls, we retained 29,198 cells from the ten patients (see Methods). For comparison, we also profiled one fresh small intestine adenocarcinoma (SiAdeno) and included it in our analyses.</p>
<p>We identified clusters of cells in each tumor and annotated them based on the expression of known marker genes as neuroendocrine (NE) cells, and as tumor microenvironment cells (TME) cells including T cells, B/plasma cells, macrophages, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, epithelial cells and natural killer (NK) cells (<bold>Table S2)</bold>. Clustering and marker expression of two exemplary SiNETs are shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-D</xref>, and the remaining tumors are shown in <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>. Cell type proportions varied considerably between tumors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). In five tumors NE cells were the most frequent, while other tumors had the highest frequency of other cell types, such as endothelial, fibroblast, epithelial or T cells. The unique composition of each tumor sample likely reflects a combination of tumor-specific biology with spatial sampling within the tumor. Technical effects (e.g. fresh vs. frozen samples) could also impact the capture of distinct cell types, although we did not observe a clear pattern of such bias.</p>

<title>Heterogeneity of NE cells reveals two SiNET subtypes</title>
<p>We next focused on the NE cells and defined both their common and their variable expression profiles across patients. To this end, we examined the eight samples (one per patient) in which we identified NE cells. We first compared NE cells from each tumor to non-NE cells from the same tumor and identified all genes that are upregulated in NE cells. Genes that were consistently upregulated in NE cells from most tumors (n&gt;5) were defined as common NE genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). These signature genes were specifically upregulated in NETs of the small intestine compared to other NETs that were profiled by bulk RNA-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], therefore defining an SiNET signature (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref><bold>, Table S3</bold>). The SiNET signature consists of 26 genes, including <italic>CHGA, CHGB</italic>, and <italic>TPH1</italic>, known markers of SiNET [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>] as well as of enterochromaffin cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. These genes were most significantly enriched with gene-sets associated with neuroendocrine-related functions such as exocytosis, Neurosecretory vesicle, and serotonergic synapse (all with adjusted <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="605642v1_fig2.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>However, many more genes were found as upregulated in NE cells of only few of the SiNETs, and these were separated into tumor specific (n=1, see <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref>) and subset-specific (between 2 and 5 tumors). Subset-specific genes may help to uncover functionally distinct subtypes of SiNETs and therefore we investigated them further. These genes exhibited nine distinct expression patterns across the ten SiNETs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref><bold>, Table S3</bold>). Notably, pattern #1, which was associated with the largest number of genes (n=26), was highly expressed in three tumors that had low expression of all other eight patterns. In contrast, the other seven tumors highly expressed genes from multiple patterns, and had low expression of pattern #1 genes. This analysis highlighted a division of the ten SiNETs into two primary clusters based on pattern #1 vs. all other patterns. Notably, the same division was clearly detected by clustering of the SiNETs based on the global expression profiles of NE cells in each tumor (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>The first subtype (SiNETs 1, 2 and 9) was associated with upregulation of 129 genes, including the epithelial markers <italic>EPCAM</italic> and <italic>KRT8</italic> (<bold>Table S4</bold>). The second subtype (SiNET3-8, 10) was associated with upregulation of 73 genes, including neuronal-related genes such as <italic>NAV3, RYR2, CACNA1A/B, KCNIP1</italic>. This led us to speculate that even though both subtypes express the neuroendocrine markers described above (i.e. common genes), the first subtype may have higher overall similarity to epithelial cells compared to the second subtype, which might have more neuronal features.</p>
<p>To examine this possibility, we evaluated the expression of other cell type signatures across NE cells from the two SiNET subtypes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Signatures of multiple epithelial cell types from the small intestine or from the lung, including those of enteroendocrine cells, were expressed more highly in subtype 1 than in subtype 2 SiNETs. Nevertheless, the expression of such epithelial signatures was considerably lower in NE cells from subtype 1 tumors than in bone-fide epithelial cells such as the non-malignant epithelial cells identified in SiNET6 or the malignant cells in the siAdeno tumor. Thus, epithelial signatures are upregulated in subtype 1 tumors but not at the same level as in bone-fide epithelial cells. Conversely, signatures of neuronal cell types had the opposite expression pattern – highest in subtype 2 SiNETs, intermediate in subtype 1 SiNETs and lowest in bone-fide epithelial cells. Based on these results we renamed subtypes 1 and 2 as the <italic>epithelial-like</italic> and <italic>neuronal-like</italic> SiNET subtypes.</p>
<p>To validate the existence of these two SiNET subtypes, we turned to analyze an external bulk RNA-seq dataset of SiNETs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. The signal of NE cells is diluted in bulk RNA-seq due to the profiling of entire tumor samples, and especially given the wide diversity of cell type compositions that we observe in single cell analysis (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). However, we wondered whether we would still be able to detect the two subtypes when directly analyzing the subset-specific genes defined above. Indeed, the 81 SiNET bulk profiles could be separated into the <italic>epithelial-like</italic> and <italic>neuronal-like</italic> subtypes based on expression of pattern #1 genes vs. the genes of the other patterns (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). Moreover, the proportion of the two subtypes (20% vs. 80%) were comparable to those seen in our single cell cohort (30% vs. 70%).</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Heterogeneity in the SiNET tumor microenvironment</title>
<p>Next, we examined the diversity of cellular states within each non-NE cell type of the tumor microenvironment (TME). For each cell type, we analyzed the diversity within each tumor, searching for distinguishable subpopulations of cells, their occurrence across tumors and their potential functional implications (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Below we briefly describe the three most notable cases of diversity within cell-type that we observed.</p>
<fig id="fig3" position="float" fig-type="figure">
<label>Figure 3.</label>
<caption><title>Heterogeneity in the SiNET tumor microenvironment.</title>
<p>For each of three non-malignant cell types, the diversity of that cell type is shown in one exemplary tumor: fibroblast heterogeneity in SiNET8 is shown in (<bold>A-C</bold>), endothelial cell heterogeneity in SiNET5 is shown in (<bold>D-F</bold>), and B-cell heterogeneity in SiNET2 is shown in (<bold>G-I</bold>). For each cell type, three panels depict three types of analyses. The first panel (<bold>A, D, G</bold>) is a UMAP plot of the respective tumor, where only the respective cell type is colored, and distinct colors highlight the clusters of that cell type. The second panel (<bold>B, E, H</bold>) shows differential expression analysis between the first two clusters using heatmaps, with labeling of selected genes. The third panel (<bold>C, F, I</bold>) shows clustering of cells from that cell type (columns) based on their relative expression of previously defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] signatures of diversity in that cell type (rows); the top panel shows assignment of cells to clusters.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="605642v1_fig3.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>Among fibroblasts, we found the highest diversity in SiNET8, with three distinguishable subpopulations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). To understand their differences, we both conducted a differential expression analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>) and compared their profiles to recently described fibroblast signatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). This analysis indicated that cluster 1 resembles other cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), while cluster 2 and 3 are distinguished by specific expression profiles. Cluster 3 cells were primarily distinguished by expression of MHC-II genes and are thus consistent with previous observations of antigen-presenting CAFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Cluster 2 cells upregulate several programs of pericytes and myofibroblasts, but are further distinguished by upregulation of four ABC-transporters (ABCA6, ABCA8, ABCA9 and ABCA10). To our knowledge, such consistent upregulation of multiple ABC transporters was not observed in previous analysis of CAF heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Yet, in our data, upregulation of ABC transporters was also detected in a subset of CAFs from SiNET3 and SiNET5 (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A-D</xref>). These results suggest a unique feature of CAFs in a subset of SiNETs, possibly due to the unique microenvironment of SiNETs.</p>
<p>Among endothelial cells, we found two highly distinct subpopulations in SiNET5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D-E</xref>). Comparison to pan-cancer endothelial signatures mapped the smaller subpopulation to the Endo2 poorly described signature that was detected primarily in lung and skin tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). Similar subpopulations of endothelial cells were also detected in SiNET2, highlighting the Endo2 signature as a recurrent pattern of subsets of SiNET endothelial cells (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3E-F</xref>).</p>
<p>Among B cells, two distinct populations were found in SiNET2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). Differential expression showed that the small B cell subpopulation is distinguished by upregulation of many cell cycle genes including canonical markers (MKI67, TOP2A, CDK1), reflecting proliferating B cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H-I</xref>). Moreover, we noticed that, among all SiNET2 cells, the canonical cell cycle markers are expressed in B cells more than in all other cell types, including the malignant NE cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). This observation prompted us to turn our attention to cell cycle patterns across all cell types within the SiNETs.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Proliferation of NE and immune cells in SiNETs</title>
<p>Most SiNETs are low-grade tumors with a low mitotic index, but the exact identify of proliferating cells in SiNET is unknown. We used previously defined signatures of the cell cycle to identify all cycling cells. Notably, as we and others demonstrated previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], cell cycle involves the consistent upregulation of dozens of canonical genes and therefore the cycling cells can be robustly detected by scRNA-seq along with their phase along the cell cycle (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>).</p>
<p>Surprisingly, extremely few cycling cells were observed among the malignant NE cells (0.246% on average) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). This fraction is considerably lower than what we detect in other cancers types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>], and as an extreme example from the same dataset, in the SiAdeno sample we find ∼13% of cycling epithelial cells using the same method (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>). Notably, the fraction of SiNET cycling cells was lower for NE cells than for all other cell types identified in the SiNET ecosystem (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>; see also <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>,<bold>D</bold>). Relatively high fractions of cycling cells (&gt;10%) were found only in epithelial or in B/plasma cells. Epithelial cells were only detected in two tumors, and of those only in one tumor they had a high fraction of cycling cells. In contrast, B/plasma cells were detected more commonly – in eight tumors – and in three of those they had a high fraction of cycling cells. The other cell types all had low-to-intermediate fractions of cycling cells across all SiNETs, but even those fractions were consistently higher than for the NE cells. Thus, at least in our SiNET cohort, proliferation is associated with the tumor microenvironment rather than with the NE cells. This result raises intriguing questions regarding the manner by which SiNETs grow, and the meaning of their mitotic index (see Discussion).</p>

<p>Next, to ensure that this result is not unique to our cohort we reanalyzed bulk RNA-seq data of 81 SiNET samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. We reasoned that if NE cells are a major source of proliferation, then cell cycle signatures should correlate with the expression of NE marker genes across bulk SiNET samples. Similarly, if other cell types, such as B cells or T cells, are more proliferative than the NE cells, then their markers should correlate with the cell cycle signature. As expected from the single cell analysis, we found that cell cycle signature significantly correlates positively with B cell markers, and to a more limited degree with T cell markers, but not with NE markers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>), supporting the broader relevance of our results.</p>

<title>B cell proliferation and MIF upregulation in the epithelial-like SiNET subtype</title>
<p>One potential explanation for the high proliferation of B cells is that our siNET samples may have included germinal centers (GC), in which B cells are expected to proliferate. To assess this possibility, we scored the B cells for a previously defined GC signature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. While two tumors with high B cell proliferation also had high GC scores, this was not the case for the third tumor (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>). Thus, inclusion of GCs may partially explain the unusual proliferation of B cells.</p>
<p>An alternative possibility is that B cells proliferate in response to particular signals in the SiNET microenvironment, for example, due to factors secreted by other cells. The proliferation of B/plasma cells was high only in three of the SiNETs and was absent or low in five other SiNETs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Intriguingly, all of the epithelial-like SiNETs had high B/plasma cell proliferation and all of the neuronal-like SiNETs (in which B/plasma cells were detected) had low proliferation of those cells. This perfect agreement with SiNET subtypes suggests that the unique features of the epithelial-like subtype may drive the proliferation of B/plasma cells. To identify such features, we defined the differential expression between the two subtypes for each cell type (<bold>Table S4)</bold>.</p>
<p>This analysis highlighted Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) as a prominent marker of the epithelial-like subtype that could potentially drive the proliferation of B/plasma cells. First, MIF was one of the top markers of the epithelial-like subtype in our analysis of NE cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), and a closer inspection reveals an extreme degree of differential expression, with almost no detected reads in the neuronal-like subtype and a consistently high expression in the epithelial-like subtype (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Second, upregulation of MIF in the epithelial-like subtype was also detected all other cell types, although the effect was strongest in NE cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Such consistent upregulation across six different cell types is not seen for any other genes, highlighting the unique upregulation of MIF in the ecosystem of the epithelial SiNETs, and supporting its potential causal effect in driving other phenotypes such as B/plasma cell proliferation. Third, MIF is an important cytokine that binds CD74 and was previously shown to regulate B cell proliferation by multiple studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>].</p>

<title>Putative progenitors in mixed tumors</title>
<p>Apart from our focus on SiNET, we were intrigued by the phenomena of MiNEN and aimed to profile such tumors by single cell RNA-seq. Due to their rarity and the difficulty of recognizing mixed tumors prior to their surgery, we were so far able to profile only one such tumor. This tumor was a Large Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma of the lung (LCNEC), mixed with a squamous cell carcinoma. While this tumor is highly different from SiNETs, we believe that this N-of-1 case study is of interest and raises important questions that might also be of relevance for SiNET and other NENs and hence we describe its analysis below.</p>
<p>We profiled the fresh LCNEC tumor sample by scRNA-seq using the 10x Chromium. Cells were first classified as malignant or non-malignant, based on inference of copy-number aberrations, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>] (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Clustering of the non-malignant cells and annotation of the clusters based on standard markers separated them into fibroblasts, endothelial cells, macrophages, T cells and B cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="605642v1_fig5.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>We found extensive diversity among the malignant cells, which highlighted several subpopulations of cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B-C</xref>). These include the two malignant components expected based on the classification as a mixed tumor – neuroendocrine cells (e.g. expressing CHGB and SSTR2) and epithelial squamous cells (e.g. expressing KRT5 and KRT8). The epithelial cells further varied in their expression of a program that we previously termed “epithelial senescence” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], which was indeed associated with lack of proliferation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Interestingly, we also found additional subpopulations of malignant cells with intermediate expression levels of both the neuroendocrine genes and the squamous genes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). The “intermediate” cells included two clusters that we termed <italic>undifferentiated</italic> and <italic>progenitors</italic>, since they were distinguished by expression of developmental and stemness-related regulators (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). These include the homeobox transcription factors PBX1 and PROX1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], The RNA-binding protein MSI2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>], the WNT-related TCF4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], and the NOTCH-related transcription factor HES6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>] (<bold>Table S5</bold>). All four malignant populations were highly proliferative, except for the subset of squamous cells that express the epithelial senescence program (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). The progenitor cluster, with intermediate expression of the two lineage programs and upregulation of stemness factors, is consistent with the possibility that stem/progenitor cells may give rise to the two differentiated components that constitute the mixed phenotype. Additional MiNENs would need to be profiled at single cell resolution to explore the generality of this observation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>While low-grade SiNETs are known to have a low mitotic index, any cancer is driven by cell proliferation such that malignant cells are expected to have higher cell cycle activity than non-malignant cells. Surprisingly, this does not seem to be the case in our analysis of SiNETs, where malignant cells appear to be less proliferative than multiple types of non-malignant cells. In such cases, it is conceivable that pathological evaluation of tumor proliferation (Ki67 counts) may be confounded by non-malignant cycling cells and therefore inflated. But a more fundamental question is how could those tumors initiate and progress when the NE cells appear to be largely non-proliferative?</p>
<p>We can envision multiple potential answers although further studies are needed to resolve these possibilities. First, since growth is determined by the balance between cellular proliferation, death and migration, SiNETs may still grow despite their very low proliferation through abnormally low death or abnormal patterns of migration. We are not aware of any evidence in support of this possibility but cannot exclude it. Second, proliferation of NE cells may be inhibited by prior treatments with Somatostatin analogues. Third, proliferation may be spatially or temporally restricted. Accordingly, higher proliferation may occur only in particular niches or at a particular time of tumor progression. This possibility would require an explanation for why our single cell analysis have consistently missed the relevant context of proliferation across the ten SiNETs.</p>
<p>A related possibility is that proliferation may be restricted to a hidden stem/progenitor population that we have not captured, either because it is rare or because it may be sensitive to our experimental workflows. Such proliferative stem/progenitor cells were described in other cancer types and are consistent with the cancer stem cell hypothesis. For example, we previously described the cellular hierarchy of oligodendroglioma, in which proliferation is restricted to cells resembling neural progenitor, while the tumor is dominated by more differentiated cells resembling oligodendrocytes and astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. A second, and more relevant example, is presented here with the N-of-1 analysis of a mixed LCNEC. In this case, high proliferation is seen across all malignant components, but the mere presence of a proliferative stem/progenitor population suggests that bipotent progenitors may explain the diversity within mixed LCNECs and possibly even the wider phenomena of MiNENs. It is tempting to speculate that such progenitors may also exist in other neuroendocrine tumors (e.g. SiNETs).</p>
<p>SiNETs deviate from classical oncogenesis not only by their low malignant cell proliferation, but also by their paucity of mutations and apparent driver events. Accordingly, previous work proposed that SiNET may be driven by epigenetic aberrations in NE cells or by effects of the TME. Our observation of minimal proliferation in NE cells supports the latter possibility of TME oncogenic effects. In particular, SiNETs of the epithelial-like subtype are associated with extremely high levels of MIF, an important and pleiotropic cytokine that may influence the TME in multiple important ways and possibly create a unique inflammatory TME. One potential effect that we observe is high proliferation of B or plasma cells. Notably, the three SiNETs of the epithelial-like subtype are not associated with higher numbers of B/plasma cells compared to other SiNETs, but rather only with increased cell cycle of B/plasma cells, suggesting that their proliferation is balanced by high death. The implications of high B/plasma cell turnover, and of other downstream effects of high MIF expression, are unclear, but raise the possibility that MIF-CD74 interaction may constitute a relevant target for the epithelial-like SiNET subtype. Notably, MIF-CD74 inhibitors have already been developed and initially tested for the treatment of solid tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>].</p>
<p>In summary, single cell profiling of SiNETs revealed two distinct subtypes that differ in NE profiles and in the proliferation of B-cells, possibly justifying different therapeutic strategies (e.g. MIF inhibition). The two subtypes share a minimal proliferation of NE cells, which raises questions about the initiation and growth of SiNETs and the potential role of TME cells, in line with the limited mutations observed in SiNETs. Our analysis of a mixed tumor further suggests the potential presence of bipotent progenitors that may account for mixed phenotypes. Taken together, these results improve our understanding of neuroendocrine neoplasms while highlighting their complex biology.</p>

<title>Human samples</title>
<p>The study was approved by the Instituntional Helsinkee Committee at Sheba Medical Center (SMC-18-5674). For tissue preparation for Immunohistochemistry, flash frozen SiNETs were stored at −80°C until cutting. Blocks were prepared in OCT followed by freezing and sectioning. Frozen tissue was sectioned using a −20°C temperature on a cryostat (Leica CM3050 S) onto microscopic slides (Thermo, Superfrost Plus).</p>

<title>Tumor dissociation and library preparation</title>
<p>Fresh tumors were collected directly from the operating room at the time of surgery. Tumors were washed in ice-cold HBSS, minced using a pair of Noyes spring scissors (Fine Science Tools) and then enzymatically dissociated using a tumor dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) in a GentleMACS Octo-dissociator on low speed settings (Filbin et al., 2018; Patel et al., 2014; Tirosh et al., 2016b). Single cell suspension was obtained by passing dissociated slurry through a 60-100 micron cell strainer (Miltenyi) and the filtrate was subjected to RBC removal using a RBC lysis buffer (Roche). Dead cell removal (Miltenyi) was performed on cell suspension following manufacturer’s protocol and cells were assessed for viability and density. 5 µl of Trypan blue (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was mixed with 5 µl of the sample and loaded onto chip disposable automated hemocytometer (Countess II). Cell concentration was adjusted such that a total of 8000-10,000 cells were loaded onto each channel of the 10x Genomics Single-Cell Chromium Controller.</p>
<p>For frozen tumors, a similar dissociation procedure was performed with the following modifications. Nuclei isolation was achieved using either ST-based buffers as done before (Slyper et al) or by EZ-lysis method (Sigma). Briefly, tissue samples were cut into pieces &lt;0.5 cm using spring noyes scissors and then homogenized in ice-cold buffer (ST based or EZ lysis) using a glass Dounce tissue grinder (Sigma). Nuclei were centrifuged at 500g, with low acceleration/deceleration for 5 min at 4 °C, washed with 5 ml ice-cold ST/EZ lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 5 min. A suspension buffer containing PBS, BSA and RNAse inhibitor was used to wash and resuspend the nuclei pellet. Nuclei suspension was filtered through a 40 μm cell strainer (Miltenyi) and counted. A final concentration of 1,000 nuclei per µl was used for loading on a 10x channel with a target of 10,000 nuclei per channel in the 10x controller.</p>
<p>The Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3′ GEM, Library &amp; Gel Bead Kit v3.1, Chromium Single Cell 3′ Feature Barcode Library Kit, Chromium Next GEM Chip G, and 10x Chromium Controller (10x Genomics) was used for generation of libraries of fresh tumors/single cells and the Chromium Next GEM Single 5′ GEM was used for frozen tumors/single-nuclei.</p>
<p>As per the standardized protocol of creating 10x libraries, single cells, reagents and single gel beads containing barcoded oligonucleotides were emulsified and encapsulated into nanoliter-sized droplets followed by reverse transcription (RT). Following manufacturer’s recommendations RT samples were subjected to cDNA amplification, fragmentation, adapter and sample index attachment. Libraries from two 10x channels were pooled together and sequenced on one lane of an Illumina NovaSeq-6000, using an sp-100 kit or 4 were pooled together on two lanes with an S1-100 kit, with paired end reads as follows: read 1, 26 nt; read 2, 55 nt; index 1, 8 nt; index 2, 0 nt.</p>

<title>Sample Normalization, Filtering and annotations</title>
<p>Four samples (siAdeno, SiNETs 1-3) underwent single nuclei sequencing, while the remaining samples (SiNETs 4-10) were subjected to scRNA-seq. To facilitate comparative analysis, we converted counts of unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts to transcripts per million (TPM) values, which were divided by 10 since the actual complexity of cells is assumed to be in the realm of ∼100,000 transcripts and not 1 million as implied by the TPM measures. The resulting values were added 1 and log2-transformed. Finally, to derive relative expression we centered the value of each gene in each tumor, except in analysis where we were interested in absolute expression levels.</p>
<p>To ensure data quality, we excluded low-quality cells based on the number of detected genes. For the nuclei-seq platform, we used a threshold of 1000 detected genes, while for the scRNA-seq platform, we used a threshold of 700 in order to retain lymphocytes that tend to have low numbers of detected genes. Additionally, we performed most analysis with a filtered set of genes, retaining only the genes in which the logged row-means per gene across all cells passed 4.5. After filtering, the number of cells analyzed per sample ranged from 287 to 10,802.</p>

<title>Neuroendocrine cell signatures and their classification</title>
<p>To identify NE-specific genes, we performed a differential expression analysis between NE cells and a reference group consisting of Macrophages, Fibroblasts, and Endothelial cells. For each sample, we sampled 50 NE cells along with 50 cells from the reference group. Differentially expressed (DE) genes were defined as those with fold change greater than 8 and a p-value lower than 0.05. In samples that had insufficient reference cells (SiNET7 and SiNET8), we sampled the reference cells from a different sample that exhibited the highest correlation with the given sample. Samples that did not contain NE cells (SiNET3 and siAdeno) were excluded from this analysis. We then classified the DE genes into three groups: Common genes, Subset-specific genes, and Sample-specific genes. Common genes were defined as those differentially expressed in at least 6 samples, Subset-specific genes were those differentially expressed in 2-5 samples, and Sample-specific genes were differentially expressed only in one sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6e">
<title>Clustering of Subset-specific NE genes into nine patterns</title>
<p>We divided the subset-specific NE genes based on their expression pattern across the 8 tumors that contained enough NE cells. To this end, we first considered all potential binary patterns, in which a gene is considered as either expressed (1) or not expressed (0) in each tumor. This defined 2<sup>8</sup> = 256 theoretical patterns. Next, for each gene, we calculated the correlation between its relative expression across the eight samples, and each of the 256 binary patterns; the gene was then assigned to the pattern with highest correlation. This uncovered 9 patterns that were each assigned to &gt;5 genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2C</xref><bold>, Table S3</bold>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6f">
<title>Cell Cycle Analysis</title>
<p>To investigate the cell cycle dynamics within the dataset, we utilized a canonical cell cycle gene-set [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Each cell in every sample was scored based on the expression of these cell cycle genes. To identify cycling cells, we established a threshold based on the distribution of scores within each sample. We chose a relatively lenient threshold (log2 fold change of 1.5), and further verified that our main claims are qualitatively maintained when using a more strict threshold of 2-fold. In particular, NE cells had an extremely low fraction of cycling cells (0.127%), while B and plasma cells had a high fraction of cycling cells in epithelial-like SiNETs (32.25%) but not in Neuronal-like SiNETs (0.178%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6g">
<title>Within Cell-Type analysis</title>
<p>In each tumor, we examined clusters that were annotated as the same cell type but were not grouped together in the initial clustering analysis. For each such pair of clusters, we defined differential expression (with log-ratio of 1.5 and a p-value of 0.05), and analyzed the expression of previously defined meta-programs associated with the corresponding cell type.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6h">
<title>Comparing Gene Expression between SiNET Subtypes across Cell Types</title>
<p>We performed a comparative gene expression analysis, examining epithelial-like and neuronal-like subtypes of SiNETs. The significance threshold for gene selection was established at an uncorrected p-value &lt; 0.05, along with a log2 fold change &gt; 2. Given the limited sample size. Additionally, we extended this analysis to bulk data, where each sample was assigned to the subtype for which the signature score was higher.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6i">
<title>Cell cycle correlations with cell type signatures in bulk SiNET samples</title>
<p>From GSE98894, we used the 81 SiNET samples. Counts were converted to TPM, and log2-transformed with an offset of 1. We then averaged the marker genes of Epithelial, T cells, B cells, NE cells and cell cycle to create scores of their expression. Few outlier samples with very low NE score were excluded from further analysis. Finally, we calculated Pearson correlation between the cell-type scores and cell cycle score.</p>

<p>This study analyzes a cohort of small intestine neuroendocrine tumors, and the description of tumor-intrinsic programs that govern such rare cancers is felt to be <bold>valuable</bold>. The methods are for the most part felt to be <bold>solid</bold>, however, some broad concerns were raised that the possible separation of samples by a program may be impacted by fresh versus frozen sequencing. Similarly, the heterogeneity of the SiNET tumor microenvironment is unclear given a mixing of subtypes and the proliferation of NE and immune cells in SiNET could be influenced by technical factors. Recommendations were made to extend these data with other published datasets of SiNET tumors, expanding technical clarity and details, and validating findings using cell lines/PDX if available.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors have assembled a cohort of 10 SiNET, 1 SiAdeno, and 1 lung MiNEN samples to explore the biology of neuroendocrine neoplasms. They employ single-cell RNA sequencing to profile 5 samples (siAdeno, SiNETs 1-3, MiNEN) and single-nuclei RNA sequencing to profile seven frozen samples (SiNET 4-10).</p>
<p>They identify two subtypes of siNETs, characterized by either epithelial or neuronal NE cells, through a series of DE analyses. They also report findings of higher proliferation in non-malignant cell types across both subtypes. Additionally, they identify a potential progenitor cell population in a single-lung MiNEN sample.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, this study adds interesting insights into this set of rare cancers that could be very informative for the cancer research community. The team probes an understudied cancer type and provides thoughtful investigations and observations that may have translational relevance.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study could be improved by clarifying some of the technical approaches and aspects as currently presented, toward enhancing the support of the conclusions:</p>
<p>(1) Methods: As currently presented, it is possible that the separation of samples by program may be impacted by tissue source (fresh vs. frozen) and/or the associated sequencing modality (single cell vs. single nuclei). For instance, two (SiNET1 and SiNET2) of the three fresh tissues are categorized into the same subtype, while the third (SiNET9) has very few neuroendocrine cells. Additionally, samples from patient 1 (SiNET1 and SiNET6) are separated into different subtypes based on fresh and frozen tissue. The current text alludes to investigations (i.e.: &quot;Technical effects (e.g., fresh vs. frozen samples) could also impact the capture of distinct cell types, although we did not observe a clear pattern of such bias.&quot;), but the study would be strengthened with more detail.</p>
<p>(2) Results:</p>
<p>
Heterogeneity in the SiNET tumor microenvironment: It is unclear if the current analysis of intratumor heterogeneity distinguishes the subtypes. It may be informative if patterns of tumor microenvironment (TME) heterogeneity were identified between samples of the same subtype. The team could also evaluate this in an extension cohort of published SiNET tumors (i.e. revisiting additional analyses using the SiNET bulk RNAseq from Alvarez et al 2018, a subset of single-cell data from Hoffman et al 2023, or additional bulk RNAseq validation cohorts for this cancer type if they exist [if they do not, then this could be mentioned as a need in Discussion])</p>
<p>(3) Proliferation of NE and immune cells in SiNETs: The observed proliferation of NE and immune cells in SiNETs may also be influenced by technical factors (including those noted above). For instance, prior studies have shown that scRNA-seq tends to capture a higher proportion of immune cells compared to snRNA-seq, which should be considered in the interpretation of these results. Could the team clarify this element?</p>
<p>(4) Putative progenitors in mixed tumors: As written, the identification of putative progenitors in a single lung MiNEN sample feels somewhat disconnected from the rest of the study. These findings are interesting - are similar progenitor cell populations identified in SiNET samples? Recognizing that ideally additional validation is needed to confidently label and characterize these cells beyond gene expression data in this rare tumor, this limitation could be addressed in a revised Discussion.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The research identifies two main SiNET subtypes (epithelial-like and neuronal-like) and reveals heterogeneity in non-neuroendocrine cells within the tumor microenvironment. The study validates findings using external datasets and explores unexpected proliferation patterns. While it contributes to understanding SiNET oncogenic processes, the limited sample size and depth of analysis present challenges to the robustness of the conclusions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The studies effectively identified two subtypes of SiNET based on epithelial and neuronal markers. Key findings include the low proliferation rates of neuroendocrine (NE) cells and the role of the tumor microenvironment (TME), such as the impact of Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, the analysis faces challenges such as a small sample size, lack of clear biological interpretation in some analyses, and concerns about batch effects and statistical significance.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors set out to profile small intestine neuroendocrine tumors (siNETs) using single-cell/nucleus RNA sequencing, an established method to characterize the diversity of cell types and states in a tumor. Leveraging this dataset, they identified distinct malignant subtypes (epithelial-like versus neuronal-like) and characterized the proliferative index of malignant neuroendocrine cells versus non-malignant microenvironment cells. They found that malignant neuroendocrine cells were far less proliferative than some of their non-malignant counterparts (e.g., B cells, plasma cells, epithelial cells) and there was a strong subtype association such that epithelial-like siNETs were linked to high B/plasma cell proliferation, potentially mediated by MIF signaling, whereas neuronal-like siNETs were correlated with low B/plasma cell proliferation. The authors also examined a single case of a mixed lung tumor (neuroendocrine and squamous) and found evidence of intermediate/mixed and stem-like progenitor states that suggest the two differentiated tumor types may arise from the same progenitor.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strengths of the paper include the unique dataset, which is the largest to date for siNETs, and the potentially clinically relevant hypotheses generated by their analysis of the data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The weaknesses of the paper include the relatively small number of independent patients (n = 8 for siNETs), lack of direct comparison to other published single-cell NET datasets, mixing of two distinct methods (single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq), lack of direct cell-cell interaction analyses and spatially-resolved data, and lack of in vitro or in vivo functional validation of their findings.</p>
<p>The analytical methods applied in this study appear to be appropriate, but the methods used are fairly standard to the field of single-cell omics without significant methodological innovation. As the authors bring forth in the Discussion, the results of the study do raise several compelling questions related to the possibility of distinct biology underlying the epithelial-like and neuronal-like subtypes, the origin of mixed tumors, drivers of proliferation, and microenvironmental heterogeneity. However, this study was not able to further explore these questions through spatially-resolved data or functional experiments.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors have assembled a cohort of 10 SiNET, 1 SiAdeno, and 1 lung MiNEN samples to explore the biology of neuroendocrine neoplasms. They employ single-cell RNA sequencing to profile 5 samples (siAdeno, SiNETs 1-3, MiNEN) and single-nuclei RNA sequencing to profile seven frozen samples (SiNET 4-10).</p>
<p>They identify two subtypes of siNETs, characterized by either epithelial or neuronal NE cells, through a series of DE analyses. They also report findings of higher proliferation in non-malignant cell types across both subtypes. Additionally, they identify a potential progenitor cell population in a single-lung MiNEN sample.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, this study adds interesting insights into this set of rare cancers that could be very informative for the cancer research community. The team probes an understudied cancer type and provides thoughtful investigations and observations that may have translational relevance.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study could be improved by clarifying some of the technical approaches and aspects as currently presented, toward enhancing the support of the conclusions:</p>
<p>(1) Methods: As currently presented, it is possible that the separation of samples by program may be impacted by tissue source (fresh vs. frozen) and/or the associated sequencing modality (single cell vs. single nuclei). For instance, two (SiNET1 and SiNET2) of the three fresh tissues are categorized into the same subtype, while the third (SiNET9) has very few neuroendocrine cells. Additionally, samples from patient 1 (SiNET1 and SiNET6) are separated into different subtypes based on fresh and frozen tissue. The current text alludes to investigations (i.e.: &quot;Technical effects (e.g., fresh vs. frozen samples) could also impact the capture of distinct cell types, although we did not observe a clear pattern of such bias.&quot;), but the study would be strengthened with more detail.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful and constructive review. Due to the difficulty in obtaining enough SiNET samples, we used two platforms to generate data - single cell analysis of fresh samples, and single nuclei analysis of frozen samples. We opted to combine both sample types in our analysis while being fully aware of the potential for batch effects. We therefore agree that this is a limitation of our work, and that differences between samples should be interpreted with caution.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we argue that the two SiNET subtypes that we have identified are very unlikely to be due to such batch effect. First, the epithelial SiNET subtype was not only detected in two fresh samples but also in one frozen sample (albeit with relatively few cells, as the reviewer correctly noted). Second, and more importantly, the epithelial SiNET subtype was also identified in analysis of an external and much larger cohort of bulk RNA-seq SiNET samples that does not share the issue of two platforms (as seen in Fig. 2f). Moreover, the proportion of samples assigned to the two subtypes is similar between our data and the external data. We therefore argue that the identification of two SiNET subtypes cannot be explained by the use of two data platforms. However, we agree that the results should be further investigated and validated by future studies, as is often done in research on rare tumors.</p>
<p>The reviewer also commented that two samples from the same patient which were profiled by different platforms (SiNET1 and SiNET6) were separated into different subtypes. We would like to clarify that this is not the case, since SiNET6 was not included in the subtype analysis due to too few detected Neuroendocrine cells, and was not assigned to any subtype, as noted in the text and as can be seen by its exclusion from Figure 2 where subtypes are defined. We apologize that our manuscript may have gave the wrong impression about SiNET6 classification (it is labeled in Fig. 4a in a misleading manner). In the revised manuscript, we will correct the labeling in Fig. 4a and clarify that SiNET is not assigned to any subtype. We will further acknowledge the limitation of the two platforms and the arguments in favor of the existence of two SiNET subtypes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Results:</p>
<p>
Heterogeneity in the SiNET tumor microenvironment: It is unclear if the current analysis of intratumor heterogeneity distinguishes the subtypes. It may be informative if patterns of tumor microenvironment (TME) heterogeneity were identified between samples of the same subtype. The team could also evaluate this in an extension cohort of published SiNET tumors (i.e. revisiting additional analyses using the SiNET bulk RNAseq from Alvarez et al 2018, a subset of single-cell data from Hoffman et al 2023, or additional bulk RNAseq validation cohorts for this cancer type if they exist [if they do not, then this could be mentioned as a need in Discussion])</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that analysis of an independent cohort will assist in defining the association between TME and the SiNET subtype. However, the sample size required for that is significantly larger than the data available. In the revised manuscript we will note that as a direction for future studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Proliferation of NE and immune cells in SiNETs: The observed proliferation of NE and immune cells in SiNETs may also be influenced by technical factors (including those noted above). For instance, prior studies have shown that scRNA-seq tends to capture a higher proportion of immune cells compared to snRNA-seq, which should be considered in the interpretation of these results. Could the team clarify this element?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that different platforms could affect the observed proportions of immune cells, and more generally the proportions of specific cell types. However, the low proliferation of Neuroendocrine cells and the higher proliferation of immune cells (especially B cells, but also T cells and macrophages) is consistently observed in both platforms, as shown in Fig. 4a, and therefore appears to be reliable despite the limitations of our work. We will clarify this consistency in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Putative progenitors in mixed tumors: As written, the identification of putative progenitors in a single lung MiNEN sample feels somewhat disconnected from the rest of the study. These findings are interesting - are similar progenitor cell populations identified in SiNET samples? Recognizing that ideally additional validation is needed to confidently label and characterize these cells beyond gene expression data in this rare tumor, this limitation could be addressed in a revised Discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with this comment and will add the need for additional validation for this finding in the revised Discussion.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The research identifies two main SiNET subtypes (epithelial-like and neuronal-like) and reveals heterogeneity in non-neuroendocrine cells within the tumor microenvironment. The study validates findings using external datasets and explores unexpected proliferation patterns. While it contributes to understanding SiNET oncogenic processes, the limited sample size and depth of analysis present challenges to the robustness of the conclusions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The studies effectively identified two subtypes of SiNET based on epithelial and neuronal markers. Key findings include the low proliferation rates of neuroendocrine (NE) cells and the role of the tumor microenvironment (TME), such as the impact of Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, the analysis faces challenges such as a small sample size, lack of clear biological interpretation in some analyses, and concerns about batch effects and statistical significance.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors set out to profile small intestine neuroendocrine tumors (siNETs) using single-cell/nucleus RNA sequencing, an established method to characterize the diversity of cell types and states in a tumor. Leveraging this dataset, they identified distinct malignant subtypes (epithelial-like versus neuronal-like) and characterized the proliferative index of malignant neuroendocrine cells versus non-malignant microenvironment cells. They found that malignant neuroendocrine cells were far less proliferative than some of their non-malignant counterparts (e.g., B cells, plasma cells, epithelial cells) and there was a strong subtype association such that epithelial-like siNETs were linked to high B/plasma cell proliferation, potentially mediated by MIF signaling, whereas neuronal-like siNETs were correlated with low B/plasma cell proliferation. The authors also examined a single case of a mixed lung tumor (neuroendocrine and squamous) and found evidence of intermediate/mixed and stem-like progenitor states that suggest the two differentiated tumor types may arise from the same progenitor.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strengths of the paper include the unique dataset, which is the largest to date for siNETs, and the potentially clinically relevant hypotheses generated by their analysis of the data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The weaknesses of the paper include the relatively small number of independent patients (n = 8 for siNETs), lack of direct comparison to other published single-cell NET datasets, mixing of two distinct methods (single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq), lack of direct cell-cell interaction analyses and spatially-resolved data, and lack of in vitro or in vivo functional validation of their findings.</p>
<p>The analytical methods applied in this study appear to be appropriate, but the methods used are fairly standard to the field of single-cell omics without significant methodological innovation. As the authors bring forth in the Discussion, the results of the study do raise several compelling questions related to the possibility of distinct biology underlying the epithelial-like and neuronal-like subtypes, the origin of mixed tumors, drivers of proliferation, and microenvironmental heterogeneity. However, this study was not able to further explore these questions through spatially-resolved data or functional experiments.</p>
