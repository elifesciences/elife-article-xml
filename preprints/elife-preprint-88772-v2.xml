<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Imidacloprid is a global health threat that severely poisons the economically and ecologically important honeybee pollinator, <italic>Apis mellifera</italic>. However, its effects on developing bee larvae remain largely unexplored. Our pilot study showed that imidacloprid causes developmental delay in bee larvae, but the underlying toxicological mechanisms remain incompletely understood. In this study, we exposed bee larvae to imidacloprid at environmentally relevant concentrations of 0.7, 1.2, 3.1, and 377 ppb. There was a marked dose-dependent delay in larval development, characterized by reductions in body mass, width, and growth index. However, imidacloprid did not affect on larval survival and food consumption. The primary toxicological effects induced by elevated concentrations of imidacloprid (377 ppb) included inhibition of neural transmission gene expression, induction of oxidative stress, gut structural damage, and apoptosis, inhibition of developmental regulatory hormones and genes, suppression of gene expression levels involved in proteolysis, amino acid transport, protein synthesis, carbohydrate catabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolysis energy production. In addition, we found that the larvae may use antioxidant defenses and P450 detoxification mechanisms to mitigate the effects of imidacloprid. Ultimately, this study provides the first evidence that environmentally exposed imidacloprid can affect the growth and development of bee larvae by disrupting molting regulation and limiting the metabolism and utilization of dietary nutrients and energy. These findings have broader implications for studies assessing pesticide hazards in other juvenile animals.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hazardous pesticides are used extensively around the world to protect crop production, particularly in agriculture-dependent developing countries. However, exposure to these chemicals has become a global health concern. Imidacloprid, introduced in 1991, is known for its high animal toxicity and has received international attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jeschke et al., 2011</xref>). The World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have listed it as an acute oral and dermal toxicant for animals. The excessive use of imidacloprid can lead to environmental contamination, endangering human and animal health through food chains, poisoning non-target pollinators, and disrupting ecological balances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Tudi et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Imidacloprid is also known for its adverse effects on human health. Adults exposed to high doses of imidacloprid (9.6%) experience dizziness, apathy, movement disorders, labored breathing, and temporary growth retardation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Wu et al., 2001</xref>). Imidacloprid also causes adverse congenital, hematological, hepatic, and renal effects, along with degenerative changes in various organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Khan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Shaw et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). Imidacloprid even at low doses causes severe liver, thyroid, and body weight problems, reproductive toxicity, developmental retardation, and neurobehavioral deficits in rats and rabbits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anatra-Cordone M, 2005</xref>). Additionally, imidacloprid affects the singing ability of birds, making it difficult for them to attract mates and reproduce. It is a significant contributor to the decline in terrestrial insect populations since 1991, averaging 9% per decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cardoso et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sánchez-Bayo and Wyckhuys, 2019</xref>). Honey bees (<italic>Apis mellifera</italic> L.) are valuable model organisms in insects with significant economic and ecological importance as crop pollinators and in maintaining ecological balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Zheng and Fu-Liang, 2009</xref>). However, the widespread use of pesticides, including imidacloprid, has resulted in colony collapse disorder (CCD), causing severe impacts on the beekeeping industry and ecological balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Mahé et al., 2021</xref>). Studies have shown that imidacloprid is applied as a seed coating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Simon-Delso et al., 2015</xref>) and accumulates in the plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Dively and Kamel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Rocha et al., 2022</xref>), exposing non-target bees to imidacloprid residues during pollen and nectar collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Tong et al., 2018</xref>). Even low levels of systemic imidacloprid cause sublethal effects in adult bees, including neurotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Belzunces et al., 2012</xref>), behavioural changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Karahan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Medrzycki et al., 2003</xref>), reproductive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chaimanee et al., 2016</xref>), reduced immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Pettis et al., 2013</xref>), apoptosis and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Carneiro et al., 2022</xref>), and shortened lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Anderson and Harmon-Threatt, 2021</xref>). A recent finding shows that imidacloprid induces oxidative stress in honey bees (Balieira et al., 2018). This oxidative stress is a result of the long-term synergistic effect between imidacloprid and its target receptors (nAChRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Makoto et al., 2020</xref>) in bees, which leads to an excessive influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the bee brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Tahirare, 2013</xref>), disrupting Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and ultimately causing mitochondrial dysfunction and increased mitochondrial ROS generation, exacerbating oxidative stress.</p>
<p>The development and health status of juvenile animals play a critical role in population structure and future growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Gill et al., 2012</xref>). However, they are more susceptible to the toxic effects of pesticides than adults. Despite this, there is limited information on the toxic effects of imidacloprid on juvenile animals. Available reports mainly focus on the epistatic effects of toxicity, with limited investigation into the involved biochemical mechanisms. Imidacloprid is known to pose a potential health risk to children through dietary exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Anderson and Harmon-Threatt, 2021</xref>), and may cause lead to developmental abnormalities in amphibians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Samojeden et al., 2022</xref>) and fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Islam et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, negative effects on pupal development in insects have been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Jia and Li, 2023</xref>). For instance, cat fleas (<italic>Ctenocephalides felis</italic>) larvae treated with imidacloprid become immobile, and their intestines show pulsatile movements for up to one hour, eventually dying after two hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Mehlhorn et al., 1999</xref>). Additionally, imidacloprid exposure can affect the average weight gain per day in <italic>Harmonia axyridis</italic> (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Charles et al., 2000</xref>). It has also been found that imidacloprid exposure affects various cellular aspects, such as mitochondria, energy, lipids, and the transcriptome in Drosophila (Felipe et al., 2020), and prolongs the larval pupation duration and affects forewing development in the butterfly <italic>Pieris brassicae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Whitehorn et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>In bees, larvae play a crucial role in the growth and development of colonies. However, the broader toxic effects of imidacloprid on bee larvae remain to be investigated. Limited reports suggest that developing bee larvae are exposed to imidacloprid through contact with contaminated hives or ingestion of contaminated food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bhme et al., 2018</xref>). However, their survival, developmental rate, and body weight are not affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Dai et al., 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, other studies have shown that imidacloprid can lead to impaired olfactory learning behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Peng and Yang, 2016</xref>), and other behavioral abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). The current understanding is that honey bee larvae are more tolerant to imidacloprid than adults, as they can survive treatment and develop into adults (Dai et al., 2017). However, they may experience developmental delays, such as delayed plumage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Woyciechowski and Moroń, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Wu et al., 2011</xref>), and reduced rates of capping, pupation, and eclosion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). A recent study using next-generation sequencing has indicated that sublethal imidacloprid treatment during the larval stage causes changes in gene expression in larvae, pupae, and adults, suggesting a persistent sublethal impact on honey bee development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, a latest study has demonstrated that imidacloprid induces differential gene expression in bumble bee larvae, resulting in unique expression patterns related to various biological processes such as starvation response, cuticle genes, neural development, and cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Martín-Blázquez et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Although progress has been made in understanding the toxic effects of imidacloprid on honey bee larvae, the molecular basis of this toxicity remains poorly understood. Further research is needed to uncover the mechanisms and pathways involved in the developmental toxicity of imidacloprid in honey bee larvae. In our pilot study, we observed a significant developmental delay in bee larvae exposed to imidacloprid; However, the molecular and biochemical mechanisms underlying this delay have not been systematically investigated. Therefore, this study aims to comprehensively evaluate the toxicity of imidacloprid on honey bee larvae at multiple levels, including histology, neurotoxicity, molting regulation, oxidative stress, detoxification, nutrition, and energy metabolism. Our study provides first-hand evidence of the developmental delay caused by imidacloprid in bee larvae. Because these mechanisms involved are relatively conserved in animals, our findings have broader implications for understanding and assessing the potential risk of continuous exposure to imidacloprid during animal development.</p>

<title>Imidacloprid causes bee larval developmental retardation</title>
<p>The 96-hour observation period showed no significant difference in larval survival between the four groups exposed to imidacloprid and the control group. However, as the exposure concentration and duration increased, here was a significant decrease in larval developmental progress, weight, and width (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>). Further analysis was conducted on the most adverse exposure level of 377 ppb, which is the highest reported environmental residue concentration detected in bee products, such as beeswax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kapoor et al., 2014</xref>). It is important to note that while the tested doses of the 377 ppb was found in bee products, it is likely that the bees themselves were exposed to even higher doses. Out result demonstrate that exposure to 377 ppb imidacloprid did not have a significant impact on survival, feeding (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>, and 1G), and the time required for larvae to enter the pupal stage successfully (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). However, it did lead to slow developmental progress, a lower initial rate of successful pupation, and lower growth index. Additionally, imidacloprid consistently resulted in lower larval weight (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>) and width (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>) up to the pupal stage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>

<title>Toxic effects and the molecular basis of environmental concentrations of imidacloprid on bee larvae</title>
<p>Previous research has shown that bee larvae are more susceptible to the adverse effects of pesticides than adult bees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Tomé et al., 2020</xref>). In this study, larvae were exposed to environmental concentrations of imidacloprid, resulting in sublethal effects such as decreased body weight, width, developmental rate, and growth index (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Our results support the notion that pesticides can affect larval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Dai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>). However, current research has primarily focused on characterizing the effects of imidacloprid on larval phenotype and behavior, and the molecular mechanisms underlying its ecotoxicological effects remain poorly understood.</p>
<p>To obtain molecular evidence of imidacloprid toxicity to bee larvae, we first examined the expression of acetylcholine receptors and AChE activity. The results showed that imidacloprid exposure increased the expression of the <italic>Alph2</italic> gene and inhibited AChE activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Normally, acetylcholine stimulates nerve impulses by binding to the Alph receptor, and AChE degrades acetylcholine to terminate nerve conduction. However, imidacloprid competitively binds to AChE receptors, inhibits AChE activity, and causes continuous excitation of nerve conduction, ultimately leading to paralysis and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Katić et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Shan et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, our results strongly suggest that imidacloprid is neurotoxic to bee larvae.</p>
<p>The growth and development of juvenile animals depends on the digestion, absorption and utilization of food nutrients. Therefore, we next investigated whether imidacloprid affects the digestion and utilization of dietary by larvae. The results indicate that exposure to imidacloprid suppressed the hydrolysis genes <italic>CPs</italic> and <italic>APs</italic> and the amino acid transport pathway genes <italic>Aats-Gly</italic> and <italic>Aats-Tyr</italic> in larvae (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>). Since these genes are responsible for cleaving dietary proteins into absorbable peptides and amino acids and transporting them for metabolism (2019), inhibiting the expression of these genes would severely affect larval digestion, resulting in protein deficiency and impaired metabolic activity. In addition, imidacloprid also affected the expression of <italic>α- Am</italic> and <italic>α-Glu</italic> genes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>), which are involved in carbohydrate digestion, indicating that imidacloprid also affects the digestion of dietary carbohydrates. Indeed, histological observations also confirmed that a large amount of undigested food remained in the intestine of larvae exposed to imidacloprid (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). In conclusion, imidacloprid inhibits the digestion and utilization of dietary proteins and carbohydrates by larvae, which is extremely detrimental to their growth and development.</p>
<p>In addition to nutrition, energy metabolism is critical for the maintenance of all life activities. In this study, imidacloprid exposure inhibited the expression of genes related to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (<italic>COX17</italic>, <italic>NDUFB7</italic>) and its alternative glycolytic pathway (<italic>Gapdh</italic>, <italic>Oscillin</italic>). Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is the central pathway for ATP generation during energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Tian et al., 2020a</xref>), while glycolysis is an alternative mechanism for ATP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>). Since both biochemical processes are essential for energy production, their inhibition resulted in reduced ATP levels in bee larvae (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>). These results strongly suggest that imidacloprid induces energy metabolism dysfunction leading to insufficient energy production in larvae. Since larval energy production is insufficient, this is likely to lead to a depletion of energy reserves. Indeed, further analysis revealed a significant decrease in glycogen and protein energy reserves in larvae exposed to imidacloprid (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6I</xref>). These findings are consistent with previous reports that exposure to pesticides such as endosulfan, chlorpyrifos, insecticides, and fipronil can lead to a reduction in energy reserves in organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bouayad et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Dutra et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Radwan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Rambabu and Rao, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Ribeiro et al., 2001</xref>). In conclusion, our results suggest that imidacloprid induces energy metabolism dysfunction and affects energy production and reserves in bee larvae.</p>
<p>Insects rely primarily on cytochrome P450 detoxification to resist toxic compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Li et al., 2007</xref>), and the level of CYP450 expression indicates the severity of pesticide toxicity. While adult worker bees have shown a positive response to imidacloprid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Mao et al., 2009</xref>), it is uncertain whether bee larvae can respond to pesticide toxicity. In this study, we found that seven cytochrome P450 family transcripts, including CYPq1, CYPq2, CYP450, CYP6AS14, CYP4G11, and CYP306A1, were significantly upregulated in bee larvae, with CYP9q1 being 94-fold higher than the control group (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). These results are consistent with previous findings that the CYP450 family genes CYP6AS3, CYP6AS4, and CYP9S1 were significantly upregulated in adult worker bees exposed to quercetin, coumaphos, and fluvalinate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Mao et al., 2011</xref>) and that CYP9Q1, CYP9Q2, and CYP9Q3 help bees detoxify fluvalinate and coumaphos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Gregorc et al., 2018</xref>). This suggests that the P450 detoxification system is already established in bee larvae and they respond positively by activating the detoxification function of CYP450 upon exposure to imidacloprid.</p>
<p>Oxidative stress is the excessive production of ROS in aerobic organisms (Felton, 1995; Ozcan and Ogun, 2015). Pesticides, including coumaphos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Gregorc et al., 2018</xref>), fipronil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Paris et al., 2017</xref>), paraquat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Li-Byarlay et al., 2016</xref>), organophosphorus, pyrethroid, organochlorinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chakrabarti et al., 2015</xref>), and chlorpyrifos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Shafiq-ur-Rehman et al., 2012</xref>), have been shown to cause oxidative stress in bees. In this study, exposure to imidacloprid resulted in increased levels of ROS and MDA in larvae (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>), indicating severe oxidative stress and lipid damage. Organisms have evolved antioxidant defense mechanisms to scavenge excessive ROS and resist oxidative stress, including increasing levels of antioxidants such as CAT, SOD, GSH, TrxR, and GSH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Dong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Tian et al., 2020b</xref>). In this regard, we have recently confirmed this in worker bees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Li et al., 2022</xref>), which is also well reflected in the present study. We observed a significant increase in the activities of antioxidant enzymes SOD and CAT, gene expression of Trx and Gpx, and GSH levels in larvae after exposure to imidacloprid (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). These results show that the antioxidant system in developing larvae is established and used to resist oxidative stress caused by imidacloprid, similar to that in adult worker bees. Notably, compared to our recent study in adult bees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Li et al., 2022</xref>), the larvae in this study exhibited more robust antioxidant activity when exposed to higher concentrations of imidacloprid toxicity than worker bees. However, the underlying mechanism requires further investigation. The underlying mechanisms involved require further study.</p>
<p>Notably, in addition to routine antioxidants, imidacloprid induces a 7-fold increase in Vg expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Vg is known to provide nutrition to developing embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Jorgensen et al., 2009</xref>) and to help animals cope with pollution-induced stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Matozzo et al., 2008</xref>). In bees, Vg plays an important antioxidant role by protecting other hemolymph molecules from ROS and increasing cellular oxidative stress tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Corona et al., 2007</xref>). Previous studies have shown a correlation between high Vg expression in adult worker bees and resistance to oxidative stress resulting from exposure to the pesticide paraquat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Seehuus et al., 2006</xref>). In this study, our results support this observation and suggest that larvae may also resist oxidative stress caused by imidacloprid through increased Vg production.</p>

<title>Mechanisms of imidacloprid-induced developmental retardation in bee larvae</title>
<p>Impaired juvenile development can have a significant impact on the growth and sustainability of entire populations. Deviations in juvenile development due to environmental stress have recently received considerable attention. <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> exposed to heat stress exhibit developmental delays due to the failure of early embryos to fully inhibit the synthesis of non-heat shock proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bergh and Arking, 1984</xref>). Similarly, exposure to nutrient and heavy metal stress can cause delayed or arrested development in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> due to altered gene expression and disruption of developmental signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Carranza-García and Navarro, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Rashid et al., 2021</xref>). In the present study, we also observed typical developmental delays in honeybee larvae exposed to imidacloprid, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.</p>
<p>Insect development is regulated by the hormones JH and 20E, which control morphological remodeling events during molting. 20E promotes pupation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Yuan et al., 2020</xref>), while JH maintains juvenile characteristics and prevents metamorphosis by antagonizing the effects of 20E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Luo et al., 2021</xref>). To elucidate the mechanism underlying imidacloprid-induced larval developmental delay, we first focused on the hormonal regulation of molting development and found that imidacloprid inhibits the expression of JHAMT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), a positive regulator of JH synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Liu et al., 2018</xref>), but did not affect JH titer levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). This suggests that the antagonistic effect of JH still restricts the developmental process, thereby maintaining larval morphology. In parallel, imidacloprid toxicity also resulted in reduced ecdysteroid 20E titer and Br-c expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The role of 20E is to induce larval molting and pupation by triggering downstream response factors, such as Br-c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Deng et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, our results suggest that larval developmental delay may be caused by imidacloprid reducing 20E titer and inhibiting <italic>Br-c</italic> expression, thereby blocking molting. Notably, we also observed that a decrease in 20E levels was accompanied by a decrease in AChE activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), which is known to cause delayed pupation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">He et al., 2012</xref>) and developmental arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Desneux et al., 2007</xref>) in insect larvae. Therefore, our results suggest that imidacloprid neurotoxicity may cause developmental delay in bee larvae by inhibiting the molting hormone 20E. This conclusion is supported by a correlation analysis showing that decreases in 20E titer, <italic>Br-c</italic> expression and AChE activity were positively correlated with decreased developmental rates and growth index, weight and width growth (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). In conclusion, imidacloprid neurotoxicity inhibits the 20E and <italic>Br-c</italic> genes, thereby blocking molting, which may be an important cause of delayed larval development in honey bees.</p>
<p>Animals employ selective foraging as a survival strategy to avoid ingesting toxic foods that may cause adverse physiological effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Berenbaum and Johnson, 2015</xref>). Although bees cannot actively reject toxins innately, postingestive malaise allows them to learn to avoid ingesting toxic-containing foods with adverse physiological effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hurst et al., 2014</xref>). Given this, we speculate that it is likely that the honey bee larvae in this study reduced their intake of toxic imidacloprid-containing foods, making it difficult to meet their nutritional and energy needs, which may have resulted in delayed development. However, monitoring of daily food intake did not show a significant difference between larvae exposed to imidacloprid and the control group (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>), indicating that larval food intake was not reduced and larvae did not initiate avoidance behavior toward toxic food. Therefore, food intake was not a critical factor in the delayed larval development caused by imidacloprid.</p>
<p>Nutrition and energy are critical for the growth and development of juvenile animals. Exposure to heavy metals and neonicotinoid pesticides has been shown to affect digestion, energy reserves, production, and utilization in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Li et al., 2021</xref>). Given this, since the lack of the necessary correlation between delayed larval development and food intake in this study prompts us to consider potential problems in larval food and energy utilization that led to delayed development. Consequently, our focus shifted to the investigation of larval nutrition and energy metabolism. Interestingly, we found severe pathological changes in the gut tissues of developmentally delayed larvae exposed to imidacloprid (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Imidacloprid caused a significant reduction in the tightness of the cell arrangement in the basal layer of the gut, and a drastic decrease in the number of cells. The peritrophic membrane was incompletely formed, and undigested food residues were present in the gut. qRT-PCR analysis revealed a significant decrease in larval digestion and catabolism of dietary proteins and carbohydrates, amino acid transport, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolysis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>-<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>). Biochemical assays showed that imidacloprid stress also decreased ATP levels and total glycogen and protein content, resulting in a lack of energy reserves and increased energy expenditure (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>-<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6I</xref>). Correlation analysis indicated a positive relationship between impaired catabolism and dietary nutrient utilization caused by imidacloprid and larval developmental delay (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). These evidence strongly suggest that imidacloprid exposure affects the digestion and utilization of nutrients and energy in larvae, resulting in insufficient nutrients and energy for growth and development, which may be another important factor contributing to imidacloprid-induced larval developmental delay.</p>
<p>The Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory suggests that environmental stress can significantly affect the energy balance of organisms, leading to increased energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kooijman, 2009</xref>). To cope with stress, animals may deplete their energy reserves, such as glycogen and protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bouayad et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Matsukura et al., 2008</xref>). In this study, we found that larvae with delayed development caused by imidacloprid had lower energy reserves (ATP, total protein, and total glycogen), and these energy reserves were negatively correlated with larval antioxidant and detoxification (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>), suggesting that the reduction in energy reserves caused by imidacloprid is related to the energy-consuming activities of CYP450 detoxification and antioxidant defense. To meet the high energy cost demands of environmental stress, animals often have to allocate most of their food intake to defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Guedes et al., 2006</xref>), and this redistribution of energy resources will inevitably lead to an insufficient energy supply for growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Beyers et al., 1999</xref>). Therefore, the P450 detoxification and antioxidant defense used by the larvae in this study to resist imidacloprid toxicity will inevitably force them to consume more food resources that should have been used for growth and development, resulting in a severe lack of energy needed for development. This may also be another important reason why imidacloprid causes delayed development in bee larvae.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that our investigation into the causes of imidacloprid-induced developmental delay in honey bee larvae has provided limited answers. Future comparative analyses of different tissues and durations of exposure, using genetic manipulation and histochemical methods, would improve our understanding of the effects of sublethal doses of imidacloprid on larval development, growth and survival.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Imidacloprid toxicity caused growth and developmental delay in <italic>A. mellifera</italic> larvae. The toxic mechanism may include imidacloprid disrupting the regulatory balance of molt development, resulting in restricted development. In addition, the gut damage caused by imidacloprid restricts the metabolism and utilization of food nutrients and energy in the larvae. Third, the additional energy consumed by larval P450 detoxification and antioxidant defenses further reduces the supply of nutrients and energy for growth and development (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).

The plates contained standard food, which included royal jelly, glucose, fructose, water, and yeast extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Aupinel et al., 2005</xref>). The larvae were cultured in dark conditions at 35°C and 96% RH, with daily feeding volumes adjusted according to their age (20 μL for three-day-old larvae, 30 μL for four-day-old larvae, 40 μL for five-day-old larvae, and 50 μL for six-day-old larvae). Any remaining food was recorded and removed.</p>

<title>Experimental design</title>
<p>This study employed four different concentrations of imidacloprid, which were residual concentrations found in honey (0.7 ppb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Chauzat et al., 2009</xref>), bees (1.2 ppb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Chauzat et al., 2011</xref>), pollen (3.1 ppb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Mullin et al., 2010</xref>), and beeswax (377 ppb) (Pareja et al., 2011). The experiment was conducted with three treatment groups: control group (CK), solvent control group (CKac), and imidacloprid-treated group (IMI), each with three replicates. Each replicate contained 32 bees that were distributed in standard 24-well cell culture plates (1 bee/well). The CK group consisted of larval bees fed acetone-royal jelly glucose-fructose-yeast extract-distilled water (0.00377%-50%- 6%-6%-1%-36.99623%, v/w/w/w/w/v). The IMI group consisted of larvae-fed control solution containing imidacloprid (99% active ingredient, Hubei Norna Technology Co. Ltd, Hubei, China) at 0.7 ppb, 1.2 ppb, 3.1 ppb, and 377 ppb. The CKac group served as a solvent control and contained only acetone at a concentration of 0.00377%. A total of 312 larvae were used for survival statistics (96 bees), body weight and width (96 bees), and gene expression, enzyme activity, histochemical content, and histopathologic analysis. Food was administered daily according to age (20 μL for three-day-old larvae, 30 μL for four-day-old larvae, 40 μL for five-day-old larvae, and 50 μL for six-day-old larvae). Dead individuals and food remain were recorded daily, and incubation conditions were 35°C and 96% RH. Surviving larvae were collected 72 h after consumption of the test solution and stored at −80°C for further analysis, including evaluations of gene expression, enzyme activity, and chemical content evaluations. Furthermore, HE-stained sections were used to evaluate any imidacloprid-induced tissue damage and apoptosis.</p>

<title>Developmental phenotypic traits</title>
<p>Larval individuals were randomly selected daily from the CK and IMI groups to measure body weight and width. Food residues, larval mortality, developmental progression, and the amount of time spent in the larval developmental stage (from the first imidacloprid exposure to before pupa) were recorded daily to calculate food consumption, survival rates, developmental rates, and development times. The growth index (GI) was calculated for larvae exposed to imidacloprid from the three-day-old to the six-day-old using the equations described by Zhang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Zhang et al., 1993</xref>). The developmental rate was measured as the number of larvae successfully reaching the pupal stage as a percentage of the total initial sample size.</p>

<title>RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and real-time quantitative PCR analysis</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted from larvae using TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and RNAex Pro Reagent (Accurate Biology, China) as instructed by the manufacturer. The RNA quality was evaluated by gel electrophoresis and absorbance determination using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, New York, USA). Genomic DNA was removed, and cDNA was synthesized using a reverse transcription kit (Evo M-MLV RT Mix Kit with gDNA Clean for qPCR, Accurate Biology, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 1 μg of RNA reacted with the 5X gDNA Clean Reaction Mix provided in the kit at 42°C for 5 min to remove residual genomic DNA to ensure the accuracy of the quantitative results. After the reaction, 4 μL of 5X Evo M-MLV RT Reaction Mix and 4 μL of RNase-free water were added to the reaction tube for 20 μL. The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 15 min and 85°C for 5 sec to generate cDNA. Then, quantitative RT–PCR was performed with a Bio-Rad CFX96™ Real-time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) according to standard protocols and cycling conditions. RP49 (ribosomal protein 49, Accession no. AF441189) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Lourenco et al., 2008</xref>) was used as the endogenous control. The primers for target genes and RP49 are listed in Table S1. qPCR system (20 µL): EvaGreen Express 2X qPCR MasterMix (10 µL), each forward and reverse primer (0.4 µL, 0.2 µmol/L), cDNA (1 µL, 100 ng/µL), ddH<sub>2</sub>O (8.2 µL). The thermal cycling program was as follows: 95°C for 30 sec, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 5 s and 60°C for 30 s. The qPCR products were sequenced by Shanghai Biological Engineering Technology Services Co., Ltd. to confirm whether the amplified fragments were the target sequences. Relative mRNA expression levels of target genes were calculated using the 2<sup>−ΔΔCt</sup> method.</p>

<title>Histochemical measurement</title>
<p>Juvenile hormone 3 (JH-III), 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) titers, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in larvae were determined using ELISA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (Jining, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the larva was homogenized on ice in 5 volumes (M: V) of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer, and the supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 20 min. Subsequently, 50 μL of reference standard solution or 10 μL of sample supernatant plus 40 μL of dilution were added to the microtiter wells and incubated at 37°C for 60 min with 100 μL of HRP-labeled detection antibody. Each well was washed five times with 400 μL of PBS buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20, pat dried, and left to stand at room temperature for 5 min. TMB chromogen solution A (50 μL) and solution B (50 μL) were added to each well, gently mixed, and incubated at 37°C for 15 min in the dark. Then, 50 μL of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (4 mol/L) was added to each well to terminate the reaction. Finally, the OD value was measured at 450 nm with a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, New York, USA), and the content of the detected substance was calculated from a calibration curve constructed by reference standards.</p>
<p>To prepare samples for analysis of protein carbonylation (PCO), acetylcholinesterase (AchE), catalase (CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione (GSH), larvae was weighed and homogenized on ice in 5 volumes (M: V) of PBS buffer, then centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 15 min to collect the supernatant. Subsequently, PCO content was measured using the 2,4-dinitrophenyl-hydrazine (DNPH) method with slight modifications. The above-prepared supernatant was mixed with streptomycin sulfate at a 9:1 volume (V: M), kept at room temperature for 10 min, and then centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 15 min. Then, 80 μL of supernatant was mixed with 160 μL of 10 mM DNPH in 2 M HCl and reacted at 37°C for 30 min. Sample controls were also prepared by adding an equal volume (500 μL) of 2 M HCl. Then, 200 μL of 20% TCA was added, mixed thoroughly, and centrifuged at 4°C for 10 min at 12,000 x g, and the precipitate was collected. Add 400 μL of ethanol: ethyl acetate mixture (1:1), vortex and mix, centrifuge at 4°C 12,000 x g for 10 min, and collect the precipitate to remove unbound DNPH. This DNPH removal step was repeated once. The pellet was mixed with 400 μL of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, kept at room temperature for 15 min, and then centrifuged at 4°C 12,000 x g for 10 min to collect the supernatant. The carbonyl and protein contents were determined by reading the absorbance at λ = 370 nm and 280 nm with a SpectraMax 190 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, California, USA) for each sample against an appropriate blank. Finally, the carbonyl content per unit of protein was calculated based on the protein content.</p>
<p>AChE activity was measured by the Ellman method as described by Orhan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Orhan et al., 2007</xref>) with slight modifications. Briefly, 20 μL of the prepared sample supernatant was mixed with 160 µL of 0.1 mM PBS buffer (pH 8.0) and 10 µL of an AChE (0.28 U mL<sup>−1</sup>) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Then, 10 µL of ATChI (acetylthiocholine iodide, 4 mg mL<sup>−1</sup>) was added together with 20 µL of DTNB (5,5- dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid, 1.2 mg mL<sup>−1</sup>) and immediately mixed, and the absorbance was read at 412 nm. The results were expressed as activity percentages relative to the sample solvent negative control.</p>
<p>The CAT activity was determined using a kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with slight modifications. Briefly, 10 μL of the prepared sample supernatant was mixed with 30 μL of Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0, 50 mmol L<sup>-1</sup>), 10 µL of 250 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was added, and the mixture was immediately mixed and kept at 25°C for 5 min. Then, 450 μL of 1.8 mol L-1 H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> was added, and the mixture was vortexed to terminate the reaction. Subsequently, 10 µL of this termination reaction solution was mixed with 40 µL of Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0, 50 mmol L<sup>-1</sup>). Then, 10 µL of this mixture was added to a 96-well plate mixed with 200 µL of color development working solution containing peroxidase and incubated for 15 min at 25°C. Finally, the absorbance was measured at 520 nm, and the CAT activity was calculated using a calibration curve of 5 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>T-AOC was measured using the total antioxidant capacity assay kit with the ABTS (2,2’-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) method based on a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). Add 10 μL of the prepared sample supernatant to 200 μL of ABTS working solution. After 6 min of reaction, the absorbance was measured at 734 nm. Finally, the antioxidant activity was displayed by Trolox equivalents antioxidant capacity as mmol Trolox equivalents/g extract. The ABTS working solution was prepared as follows: 400 μL of potassium persulfate was added to 400 μL of ABTS to generate an ABTS stock solution, which was then incubated for 16 h at room temperature in the dark. Before use, the stock solution was diluted with phosphate buffer, and the absorbance at 734 nm was adjusted to 0.70 ± 0.05.</p>
<p>Additionally, MDA, SOD, and GSH levels were detected using ELISA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) according to our recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Li et al., 2022</xref>).</p>

<p>This study provides evidence of the ability of sublethal imidacloprid doses to affect growth and development of honeybee larva. While checking the effect of doses that do not impact survival or food intake, the authors found changes in the expression of genes related to energy metabolism, antioxidant response, and metabolism of xenobiotics. The authors also identified cell death in the alimentary canal, and disturbances in levels of ROS markers, molting hormones, weight and growth ratio. The study strengths come from exploring different aspects and impacts of imidacloprid exposure on honeybee juvenile stages and for that it demonstrates potential for assessing the risks posed by pesticides. The study weaknesses come from the lack of in depth investigation and an incomplete methodological design. For instance, many of the study conclusions are based on RT-qPCR, which show only a partial snapshot of gene expression, which was performed at a single time point and using whole larvae. There is no understanding of how different organs/tissues might respond to exposure and how they change over time. That creates a problem to understand the mechanisms of damage caused by the pesticide in the situation studied here. There is no investigation of what happens after pupation. The authors show that the doses tested have no impact on survival, food consumption and time to pupation, and the growth index drops from ~0.96 to ~0.92 in exposed larvae, raising the question of its biological significance. The origin of ROS are not investigated, nor do the authors investigate if the larvae recover from the damage observed in the gut after pupation. That is important as it could affect the adult workers' health. One of the study's central claims is that the reduced growth index is due to the extra energy used to overexpress P450s and antioxidant enzymes, but that is based on RT-qPCR only. Other options are not well explored and whether the gut damage could be causing nutrient absorption problems, or the oxidative stress could be impairing mitochondrial energy production is not investigated. These alternatives may also affect the growth index. The authors also state that the honeybee larvae has 7 instars, which is an incorrect as Apis mellifera have 5 larval instars. It is not clear from methods which precise stage of larval development was used for gut preparations. That information is important because prior to pupation larvae defecate and undergo shedding of gut lining. That could profoundly affect some of the results in case gut preparations for microscopy were made close to this stage. A more in-depth investigation and more complete methodological design that investigates the mechanisms of damage and whether the exposures tested could affect adult bees may demonstrate the damage of low insecticide doses to a vital pollinator insect species.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<p>We sincerely appreciate the opportunity to revise the manuscript and the reviewers' critical comments and valuable suggestions. After carefully revising the manuscript, we strongly believe that the reviewers' comments are invaluable and will significantly enhance the quality of the manuscript and contribute to our future research. Following the reviewers' comments, we conducted a comprehensive and meticulous review, addressing each point individually and making extensive modifications and corrections. The responses to each question are provided in a point-by-point manner as follows:</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer 1:</bold></p>
<p>This study delves into the impact of imidacloprid, an insecticide documented for its toxicity towards honeybees, on the development of bee larvae. The investigation involved exposing bee larvae to various concentrations of imidacloprid, and observing the resultant effects.</p>
<p>The findings of this study revealed that imidacloprid exerted a dose-dependent delay in the development of bee larvae, marked by reductions in body mass, width, and an overall decline in the growth index. Moreover, at elevated concentrations, imidacloprid was observed to impair neural transmission, induce oxidative stress, inflict damage to the gut, and inhibit hormones and genes essential for development. The larvae were found to engage antioxidant defense systems and deploy detoxification mechanisms to mitigate these effects.</p>
<p>However, the manuscript could be significantly enhanced through several improvements. Firstly, the structure of the manuscript warrants refinement to foster coherence and clarity. Additionally, there is a need for careful reevaluation of the concentrations of imidacloprid employed in the study, to ensure their relevance and applicability. In terms of references, greater attention to accuracy in citation is imperative.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while the authors have provided an overview of the general effects of imidacloprid on both vertebrates and invertebrates, the inclusion of a more exhaustive literature review with a specific focus on honey bees and other insects would bolster the context and significance of this research. This would be particularly beneficial in the introduction section, which should be subjected to a major revision.</p>
<p>In summary, this study offers preliminary evidence of the detrimental effects of imidacloprid on the development of bee larvae by interfering with molting and metabolism. This research holds potential as a valuable resource for assessing the risks posed by pesticides to juvenile stages of various animal species.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>On behalf of all the authors, I express our most sincere gratitude for your critical comments and suggestions. Following your suggestions, we have thoroughly reviewed and revised the entire manuscript, including the issues of imidacloprid concentration and citation accuracy you raised. More importantly, we have significantly revised the structure and content of the introductory section of the manuscript to include many more detailed reviews of critical literature, with particular attention to the overview of relevant research on honey bees, Drosophila, and other insects, to promote coherence and clarity of the introduction and to enhance the context and importance of this research. We hope that these changes meet with your approval. Overall, your valuable comments have greatly improved the quality of the manuscript and will facilitate our future research.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Q1: Line 48, &quot;Adults exposed to high doses of imidacloprid experience&quot;, please provide a more precise value for the high doses.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for your comments. Following your suggestion, we have provided precise values for high doses of imidacloprid for adult exposure based on the study by Dr. Wu et al. 2001.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Q2: Line 82, There are several larvae effect reports using next generation sequencing approach. The authors should include those related references in this section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments. We have included relevant references in our revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Q3: Line 394, for the concentration design, the maximum concentration of imidacloprid used in this study is 377 ppb, which is from the imidacloprid residue level in beeswax. Bees don't consume beeswax, and the reference is wrong.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising this critical issue. As you point out, bees do not eat beeswax, but it is important to stress that this may well mean that the bee larvae themselves are exposed to higher doses. Therefore, in this study, we ultimately designed for the worst-case scenario of 377 ppb of imidacloprid residues in beeswax. We would like your agreement on this point. In addition, we have corrected the citation errors in the references here and included them in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer 2:</bold></p>
<p>This study provides evidence on the ability of sublethal imidacloprid doses to affect growth and development of honeybee larva. While checking the effect of doses that do not impact survival or food intake, the authors found changes in the expression of genes related to energy metabolism, antioxidant response, and P450 metabolism. The authors also identified cell death in the alimentary canal, and disturbances in levels of ROS markers, molting hormones, weight and growth ratio. The study strengths come from applying these different approaches to investigate the impacts of imidacloprid exposure. The study weaknesses are not providing an in-depth investigation of the mechanisms behind the impacts observed and not bringing the results in light of the current literature. For instance, the authors' hypothesis is based on two main points, the generation of ROS that leads to gut cell death and energy dysfunction, and the increased P450 expression. They propose this increases P450 expression which in turn increases energy consumption and could contribute to developmental retardation. There is however no investigation on the mechanisms of ROS generation (it could be through mitochondrial damage, Nox/ Duox activity, NOS activity, P450s activity, etc). A link between higher P450 expression and increased energy consumption leading to energy deprivation is also missing. It would also be important for the authors to provide a more complete literature review as previous works have investigated imidacloprid sublethal dose impacts in larval stages for bees and other insect models.</p>

<p>Q1: Abstract: It would be important to rephrase the abstract to make it clear when authors are talking about gene expression results or functional assays.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. Following your suggestion, we have revised the abstract to make it clearer, especially the description of the gene expression results. Please see lines 15-34 in our revised manuscript.</p>
<p>“Abstract Imidacloprid is a global health threat that severely poisons the economically and ecologically important honeybee pollinator, Apis mellifera. However, its effects on developing bee larvae remain largely unexplored. Our pilot study showed that imidacloprid causes developmental delay in bee larvae, but the underlying toxicological mechanisms remain incompletely understood. In this study, we exposed bee larvae to imidacloprid at environmentally relevant concentrations of 0.7, 1.2, 3.1, and 377 ppb. There was a marked dose-dependent delay in larval development, characterized by reductions in body mass, width, and growth index. However, imidacloprid did not affect larval survival and food consumption. The primary toxicological effects induced by elevated concentrations of imidacloprid (377 ppb) included inhibition of neural transmission gene expression, induction of oxidative stress, gut structural damage, and apoptosis, inhibition of developmental regulatory hormones and genes, suppression of gene expression levels involved in proteolysis, amino acid transport, protein synthesis, carbohydrate catabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolysis energy production. In addition, we found that the larvae may use antioxidant defenses and P450 detoxification mechanisms to mitigate the effects of imidacloprid. Ultimately, this study provides the first evidence that environmentally exposed imidacloprid can affect the growth and development of bee larvae by disrupting molting regulation and limiting the metabolism and utilization of dietary nutrients and energy. These findings have broader implications for studies assessing pesticide hazards in other juvenile animals”</p>

It is important that the authors perform a more complete literature search to compare their work to previous ones, drawing conclusions and highlighting their novelties.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate your insightful comments and valuable suggestions. Following your suggestions, we have made significant revisions to the structure and content of the Introduction section. We have incorporated the critical literature you provided and other relevant literature reviews, with a particular emphasis on studies of bees, fruit flies, and other insects. These revisions aim to improve the coherence, clarity, background, and significance of the Introduction. We hope that these modifications meet with your approval. Please see the red text in the Introduction section in our revised version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Q5: Line 104: Explanation on the doses used should be included here, not later in the methods. Also, important to highlight that whereas the doses tested were found in bee products, they likely mean that the bees themselves were being exposed to even higher doses.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. Following your suggestions, we have moved the explanation of the imidacloprid doses used in this study to the Results section, as you mentioned. Please see lines 138-142 in our revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Q6: Line 112: It is important to identify the neuronal targets of imidacloprid in honeybees. Many are known. Some of the nAChRs targets were not investigated in this study (such as subunit alpha8 and beta1). Plus, is alpha2 an imidacloprid target? How does the expression of other nAChRs subunits compares? Importantly, these genes are expressed mostly in the nervous system, so a more correct approach would be a tissue specific analysis. The lack of tissue specific analysis is a consistent flaw throughout the methodological design.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for your important comment. Bees have more than ten nAChR subunit members. Imidacloprid inhibits acetylcholinesterase activity by competitively binding to acetylcholinesterase receptors. As you noted, this study did not investigate the expression of all nAChR subunits, including the alpha8 and beta1 subunits, in different tissues, which is a shortcoming of our study. We have always failed to make a technological breakthrough and cannot dissect to obtain important tissues from developing larvae alone. We have therefore had to abandon this design and use the whole larva as a sample for measurement. We are aware that this is a shortcoming of this research. In the future, we will make a breakthrough in technology and conduct a comparative analysis of all nAChR subunit genes in different organizations and developmental stages to obtain more comprehensive and accurate data. Thank you again for raising this important issue and for your valuable suggestions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Q7 ~ Q9: Line 125: P450s expression may have opposite behavior when exposed to insecticides depending on tissue (such as brain and fat body). When checking whole larva gene expression, the tissue specific profiles become diluted and thus less reliable (for reference, check: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2011828117">https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2011828117</ext-link>); Line 131: Again, for the analysis of oxidative stress it would be important to investigate a tissue specific expression pattern and measurement of ROS markers. Investigating different time points during the exposure also adds to the mechanistic understanding. Do all tissues respond in the same way? In which tissue does an increase in ROS generation start? How? Does it spread to other tissues? By which mechanisms is it generated; Results in general: Tissue specific analyses and more time points can provide a better understanding of how sublethal imidacloprid doses impact growth and survival. Thinking about the doses of choice in light of what bees might be exposed is also important. The mechanistic understanding is missing in the paper, and without it the study does not add much in comparison to previous ones.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for your valuable comments. As you pointed out, the intensity of P450 detoxification and oxidative stress varies considerably between tissues. When checking whole larva gene expression, the tissue-specific profiles become diluted, which is detrimental to elucidating mechanisms. In this study, we encountered technical barriers in obtaining independent samples of specific tissues for anatomical sampling. As a result, we had to forego analysis of some specific tissues, including the tissue-differentiated analyses of P450 gene expression patterns and ROS markers that you mentioned. We only examined larval overall detoxification and antioxidant responses to imidacloprid toxicity. While we do not believe that data from specific tissues are fully representative of the complex overall picture of larvae, there is no doubt that the decision to study larvae as a whole does not contribute to our complete understanding of the mechanisms by which imidacloprid causes larval developmental retardation and larval responses to imidacloprid toxicity. In addition, the fact that this study only analyzed one-time points during imidacloprid exposure and did not design and comparatively analyze different time points limits our complete understanding of the above mechanisms. In summary, as you have pointed out, tissue-specific analyses and more time points could better understand how sublethal doses of imidacloprid affect growth and survival. In future studies, we will overcome the technical challenges and refer to your suggestions for further systematic and in-depth mechanistic studies specifically targeting imidacloprid toxicity in different tissues at different exposure times and incorporate your suggestions, such as whether the response is consistent across all tissues, the origin of the increase in ROS production, how it increases, whether it spreads to other tissues, and the underlying mechanisms into the next experimental design. Again, Thank you for your constructive and valuable comments, which have provided valuable insight for our study on mechanisms. Undoubtedly, these comments will enhance the innovativeness of our study and greatly facilitate our future research.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Q10: Line 236: The conclusion that mitochondrial dysfunction is taking place is not well corroborated. Are there changes in mitochondrial aconitase activity to suggest the mitochondrial origin of ROS? How do mitochondria look like under electron microscopy? Evidence for mitochondrial damage from functional assays? Could the ATP reduced levels be caused by increased consumption by other systems, instead of reduced production? Without functional assays to demonstrate mitochondrial dysfunction the indirect measurements of gene expression at most suggest expression perturbations in mitochondria for the point in time when gene profiles were examined.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the comments. Based on the data of the present study, i.e., suppression of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (COX17, NDUFB7) and expression of genes of its alternative glycolytic pathways (Gapdh, Oscillin), as well as a decrease in the ATP content, suggests that imidacloprid exposure leads to impaired energy metabolism in larvae and not to mitochondrial dysfunction.

<p>Q11: Though not the aim of the study, an important step forward would be to investigate whether these doses that do not impact survival but cause growth retardation could affect the many stereotypical behaviors displayed by the worker bees when they reach the adult life. Without this sort of analysis, it is difficult to stablish whether the doses tested will impact the colony health.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your valuable suggestions, which give us broader ideas for our subsequent, more in-depth work on the mechanism of toxicity. Inspired by your suggestion, we plan to conduct further studies to investigate the effects of different levels of imidacloprid exposure on the developmental process of bee larvae and the underlying mechanism of toxicity. We will also investigate the intrinsic link between this juvenile toxicity and behavioral and physiological defects in adult individuals.</p>

<p>Q12: Line 376: the authors do not provide a link to their hypothesis that increased P450, and antioxidant response is reducing larvae nutrient supply.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. I apologize for not fully understanding your point. If you mean that the hypothesis proposed in this study that increased P450 and antioxidant responses reduce larval nutrient energy supply is not well-founded, we have already addressed this in the previous paragraph. See Figure 7 and lines 395-399 for more details in our revised manuscript.</p>

<p>Q13: Line 393: Were the colonies single-cohort? Were the frames from different hives mixed together to create the experimental groups? Or each experimental group comes from a different frame/colony? This information is important to establish how much genetic variation might exist between the different experimental groups.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. In this study, the selected colonies were healthy and not exposed to pathogens or pesticides. Two-day-old larvae from the same frames of the same hive were individually transferred to sterile 24-well cell culture plates. The plates contained a standard diet containing royal jelly, glucose, fructose, water, and yeast extract. We have included the above text in our revised manuscript. Please see the lines 430-432 red text in the revised manuscript.</p>
