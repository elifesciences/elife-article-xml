<abstract><p>Mouse female primordial germ cells undergo five synchronous, incomplete mitotic divisions, and send each resulting germline cyst into meiosis to fragment and produce 4-6 oocytes and 24-26 supportive nurse cells. How oocytes are specified, linked appropriately to nurse cells and acquire high quality organelles and cytoplasm remains unclear. We show that mouse cysts develop an asymmetric Golgi, ER and microtubule-associated structure, “Visham,” similar to oocyte-determining fusome in Drosophila cysts. Starting as the EMA granule, Visham distributes asymmetrically in cyst cells along with Pard3, and enriches in future oocytes. Transient spindle remnants containing stable acetylated microtubules link early cyst cells; a gap in these microtubules beginning at the 8-cell stage suggests cysts are programmed to fragment into six-cell groups. Visham also acts during meiosis to mediates Pard3-dependent polarity, Xbp1-dependent adaptive UPR, and organelle rejuvenation. In Dazl mutants, cysts still form, but normal Visham behavior, polarity, rejuvenation and oocyte production are blocked.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Early female germ cell development occurs within interconnected cysts formed by consecutive incomplete divisions of a germline stem cell (GSC) or PGC in diverse animals. These include basal species like hydra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Littlefield, 1994</xref>), nematodes like C. elegans, insects like Drosophila, and vertebrates including fish, frogs, mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gondos, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">King, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Pepling and Spradling, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kloc et al. 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Marlow and Mullins, 2008</xref>; review, Spradling, 2024). As they develop, cysts acquire polarity often associated with a microtubule-rich &quot;fusome&quot; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Giardina, 1901</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Huynh and St Johnston, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Spradling et al 2022</xref>). In Drosophila, the fusome arises from mitotic spindle remnants, contains ER cisternae and its polarity is essential for oocyte production. Later in meiotic prophase the fusome mediates centrioles, mitochondria, and germ plasm regulators such as oskar mRNA to move into the oocyte where they form the Balbiani body (Bb). Remarkably, mammalian oocytes also undergo these same events (review: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Spradling et al. 2022</xref>). Oocytes in many invertebrate and vertebrate species require Par genes to establish or maintain their polarity (review: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Huynh and St Johnston, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In the mouse, germ cells are induced around embryonic day 6.5 (E6.5) (Lawson et al. 2002) and begin migrating toward the gonad as primordial germ cells (PGCs). En route, PGCs reprogram their epigenetic state and return to pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Seki et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Saitou et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Loda et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Liu et al. 2025</xref>). However, after they enter the gonad at E10.5, PGCs turn on DDX4 and initiate cyst formation while reprogramming is still ongoing. During E11.5 they upregulate Dazl, an RNA-binding, post-transcriptional regulatory protein which is needed to produce and translate multiple target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Zagore et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Yang et al. 2020</xref>). Dazl plays an essential role promoting germ cell meiotic entry and oocyte production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gill et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Nicholls et al. 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Mouse germline cysts arise from five rounds of mitotic divisions beginning at E10.5, so that each PGC generates almost 32 cells. However, the cysts break into an average of 4.8 smaller cysts by the time divisions are completed at E14.5 when cells enter meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lei and Spradling, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Levy et al. 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>During meiosis, each smaller cyst slowly loses component cells, as every 2 days about one cell on average becomes activated to act as a nurse cell. It transfers most of its cytoplasm into the residual cyst, shrinks to a small remnant and undergoes programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lei et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Niu and Spradling, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ikami et al 2023</xref>). In pachytene, there is a substantial reorganization that brings mitochondria and ER sheets into close proximity by E18.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Pepling and Spradling, 2001</xref>). Cyst breakdown is complete by 5 days after birth (P5) with the formation of 4-6 primordial follicles, each containing a single oocyte in which organelles transferred from nurse cells are gathered into an aggregate known as the Balbiani body. Cyst polarity guide cyst fragmentation and oocyte specification, polarization and organelle acquisition, but a mouse analog of the fusome has not been identified.</p>
<p>Germline cysts also support germ cell rejuvenation, the universal process that allows damage to be removed each generation so that species can persist without known limit. Germline rejuvenation takes place during meiosis in single celled eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Unal et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Suda et al. 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Xiao and Unal, 2025</xref>). Processes that rejuvenate organelles such as mitochondria, restore rDNA copy number, and reset epigenetic chromatin marks have also been documented in meiosis during animal gametogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cox and Spradling, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hill et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Reik and Surani, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bohnert and Kenyon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lieber et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Pang et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Yamashita, 2023</xref>). The Balbiani body, in newly formed oocytes, is associated with germ plasm formation and selection for mitochondrial function in many species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Heasman et al. 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kloc et al. 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Marlow and Mullins, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Spradling et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Sekula et al. 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>Here we find that mouse PGCs and cyst cells elaborate a fusome-like structure we term &quot;Visham&quot; that is rich Golgi, endosomal vesicles and associates with ER. Visham distributes asymmetrically in association with stable microtubules that persist briefly for part of the cyst cell cycle. By the 8-cell stage, cyst cells reorganize into a rosette configuration that brings cells with the most bridges (potential oocytes) and associated Visham closer together. Developing cysts at this stage frequently fragment non-randomly at sites lacking microtubule connections into six-cell cysts, implying that mouse ovarian cyst structure is more highly controlled than previously realized. Beginning as PGCs and throughout cyst formation, EGAD-mediated UPR pathway proteins including Xbp1 are expressed, suggesting that the oocyte proteome quality begins to be enhanced beginning very early. After pachytene, centrosome/Golgi-rich elements move to the oocyte and mediate the acquisition of organelles by the Bb. In the absence of Dazl, cyst development and asymmetric Visham accumulation is disrupted, and no oocytes are produced.</p>

<title>PGCs contain a Golgi-rich structure known as the EMA granule</title>
<p>Early observations of a germ cell &quot;epithelial membrane antigen (EMA)&quot; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hahnel and Eddy, 1987</xref>) identified an &quot;EMA granule&quot; in mouse primordial germ cells that resembles the Drosophila spectrosome, a fusome precursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Lin et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Pepling and Spradling, 1998</xref>). To investigate this relationship further, we determined that the EMA granule appears in PGCs as early as E9.5 and continues to be expressed in later cysts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1A</xref>). We used lineage labeling to mark cysts derived from single PGCs, and 3D surface rendering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig S1B-C</xref>) and volume quantification, to demonstrate a significantly uneven distribution of the EMA granule within cyst daughter cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). This structural asymmetry prompted us to name th EMA-rich structure &quot;Visham&quot; (Sanskrit for asymmetric/uneven).</p>

<p>The EMA-rich material reorganized and moved closer together in female cysts by E13.5 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1D-E</xref>), whereas in male cysts they remained mostly separate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C’</xref> and graph). Cyst regions with enriched Visham staining contain an average of 3 Tex14-positive bridges, whereas unenriched zones had an average of just 1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> graph; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1F</xref>). Thus, highly branched cells with more bridges, which are known to give rise to most oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lei and Spradling, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lei and Spradling, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ikami et al. 2023</xref>), contain more Visham. Similar clustering, known as rosette formation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>), and increased fusome accumulation in pro-oocytes, occur as germline cysts grow in Drosophila and many species (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hegner, 1914</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Büning, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Huynh and St Johnston, 2004</xref>). Rosette formation is thought to prepare for sharing between nurse cells and oocytes.</p>

<title>Visham is highly enriched in Golgi and vesicles</title>
<p>Electron microscopy (EM) of mouse germ cells documented EMA granules with prominent Golgi and endocytic vesicles in most E11.5 and E12.5 cyst germ cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E’</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1K</xref>). Visham co-stained with the Golgi protein Gm130 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>) and the recycling endosomal protein Rab11a1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F’</xref>).</p>
<p>Visham often partly overlaps with ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1I</xref>). EM sections of E14.5 cysts revealed clusters of Golgi within adjacent cyst cells near ring canals as expected for cysts after rosette formation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, 1E’’). EMA-1 antisera react with multiple fucosylated glycolipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Apostolopoulos et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1H</xref>). EMA staining disappears from germ cells at E14.5 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>), however, very similar (but non-germ cell-specific) staining continued with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) at later stages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G, G”</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1G</xref>).</p>

<title>Visham overlaps centrosomes and moves on microtubules</title>
<p>A cell’s microtubule cytoskeleton that emanates from its centrosomes, and from non-centrosomal microtubule organizing centers (ncMTOCs), frequently controls trafficking of Golgi elements and positions them near centrosomes. To investigate the relationship between microtubules and Visham, we stained E11.5 gonads with anti-acetylated tubulin (AcTub) and EMA. Visham usually overlapped the centrosomes in interphase germ cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), indicating it occupies a peri-centriolar domain. In germ cells undergoing mitosis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), Visham associated with centrioles during interphase, but (typical for Golgi) dispersed as a spindle forms and for most of metaphase. In telophase, Visham vesicles gather at the spindle poles in both daughter cells and at the arrested cytokinesis furrow, which still retains the elongated spindle/midbody microtubules typical of cyst-forming cell cycles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). 3D summary movies of germ cells at these stages stained for AcTub and EMA are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2A</xref>.</p>

<p>These behaviors differ in detail from the pattern of Drosophila fusome segregation during cyst divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">de Cuevas and Spradling, 1998</xref>). Visham was rarely seen at just one pole of a spindle like the fusome at very early stages of GSC and cytoblast division; some EMA-reactive material also appears at the cytokinesis furrow earlier than the fusome (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2C-D</xref>). Asymmetry in the Visham distribution arose only in late telophase. Clusters of Visham and centrosomes approached the arrested furrow (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">S2C-D</xref>). At this point short microtubule arrays were visible (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">S2C</xref>). Soon after, the amount of Visham in the two daughter cells becomes asymmetric, suggesting that differential activity or persistence of Visham transport late in cytokinesis generates asymmetry. Ovaries cultured briefly in vitro support continued germ cell division and Visham asymmetry. Visham formation is severely affected in such cultures if MTs were disrupted by cold or by Ciliobrevin D treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2E graph</xref>).</p>

<title>Cyst fragmentation is non-random and correlates with microtubule gaps</title>
<p>Mouse cysts produce an average of 4-6 oocytes per PGC as a result of initial cyst breakage into multiple, independently developing subcysts that each produce one oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lei and Spradling, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Niu and Spradling, 2022</xref>). Production of uniform-sized oocytes, as observed, would seem to require programmed breakage into uniform subcysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Spradling et al. 2022</xref>), but some random breakage also occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lei and Spradling, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ikami et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Levy et al. 2024</xref>). To assess a role of microtubules and Visham in programming cyst fragmentation, we tracked AcTub and Visham in lineage-labeled E12.5 cysts. In about 10% of interphase cysts, presumably those in very late telophase or early in the subsequent cell cycle, persistent microtubule arrays were observed that connected the cells in pairs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). When we examined a total of about 50 large cysts, 15 larger cysts of 7-10 cells were found where the MTs in all cells could be analyzed completely. Unexpectedly, all showed a large discontinuity of 10μ or more in microtubule linkage between just two of the cystocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Three examples are shown in which projections of 8-cell lineage labeled cysts are outlined (dashed lines). In the left column, Visham and MTs are shown (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E-E”</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2F’</xref>). In the middle column, microtubule bundles connect most cell cells, but are absent between two cells (straight dashed line). The absence of an MT connection predicts cyst breakage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E’’</xref>), where separation into a 2-cell and 6-cell cyst has already occurred.</p>
<p>The patterns of cyst breakage predicted by MT absence were non-random (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Production of a 6-cell cysts was strongly preferred based on the position of the gaps in 13/15 cysts analyzed. 8-cell or larger cysts all were predicted to generate a 6-cell cyst and a residual cell group. This pattern potentially explains six-cell mitoses frequently observed during E10.5-E14.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Pepling and Spradling, 1998</xref>), and the ∼5-fold increase in the number of accumulated organelles in P4 oocytes compared to E14.5 germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lei and Spradling, 2016</xref>).</p>

<p>Microtubules play a critical role in ovarian cyst formation and polarity in multiple species. Some of the most important regulators of MTs and polarity are the Par proteins that function in epithelial cell polarity, embryonic development, asymmetric neuroblast division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Petronczki and Knoblich, 2001</xref>) and oocyte formation in C. elegans, Drosophila and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kemphues et al. 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Huynh and St Johnston, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Moore and Zernicka-Goetz, 2005</xref>). Drosophila meiotic cysts express Par3/Baz and Par6, another apical Par complex protein, along with beta-catenin/Arm in a ring-like arrangement close to the ring canals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cox et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Huynh et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Huynh and St Johnston, 2004</xref>). This relatively small membrane zone likely represents the apical domain of cyst germ cells.</p>
<p>We investigated the expression of Pard3, the mouse ortholog of Par3/Baz to determine if a similar arrangement of the highly conserved Par proteins occurs in mouse germline cysts. Pard3 expression localized around Visham but extended beyond it, a pattern reminiscent of the larger ring of Baz in Drosophila cyst cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3A</xref>). At E13.5, cysts in rosette configuration show Pard3 and Visham enriched around a central cell (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, dashed region) but not in E13.5 male cysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3B’</xref>) This co-localization was validated in multiple lineage-labeled E13.5 cysts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3D</xref>). Ring canals were concentrated in this zone (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), hence mouse cysts have ring canals and an apical Par protein in the same small anterior location as in Drosophila, and that Visham occupies the corresponding zone as the Drosophila fusome. These findings suggest that mammals form and polarize oocytes using a conserved system found in diverse animals based on Par genes, cyst formation and a fusome.</p>

<title>Visham associates with Golgi genes involved in UPR beginning at the onset of cyst formation</title>
<p>We sequenced additional fetal germ cells (see Methods) and added them to data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Niu and Spradling (2022)</xref> to make an integrated dataset of more than 3,000 germ cells spanning E10.5 to P5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F-H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3E-I</xref>). Our gene expression studies showed that PGCs and early cysts actively express many genes that enhance proteome quality by monitoring, refolding or expelling misfolded or aggregated proteins for degradation. The UPR pathway associated largely with the ER in yeast is regulated by Hac1, the ortholog of Xbp1. We observed high levels of Xbp1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>) and many of. its target genes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>) that increase quality secretory protein production. Membrane proteins and lipids are also promoted by this pathway In animals the UPR pathway has been expanded with several additional branches. We also observed expression Creb3l2 (ER/Golgi resident transcription factor), ATF4 (General UPR transcription factor activated by Golgi stress), Golph3 (Golgi phosphoprotein for membrane trafficking) and Arfgap(s) (involved in both Golgi to ER-and Golgi to endosome trafficking) during mouse cyst formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig S3J</xref>). Xbp1 activates genes such as the chaperones (Hsp5a/Bip, Hsp90b1;DNAjc10; Lman2; Dnajb9(, protein-disulfide isomerases (Erp44, Pdia3, Pdia4, Pdia6, Creld2), the ERAD regulator Syvn1/Hrd1 and the ERAD components (Sec61b; Ubxn4, Psmc6, Ube2j2, Get4, Ufd1). Thus, repair and expansion of ER, Golgi and secretory components begins immediately or even before migrating PGCs reach the gonad (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3I</xref>).</p>

<p>Xbp1 also supports synthesis of ER membrane phospholipids via upregulation of targets such as Elovl1, Elovl5, and Elovl6, and Chka, Other highly expressed targets maintain ER and Golgi structure and are orthologs of Drosophila fusome proteins (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I’</xref>).

<title>UPR genes are active during cyst formation and depend on Dazl</title>
<p>To investigate the effects of Dazl on cyst formation we confirmed that Dazl<sup>-/-</sup> mice retard the PGC to germ cell transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4C-E</xref>). Dazl<sup>-/-</sup> E12.5 cysts showed higher levels of the DNA methylase Dnmt3a expression compared to controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4A-B</xref>) suggesting that germ cell DNA demethylation has slowed. Ring canals highlighted by staining for Tex14 were only half the size of wild type canals at E13.5 or structurally abnormal showing that cyst formation was slowed and cytokinesis was sometimes abnormal(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>
<p>We also performed scRNA sequencing of Dazl female homozygous mutant gonads at E11.5 and E12. and reclustered them with wild type germ cells at these stages for comparison (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). At E11.5 the merged germ cells cluster together suggesting that Dazl<sup>-/-</sup> has minimal effects on germ cells at E11.5, the stage it is first expressed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). However, E12.5 WT and Dazl<sup>-/-</sup> germ cells cluster separately (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). Wild type and Dazl<sup>-/-</sup> expressed similar amounts of EGAD mediated UPR pathway genes at E11.5 germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4F</xref>) whereas wild type germ cells expressed lower levels compared to Dazl<sup>-/-</sup> cells at E12.5 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C’</xref>). Thus, UPR genes in Dazl<sup>-/-</sup> cells act similarly to pluripotency genes, and retain high expression levels later in cyst development than wild type.</p>
<p>The high expression of Xbp1 and many of its target genes in PGCs and early cyst cells argues that early germ cells are expanding ER and Golgi production, and increasing membrane protein quality. To validate that XBP1 is active in germ cells, we employed an IRE1-XBP1 ratiometric assay which utilizes a genetically encoded dual-fluorescent reporter system (see Methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4I</xref>). First, we performed magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) to purify SSEA1 labelled germ cells from the E11.5 gonad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4G-H</xref>). We delivered the IRE1-XBP1 sensor to SSEA1+ve germ cells and SSEA1-ve control somatic cells by transfection. Both types of cells fluoresce in proportion to IRE1-splicing activity which measures Xbp1activation activity. The construct also constitutively expresses a fluorescent marker such that the color ratio will represent a quantitative measure of relative IRE1-XBP1 activity between cells and under different conditions. Our observations showed that IRE1-Xbp1 activity in E11.5 germ cells was significantly higher than in somatic cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Dazl mutant cells showed persistent higher levels of Xbp1 activity at E12.5 (Figure D’, D’’).</p>
<p>The adaptive UPR pathway destroys misfolded proteins using proteasome activity, particularly the 20 proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Vembar and Brodsky, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). We measured proteasome activity within E11.5 PGCs to investigate whether the UPR pathway was paired with increased proteasome activity indicating it served an adaptive cellular mechanism of cell rejuvenation in PGCs destined to produce oocytes. Using a fluorogenic substrate to measure 20S Proteasome activity, we compared MACS sorted germ cells to somati cells and found that germ cells have significantly higher proteasome activity than somatic cells at E11.5 (Fi 4E) and E12.5 (4E’ Left). Proteosome activity was even higher in Dazl-/-germ cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E’</xref> Right, 4E”).</p>
<p>We also studied the effects of Dazl mutation on the asymmetric enrichment of Visham in cells with multiple ring canals. Using both EMA and a Golgi marker, Gs28, we observed that germ cell Golgi begin to fragment in <italic>Dazl</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutant germ cells even by E12.5 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4F</xref>, dotted circles). High levels of Golgi stress documented by the increased IRE1-Xbp1 activity, and elevated proteolysis in these cells, may lead to such fragmentation. These problems were accompanied by a dramatic arrest in cyst polarity development. E13.5 in <italic>Dazl</italic><sup>-/-</sup> germ cells showed virtually no differential expression of Pard3 or enrichment of Visham within particular cyst cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F’</xref>). Finally, in <italic>Dazl</italic><sup>-/-</sup> P0 gonads, large cells destined by become oocytes do no appear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figure S5E</xref>). The effects of Dazl-/-on germline cyst development and meiosis are summarized in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>. The observed loss of polarity caused by Dazl-/-mutation can explain the failure of oocyte production and sterility of Dazl homozygotes.</p>

<title>Visham participates in organelle rejuvenation during meiosis</title>
<p>In Drosophila, starting at pachytene the microtubule cytoskeleton changes its structure, and polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cox and Sprading, 2006</xref>). The new polarity, with microtubules running along the fusome such that minus ends cluster in the oocyte, prepares selected nurse cell organelles for transport into the oocyte and the Bb of a new primordial follicle. Mouse nurse cell centrosomes, mitochondria, Golgi, ER and possibly other organelles also move from nurse cells to the oocyte between P0 and P4 in a microtubule-dependent process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lei and Spradling, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Niu and Spradling, 2022</xref>). Prior to or during these events, Drosophila mitochondria are selected and rejuvenated by programmed mitophagy to enhance functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cox and Spradling, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lieber et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Palozzi et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Monteiro et al. 2023</xref>). It is not currently known if selection and rejuvenation take place before movement to the oocyte, or if a significant amount also takes place en route.</p>
<p>Because the fusome is directly involved in organelle movement to the Drosophila Balbiani body we looked for changes in Visham and in gene expression that might relate to organelle rejuvenation and movement to the oocyte. Visham staining with WGA persists within meiotic germ cells at E17.5 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-A’</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figure S5A-C</xref>). Visham volume, remained in proportion with germ cell ring canals, as outer nurse cells (with one ring canal) transfer organelles and cytoplasm to cells with more ring canals located closer to oocytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, graph). Pard3 content also showed such a proportion (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). At E18.5, cyst development in the medulla toward wave 1 follicles, diverged from wave 2 follicles in the cortex that become quiescent primordial follicles (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Yin and Spradling, 2025</xref>). Wave 1 oocytes grow substantially in volume, Visham content and Pard3 due to cytoplasmic transfer from surrounding nurse cells which decrease in size (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B-B’, 5E-E’’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figure S5E-F, left</xref>). Oocyte enrichment of Visham and Pard3 was confirmed using lineage labelled cysts at P0 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5F</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Mouse germline cysts contain a fusome-like structure, Visham</title>
<p>Our results document a mammalian analog of the Drosophila fusome that displays conserved properties likely to underlie animal oogenesis. The fusome and Visham and both start as a small granular region within migrating PGCs before they arrive at the gonad. The granule transforms into an asymmetric structure during synchronous, incomplete divisions, involving stabilized spindle microtubules rich in AcTu and a program of arrested cytokinesis that produces distinctive ring canals. While stainable MTs persist for only part of the cell cycle, cyst and fusome polarity is maintained, as evidenced by preferential Visham accumulation in future oocytes, and rosette formation. Finally, the association of Visham with an apical Par complex located near the clustered ring canals, as originally described for the fusome in Drosophila cysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cox et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Huynh et al. 2001</xref>), is particularly important. Apical-basal patterning of Drosophila oocytes differs from many epithelial cells (review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Huynh and St Johnston, 2004</xref>), but Par genes are essentia for oocyte production and their action now appears to be conserved at least in part. Our results argue that apical-basal polarity formation within germline cysts utilizes a fusome to specify oocytes and to aid their patterning and rejuvenation.</p>
<p>Early germ cells in other female mammals likely also use closely related mechanisms, given the ancient origin of cyst formation in animal gametogenesis. Golgi/ER-associated membranes forming a spherical mass in germ cells were reported in classical studies of pig and mouse reproductive tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Anderson &amp; Beams, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Clark &amp; Eddy, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Ginsburg et al., 1990</xref>). Similar perinuclear structures associated with a Golgi complex in PGCs have been reported in other vertebrate species like chicken and quail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fazel et al., 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Jung et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Urven et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Yoshinaga et al., 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hen et al. 2014</xref>). The presence of a fusome in developing human germline cysts and its similarity to mouse Visham merits further investigation.</p>

<title>Mouse cysts develop multiple uniform oocytes using a novel specific-cleavage mechanism</title>
<p>Mouse PGCs usually generate 4-6 oocytes using a complicated mechanism involving synchronous incomplete cyst divisions, limited breakage into smaller cysts (&lt;10% of cell-cell junctions) and continuous, slow nurse cell turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lei and Spradling, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lei and Spradling, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Niu and Spradling, 2022</xref>.</p>
<p>Despite their complex pathway, mouse oocytes in newly formed primordial follicles appear quite uniform i size and are efficiently produced, suggesting that they develop from final cysts of similar size and nurse cell content. However, lineage analyses did not reveal a pathway that generated uniform cysts, but showed man cyst cells that had moved considerable distances apart at least transiently. Live imaging studies revealed active movement likely responsible for some cell displacement, but also cell detachment caused by random breakage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Levy et al. 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>Our studies of Visham and stable microtubules support the view that programmed cyst breakage during mitotic divisions contributes strongly to oocyte uniformity. AcTub arrays in cysts of 7-10 cells frequently contained a single large gap lacking MTs between a group of 6-cells, and the other residual cells. Such gaps in a major cytoskeletal element of germ cells subjected to significant tissue movements might represent cleavage sites (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E’’</xref>). Previous studies also strongly support the idea that 6-cell cysts play a special role. Synchronous mitoses in forming cysts are distinctive and easier to map unambiguously than th connectivity of lineage-labeled cells. 6-cell synchronous divisions are by far the most commonly observed cyst size not a power of 2 throughout E11.5 to E14.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Pepling and Spradling, 1998</xref>). Additionally, quantitation of organelles in developing germ cells throughout oogenesis showed that P4 oocytes contain approximately 5 times as many centrosomes, Golgi, and mitochondria and four times as much cytoplasm as E14.5 germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lei and Spradling, 2016</xref>). It is difficult to explain these results if random breakage due to excess random cell movement is a major factor determining cyst size and connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Levy et al. 2024</xref>), although it undoubtedly occurs.</p>
<p>What might cause the preferential breakage of growing cysts in a 6:2 manner? One possibility is the uneven distribution of Visham in four cell cysts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B’’</xref>). The cell with the lowest amount might fail to sustain a microtubule connection at the next division, leading to 6:2 breakage. Involvement of the microtubule cytoskeleton in asymmetric divisions has been observed in many other situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fichelson &amp; Huynh, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kaltschmidt &amp; Brand, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Sunchu &amp; Cabernard, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Meiring et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Planelles-Herrero et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Watson et al., 2023</xref>). Even if programmed breakage into 6-cell cysts predominates, other sources of variation likely also occur. Some 8-cell cysts persist and divide again, rarely completing intact 32-cell cysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Pepling and Spradling, 1998</xref>). It is not known if these cells are cleavable into smaller cysts or not, or whether random breakage to a smaller size would make them cleavable. Nonetheless, given oocyte uniformity, it seems plausible that most functional oocytes derive from cysts with about 5 nurse cells.</p>

<title>Germ cell rejuvenation is highly active during cyst formation</title>
<p>Germ cells have long been known to propagate species without know limits over evolutionary time by rejuvenating gametes each generation in association with meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Weismann, 1892</xref>; Kirkwood, 1987).</p>
<p>Recently, the detailed cellular and molecular genetic mechanisms that make this possible both in single-celled eukaryotes and in animals have generated increasing interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cox and Spradling, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Unal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bohnert and Kenyon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lieber et al., 2019</xref>; Chen et al. 2020; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Palozzi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Spradling et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Yamashita, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Xiao and Unal, 2025</xref>). By studying Visham, which is already present in migrating PGCs and E9.5, and by sequencing mouse germ cells from the earliest stages of ovarian development beginning at E10.5, we gained new insights into the timing and processes of germ cell rejuvenation during mouse oogenesis.</p>
<p>These studies made it clear that multiple processes of rejuvenation are highly active from the very earliest times of germ cell development (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>). In animals the UPR pathway has been modified by the addition of several additional pathways besides the Ire1-Xba1 branch, all of which were expressed in early germ cells. Creb3l2 controls a transcription factor that increases production COPII vesicles that carry out ER to Golgi transport and maintain a balance between secretory supply and demand. Insufficient matching can lead to Golgi stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Machamer, 2015</xref>), which can be managed by activating the ATF4 pathway branch.</p>
<p>Expression of Xbp1mRNA or even Xbp1 protein using a general antibody is not sufficient to show Xbp1 activity, since this is controlled by Ire1-mediated splicing to produce the active Xbp1s isoform. We were able to purify enough E11.5 and E12.5 germ cells to carry out biochemical assays and show that mouse female germ cells have substantial levels of Xbp1s activity at both times, higher than in somatic cells. The high expression of many known Xbp1 targets also documents the high activity of this pathway (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I,I’</xref>). Early germ cells also express genes suggesting that they are expanding membranes via lipid biosynthesis and secretory pathway activity. Consistent with active adaptive-UPR rejuvenation of their proteomes we documented substantial levels of active proteolysis in early germ cells at both E11.5 and E12.5</p>
<p>The observations reported here suggest that Golgi- and endosome-associated degradation (EGAD)— an emerging proteostatic mechanism plays a previously unappreciated role. EGAD complements the well-established ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway by facilitating the clearance of misfolded proteins via Golgi-endosome trafficking and proteolysis, rather than removal from the ER and degradation in the proteosome as in ERAD. We observed substantial amounts of ERAD based on the expression of Xbp1 and its many targets, and its documented activity and its endpoint 20S proteosome activity. It is hard to quantitatively compare the amount of EGAD activity, but the prominent role Golgi throughout the stages of mouse oogenesis and its location at the core of the Balbiani body suggests that EGAD either fulfills a unique role in oocyte production. or else is uniquely capable of operating at the highest level of proteostatic activity demanded by the much greater challenge of germline rejuvenation compared to any other tissue without generating damaging and self-limiting side effects.</p>
<p>Rejuvenation genes were also highly expressed later in meiosis during zygotene and pachytene, in diplotene when mitochondria/ER contact is extremely high (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>), as well as in primordial follicles (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I,I’</xref> &quot;Dc&quot;). The early appearance of Visham and its association with Golgi and ER-related processe that are central to adaptive-UPR, suggests that in animals, rejuvenation begins earlier in the germ cell cycle than it does in single celled eukaryotes. Animal germ cells return to a pleuripotent state prior to undergoing cyst formation. Both these events precede meiosis and represent an addition to the rejuvenation process (Spradling, 2024). Our findings of early rejuvenation align with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Palozzi et al. (2022)</xref>, who showed that mitochondrial rejuvenation during oogenesis uses a special germline mitophagy and begins at the onset of meiosis. In yeast, mouse and C. elegans oocytes, damaged materials are destroyed by lysosome-like degradation in mature oocytes and at meiosis II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bohnert and Kenyon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Zaffagnini et al. 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Xiao and Unal, 2025</xref>). Thus, animal oocytes may engage in rejuvenation activities from before meiosis begins until it is completed.</p>

<title>Dazl regulates cyst formation, fusome polarization, and oocyte specification</title>
<p>Female gamete development in many organism is extensively controlled at the post-trancriptional level by RNA binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Mercer et al 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Conti and Kunitomi, 2024</xref>). In vertebrates, the RNA-binding protein Dazl is widely conserved and controls multiple aspects of early germ cell development by regulating a large number of target transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Zagore et al. 2018</xref>). In mice, Dazl modulates the ongoing reprogramming of new arrived gonadal PGCs to pleuripotency beginning at E11.5 when it turns on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gill et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Nicholls et al. 2019</xref>). Normally, Dazl continues to function at later stages of oocyte development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Conti and Kunitomi, 2024</xref>), but Dazl mutants fail to enter or progress in meiosis. In zebrafish, Dazl is required to establish germline stem cells and to properly form cysts via incomplete cytokinesis leading to their degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bertho et al. 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Our studies defined a series of important new functions for Dazl during cyst formation. We confirmed that pluripotency reactivation is slowed in Dazl mutants since DNA demethylation was delayed, and pluripotency genes failed to start downregulating at E12.5. Dazl mutant homozygotes failed to normally regulate UPR genes, leaving their mRNA levels elevated. This likely resulted from a failure to downregulate their Xbp1 activator, since both Xbp1 activity and 20S proteosome activity was also elevated in Dazl-/-germ cells. This overactivation of the UPR pathway appeared to cause Golgi fragmentation and These effects resembled the general slowing of normal developmental progression, as with pleuripotency downregulation. We also observed abnormal cyst formation with some small and defective ring canals as i zebrafish Dazl mutants, but cysts remained intact and continued to develop. This allowed us to document that Dazl is needed for cysts and for the fusome to become polarized. In Dazl mutants, cysts did not undergo rosette formation or concentrate Visham or Pard3 in cells with multiple ring canals. Oocytes apparently could not be specified and did not form. These results show that Dazl acts as a major regulator that is essential for the most important aspects of cyst formation and oocyte production.</p>

<title>Single germ cell lineage labeling</title>
<p>The protocol used for single germ cell lineage labeling was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lei and Spradling, 2016</xref>). Briefly, to obtain fetuses for lineage marking, adult female R26R-EYFP mice were mated with male CAG-cre/ERT2 mice. Tamoxifen was dissolved in corn oil (Sigma) and a single dose was injected intraperitoneally at 0.2 mg per 40 g body weight into pregnant female R26R-EYFP mice at E10.5. Fetal gonads/Pups were dissected as needed in between E11.5-E18.5/P0. To analyze the lineage-labeled germ cells, fixed and frozen whole gonads were subjected to whole mount staining for chicken-GFP, the number of lineage-labeled germ cells of each ovary was determined by examining optically sectioned Z-stack images generated by confocal imaging of the entire ovary.</p>

Each wash cycle lasted for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Next, gonads were Incubated with primary antibodies mixed with Blocking solution (PBST<sub>2</sub>+ 10 % Normal donkey serum) overnight at room temperature. Following day, gonads were incubated with fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibodies (Donkey Anti-Rabbit/mouse/rat Alexa-fluor 488/568/647, Invitrogen) overnight at room temperature. Next day, gonads were washed with PBST and stained with DAPI (Sigma) to visualize nuclei. Gonads were mounted on slides with a mounting medium (Vector Labs) and analyzed using confocal microscopy (STELLARIS 8 DIVE Multiphoton Microscope, Leica).

<title>3D reconstruction</title>
<p>Three-dimensional model images and movies were generated by Imaris software (Bitplane).For z-stack images, different visualization options in the Surpass mode of Imaris helped to gain visualization control of the objects. To perform surface rendering and volume quantification using Imaris software, we imported your 3D image dataset for EMA/WGA staining. We started with a “Volume” rendering for channels corresponding to EMA/WGA staining and then we adjusted the contrast, brightness and transparency in the “Display Adjustment” window. Next, we used the Surfaces module to create surface renderings by selecting the appropriate fluorescence channel, applied manual thresholding and adjusted smoothing parameters to define the structure accurately. Once the surface is rende, we navigated to the statistics tab to access volume measurements. Further visualization of the results was performed in 3D or orthogonal views to confirm accuracy, and adjusted rendering properties such as color or transparency as needed. To create spots for easy counting of labelled cells, we used the &quot;Spots&quot; icon-option in the &quot;Creation&quot; menu and started the spot creation wizard. We set the approximate spot size as per the requirement. Next, we selected the &quot;Manual Creation&quot; option to place spots individually. Each click placed a single spot at the corresponding position.</p>

Inhibitor stock solutions were prepared in DMSO and diluted at desi concentration in culture media (Ciliobrevin D from Millipore, 25 μM for 6 hours). Control medium containing the vehicle DMSO was prepared simultaneously. Fetal ovaries were dissected from E11.5 embryos under a stereomicroscope in sterile PBS, we have kept the surrounding mesonephric tissue intact and attached to the gonad to ensure proper development. We have also collected corresponding fetus tail of each fetal gonad to perform genetic sex determination. We have placed membrane inserts into a 24-well plate and added ∼500 µL of culture medium (with or without inhibitors) to the lower chamber and ensu no contact between medium and the insert surface. Next, we gently placed isolated ovaries onto the membrane surface using sterile forceps. The plate is then incubated in a CO incubator at 37°C for ∼6 hours. After the designated culture period, confirmed ovaries (post genetic-sex analysis), were carefully removed from the membrane inserts and washed three times with basal media to remove any residual inhibitors. Next, we collected ovaries and fixed in 4% PFA for downstream immunolocalization studies. To inhibit the microtubule growth using cold treatment, we transfer dissected gonad to a chilled culture medium, maintained at 0-4°C. The tissue is fully immersed in the pre-cooled medium and incubated on ice for ∼60 minutes. This low-temperature exposure destabilizes microtubules by disrupting tubulin dynamics, effectively depolymerizing existing microtubules and inhibiting further polymerization.

<title>Quantification of germ cell numbers</title>
<p>PFA fixed ovaries were subjected to whole mount immunostaining as described previously. Z-stack images for whole ovaries were analyzed using FIJI. Germ cell numbers are quantified in each ovary by manually counting EMA/DDX4 stained germ cells in multiple 0.45 μm optical sections from different ovaries using FIJI.</p>

<sec id="s9c2">
<title>3D volume Quantification</title>
<p>Whole mount immunostaining was performed and the z-stack images were converted to 3D image to analyze using Imaris as described previosuly. After using the Surfaces module to create surface rendering and applying manual thresholding and smoothing to define the structure accurately, we navigated to the statistics tab to access volume measurements. Further visualization of the results was performed in 3D or orthogonal views to confirm accuracy, and adjusted rendering properties such as color or transparency as needed. On an average the average values from three measurements performed were conside and plotted as graph using Graphpad prism.</p>

<title>Area of staining quantified using FIJI</title>
<p>Images were analyzed using FIJI to calculate area of staining by selecting region of interest and using measure command from Analyze tab. The results were plotted as number of pixels to depict the area corresponding to stained regions.</p>

<p>This manuscript provides evidence that mouse germline cysts develop an asymmetric Golgi, ER, and microtubule-associated structure, referred to as Visham, which in many ways resembles the fusome of Drosophila germline cysts. This is an <bold>important</bold> study that provides new evidence that fusome-like structures exist in germ cell cysts across species. While most of the data are <bold>solid</bold>, several instances remain in which conclusions regarding the dynamics and function of Visham should be restated, or additional experimental evidence should be provided to more fully support the authors' interpretations.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors attempt to study how oocyte incomplete cytokinesis occurs in the mouse ovary.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The finding that UPR components are highly expressed during zygotene is an interesting result that has broad implications for how germ cells navigate meiosis. The findings that proteasome activity increases in germ cells compared to somatic cells suggest that the germline might have a quantitatively different response for protein clearance.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The microscopy images look saturated, for example, Figure 1a, b, etc? Is this a normal way to present fluorescent microscopy?</p>
<p>(2) The authors should ensure that all claims regarding enrichment/lower vs lower values have indicated statistical tests.</p>
<p>(a) In Figure 2f, the authors should indicate which comparison is made for this test. Is it comparing 2 vs 6 cyst numbers?</p>
<p>(b) Figures 4d and 4e do not have a statistical test indicated.</p>
<p>(3) Because the system is developmentally dynamic, the major conclusions of the work are somewhat unclear. Could the authors be more explicit about these and enumerate them more clearly in the abstract?</p>
<p>(4) The references for specific prior literature are mostly missing (lines 184-195, for example).</p>
<p>(5) The authors should define all acronyms when they are first used in the text (UPR, EGAD, etc).</p>
<p>(6) The jumping between topics (EMA, into microtubule fragmentation, polarization proteins, UPR/ERAD/EGAD, GCNA, ER, balbiani body, etc) makes the narrative of the paper very difficult to follow.</p>
<p>(7) The heading title &quot;Visham participates in organelle rejuvenation during meiosis&quot; in line 241 is speculative and/or not supported. Drawing upon the extensive, highly rigorous Drosophila literature, it is safe to extrapolate, but the claim about regeneration is not adequately supported.</p>

<p>This study identifies Visham, an asymmetric structure in developing mouse cysts resembling the Drosophila fusome, an organelle crucial for oocyte determination. Using immunofluorescence, electron microscopy, 3D reconstruction, and lineage labeling, the authors show that primordial germ cells (PGCs) and cysts, but not somatic cells, contain an EMA-rich, branching structure that they named Visham, which remains unbranched in male cysts. Visham accumulates in regions enriched in intercellular bridges, forming clusters reminiscent of fusome &quot;rosettes.&quot; It is enriched in Golgi and endosomal vesicles and partially overlaps with the ER. During cell division, Visham localizes near centrosomes in interphase and early metaphase, disperses during metaphase, and reassembles at spindle poles during telophase before becoming asymmetric. Microtubule depolymerization disrupts its formation.</p>
<p>Cyst fragmentation is shown to be non-random, correlating with microtubule gaps. The authors propose that 8-cell (or larger) cysts fragment into 6-cell and 2-cell cysts. Analysis of Pard3 (the mouse ortholog of Par3/Baz) reveals its colocalization with Visham during cyst asymmetry, suggesting that mammalian oocyte polarization depends on a conserved system involving Par genes, cyst formation, and a fusome-like structure.</p>
<p>Transcriptomic profiling identifies genes linked to pluripotency and the unfolded protein response (UPR) during cyst formation and meiosis, supported by protein-level reporters monitoring Xbp1 splicing and 20S proteasome activity. Visham persists in meiotic germ cells at stage E17.5 and is later transferred to the oocyte at E18.5 along with mitochondria and Golgi vesicles, implicating it in organelle rejuvenation. In Dazl mutants, cysts form, but Visham dynamics, polarity, rejuvenation, and oocyte production are disrupted, highlighting its potential role in germ cell development.</p>
<p>Overall, this is an interesting and comprehensive study of a conserved structure in the germline cells of both invertebrate and vertebrate species. Investigating these early stages of germ cell development in mice is particularly challenging. Although primarily descriptive, the study represents a remarkable technical achievement. The images are generally convincing, with only a few exceptions.</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>(1) Some titles contain strong terms that do not fully match the conclusions of the corresponding sections.</p>
<p>(1a) Article title &quot;Mouse germline cysts contain a fusome-like structure that mediates oocyte development&quot;:</p>
<p>The term &quot;mediates&quot; could be misleading, as the functional data on Visham (based on comparing its absence to wild-type) actually reflects either a microtubule defect or a Dazl mutant context. There is no specific loss-of-function of visham only.</p>
<p>(1b) Result title, &quot;Visham overlaps centrosomes and moves on microtubules&quot;:</p>

<p>(1c) Result title, &quot;Visham associates with Golgi genes involved in UPR beginning at the onset of cyst formation&quot;:</p>

<p>This manuscript provides evidence that mice have a fusome, a conserved structure most well studied in Drosophila that is important for oocyte specification. Overall, a myriad of evidence is presented demonstrating the existence of a mouse fusome that the authors term visham. This work is important as it addresses a long-standing question in the field of whether mice have fusomes and sheds light on how oocytes are specified in mammals. Concerns that need to be addressed revolve around several conclusions that are overstated or unclear and are listed below.</p>
<p>(1) Line 86 - the heading for this section is &quot;PGCs contain a Golgi-rich structure known as the EMA granule&quot; but there is nothing in this section that shows it is Golgi-rich. It does show that the structure is asymmetric and has branches.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the constructive and thoughtful evaluation of our work. We appreciate the recognition of the novelty and potential implications of our findings regarding UPR activation and proteasome activity in germ cells.</p>
<p>(1) The microscopy images look saturated, for example, Figure 1a, b, etc. Is this a normal way to present fluorescent microscopy?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The apparent saturation was not present in the original images, but likely arose from image compression during PDF generation. While the EMA granule was still apparent, in the revised submission, we will provide high-resolution TIFF files to ensure accurate representation of fluorescence intensity and will carefully optimize image display settings to avoid any saturation artifacts.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors should ensure that all claims regarding enrichment/lower vs. lower values have indicated statistical tests.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully agree. In the revised version, we will correct any quantitative comparisons where statistical tests were not already indicated, with a clear statement of the statistical tests used, including p-values in figure legends and text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(a) In Figure 2f, the authors should indicate which comparison is made for this test. Is it comparing 2 vs. 6 cyst numbers?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge that the description was not sufficiently detailed. Indeed, the test was not between 2 vs 6 cyst numbers, but between all possible ways 8-cell cysts or the larger cysts studied could fragment randomly into two pieces, and produce by chance 6-cell cysts in 13 of 15 observed examples. We will expand the legend and main text to clarify that a binomial test was used to determine that the proportion of cysts producing 6-cell fragments differed very significantly from chance.</p>
<p>Revised text:</p>
<p>“A binomial test was used to assess whether the observed frequency of 6-cell cyst products differed from random cyst breakage. Production of 6-cell cysts was strongly preferred (13/15 cysts; ****p &lt; 0.0001).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(b) Figures 4d and 4e do not have a statistical test indicated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will include the specific statistical test used and report the corresponding p-values directly in the figure legends.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Because the system is developmentally dynamic, the major conclusions of the work are somewhat unclear. Could the authors be more explicit about these and enumerate them more clearly in the abstract?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will revise the abstract to better clarify the findings of this study. We will also replace the term Visham with mouse fusome to reflect its functional and structural analogy to the Drosophila and Xenopus fusomes, making the narrative more coherent and conclusive.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The references for specific prior literature are mostly missing (lines 184-195, for example).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this observation of a problem that occurred inadvertently when shortening an earlier version.  We will add 3–4 relevant references to appropriately support this section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The authors should define all acronyms when they are first used in the text (UPR, EGAD, etc).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will ensure that all acronyms are spelled out at first mention (e.g., Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), Endosome and Golgi-Associated Degradation (EGAD)).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6)  The jumping between topics (EMA, into microtubule fragmentation, polarization proteins, UPR/ERAD/EGAD, GCNA, ER, balbiani body, etc) makes the narrative of the paper very difficult to follow.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are not jumping between topics, but following a narrative relevant to the central question of whether female mouse germ cells develop using a fusome.  EMA, microtubule fragmentation, polarization proteins, ER, and balbiani body are all topics with a known connection to fusomes. This is explained in the general introduction and in relevant subsections. We appreciate this feedback that further explanations of these connections would be helpful. In the revised manuscript, use of the unified term mouse fusome will also help connect the narrative across sections.  UPR/ERAD/EGAD are processes that have been studied in repair and maintenance of somatic cells and in yeast meiosis.  We show that the major regulator XbpI is found in the fusome, and that the fusome and these rejuvenation pathway genes are expressed and maintained throughout oogenesis, rather than only during limited late stages as suggested in previous literature.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) The heading title &quot;Visham participates in organelle rejuvenation during meiosis&quot; in line 241 is speculative and/or not supported. Drawing upon the extensive, highly rigorous Drosophila literature, it is safe to extrapolate, but the claim about regeneration is not adequately supported.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe this statement is accurate given the broad scope of the term &quot;participates.&quot; It is supported by localization of the UPR regulator XbpI to the fusome. XbpI is the ortholog of HacI a key gene mediating UPR-mediated rejuvenation during yeast meiosis.  We also showed that rejuvenation pathway genes are expressed throughout most of meiosis (not previously known) and expanded cytological evidence of stage-specific organelle rejuvenation later in meiosis, such as mitochondrial-ER docking, in regions enriched in fusome antigens. However, we recognize the current limitations of this evidence in the mouse, and want to appropriately convey this, without going to what we believe would be an unjustified extreme of saying there is no evidence.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comprehensive summary and for highlighting both the technical achievement and biological relevance of our study. We greatly appreciate the thoughtful suggestions that have helped us refine our presentation and terminology.</p>
<p>(1) Some titles contain strong terms that do not fully match the conclusions of the corresponding sections.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>(1a) Article title “Mouse germline cysts contain a fusome-like structure that mediates oocyte development”</p>
<p>We will change the statement to: “Mouse germline cysts contain a fusome that supports germline cyst polarity and rejuvenation.”</p>
<p>(1b) Result title “Visham overlaps centrosomes and moves on microtubules” We acknowledge that “moves” implies dynamics. We will include additional supplementary images showing small vesicular components of the mouse fusome on spindle-derived microtubule tracks.</p>
<p>(1c) Result title “Visham associates with Golgi genes involved in UPR beginning at the onset of cyst formation”</p>
<p>We will revise this title to: “The mouse fusome associates with the UPR regulatory protein Xbp1 beginning at the onset of cyst formation” to reflect the specific UPR protein that was immunolocalized.</p>
<p>(1d) Result title “Visham participates in organelle rejuvenation during meiosis”</p>
<p>We will revise this to: “The mouse fusome persists during organelle rejuvenation in meiosis.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors aim to demonstrate that Visham is a fusome-like structure. I would suggest simply referring to it as a &quot;fusome-like structure&quot; rather than introducing a new term, which may confuse readers and does not necessarily help the authors' goal of showing the conservation of this structure in Drosophila and Xenopus germ cells. Interestingly, in a preprint from the same laboratory describing a similar structure in Xenopus germ cells, the authors refer to it as a &quot;fusome-like structure (FLS)&quot; (Davidian and Spradling, BioRxiv, 2025).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comment. To maintain conceptual clarity and align with existing literature, we will refer to the structure as the mouse fusome throughout the manuscript, avoiding introduction of a new term.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>We thank the reviewer for emphasizing the importance of our study and for providing constructive feedback that will help us clarify and strengthen our conclusions.</p>
<p>(1) Line 86 - the heading for this section is &quot;PGCs contain a Golgi-rich structure known as the EMA granule&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the enrichment of Golgi within the EMA PGCs was not shown until the next section. We will revise this heading to:</p>
<p>“PGCs contain an asymmetric EMA granule.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2)  Line 105-106, how do we know if what's seen by EM corresponds to the EMA1 granule?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will clarify that this identification is based on co-localization with Golgi markers (GM130 and GS28) and response to Brefeldin A treatment, which will be included as supplementary data. These findings support that the mouse fusome is Golgi-derived and can therefore be visualized by EM. The Golgi regions in E13.5 cyst cells move close together and associate with ring canals as visualized by EM (Figure 1E), the same as the mouse fusomes identified by EMA.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Line 106-107-states &quot;Visham co-stained with the Golgi protein Gm130 and the recycling endosomal protein Rab11a1&quot;. This is not convincing as there is only one example of each image, and both appear to be distorted.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Space is at a premium in these figures, but we have no limitation on data documenting this absolutely clear co-localization. We will replace the existing images with high-resolution, non-compressed versions for the final figures to clearly illustrate the co-staining patterns for GM130 and Rab11a1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Line 132-133---while visham formation is disrupted when microtubules are disrupted, I am not convinced that visham moves on microtubules as stated in the heading of this section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will include additional supplementary data showing small mouse fusome vesicles aligned along microtubules.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Line 156 - the heading for this section states that Visham associates with polarity and microtubule genes, including pard3, but only evidence for pard3 is presented.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree and will revise the heading to: “Mouse fusome associates with the polarity protein Pard3.” We are adding data showing association of small fusome vesicles on microtubules.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6)  Lines 196-210 - it's strange to say that UPR genes depend on DAZ, as they are upregulated in the mutants. I think there are important observations here, but it's unclear what is being concluded.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>UPR genes are not upregulated in DAZ in the sense we have never documented them increasing. We show that UPR genes during this time behave like pleuripotency genes and normally decline, but in DAZ mutants their decline is slowed.  We will rephrase the paragraph to clarify that Dazl mutation partially decouples developmental processes that are normally linked, which alters UPR gene expression relative to cyst development.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Line 257-259-wave 1 and 2 follicles need to be explained in the introduction, and how these fits with the observations here clarified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Follicle waves are too small a focus of the current study to explain in the introduction, but we will request readers to refer to the cited relevant literature (Yin and Spradling, 2025) for further details.</p>
<p>We sincerely thank all reviewers for their insightful and constructive feedback. We believe that the planned revisions—particularly the refined terminology, improved image quality, clarified statistics, and restructured abstract—will substantially strengthen the manuscript and enhance clarity for readers.</p>
