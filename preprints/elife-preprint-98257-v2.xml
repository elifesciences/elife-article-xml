<title>Abstract</title><p>The Transforming Growth Factor β (TGFβ) signaling pathway is critical for survival, proliferation, and cell migration, and is tightly regulated during cardiovascular development. Smads, key effectors of TGFβ signaling, are sequestered by microtubules (MTs) and need to be released for pathway function. Independently, TGFβ signaling also stabilizes MTs. Molecular details and the <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of this cross-regulation remain unclear, understanding which is important in complex biological processes such as cardiovascular development. Here, we use <italic>rudhira/Breast Carcinoma Amplified Sequence 3 (BCAS3)</italic>, a MT-associated, endothelium-restricted and developmentally essential proto-oncogene, as a pivot to decipher cellular mechanisms in bridging TGFβ signaling and MT stability. We show that Rudhira regulates TGFβ signaling <italic>in vivo,</italic> during mouse cardiovascular development, and in endothelial cells in culture. Rudhira associates with MTs and is essential for the activation and release of Smad2/3 from MTs. Consequently, Rudhira depletion attenuates Smad2/3- dependent TGFβ signaling thereby impairing cell migration. Interestingly, Rudhira is also a transcriptional target of Smad2/3-dependent TGFβ signaling essential for TGFβ-induced MT stability. Our study identifies an immediate early physical role and a slower, transcription-dependent role for Rudhira in cytoskeleton-TGFβ signaling crosstalk. These two phases of control could facilitate temporally- and spatially restricted targeting of the cytoskeleton and/or TGFβ signaling in vascular development and disease.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="teaser"><title>Significance statement</title>
<p>The developmental TGFβ pathway is essential for cell migration, cell-cell communication, adhesion, apoptosis, and matrix remodeling. Dysregulation of TGFβ signaling leads to aberrant vascular patterning and angiogenesis during mouse embryogenesis. Pathway activation involves phosphorylation and nuclear transport of Smads. Microtubules sequester Smads in the cytoplasm, thereby inhibiting TGFβ signaling. Conversely, TGFβ signaling stabilizes microtubules. However, the molecular components involved, and biological relevance of this cross-regulation remain unclear. We show that the oncoprotein Rudhira/BCAS3 facilitates Smad-MT dissociation upon ligand-mediated TGFβ receptor activation. Interestingly, Smad-dependent TGFβ signaling activation enhances rudhira transcription, essential for microtubule stabilization during cardiovascular development. This dual regulation of TGFβ signaling and microtubule stability by Rudhira allows sustained temporal control essential for development, and its dysregulation has pathological outcomes.</p></abstract>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cytoskeletal organization and growth factor signaling are mutually dependent and coordinate multiple cellular processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. The multifunctional Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) pathway regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, survival and migration and is sensitive to cytoskeletal rearrangements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Depletion of TGFβ pathway components causes developmental abnormalities often leading to embryonic death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Ligand binding activates the TGFβ receptor, causing receptor-mediated phosphorylation, followed by nuclear translocation of Smad proteins, resulting in transcriptional regulation of target gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Smads, the effectors of the TGFβ pathway, are competitively bound by several proteins and are a hub for regulation of TGFβ signaling and its intersecting pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. MTs bind to and sequester Smad2/3 and Smad4, thereby negatively regulating TGFβ signaling, which is relieved upon TGFβ stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Conversely, TGFβ signaling stabilizes MTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] through an as yet unclear mechanism, suggestive of a feedback loop.</p>
<p>During development, TGFβ signaling is activated in endothelial cells (ECs) of the remodeling angiogenic endothelium and is critical for vascular development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. MT stability is also essential for angiogenic sprouting in ECs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. MTs can be stabilized in multiple ways within the cell, initially by RhoA-mDia actin bundling and thereafter by interaction with multi-protein complexes. Serum components, TGFβ and Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), have been shown to stabilize MTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. While LPA stabilizes MTs within 30 min post-stimulation and generically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>], the effect of TGFβ signaling takes at least 2 hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] but is more restricted to and essential for endothelial cell function <italic>in vivo</italic>. Slow and restricted induction of MT stability by TGFβ as compared to the more generic and rapid function of LPA suggests a requirement for new transcription/translation which may be developmentally important. However, the molecular mechanisms and biological relevance of cytoskeletal interactions with TGFβ signaling remain elusive. Characterization of tissue-restricted regulators of the ubiquitous MT cytoskeleton may aid in defining its specialized context-dependent functions.</p>
<p>In this study, we address the role of the MT-interacting protein Rudhira in connecting TGFβ signaling and MT stability. Rudhira associates with MTs and intermediate filaments (IFs), stabilizes MTs and promotes directional cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. <italic>Rudhira</italic> knockout in mouse causes mid-gestation lethality due to aberrant cardiovascular patterning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Transcriptome analysis showed that several processes were deregulated in the <italic>rudhira</italic> knockout, especially, a large number of TGFβ signaling pathway components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. This suggests that Rudhira may regulate TGFβ signaling for vascular development.</p>
<p>Here, we show that Rudhira-depleted cells have reduced Smad2/3 activation during mouse embryonic development, indicating that Rudhira is a positive regulator of TGFβ signaling. We demonstrate that Rudhira facilitates TGFβ-mediated release of Smad2/3 from MTs. Further, TGFβ signaling stabilizes MTs by inducing transcription, in a Rudhira-dependent manner. Thus, Rudhira bridges TGFβ signaling and MT stability, required for cardiovascular development. Ectopic and aberrant Rudhira expression is seen in several carcinomas and positively correlates with tumor metastatic potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Hence our study will aid understanding of TGFβ signaling and suggest novel ways to regulate it in development and disease.</p>

<title>Rudhira depletion attenuates Smad2/3-dependent TGFβ signaling <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p><italic>Rudhira</italic> is an essential gene, critical for mouse cardio-vascular development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Ubiquitous (<italic>rudh<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) or endothelial (<italic>rudh<sup>CKO</sup>)</italic> knockout of <italic>rudhira</italic> results in angiogenic defects and mid-gestation embryonic lethality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Transcripts of several components of the TGFβ pathway are deregulated upon Rudhira depletion and the knockout phenocopies mutants of several TGFβ pathway components, whose primary phenotype is in the cardiovascular system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Hence, we characterized the role of Rudhira in TGFβ signaling. Analysis of the molecular interaction, reaction and relation networks by KEGG pathway mapping indicated that multiple components of the TGFβ pathway were deregulated in the absence of Rudhira, affecting several processes important for cardiovascular development (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). To validate this, we used non-silencing (NS) control and rudhira knockdown (KD) saphenous vein endothelial cell lines (SVEC) as described before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig S1A, B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. To test the pathway regulation at the level of receptors, we analysed transcript and basal as well as active protein levels. While we observed some reduction in transcript levels of <italic>tgfbrI</italic> and <italic>tgfbrII</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2A</xref>), the basal and active protein levels of TGFβRI remained unchanged in KD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2B</xref>). Interestingly, a constitutively active form of TGFβRI (TGFβRIT204D), expressed under the CMV promoter, was also suppressed in Rudhira KD (overexpression achieved in NS ∼200 folds while in KD ∼80 folds) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2C</xref>). TGFBR1 protein has a short half-life, while the mRNA is relatively stable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Reduced amount of relatively stable RNA may be sufficient to produce adequate protein levels. These increased levels of active TGFβRI in KD were unable to restore Smad2 phosphorylation, unlike NS controls, which showed a clear increase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). While important to note that Rudhira or its loss may regulate <italic>tgfbr</italic> transcript levels, these results support a receptor-independent role of Rudhira in regulating TGFβ pathway.</p>

</fig>
<p>To probe further into the molecular mechanism by which Rudhira controls TGFβ signaling, we used <italic>rudhira</italic> knockout mice and the KD endothelial cell line. Upon TGFβ-stimulation ECs in culture showed reduced Smad2 activation in the KD as compared to NS control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Further, qRT-PCR analysis showed that transcript levels of Smad2/3 targets, namely <italic>mmp9</italic> and <italic>pai1</italic>, did not increase significantly in KD, whereas NS control showed &gt;2-fold increase for both (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Expectedly, partial restoration of Rudhira level in KD cells restored Smad2 activation and target gene expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C, D</xref>). The canonical TGFβ pathway also responds to BMP4 activation. However, upon stimulation with BMP4 there was no significant difference in the levels of pSmad1/5/8 between NS and KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2D</xref>). These data indicate that Rudhira is required for TGFβ-dependent Smad2 phosphorylation and pathway activation.</p>
<p>Endothelial depletion of Rudhira (<italic>rudh<sup>CKO</sup>)</italic> is sufficient to cause vascular defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>] and functional TGFβ signaling is essential for vascular development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Expectedly, <italic>rudh<sup>CKO</sup></italic> embryos showed a concomitant loss of pSmad2/3 in the embryonic endocardium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>, E’), without affecting the total Smad2/3 level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2E, E’</xref>). Thus, Rudhira regulates TGFβ signaling in a Smad2/3-dependent manner <italic>in vivo</italic>, which is essential for angiogenesis and endothelial cell migration during cardio-vascular development.</p>

<title>Rudhira is required for TGFβ mediated cell migration</title>
<p>As Rudhira is essential for cell migration, we tested the effect of altered TGFβ pathway activity in Rudhira KD endothelial cells (SVEC) in a transwell migration assay. We also validated our results in HEK293 cells as these allow a high efficiency of transfection and Rudhira overexpression, for migration assays. TGFβ addition did not enhance migration in <italic>rudhira</italic> knockdown (KD) cells as compared to controls (NS and rescued KD) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). In addition, ectopic Rudhira expression in HEK293 cells caused increase in migration rate as compared to the control, consistent with our earlier study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B,C</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>TGFβ supplementation of Rudhira overexpressing cells dramatically enhanced the rate of cell migration (∼2.6 fold), suggesting a direct correlation between Rudhira levels and pathway function (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C, D</xref>). Serum contains TGFβ in a concentration range of 10-40 ng/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>] and we used 5% FBS with or without additional TGFβ in the transwell migration assay, since purified TGFβ alone is unable to induce migration. The ratio of increase in migration rates with or without exogenous TGFβ addition was similar in both the control and Rudhira-overexpressing cells (∼1.5 fold). Interestingly, TGFβ pathway-inhibition by SB431542 (SB) restored the effect of Rudhira overexpression (enhancement in cell migration rate) to control levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">S3A</xref>) suggesting that Rudhira function is regulated by the TGFβ pathway downstream of receptor activation. In addition to the multiple molecular pathways that function in concert to control cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>], our data support a role for Rudhira in TGFβ-dependent cell migration.</p>

<title>Rudhira regulates TGFβ signaling by promoting the release of Smad2/3 from MTs</title>
<p>Since Rudhira localizes to the cytoskeletal components, namely microtubules and intermediate filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>], we hypothesized that it regulates TGFβ signaling at the cytoskeleton. However, we could not detect any interaction between Rudhira and Smad2/3 under the conditions tested (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), suggesting that the effect on the pathway may be indirect, possibly through MTs. TGFβ signaling is controlled at multiple levels, including cytoskeletal regulation at MTs, which interact with and sequester Smad2/3 thereby inhibiting the TGFβ pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. TGFβ stimulation releases Smads from MT sequestration in multiple cell types including endothelial cells, facilitating its activation and nuclear translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Expectedly, TGFβ stimulation in ECs (confirmed by increase in pSmad2 levels) reduced Smad-MT binding as seen by co-immunoprecipitation for β-Tubulin and immunoblotting for Smad2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>

<p>To assess whether Rudhira is required for TGFβ-dependent release of Smad from MTs, we tested for β-Tubulin and Smad interaction upon TGFβ stimulation in NS and KD cells by performing <italic>in situ</italic> Proximity Ligation assay (PLA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. While NS cells showed reduced Smad-MT interaction, KD cells retained Smad-MT interaction even upon TGFβ stimulation in multiple KD cell lines (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3B</xref>). Interestingly, TGFβ stimulation resulted in an increase in Rudhira-MT association in wild type cells, detected by colocalization (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>) and confirmed by PLA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). Thus TGFβ-stimulated Rudhira-MT association makes MTs unavailable for Smad binding. However, MTs are abundant and present as subsets, differing in their Tubulin isotype and isoform composition, post translational modifications (PTMs) and stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], which may also govern their interactions with other molecules. It is unlikely that Rudhira binds to all MTs present. Also, it is likely that only a subset of MTs may bind and sequester Smads.</p>

<title>TGFβ signaling stabilizes MTs in a Rudhira-dependent manner</title>
<p>Since <italic>rudhira</italic> transcription is dependent on TGFβ signaling and Rudhira is required for MT stability, we further tested whether TGFβ-induced MT stability is Rudhira-dependent. Serum starvation resulted in low detectable levels of Glu-tubulin in NS and KD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5C</xref>). Stimulation with TGFβ or serum led to increased Glu-tubulin level in NS but not in KD cells showing that TGFβ- induced MT stability is dependent on Rudhira (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5C, D</xref>). To test whether Rudhira stabilizes MTs <italic>in vivo</italic> also, we analyzed the effect of loss of Rudhira on MT stability in the developing endocardium. Interestingly, along with reduced pSmads levels observed earlier (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>, E’), we found that Glu-tubulin positive stable MTs were fewer in <italic>rudh<sup>CKO</sup></italic> embryonic endocardium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5D</xref>), supporting a role of Rudhira in regulation of TGFβ signaling and MT stability during cardiovascular development. Combined, our study suggests that Rudhira primarily affects MTs to modulate their Smad-binding property and downstream TGFβ signaling. Consequently, Smad2/3-dependent TGFβ signaling induces <italic>rudhira</italic> transcription leading to MT stabilization essential for cardiovascular remodeling during development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5E</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Growth factor signaling and cytoskeletal remodeling are mutually dependent processes that require complex context-dependent molecular crosstalk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Specifically, the developmentally essential, tissue-restricted TGFβ signaling pathway, regulates and is regulated by the MT cytoskeleton. However, the underlying molecular mechanism and <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of this cross-regulation remain elusive. In this study, we probed the role of Rudhira in the cytoskeletal control of TGFβ signaling and, in turn, its effect on MT properties. Our study identifies a dual role of Rudhira during vascular development-a n e a r l y r o l e in MT-mediated regulation of Smad2/3 and a late role as a transcriptional target of TGFβ signaling required for MT stability.</p>
<p>While several processes important for cardiovascular development were deregulated in <italic>rudhira<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos, the TGFβ pathway was primarily affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. TGFβ signaling is a complex pathway and is regulated at multiple levels by various feedback loops. One of the complicated yet delicate feedback circuits is the regulation of receptor levels and activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Rudhira depletion reduces transcript level without altering basal and active protein level of TGFBRI. This disparity in the transcript and protein level may arise from the fact that while the <italic>tgfbr</italic> transcript is very stable, the protein is quite unstable, and lower transcript levels may still be sufficient for generating adequate protein levels. Such a phenomenon is not unusual, particularly for membrane proteins, where mRNA levels may not correlate with protein levels. Rudhira, in a manner not yet understood, may also be a part of a broader feedback pathway as it further negatively regulates levels of TGFβ pathway inhibitors such as Smurfs and Smad7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], suggesting that additional regulatory mechanisms may operate.</p>
<p>TGFβ signaling and Rudhira promote cell migration in a synergistic and inter-dependent manner. Mechanistically, Rudhira promotes TGFβ-dependent release of Smads from MTs likely due to increased Rudhira-MT association. This could allow pathway activation and result in enhanced cell migration. Additional, confounding factors downstream of the autoregulatory TGFβ pathway or pathway targets, as described above, may also contribute to Rudhira dependent cell migration in response to TGFβ. Converse regulation of Rudhira-MT and Smad-MT interaction is indicative of probable competition between Smads and Rudhira for MT binding, which merits further investigation. Binding of Rudhira to MTs may also alter them in a way that makes MTs unavailable for Smad binding. Since TGFβ stimulation is known to stabilize microtubules, we hypothesize that TGFβ stimulation increases Rudhira binding to stable microtubules. While unclear molecular events involved in release of Smads from MTs, and MT stabilization by Rudhira make it difficult to assign causal roles, this study supports the hypothesis that dissociation of Smads from MTs is essential for Smad activation. In addition, though MTs are ubiquitously and abundantly present, our data suggest that only a few MTs participate in Smad sequestration. This is in concordance to our earlier study which shows that Rudhira associates preferentially with stable MTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>].</p>
<p>The TGFβ signaling pathway is autoregulatory and many of its components are also targets of the pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. The <italic>rudhira</italic> promoter harbors Smad Binding Elements (SBEs). We show that Rudhira, in addition to being a regulator of the TGFβ pathway, is also a transcriptional target. However, further analysis is required to identify the specific mechanisms by which Smad-dependent, TGFβ-induced, <italic>rudhira</italic> transcription is regulated during development. In contrast to this positive feedback, TGFβ pathway is also negatively self-regulated, allowing for return to basal state amenable for reactivation. This self-suppression could possibly involve increased turnover of receptors and Smad2/3, and increased expression of inhibitory Smads, that may recover responsiveness to TGFβ stimulation. Additionally, in the context of MT-dependent Smad2/3 inhibition, the still short turnover time of stable MTs (several minutes to hours) may also promote quick return to resting state. These interesting possibilities can now be tested.</p>
<p><italic>Rudhira</italic> expression is tightly regulated and restricted to the remodeling endothelium during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Mechanistically, Rudhira promotes MT stability for angiogenic remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Independent studies show that TGFβ signaling, and MT reorganization are essential for cardiovascular development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Deletion of <italic>smad2/3</italic> or <italic>tubulins</italic> leads to embryonic lethality with severely defective embryonic and extra-embryonic vasculature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. However, the role of MT stability for angiogenic sprouting <italic>in vivo</italic> and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Our study suggests that endothelial cytoskeleton remodeling by Rudhira and activation of TGFβ signaling during cardiovascular development are inter-dependent and cross-regulated. TGFβ signaling may lead to restricted induction of MT stability by inducing the expression of MT-stabilizing developmentally regulated proteins like Rudhira. Additional cytoskeletal components such as Vimentin that interacts with Rudhira, and is also a target of TGFβ signaling, are likely to be involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Our analysis will help gain better insight into cellular processes such as migration, which require maintenance of cytoskeletal stability and active signaling for extended periods. An added advantage will be the ability to decipher deregulated migration such as in tumor metastasis. While targeting MT-Smad interaction would allow regulation of the TGFβ pathway, the ubiquitous nature of these molecules is likely to result in widespread and possibly undesirable effects of therapeutic intervention. Rudhira expression, being more restricted, could provide a suitable target to regulate developmental and pathological TGFβ signaling.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript aimed to study the role of Rudhira (also known as Breast Carcinoma Amplified Sequence 3), an endothelium-restricted microtubules-associated protein, in regulating of TGFβ signaling. The authors demonstrate that Rudhira is a critical signaling modulator for TGFβ signaling by releasing Smad2/3 from cytoskeletal microtubules and how that Rudhira is a Smad2/3 target gene. Taken together, the authors provide a model of how Rudhira contributes to TGFβ signaling activity to stabilize the microtubules, which is essential for vascular development.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study used different methods and techniques to achieve aims and support conclusions, such as Gene Ontology analysis, functional analysis in culture, immunostaining analysis, and proximity ligation assay. This study provides unappreciated additional layer of TGFβ signaling activity regulation after ligand-receptor interaction.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) It is unclear how current findings provide a better understanding of Rudhira KO mice, which the authors published some years ago.</p>
<p>(2) Why do they use HEK cells instead of SVEC cells in Fig 2 and 4 experiments?</p>
<p>(3) A model shown in Fig 5E needs improvement to grasp their findings easily.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>The authors have adequately responded to the reviewers' concerns.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>It was first reported in 2000 that Smad2/3/4 are sequestered to microtubules in resting cells and TGF-β stimulation releases Smad2/3/4 from microtubules, allowing activation of the Smad signaling pathway. Although the finding was subsequently confirmed in a few papers, the underlying mechanism has not been explored. In the present study, the authors found that Rudhira/breast carcinoma amplified sequence 3 is involved in release Smad2/3 from microtubules in response to TGF-β stimulation. Rudhira is also induced by TGF-β and probably involved in stabilization of microtubules in the delayed phase after TGF-β stimulation. Therefore, Rudhira has two important functions downstream of TGF-β in the early as well as delayed phase.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work aimed to address an unsolved question on one of the earliest events after TGF-β stimulation. Based on loss-of-function experiments, the authors identified Rudhira, as a key player that triggers Smad2/3 release from microtubules after TGF-β stimulation. This is an important first step for understanding the initial phase of Smad signaling activation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Currently, the processes how Rudhira causes the release of Smad proteins from microtubules and how Rudhira is mobilized to microtubules in response to TGF-β remain unclear. The authors are expected to address these points experimentally in the future.</p>
<p>This reviewer is also afraid that some of the biochemical data lack appropriate controls and are not convincing enough.</p>

<p>(1) It is unclear how current findings provide a beVer understanding of Rudhira KO mice, which the authors published some years ago.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our previous study demonstrated that Rudhira KO mice have a predominantly developmental cardiovascular phenotype that phenocopies TGFβ loss of function (Shetty, Joshi et al., 2018). Additionally, we found that at the molecular level, Rudhira regulates cytoskeletal organization (Jain et al., 2012; Joshi and Inamdar, 2019). Our current study builds upon these previous findings, showing an essential role of Rudhira in maintaining TGFβ signaling and controlling the microtubule cytoskeleton during vascular development. On one hand Rudhira regulates TGFβ signaling by promoting the release of Smads from microtubules, while on the other, Rudhira is a TGFβ target essential for stabilizing microtubules. Thus, our current study provides a molecular basis for Rudhira function in cardiovascular development.</p>

<p>(2) Why do they use HEK cells instead of SVEC cells in Figure 2 and 4 experiments?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our earlier studies have characterized the role of Rudhira in detail using both loss and gain of function methods in multiple cell types (Jain et al., 2012; SheVy, Joshi et al., 2018; Joshi and Inamdar, 2019). As endothelial cells are particularly difficult to transfect, and because the function of Rudhira in promoting cell migration is conserved in HEK cells, it was practical and relevant to perform these experiments in HEK cells (Figures 2 and 4E).</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>It was first reported in 2000 that Smad2/3/4 are sequestered to microtubules in resting cells and TGF-β stimulation releases Smad2/3/4 from microtubules, allowing activation of the Smad signaling pathway. Although the finding was subsequently confirmed in a few papers, the underlying mechanism has not been explored. In the present study, the authors found that Rudhira/breast carcinoma amplified sequence 3 is involved in the release of Smad2/3 from microtubules in response to TGF-β stimulation. Rudhira is also induced by TGF-β and is probably involved in the stabilization of microtubules in the delayed phase after TGF-β stimulation. Therefore, Rudhira has two important functions downstream of TGF-β in the early as well as delayed phase.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work aimed to address an unsolved question on one of the earliest events after TGF-β stimulation. Based on loss-of-function experiments, the authors identified a novel and potentially important player, Rudhira, in the signal transmission of TGF-β.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the critical evaluation and appreciation of our findings.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors have identified a key player that triggers Smad2/3 released from microtubules after TGF-β stimulation probably via its association with microtubules. This is an important first step for understanding the regulation of Smad signaling, but underlying mechanisms as well as upstream and downstream events largely remain to be elucidated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge that the mechanisms regulating cytoskeletal control of Smad signaling are far from clear, but these are out of scope of this manuscript. This manuscript rather focuses on Rudhira/Bcas3 as a pivot to understand vascular TGFβ signaling and microtubule connections.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) The process of how Rudhira causes the release of Smad proteins from microtubules remains unclear. The statement that &quot;Rudhira-MT association is essential for the activation and release of Smad2/3 from MTs&quot; (lines 33-34) is not directly supported by experimental data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment. Although we provide evidence that the loss of Rudhira (and thereby deduced loss of Rudhira-MT association) prevents release of Smad2/3 from MTs (Fig 3C), it does not confirm the requirement of Rudhira-MT association for this. In light of this, we have modified the statement to ‘Rudhira associates with MTs and is essential for the activation and release of Smad2/3 from MTs”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The process of how Rudhira is mobilized to microtubules in response to TGF-β remains unclear.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our previous study showed that Rudhira associates with microtubules, and preferentially binds to stable microtubules (Jain et al., 2012; Joshi and Inamdar, 2019). Since TGFβ stimulation is known to stabilize microtubules, we hypothesize that TGFβ stimulation increases Rudhira binding to stable microtubules. We have mentioned this in our revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) After Rudhira releases Smad proteins from microtubules, Rudhira stabilizes microtubules. The process of how cells return to a resting state and recover their responsiveness to TGF-β remains unclear.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We show that dissociation of Smads from microtubules is an early response and stabilization of microtubules is a late TGFβ response. However, we agree that the sequence of these molecular events has not been characterized in-depth in this or any other study, making it difficult to assign causal roles (eg. whether release of Smads from MTs is a pre-requisite for MT stabilization by Rudhira) or reversibility. However, the TGFβ pathway is auto regulatory, leading to increased turnover of receptors and Smads and increased expression of inhibitory Smads, which may recover responsiveness to TGFβ. Additionally, the still short turnover time of stable microtubules (several minutes to hours) may also promote quick return to resting state. We have discussed this in our revised manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Overall: Duration of TGF-β stimulation in cell-based assays should be described in the legends for readers' convenience. Avoid simple bar graphs because sample numbers are only 3. A scaVer plot should be super-imposed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Details added, as suggested. Duration of treatment is mentioned in Materials and methods section for figures 1C-D; 2A-B; 3; 4A-C; 5A-C; S2D; S3A-C; S4C, D. Bar graphs have been replaced with a bar + scatter plot. Note that, as the Excel file for data related to fig 4A was corrupted, we repeated the experiments to generate fresh data. Hence the graph had to be replaced. However, the result holds true as before.</p>

<p>Although it would be nice to have a positive control for interaction, we do not agree that a positive control of Smad4 is essential for our conclusion from this experiment, which is that ‘we were unable to detect an interaction between Rudhira and Smad2/3’.</p>

<p>(9) Figure 4E: The figure legend does not say that cells were TGF-β-stimulated. It remains unclear if Smad2 and Smad3 are involved in Rudhira expression as phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated forms. Therefore, the authors should show a pSmad2 blot. In the absence of TGF-β stimulation, Smad2 and Smad3 are expected to be sequestrated to microtubules and therefore not phosphorylated. In the case that cells were stimulated with TGF-β, show if Rudhira is induced by TGF-β in HEK293T cells. This is not shown in this manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This experiment was not performed under regulated conditions with or without TGFβ, hence the sensitivity to TGFβ could not be assessed. Cells were not stimulated with exogenous TGFβ, but cultured in regular medium with serum, which can have up to ~40 ng/ml of TGFβ (latent and active). Additionally, owing to severe depletion of Smad2 or Smad3 by shRNAs we expect sufficient loss of phospho-Smads2/3.</p>

<p>(12) Smad4 was previously reported to be sequestered to microtubules [Ref. 7]. Does Rudhira release Smad4 also?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an interesting point which could be followed up on our future studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(13) It would be nice if the authors examined how Rudhira causes the release of Smad2/3 from microtubules. Currently, it remains unclear whether the association of Rudhira to microtubules is required for the release of Smad2/3. Does a Rudhira mutant lacking microtubule binding fail to induce the release of Smad2/3 after TGF-β stimulation? If so, do Rudhira and Smad2/3 share the same binding site on microtubules? In that case, the mechanism can be regarded as &quot;competitive&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a thoughtful experiment much beyond the scope of current manuscript. In our previous study we were able to localize the Tubulin binding sites of Rudhira primarily to its Bcas3 domain (Joshi and Inamdar, 2019), however the equivalent sites in Tubulin were not assessed. While MH2 domains of Smad2/3 bind β-tubulin, amino acids 114-243 of β-tubulin bind to Smad2/3 (Dai et al., 2007). A systematic study of these tripartite interactions including Rudhira would be an interesting follow up for our future study.</p>
