<title>Abstract</title><p>Agonists activate receptors by interacting more strongly with active versus resting conformations of their target sites. For each ligand, the strong-weak binding free energy difference sets efficacy and the weak/strong ratio sets efficiency. We performed molecular dynamics simulations to explore the conformational dynamics of a nicotinic receptor neurotransmitter binding site in the weak→strong structural transition. The alternative conformations were identified by comparing calculated and experimental binding free energies for 4 agonists. In weak→strong, the agonist rotates about its cationic center (a ‘flip’), loop C moves in (a ‘flop’) to reposition αY190 to form a water-mediated cross-subunit hydrogen bond with the ligand. The flop restructures the aromatic core, and the flip increases van der Waals interactions to generate a more compact, hydrophobic and stable pocket. The simulations reveal a transient intermediate state as well as changes in a salt bridge that may distinguish agonists.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Skeletal muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) mediate synaptic transmission between motor neurons and muscle fibers. These pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) are composed of four different subunits (2 α1, β1, δ, and ε) arranged symmetrically around a central ion-conducting pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Rahman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Unwin, 1993</xref>). Binding of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) or other agonists to two target sites in the extracellular domain (ECD) increases the probability of a global conformational change that opens a distant (∼60Å) channel ‘gate’ in the transmembrane domain (TMD), to allow water and cations to cross the membrane.</p>
<p>At the start of the channel-opening isomerization the agonist binding sites switch from low to high affinity (LA→HA), and at the end of the isomerization the gate switches from closed to open (C<sub>LA</sub>→O<sub>HA</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Purohit et al., 2013</xref>). Without a bound agonist, the probability of the O shape (P<sub>O</sub>) is small and baseline activity is negligible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jackson, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Nayak et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Purohit &amp; Auerbach, 2009</xref>). Agonists (A) increase P<sub>O</sub> because they provide more favorable binding energy to the target in its active vs resting conformation, making O<sub>HA</sub> more stable than C<sub>LA</sub>. Agonists also bind strongly to the transition state that separates O from C and so also increase the channel-opening rate constant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Grosman et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The binding free energy difference between high and low affinity (ΔG<sub>HA</sub>-ΔG<sub>LA</sub>) drives receptor activation and determines agonist efficacy, the high-concentration limit of the dose-response curve. In contrast, the binding free energy ratio (ΔG<sub>LA</sub>/ΔG<sub>LA</sub>) generates a correlation between the curve’s maximum and midpoint and determine agonist efficiency, the fraction binding energy converted into movements that trigger receptor conformational change.</p>
<p>Adult-type muscle AChRs have an unfavorable unliganded isomerization free energy (+8.3 kcal/mol at −100 mV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Nayak et al., 2012</xref>) and 2 approximately equal and independent binding sites a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Nayak &amp; Auerbach, 2017</xref>). For ACh, ΔG<sub>HA</sub>=-10.2 kcal/mol and ΔG<sub>HA</sub> =-5.1 kcal/mol per site, so adding their differences at 2 sites to that of the intrinsic isomerization, gives −1.9 kcal/mol. A free energy difference is proportional to the logarithm of an equilibrium constant. Hence, after binding 2 neurotransmitters the AChR gating equilibrium constant increases from 7.4×10<sup>−7</sup> to 25, and P<sub>O</sub> increases from ∼10<sup>−6</sup> to 0.96 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Binding energy from 2 neurotransmitters turns the receptor approximately from off to on.</p>

<p>Our goal is to associate ΔG<sub>LA</sub>→ΔG<sub>HA</sub> changes with underlying structural rearrangements at the binding site. Here, we use MD simulations to explore the conformational dynamics of the LA→HA transition at the α-δ neurotransmitter binding site of the <italic>Torpedo</italic> AChR (6UVW; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Rahman et al., 2020</xref>)). Binding free energies calculated <italic>in silico</italic> aligned with those estimated experimentally by using electrophysiology, so it was possible to interpret the agonist energy changes with restructuring of the binding pocket. It is difficult to draw sweeping conclusions because we examined only 4 agonists and only one wild-type site. However, in the LA→HA transition for all constructs the agonist somersaults, loop C droops to reposition αY190 and rearrange an aromatic pocket that contracts and becomes more hydrophobic. Also, in all systems the initial LA and final HA conformations of the binding site were connected by a brief intermediate state. For some but not all agonists, loop F moves in and a conserved salt bridge shortens. The results suggest that that agonist mobility is important determinant of the increase in binding free energy, and that rather than acting as a lid that closes, loop C is a positioning device that inserts an affinity-increasing side chain into the pocket core.</p>

<title>Hold</title>
<p>Traditionally, receptor activation is divided into binding (formation of a ligand-protein complex) and gating (receptor isomerization). Here, we are concerned only with movements at binding sites that connect these two steps. In binding, the agonist (A) diffuses to interact with the target (A+C=<sup>A</sup>C), after which a local rearrangement establishes the LA complex (<sup>A</sup>C=AC<sub>LA</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jadey &amp; Auerbach, 2012</xref>). In gating, the site again rearranges to produce the HA complex (AC<sub>LA</sub>=AC<sub>HA</sub>), after which the rest of the protein domains (ECD, TMD and gate) restructure to establish AO<sub>HA</sub>. We call the two local rearrangements of the binding site ‘catch’ (free energy change ΔG<sub>LA</sub>) and ‘hold’ (ΔG<sub>HA</sub>-ΔG<sub>LA</sub>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). The end of binding is AC<sub>LA</sub> and the start go gating is AC<sub>HA</sub>, so hold is the local rearrangement that connects these two activation steps.</p>
<p>The free energy changes associated with the other events in binding and gating, namely diffusion to the site (the chemical potential) and restructuring of receptor domains, are the same for the agonists we have examined and so are not relevant to this study. Furthermore, energy coupling between the binding pocket and distant residues (&gt;15 Å) typically is weak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gupta et al., 2017</xref>) (Fig. S1A). Only catch and hold determine differences between agonists with regard to affinity (ΔG<sub>LA</sub>, ΔG<sub>HA</sub>), efficacy (ΔG<sub>HA</sub>-ΔG<sub>LA</sub>) and efficiency (1-ΔG<sub>LA</sub>/ΔG<sub>HA</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Nayak et al., 2019</xref>). In AChRs, ΔG<sub>LA</sub> and ΔG<sub>HA</sub> have been measured experimentally for 23 agonists and 53 binding site mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Indurthi &amp; Auerbach, 2023</xref>) (Fig. S1B). The structures generated in the MD simulations were identified as AC<sub>LA</sub> or AC<sub>HA</sub> by aligning ΔG<sub>LA</sub> and ΔG<sub>HA</sub> values calculated i<italic>n silico</italic> with those from experiments.</p>
<p>The cryo-EM structures of AChRs include apo, resting-C with a bound toxin and high-affinity desensitized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Rahman et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Rahman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zarkadas et al., 2022</xref>). Binding sites of desensitized AChRs have a similar (perhaps identical) high affinity as do O sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Auerbach, 2020</xref>). The end states of the hold rearrangement are short-lived and have not been captured as structures.</p>
<p>Because ΔG<sub>LA</sub> and ΔG<sub>HA</sub> are independent of energy changes outside the binding pocket, in the simulations we removed the TMD and studied only α-Δ subunit ECD dimers. The starting structure for the hold transition was (PDB: 6UWZ) after toxin removal that is essentially the same as the apo structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zarkadas et al., 2022</xref>)) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). The 4 agonists we examined were acetylcholine (ACh), carbamylcholine (CCh), epibatidine (Ebt) and epiboxidine (Ebx).</p>

<title>Docking</title>
<p>Binding energy changes in hold, AC<sub>LA</sub>=AC<sub>HA</sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). To understand the structural underpinnings, we began by removing α-bungarotoxin from the high-resolution (2.69 Å) structure 6UWZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Rahman et al., 2020</xref>) and docking agonists into the empty pocket at the α-δ subunit interface (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). The docking simulations had strong binding scores, ranging from −5.82 to −9.18 kcal/mol, suggesting stable interactions. However, unlike the agonist orientation apparent in cryo-EM structures of desensitized AChRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gharpure et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Noviello et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Rahman et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Walsh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zarkadas et al., 2022</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), the agonist’s tail pointed away from (<italic>cis</italic>) rather than towards (t<italic>rans</italic>) the complimentary (non-α) subunit. This was the case for the top 3 docking scores for all 4 ligands (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Because the <italic>cis</italic> orientation was not observed in any cryo-EM (HA) structure, we examined the top 200 docking scores for CCh. All poses were <italic>cis</italic>, with the tail pointing towards the α subunit. The <italic>cis</italic> orientation was also apparent in docking of agonist into a putatively LA binding site of a homology model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Tripathy et al., 2019</xref>). To start, we associated the agonist orientation in the hold end states as <italic>cis</italic> in AC<sub>LA</sub> versus <italic>trans</italic> in AC<sub>HA</sub>.</p>

<title>LA→HA transition</title>
<p>We performed 200 ns MD simulations for each of the docked complexes, in triplicate (with different seed values) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> top). The MD simulations for all three replicates demonstrated similar root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) patterns, with differences consistently below 1Å (Table S1) suggesting that the trajectories were robust and reproducible. Although there were initial deviations, all systems became stable by ∼120 ns. The root-mean-square-fluctuation (RMSF) of the C<sub>α</sub> atoms, employed to identify regions of flexibility, showed instability mainly in loops C and F around the pocket (Fig. S2). The fluctuations observed at the base of the ECD were anticipated because the TMD that offers stability here was absent.</p>
<p>In addition to the fluctuations in these loops, during the 200 ns simulations the ligand orientation changed dramatically, <italic>cis</italic>-to-<italic>trans</italic>. At the start of the simulations the agonist’s tail points towards α, and at the end it points towards δ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> bottom). This rearrangement represents a substantial rotation (a ‘flip’) about the agonist’s main cationic center (N<sup>+</sup>) that remains close to αW149 throughout the somersault. The final MD configuration (with CCh) was well-aligned with the CCh-bound cryo-EM desensitized structure (7QL6.PDB) (RMSD &lt; 0.5 Å) (Fig. S3), further demonstrating that the simulation had converged.</p>
<p>To test whether rearrangements at the binding pocket in the simulations themselves enforce the <italic>trans</italic> configuration, we removed the bound CCh from the final state MD structure and re-docked all four agonists. The preferred poses for all 4 agonists were all <italic>trans</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). In addition, binding energies from docking scores were higher for the converged MD structure compared to the initial binding site structure. As a further control we carried out MD simulations of a pentamer docked with ACh and found similar structural changes at the binding pocket compared to the dimer (Fig. S4). These results indicate that a dimer is appropriate to study local rearrangements of an AChR neurotransmitter binding site and suggest that in the MD simulations the binding site restructures from AC<sub>LA</sub> to AC<sub>HA</sub> conformation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Principal component analysis</title>
<p>To identify the most prominent conformational states of the receptor during the MD simulations, principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out based on the most significant fluctuations (principal components). Considering the first two principal components (PC-1 and PC-2) that capture the most pronounced C<sub>α</sub> displacements, the protein backbone fluctuations revealed three energy minima (m1, m2, and m3) that mainly reflect the stabilities of loops C and F (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). For all four agonists, the trajectories quickly reach m1 (≤20 ns), then transition through m2, and culminate in m3 (180-200 ns). In the simulations progress in time was sequential, m1→m2→m3.</p>

<caption><title>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</title>
<p>For each agonist, the left panel plots PC1 vs PC2, the first two principal components that capture the maximum variance in the trajectory. Colors represent free energy value in kcal/mol (upper left, bottom). For all agonists there are 3 energy minima (red), m1, m2, and m3, that correspond to different conformations of the protein-ligand complex. The right panels are ‘porcupine’ plots that indicate the direction and magnitude of changes between PC1 and PC2. In order of appearance, m1 (≤20 ns)&lt; m2&lt;m3 (≥180 ns) (see text). m1 represents AC<sub>LA</sub>, m3 represents AC<sub>HA</sub>, and m2 is an intermediate configuration (corresponding ΔGs given in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p></caption>

</table-wrap>
<p>Accordingly, we hypothesized that m1 corresponds to AC<sub>LA</sub> and m3 corresponds to AC<sub>HA</sub>. For all agonists, the m2 population has greater variance (more instability) compared to m1 and m3. This, along with its position in the sequence, suggests that m2 represents an unstable intermediate configuration within hold, between AC<sub>LA</sub> and AC<sub>HA</sub>. For all agonists and trajectories, m3 had the least variance (was most stable), again supporting convergence by 200 ns.</p>
<p>Transitions between the 3 energy minima varied with the agonist. Always, m1 was apparent first (at 5-14 ns for ACh; 15-24 ns for CCh; 21-41 ns for Ebt; 20-56 ns for Ebx), followed by m2 (20-50 ns; 50-60 ns; 60-100 ns; 100-120 ns). All systems converged to m3 (180-200 ns) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The bottom of the m1, m2 and m3 energy wells represent the most stable configurations of each population and serve as a reference point for the rest of energy well.</p>
<p>Although the bottom of the well for 3 energy minima from PCA represent the most stable overall conformation of the protein, they do not convey direct information regarding agonist stability or orientation. To incorporate this information, we performed a cluster analysis of the ligand using frames from the bottom of each PCA well as inputs. The top three clusters, each having RMSD of ≤ 1Å, shared a similar ligand orientation (Fig. S5) and were selected to compute binding free energy using MM-PBSA. The remaining frames were disregarded. The fraction of frames accepted for free energy calculations ranged from a minimum of 20% (ACh, m1) to a maximum of 71% (Ebt, m3). On average, the fraction of frames selected from each energy minimum was ∼50%, showing the dynamic nature of the ligand in the pocket (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Computed vs experimental binding energies</title>
<p>The above procedure defined populations of structures that we hypothesize represent the end states of hold, AC<sub>LA</sub> (m1) and AC<sub>HA</sub> (m3), plus an intermediate (m2). We used MM-PBSA (Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area) computations of the selected structures to estimate binding energy of each agonist to each population. MM-PBSA is particularly useful to compare binding affinities between different states and among agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kollman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Rastelli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Sun et al., 2014</xref>). In our use, MM-PBSA computations included both enthalpic (ΔH) contributions from molecular interactions (van der Waals, electrostatics, solvation) and entropic (TΔS) contributions calculated using normal mode analysis. By capturing the dynamic interplay between the ligand and receptor as well as the influence of the surrounding solvent environment this approach enables computation of a Gibbs free energy (ΔG). However, there are limitations with regard to MM-PBSA accurately predicting absolute binding free energies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Genheden &amp; Ryde, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hou et al., 2011</xref>) that depends on parameterization of the ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Oostenbrink et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The calculated and experimental ΔG values are shown in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. For ACh and CCh, there is good agreement between ΔG<sub>m1</sub> and ΔG<sub>LA</sub> and between ΔG<sub>m3</sub> and ΔG<sub>HA</sub>. For these agonists, <italic>in silico</italic> values overestimated experimental ones only by ∼8% and ∼25%. The agreement was not as good for the other 2 agonists, as calculated values overestimated experimental ones by ∼45% (Ebt) and ∼130% (Ebt). However, the fractional overestimation was approximately the same for ΔG<sub>LA</sub> and ΔG<sub>HA</sub>.</p>
<p>Despite these discrepancies in absolute values, the trend of an increase in binding free energy, m1 versus m3, is consistent with the assignment, AC<sub>LA</sub> versus AC<sub>HA</sub>. For all agonists, the stability of the ligand-receptor complex increases significantly in the m1→m3 transition (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Further support for the assignment is from comparing calculated vs experimental efficiencies (η) that depend on ΔG<sub>LA</sub>/ΔG<sub>HA</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Nayak et al., 2019</xref>). Table 2 shows that η values calculated <italic>in silico</italic> agree closely (≤5%) with those measured experimentally, for all agonists. Apparently, MD simulations of a single pdb file successfully model the hold transition. The match between calculated and experimental efficiencies is evidence that that m1 represents low-affinity AC<sub>LA</sub> and m3 represents high-affinity AC<sub>HA</sub>.</p>

<title>Flip-Flop</title>
<p>The ligand somersault (flip) was prominent in all simulations of hold. All agonists undergo a large rotation about the N<sup>+</sup>-αW149 fulcrum (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>; Video 1). The extent of rotation was 131° for CCh, 156° for ACh, 148° for Ebt and 176° for Ebx. Another consistent and prominent restructuring event in AC<sub>LA</sub>→AC<sub>HA</sub> was the downward displacement (flop) of loop C toward the core of the pocket. This movement is conserved in related receptors and thought to play a role in receptor activation by agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Basak et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hansen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hibbs et al., 2009</xref>) (see below). In the simulations, we quantified loop C flop by measuring the displacement of its tip (C<sub>α</sub> of αC192) relative to its starting position (at 0 ns). The distance traveled at 200 ns varied with the agonist and was 9.2 Å for CCh, 5.5 Å for Ebt, 5.2 Å for ACh and 3.3 Å for Ebx (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).

<p>In hold, residues that form the pocket cavity move, apparently to accommodate the re-orientation of the ligand. In AC<sub>LA</sub> αY190, αY93, and δW57 are spaced apart, providing an open slot that accommodates the agonist’s tail in the <italic>cis</italic> orientation. However, in AC<sub>HA</sub> αY190 is positioned closer to αY93, effectively creating a unified surface that disallows the <italic>cis</italic> position of the tail (Fig. S6). However, in the simulations the event sequence is not clear so perhaps flip precedes flop, and agonist re-orientation first creates the space for αY190 to occupy.</p>
<p>αW149 (in loop B) makes a cation-π bond with N<sup>+</sup> that is important for ligand stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Xiu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Zhong et al., 1998</xref>).

<p>Loop C flop results in re-positioning of αY190 into the aromatic pocket. αY190 is the main ligand binding energy source, nearly twice as strong as αW149 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Purohit et al., 2014</xref>), perhaps because deprotonation of its hydroxyl group generates a cation-anion bond with N<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bruhova &amp; Auerbach, 2017</xref>). An interaction between αY190 and the αK145-αD200 salt bridge, suggested to be the trigger for the gating isomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bruhova &amp; Auerbach, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mukhtasimova et al., 2005</xref>).

<title>Other hold rearrangements</title>
<p>In AC<sub>LA</sub> (m1), the <italic>cis</italic> orientation is stabilized by the hydroxyl of αY93 that is proximal to a functional group on the agonist tail. Also, the tail nitrogen in CCh, Ebt, and Ebx (amide or amine) forms a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of αY198, but only in the intermediate m2 state. This interaction appears to guide the flip and provide transient stability to the intermediate state. The absence of a secondary nitrogen in ACh possibly explains its alternate re-orientation route, as only this ligand was observed to flip counterclockwise (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). It may also explain why the m2 basin in the PCA plots for ACh is especially broad and shallow (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>
<p>In AC<sub>HA</sub> (m3), the αY190/αY198/δW57 rings and the αW149 indole interact with N<sup>+</sup>, and the hydroxyl group of αY93 forms a hydrogen bond with the ligand head group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Celie et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hansen et al., 2005</xref>). However, Ala substitutions of these 5 aromatic residues have quite different consequences and result ACh binding free energy losses of +4.4, +1.9, +0.1, +2.3 and +0.9 kcal/mol, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Purohit et al., 2014</xref>). In AC<sub>HA</sub>, the tail functional moiety (carbonyl or secondary ring amine) in the <italic>trans</italic> orientation is sandwiched between αC192, αC193 and αY198 (loop C), αT150 (loop B) and δC108, δN109, δL111, and δL121 (loop E) (Fig. S7).</p>
<p>αK145 is complex and undergoes agonist-dependent hold rearrangements. In AC<sub>HA</sub> this residue i) makes a salt bridge with αD200, ii) has a cation-π interaction with αY93, iii) contacts αY190 (possibly through the hydroxyl group) and iv) approaches loop F of the complementary subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zarkadas et al., 2022</xref>). Further, the mutation αK145A lowers the efficiencies of ACh and CCh (from 0.51 to 0.41) but has no effect on those of Ebt and Ebx (0.41) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Indurthi &amp; Auerbach, 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>This agonist dependence with regard to function has a parallel in structure. In the hold simulations, the αK145-αD200 distance (Å) increases from 4.4 in apo to 6.1 or 5.1 in AC<sub>LA</sub> (CCh or ACh). The spread may relate to the agonist tail being inserted into the αY93 slot in the <italic>cis</italic> orientation. In AC<sub>LA</sub> →AC<sub>HA</sub>, for some agonist the αK145-αD200 distance (Å) shortens substantially to 2.6 or 2.8, making the bridge more rigid (ACh or CCh). However, with Ebt and Ebx the αK145-αD200 distance remains unstable, fluctuating between 3-6 Å throughout the course of the simulation. Likewise, αK145-αY190 distance stabilizes at 5.3 Å or 6.1 Å in AC<sub>HA</sub> with ACh and CCh but continues to fluctuate with Ebt and Ebx. In contrast, the αY190-αD200 distance remains stable in AC<sub>HA</sub> for all ligands. This suggests that the instability in the salt αK145-αD200 and αK145-αY190 distances can primarily be attributed to αK145 (Fig. S8).</p>
<p>In AC<sub>HA</sub>, the functional group found in the tail of each agonist -- the carbonyl group in CCh and ACh and the secondary ring amine in Ebt and Ebx - forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl of δN109 and the amine of δL121 in the complementary δ subunit <italic>via</italic> a structural water (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), as reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Blum et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gharpure et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zarkadas et al., 2022</xref>). This water-mediated bonding appears to be crucial for stabilizing the agonist in the <italic>trans</italic> orientation. The start of the agonist’s flip, m1→m2, begins the establishment of this water-mediated bond that is completed in m2→m3, with all 4 agonists (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>

<p>In diffusion-catch-hold activation of AChRs (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="558050v1_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), the binding free energy increase in the last step generates the force that initiates the receptor isomerization. We identified in MD simulations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) the hold end states, AC<sub>LA</sub> (m1) and AC<sub>HA</sub>, (m3), as well as an intermediate configuration (m2). Our approach to understanding the conformational dynamics of hold is to compare calculated with experimental binding free energies, ΔG<sub>LA</sub> and ΔG<sub>HA</sub>. There are many experimental measurements for many different AChR agonists and several binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Indurthi &amp; Auerbach, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jadey &amp; Auerbach, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Purohit et al., 2014</xref>), but here we describe the comparison for only 4 agonists and only the wt α-δ site.</p>
<p>The alignment between experimental and calculated free energies was closer for ACh and CCh than for Ebt and Ebx (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The match improved when free energy ratios rather than absolute values were compared. Individual <italic>in silico</italic> values overestimated experimental ones by approximately the same factor (different for each ligand) that, however, cancelled in the ratio. We do not know the origin of this factor but speculate that it could be caused by errors in ligand parameterization. Regardless, the results show that agonist efficiency (η) can be estimated from only agonist and receptor structure (one PDB file), and that η is a useful metric for associating structure with function.</p>
<p>In the AC<sub>LA</sub>→AC<sub>HA</sub> simulations, two conspicuous binding site rearrangements were a <italic>cis</italic>→<italic>trans</italic> somersault of the agonist (a flip) and an up→down droop of loop C (a flop). The loop C movement is well known, but its functional role has been puzzling. The extent of the flop is correlated with agonist potency in ACh binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Basak et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Du et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Polovinkin et al., 2018</xref>), but voltage-clamp fluorometry of other receptors shows it to be similar with agonists and antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chang &amp; Weiss, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Munro et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pless &amp; Lynch, 2009</xref>). In AChRs, truncation of loop C prevents activation by agonists but has no effect on unliganded activation, but agonist sensitivity is maintained if αY190 and αY198 are intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Purohit &amp; Auerbach, 2013</xref>). These results suggest that the downward displacement of loop C in AChRs is mainly associated with the generation of strong binding energy.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most puzzling result regarding loop C is that the agonist association rate constant k<sub>on</sub> is slower to AC<sub>LA</sub> (up position) than to AC<sub>HA</sub> (down position) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Grosman &amp; Auerbach, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Nayak &amp; Auerbach, 2017</xref>). Moreover, whereas k<sub>on</sub> to AC<sub>LA</sub> is correlated with agonist potency (the dissociation rate constant k<sub>off</sub> is approximately the same for all agonists), k<sub>on</sub> and k<sub>off</sub> to AC<sub>HA</sub> both are agonist dependent. The flop of loop C in hold removes a barrier to make k<sub>on</sub> approximately diffusion-limited, and also reduces discrimination between ligands (molecular recognition.</p>
<p>Loop C droop resembles the ‘clamshell closure’ apparent at other receptors binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hansen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hibbs &amp; Gouaux, 2011</xref>). However, in the light of the above experimental results, this label is misleading because ‘closing’ (or ‘capping’) a binding pocket is expected to slow rather than speed k<sub>on</sub>. For this reason, we use less functionally loaded words to describe the downward displacement of loop C, namely a ‘flop’ or ‘droop’. In AC<sub>LA</sub>→AC<sub>HA</sub> loop C indeed moves closer to αC of αW149, to cover the pocket and create higher affinity. However, it does not do so by imposing a steric barrier. We did not study the catch rearrangement and do not speculate about the nature of the barrier that limits the agonist association rate constant to C<sub>LA</sub> that has loop C in an up position.</p>
<p>Importantly, loop C flop repositions αY190, the main determinant of both LA and HA binding energies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bruhova &amp; Auerbach, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Purohit et al., 2014</xref>). In AC<sub>LA</sub>→AC<sub>HA</sub>, this side chain fills the slot adjacent to αY93 that otherwise allows the <italic>cis</italic> orientation in AC<sub>LA</sub> (Fig. S5). Further, flop moves αY190 closer to a salt bridge between αK145-αD200, and compacts the space between αW149 and N<sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Overall, the simulated structures suggest that loop C flop increases binding energy both by repositioning αY190 near N<sup>+</sup> and by allowing the <italic>cis-trans</italic> flip of the ligand. Rather than closing a door, the downward movement of loop C rearranges the furniture.</p>
<p>We interpret <italic>cis-trans</italic> rotation of the agonist about the N<sup>+</sup>-αW149 fulcrum (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) with caution. Although the <italic>trans</italic> orientation is apparent in desensitized AChR cryo-EM structures, the <italic>cis</italic> orientation exists only <italic>in silico</italic>. Notwithstanding this limitation, in AC<sub>LA</sub>→AC<sub>HA</sub> the agonist’s flip into the binding pocket and the repositioning αY190 by loop C flop were observed consistently in all simulations with all agonists, and rationalize the increase binding energy in the hold transition. We speculate that the agonist flip triggers the rest of the hold restructuring but cannot rule out flop promoting flip or synchronous rearrangements. We have been unable to establish clearly the flip-flop temporal sequence.</p>
<p>For the agonists we examined, the somersault positions the tail deep into the binding cavity where it interacts <italic>via</italic> a structural water with the complementary subunit. It appears that agonists rotation increases binding free energy by displacing water and increasing vdW interactions and protein stability. A hydrophobic binding pocket is associated with functional activation in other ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Furukawa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Sigel &amp; Steinmann, 2012</xref>) and is observed in many proteins including β2-adrenergic receptor, opioid receptors, and HIV-1 protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Rasmussen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Wlodawer &amp; Erickson, 1993</xref>). However, these effects on the AChR pocket cannot be the only basis for the higher affinity AC<sub>HA</sub> because several potent agonists lack a tail, for example tetramethylammonium. We hypothesize that both the reorganization of the aromatic groups in the pocket around N<sup>+</sup> and binding site compaction/de-wetting contribute to stronger binding, in proportions that remain to be determined. Regardless, the agonist’s somersault shows that mobility is one feature that distinguishes a ligand from a covalently linked side chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Indurthi &amp; Auerbach, 2023</xref>). Not only can an unconnected agonist come and go, it can also reposition itself dramatically to induce a conformational change of binding pocket to affect a change in binding energy.</p>
<p>Movements analogous to flip and flop have been identified in other proteins. Multiple ligand positions in a binding pocket have been documented in 5-HT3 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Basak et al., 2020</xref>), δ-opioid receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Shang et al., 2016</xref>), HIV-1 protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Klei et al., 2007</xref>) and transthyretin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Klabunde et al., 2000</xref>). In enzymes, substrate motion has been observed in hexokinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bennett &amp; Steitz, 1978</xref>) and alcohol dehydrogenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Plapp, 2010</xref>). Regarding flop, substrate-induced loop displacements are known to reposition residues to enhance catalysis, for example in chymotrypsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ma et al., 2005</xref>) and triosephosphate isomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brown &amp; Kollman, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Nickbarg et al., 1988</xref>). The agonist flip and loop C flop in AChRs are additional examples of ligand mobility and loop motions undergirding function.</p>
<p>The PCA plots (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) show 3 structural populations, one of which (m2) occurs in time between m1 (AC<sub>LA</sub>) and m3 (AC<sub>HA</sub>). In m2, the agonist tail interacts with αY198, possibly to guide the clockwise rotation of the ligand and reduce the probability of a return to the <italic>cis</italic> orientation. ACh was the only agonist to rotate counterclockwise, perhaps because it lacks the appropriate functional group in its tail. The MM-PBSA calculations indicate that ΔG<sub>m2</sub> (that does not have an experimental correlate) is intermediate between ΔG<sub>LA</sub> and ΔG<sub>HA</sub> for ACh and CCh, but least stable for Ebt and Ebx (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We do not have an explanation for this difference. However, we observe m1→m2, m2→m1, m2→m3 and m3→m1 transitions in the trajectories (Video 1), so the depth of the m2 energy well (relative to the barriers that separate it from m1 and m2) contributes to agonist efficacy and efficiency.</p>
<p>MD simulations did not reveal an interaction between the αK145-αD200 salt bridge distance and the degree of loop C displacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cheng et al., 2006</xref>). However, this distance discriminate between η classes by decreasing AC<sub>LA</sub>→AC<sub>HA</sub> in high (ACh and CCh) but not in low (Ebt and Ebx) η classes, consistent with experimental results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Indurthi &amp; Auerbach, 2023</xref>). All 4 agonists are high efficacy, so this result suggests that perturbation of this salt bridge is not a necessary requirement for the change from LA to HA. After loop C flop, the repositioned αY190 connects N<sup>+</sup> to the salt bridge, suggesting that this interaction (rather than bridge tightening) could help trigger the gating transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Beene et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gay &amp; Yakel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mukhtasimova et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Padgett et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Pless et al., 2011</xref>). The simulation did not reveal the conformational changes (forces) that drive the next step of the isomerization (ECD restructuring). However, the observation that for all agonists, interactions with the complementary subunit and pocket dehydration terminated (at 200 ns) the hold rearrangement lead us to speculate these may contribute.</p>
<p>Loop E (connecting β5 and β6 strands) has been implicated in ligand discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Basak et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Muroi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pless &amp; Lynch, 2009</xref>). The double mutation F106L+S108C in the β2 subunit of the α4β2 nicotinic AChR subtype significantly decreases the action of Ebt without altering that of ACh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Tarvin et al., 2017</xref>). Loop E residues are responsible for the binding energy difference of α-γ versus α-Δ interfaces because hydrogen bonds influence the position and participation of γW55 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Nayak et al., 2016</xref>), and for reducing instability of the α-Δ site consequent to loop C mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Purohit &amp; Auerbach, 2013</xref>). MD simulations with more agonists and more binding sites are needed to elucidate the role of loop E in the AC<sub>LA</sub>→AC<sub>HA</sub> transition.</p>
<p>Agonists belong to efficiency (η) classes in which ΔG<sub>LA</sub>/ΔG<sub>HA</sub> is the same for all members. So far 5 η-classes have been identified experimentally in adult-type AChRs, indicating that are 5 pairs of AC<sub>LA</sub>/AC<sub>HA</sub> structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Indurthi &amp; Auerbach, 2023</xref>). Although in the simulations loop F movements and salt bridge distances were agonist dependent, with only 4 ligands we cannot associate these rearrangements with η classes.</p>
<p>The key requirement for allostery is that ligand binding energy be weaker to the resting versus active conformation of the target. Natural selection must generate both low and high affinity binding sites, so our attention must be on restructuring in both <sup>A</sup>C=AC<sub>LA</sub> (catch) and AC<sub>LA</sub>=AC<sub>HA</sub> (hold). What prevents loop C flop in apo? What barrier(s) slows k<sub>on</sub> to apo? Where is the agonist in the encounter complex? What forces promote the <italic>cis</italic> orientation? What is the role of water in agonist orientation, both <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic>? What are the mechanisms and consequences of a wider salt bridge, apo versus AC<sub>LA</sub>? What structural classes are associated with efficiency classes? The correlation in the free energy changes in catch and hold that entangles binding with gating implies a corresponding correlation in structural change. We anticipate that additional MD simulations of catch, hold, and post-hold domain rearrangements, for more agonists and with binding site mutations, will lead to a more complete understanding of how agonists turn on the AChR.</p>

<title>Protein preparation</title>
<p>Protein preparation was conducted using the Protein Preparation Wizard (PPW) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Purushotham et al., 2022</xref>) and OPLS4 force field. Bond orders were assigned to atoms based on the CCD database, with zero bond orders given to bonded metals. Missing hydrogen atoms were inserted, and disulfide bonds were placed appropriately. During preprocessing, structural refinement was performed with Maestro’s Prime utility, optimizing and adding any missing side chains and residues. Missing residues were formulated by combining SEQRS information from the PDB files and optimized using Prime’s ePLOP module. The ionization state of all heterogeneous groups, including ligands, bound metals, and charged amino acids, were determined using the EpiK tool at a pH range of 7.0 ± 2.0. Subsequent force field minimization allowed for water sampling and basic restraint minimization, during which only hydrogen atoms could be freely reduced.</p>
<p>The hydrogen bonding (H-bond) network underwent significant modification. The terminal chi angle for Asn, Gln, and His was sampled through 180-degree flips, altering their spatial H-bonding capabilities without affecting the fit to electron density. The neutral and protonated states of His, Asp, and Glu, as well as two His tautomers, were sampled. Hydrogens on hydroxyls and thiols were also analyzed to enhance the H-bond network. Finally, the ProtAssign method was employed in two modes: a &quot;regular&quot; mode, which completed in seconds, and an &quot;exhaustive&quot; mode that considered many more states and could take minutes or hours, depending on the H-bond network complexity.</p>

<title>Ligand Preparation</title>
<p>The two-dimensional SDF structures of carbamylcholine (CCh), acetylcholine (ACh), epibatidine (Ebt) and epiboxidine (Ebx) were retrieved from the PUBCHEM database. LigPrep (LigPrep, Maestro 11.2.014, Schrödinger LLC) was utilized to construct ligands, produce stereoisomers, and generate tautomers using the OPLS46 force field. Additionally, the Epik module was employed to desalt and protonate the ligands at pH 7.0. Default values were applied to the remaining parameters, and LigPrep was also used to prepare the ligands ACh, CCh, Ebt, and Ebx, with the option &quot;retain specified chiralities&quot; engaged.</p>
<p>In terms of ligand state assessment, Epik can calculate a penalty to quantify the energy cost of forming each state in solution based on the Hammett and Taft methods. This EpiK state penalty is entirely compatible with the GlideScore used for docking, as it is computed in kcal/mol units. This compatibility facilitates the examination of how the EpiK state penalty affects the GlideScore. The DockingScore in Glide represents the total of the GlideScore and the Epik state penalty and served as the basis for final ranking and enrichment evaluation. Furthermore, Epik offers a technique for handling metal binding states, involving a change in the pH range within which the state is generated. This approach underscores the comprehensive considerations made in preparing the ligands for docking and subsequent analyses.</p>

<title>Grid Generation and Molecular Docking</title>
<p>The receptor grid complex of 6UWZ.pdb was generated after removing alpha-bungarotoxin from the binding pocket using Glide (Glide, Maestro 11.2.014, Schrödinger LLC). A virtual grid box with dimensions 20Å × 20Å × 20 Å was formed, centered within the C and F loops in the α-Δ binding site of the energy-minimized resting state. This grid box was used to generate a receptor grid, and the default values were assigned for other parameters. Docking was performed using the ligand docking wizard built into the Glide module of Schrödinger, with the default scaling factor and partial charge cutoff set to 0.80 and 0.15, respectively. The docking procedure consisted of two stages, extra precision (XP) followed by post-processing with prime MM-GBSA. The best dock poses were selected based on dock score and MM-GBSA energy for further investigation.</p>

<title>Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
<p>MD simulations were conducted using the Amber22 software suite within the Amber module as detailed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Singh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Srivastava et al., 2022</xref>). Ligand topology was prepared via the Leap module in AmberTools22, employing force field ff19SB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Tian et al., 2020</xref>) and the Generalized Amber Force Field (GAFF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Vassetti et al., 2019</xref>). The AM1-BCC strategy and GAFF2 were used to assign atomic charges and additional parameters. Before simulation, the systems were minimized and equilibrated following a five-step minimization process, with each step involving 10,000 energy minimization steps. Systems were heated under NVT ensembles in two consecutive runs from 0–300 K for 1 ns each, followed by a 1 ns simulation at 300 K and 1 bar pressure under the NPT ensemble for equilibration. An additional 5 ns equilibration was performed before the 200 ns production MD for each system, conducted under periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) and utilizing an NPT ensemble with 300 K and 1 bar pressure. Long-range electrostatic interactions were treated using the particle mesh Ewald method (PME), including a direct space cutoff of 12.0 Å and van der Waals interactions. In production MD, a time step of 2.0 fs was employed, and the SHAKE algorithm was used to keep bond lengths at equilibrium. Isobaric (NPT) conditions were maintained using the Berendsen barostat, with temperature monitored by a Langevin thermostat. Coordinates from the production MD were recorded in the trajectory file every 20 ps, resulting in a minimum of 10,000 frames. Trajectories were analyzed using amber-tools CPPTRAJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Roe &amp; Cheatham, 2013</xref>), and further analysis and figure generation were completed with VMD, Pymol, Xmgrace and ChimeraX. To ensure reproducibility, MD trajectories were generated in triplicate.</p>

<title>Cluster Analysis</title>
<p>Cluster analysis of the ligand was performed using TCL scripts within the Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) software, as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mittal, Tonk, et al., 2021</xref>). In brief, this script automates the identification of frames from the most stable conformations based on PCA minima. Using these frames as input, the algorithm employed RMSD values of ligand positions to cluster similar orientations. Specifically, clusters with an RMSD of ≤ 1Å were considered to share a similar ligand orientation. Frames that did not fit into these top clusters were automatically excluded by the script.</p>

<title>Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Free Energy Landscape (FEL)</title>
<p>PCA identifies collective motions in atomic-level simulations of macromolecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mittal, Srivastava, et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Srivastava et al., 2022</xref>).

All equilibrated MD simulation trajectories were analyzed by PCA computations using the CPPTRAJ algorithm in Amber tools.</p>
<p>Prior to PCA, least-square fitting of the protein’s Cα atoms was carried out with respect to a reference structure (average protein coordinates) to eliminate rotational and translational degrees of freedom in the simulation box. A positional covariance matrix C (of dimensions 3<italic>N</italic> × 3<italic>N</italic>) was constructed using the Cα atom coordinates, and this matrix was diagonalized to produce eigenvectors (directions of motion) and eigenvalues (magnitudes). The elements of the covariance matrix C were obtained using:

<p>where X<sub>i</sub> and X<sub>j</sub> are the Cartesian coordinates of the Cα atoms, and N is the number of Cα atoms. The ⟨⟩ notation represents the ensemble average of atomic positions in Cartesian space. The resulting principal components (eigenvectors) were sorted by the total motion they captured, generating 3N eigenvectors. The free energy landscapes (FELs; FIg.3) were created using the &quot;g_sham&quot; module in GROMACS, based on the probability distribution of the top two principal components (PCs). The FEL plot aids in visualizing possible conformations and corresponding energy levels. The free energy values (G) were calculated as

<title>Binding Free Energy Calculation</title>
<p>The binding free energy of the protein-ligand docked complex (ΔG<sub>bind</sub>) was calculated in two stages, after docking (using MM-GBSA in the Prime module of Schrödinger) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mittal, Tonk, et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Purushotham et al., 2022</xref>) and after MD simulation on equilibrated MD trajectories (using MM-PBSA/-GBSA in AMBER22).</p>
<p>After docking, for the static docked pose of the protein-ligand complex the MM-GBSA binding energy calculation was performed using the OPLS4 force field and the variable-dielectric generalized Born (VSGB) model in the Prime MM-GBSA module in Schrödinger 2022. We used ΔG<sub>bind_dock</sub> to rank protein-ligand docked complexes, selecting those with the highest negative values and dock scores as the best ligands for further studies. After MD Simulation, in the MD-equilibrated system binding energies were calculated through the MM-PBSA/-GBSA protocol, implemented in AMBER22. This was performed over the most stable clustered poses extracted from the equilibrated trajectory at minima m1, m2, and m3 on the free energy landscape (FEL) over a 200 ns time frame. AMBER utilizes the conventional g_mmpbsa module for MM-PBSA calculations using MM-PBSA.py script. These methods calculate the energies of electrostatic interactions, van der Waals interactions, polar solvation, and non-polar solvation in the equilibrated trajectory using a single trajectory protocol (STP). The binding energy of each protein-ligand complex (ΔG<sub>bind</sub>) was calculated as
<disp-formula id="ueqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="558050v1_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>where ΔG<sub>complex</sub>, ΔG<sub>protein</sub>, and ΔG<sub>ligand</sub> represent the absolute free energies of the complex, protein, and ligand systems, respectively. Additional terms, such as ΔH (enthalpy), T and ΔS (temperature and total solute entropy), ΔG<sub>gas</sub> (total gas phase energy), and ΔG<sub>solv</sub> (solvation energy), contribute to the calculation.</p>
<p>The Poisson-Boltzmann calculations were performed using an internal PBSA solver in Sander, while Generalized Born ESURF was calculated using ‘LCPO’ surface areas. The vibrational mode entropy contributions (TΔS) for protein-ligand interactions were calculated and averaged using normal-mode analysis in Amber. The entropy term provides insights into the disorder within the system, as well as how this disorder changes during the binding process. This value was added to the enthalpy term computed by the MM-PBSA method to determine the absolute binding free energy (ΔG<sub>bind</sub>). These comprehensive calculations allowed for a precise evaluation of the interactions between the protein and ligand, providing valuable insights into the binding process and its energetic characteristics.</p>

<title>Pocket Volume Calculation</title>
<p>To investigate the variations in binding site volume across all four agonist-bound cases, pocket volume analysis was carried out using POVME3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Wagner et al., 2017</xref>). From each of the four systems, frames were extracted at consistent intervals with a stride of 2.0, culminating in representative sets of 5000 protein structures for every system. Before commencing the volume calculation, the trajectory was aligned, and frames were selected from VMD, serving as the initial input for this method. Subsequently, an inclusion region was defined, encapsulating all binding pocket conformations within the trajectory. This region’s definition involved building a sphere upon which the inclusion grid-points were computed, using different atoms of the ligand for this calculation.</p>

<p>This <bold>useful</bold> work provides insight into agonist binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which is the stimulus for channel activation that regulates muscle contraction at the neuromuscular junction. The authors use in silico methods to explore the transient conformational change from a low to high affinity agonist-bound conformation as occurs during channel opening, but for which structural information is lacking owing to its transient nature. The evidence supporting the main conclusion that ligands flip ~180 degrees in the binding site as it transitions from a low to high affinity bound conformation is <bold>incomplete</bold> because little support is available for the starting low affinity docked conformations, and the rather approximate methods for computing binding free energies differ significantly from experimental measures for two of the four tested ligands. Nonetheless, this work presents an intriguing possibility for the nature of a transient conformational change at the agonist binding site correlated with channel opening. If the ligand flip observed in these simulations can be reproduced or verified by other studies, then this work would stand as a significant advance in our knowledge of nicotinic receptor gating.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This useful work provides insight into agonist binding to muscle nicotinic receptors. The authors want to understand the fundamental steps in ligand binding to muscle nicotinic receptors using computational methods. The study builds on a large basis of empirical studies of the various states involved in receptor activation. However, the evidence supporting the conclusions is incomplete, because little support is available for the starting structures that are derived from ligand docking. This work is a useful starting point for more detailed work on ligand binding to this important class of receptors.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The strengths include the number of ligands tried, and the relation to the mature analysis of the receptor function.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The weaknesses are the brevity of the simulations, the concomitant lack of scope of the simulations, the lack of depth in the analysis, and the incomplete relation to other relevant work.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The aim of this manuscript is to use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to describe the conformational changes of the neurotransmitter binding site of a nicotinic receptor. The study uses a simplified model including the alpha-delta subunit interface of the extracellular domain of the channel and describes the binding of four agonists to observe conformational changes during the weak-to-strong affinity transition.</p>
<p>Strength:</p>
<p>
The 200 ns-long simulations of this model suggest that the agonist rotates about its centre in a 'flip' motion, while loop C 'flops' to restructure the site. The changes appear to be reproduced across simulations and different ligands and are thus a strong point of the study.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
After carrying out all-atom molecular dynamics, the authors revert to a model of binding using continuum Poisson-Boltzmann, surface area, and vibrational entropy. The motivations for and limitations associated with this approximate model for the thermodynamics of binding, rather than using modern atomistic MD free energy methods (that would fully incorporate configurational sampling of the protein, ligand, and solvent) could be provided. Despite this, the authors report a correlation between their free energy estimates and those inferred from the experiment. This did, however, reveal shortcomings for two of the agonists. The authors mention their trouble getting correlation to experiment for Ebt and Ebx and refer to up to 130% errors in free energy. But this is far worse than a simple proportional error, because -24 Vs -10 kcal/mol is a massive overestimation of free energy, as would be evident if the authors were to instead express results in terms of KD values (which would have an error exceeding a billion fold). The MD analysis could be improved with better measures of convergence, as well as a more careful discussion of free energy maps as a function of identified principal components, as described below. Overall, however, the study has provided useful observations and interpretations of agonist binding that will help understand pentameric ligand-gated ion channel activation.</p>
<p>Main points:</p>
<p>
Regarding the choice of model, some further justification of the reduced 2 subunit ECD-only model could be given. On page 5 the authors argue that, because binding free energies are independent of energy changes outside the binding pocket, they could remove the TMD and study only an ECD subunit dimer. While the assumption of distant interactions being small seems somewhat reasonable, provided conformational changes are limited and localised, how do we know the packing of TMD onto the ECD does not alter the ability of the alpha-delta interface to rearrange during weak or strong binding? They further write that &quot;fluctuations observed at the base of the ECD were anticipated because the TMD that offers stability here was absent.&quot;. As the TMD-ECD interface is the &quot;gating interface&quot; that is reshaped by agonist binding, surely the TMD-ECD interface structure must affect binding. It seems a little dangerous to completely separate the agonist binding and gating infrastructure, based on some assumption of independence. Given the model was only the alpha and delta subunits and not the pentamer with TMD, I am surprised such a model was stable without some heavy restraints. The authors state that &quot;as a further control we carried out MD simulation of a pentamer docked with ACh and found similar structural changes at the binding pocket compared to the dimer.&quot; Is this sufficient proof of the accuracy of the simplified model? How similar was the model itself with and without agonist in terms of overall RMSD and RMSD for the subunit interface and the agonist binding site, as well as the free energy of binding to each model to compare?</p>
<p>Although the authors repeatedly state that they have good convergence with their MD, I believe the analysis could be improved to convince us. On page 8 the authors write that the RMSD of the system converged in under 200 ns of MD. However, I note that the graph is of the entire ECD dimer, not a measure for the local binding site region. An additional RMSD of local binding site would be much more telling. You could have a structural isomerisation in the site and not even notice it in the existing graph. On page 9 the authors write that the RMSF in Figure S2 showed instability mainly in loops C and F around the pocket. Given this flexibility at the alpha-delta interface, this is why collecting those regions into one group for the calculation of RMSD convergence analysis would have been useful. They then state &quot;the final MD configuration (with CCh) was well-aligned with the CCh-bound cryo-EM desensitized structure (7QL6)... further demonstrating that the simulation had converged.&quot; That may suggest a change occurred that is in common with the global minimum seen in cryo EM, which is good, but does not prove the MD has &quot;converged&quot;. I would also rename Figure S3 accordingly.</p>
<p>The authors draw conclusions about the dominant states and pathways from their PCA component free energy projections that need clarification. It is important first to show data to demonstrate that the two PCA components chosen were dominant and accounted for most of the variance. Then when mapping free energy as a function of those two PCA components, to prove that those maps have sufficient convergence to be able to interpret them. Moreover, if the free energies themselves cannot be used to measure state stability (as seems to be the case), that the limitations are carefully explained. First, was PCA done on all MD trajectories combined to find a common PC1 &amp; PC2, or were they done separately on each simulation? If so, how similar are they? The authors write &quot;the first two principal components (PC-1 and PC-2) that capture the most pronounced C. displacements&quot;. How much of the total variance did these two components capture? The authors write the changes mostly concern loop C and loop F, but which data proves this? e.g. A plot of PC1 and PC2 over residue number might help.</p>
<p>The authors map the -kTln rho as a free energy for each simulation as a function of PC1 &amp; PC2. It is important to reveal how well that PC1-2 space was sampled, and how those maps converged over time. The shapes of the maps and the relative depths of the wells look very different for each agonist. If the maps were sampled well and converged, the free energies themselves would tell us the stabilities of each state. Instead, the authors do not even mention this and instead talk about &quot;variance&quot; being the indicator of stability, stating that m3 is most stable in all cases. While I can believe 200ns could not converge a PC1-2 map and that meaningful delta G values might not be obtained from them, the issue of lack of sampling must be dealt with. On page 12 they write &quot;Although the bottom of the well for 3 energy minima from PCA represent the most stable overall conformation of the protein, they do not convey direct information regarding agonist stability or orientation&quot;. The reasons why not must be explained; as they should do just that if the two order parameters PC1 and PC2 captured the slowest degrees of freedom for binding and sampling was sufficient. The authors write that &quot;For all agonists and trajectories, m3 had the least variance (was most stable), again supporting convergence by 200 ns.&quot; Again the issue of actual free energy values in the maps needs to be dealt with. The probabilities expressed as -kTln rho in kcal/mol might suggest that m2 is the most stable. Instead, the authors base stability only on variance (I guess breadth of the well?), where m3 may be more localised in the chosen PC space, despite apparently having less preference during the MD (not the lowest free energy in the maps).</p>
<p>The motivations and justifications for the use of approximate PBSA energetics instead of atomistic MD free energies should be dealt with in the manuscript, with limitations more clearly discussed. Rather than using modern all-atom MD free energy methods for relative or absolute binding free energies, the author selects clusters from their identified states and does Poisson-Boltzmann estimates (electrostatic, vdW, surface area, vibrational entropy). I do believe the following sentence does not begin to deal with the limitations of that method: &quot;there are limitations with regard to MM-PBSA accurately predicting absolute binding free energies (Genheden &amp; Ryde, 2015; Hou et al., 2011) that depends on the parameterization of the ligand (Oostenbrink et al., 2004).&quot; What are the assumptions and limitations in taking continuum electrostatics (presumably with parameters for dielectric constants and their assignments to regions after discarding solvent), surface area (with its assumptions and limitations), and of course assuming vibration of a normal mode can capture entropy. On page 30, regarding their vibrational entropy estimate, they write that the &quot;entropy term provides insights into the disorder within the system, as well as how this disorder changes during the binding process&quot;. It is important that the extent of disorder captured by the vibrational estimate be discussed, as it is not obvious that it has captured entropy involving multiple minima on the system's true 3N-dimensional energy surface, and especially the contribution from solvent disorder in bound Vs dissociated states.</p>
<p>As discussed above, errors in the free energy estimates need to be more faithfully represented, as fractional errors are not meaningful. On page 21 the authors write &quot;The match improved when free energy ratios rather than absolute values were compared.&quot; But a ratio of free energies is not a typical or expected measure of error in delta G. They also write &quot;For ACh and CCh, there is good agreement between.Gm1 and GLA and between.Gm3 and GHA. For these agonists, in silico values overestimated experimental ones only by ~8% and ~25%. The agreement was not as good for the other 2 agonists, as calculated values overestimated experimental ones by ~45%(Ebt) and ~130% (Ebt). However, the fractional overestimation was approximately the same for GLA and GHA.&quot; See the above comment on how this may misrepresent the error. On page 21 they write, in relation to their large fractional errors, that they &quot;do not know the origin of this factor but speculate that it could be caused by errors in ligand parameterization&quot;. However the estimates from the PBSA approach are, by design, only approximate. Both errors in parameterisation (and their likely origin) and the approximate model used, need discussion.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors use docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate transient conformations that are otherwise difficult to resolve experimentally. The docking and simulations suggest an interesting series of events whereby agonists initially bind to the low-affinity site and then flip 180 degrees as the site contracts to its high-affinity conformation. This work will be of interest to the ion channel community and to biophysical studies of pentameric ligand-gated channels.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
I find the premise for the simulations to be good, starting with an antagonist-bound structure as an estimate of the low affinity binding site conformation, then docking agonists into the site and using MD to allow the site to relax to a higher affinity conformation that is similar to structures in complex with agonists. I cannot speak to the details of the simulation methods, but the predictions are interesting and provide a view into what a transient conformation that is difficult to observe experimentally might be like.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Although the match in simulated vs experimental energies for two ligands was very good, the calculated energies for two other ligands were significantly different than the experiment. It is unclear to what extent the choice of method for the energy calculations influenced the results.</p>
<p>A control simulation, such as for an apo site, is lacking.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In their manuscript &quot;Conformational dynamics of a nicotinic receptor neurotransmitter binding site,&quot; Singh and colleagues present cogent molecular docking and dynamics simulations to explore the initial conformational changes associated with agonist binding in the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, aligned with the extensive experimental literature on this system. Their central findings are of a consistently preferred pose for agonists upon initial association with a resting channel, followed by a dramatic rotation of the ligand and contraction of a critical loop over the binding site. Principal component analysis also suggests the formation of an intermediate complex, not yet captured in structural studies. Binding free energy calculations are consistent with the evolution of a higher-affinity complex following agonist binding, with a ligand efficiency notably similar to experimental values. Snapshot comparisons provide a structural rationale for these changes on the basis of pocket volume, hydration, and rearrangement of key residues at the subunit interface.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Docking results are clearly presented and remarkably consistent. Simulations are produced in triplicate with each of four different agonists, providing an informative basis for internal validation. They identify an intriguing transition in ligand pose, not well documented in experimental structures, and potentially applicable to mechanistic or even pharmacological modeling of this and related receptor systems. The paper seems a notable example of integrating quantitative structure-function analysis with systematic computational modeling and simulations, likely applicable to the wider journal audience.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Timescales (200 ns) do not capture global rearrangements of the extracellular domain, let alone gating transitions of the channel pore, though this work may provide a launching point for more extended simulations. A more general concern is the reproducibility of the simulations, and how representative states are defined. It is not clear whether replicates were included in principal component analysis or subsequent binding energy calculations, nor how simulation intervals were associated with specific states. Structural analysis largely focuses on snapshots, with limited direct evidence of consistency across replicates or clusters. Figure legends and tables could be clarified.</p>
