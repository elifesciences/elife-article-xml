<title>Abstract</title><p>Nucleomodulins are a class of effector proteins secreted by bacterial pathogens that translocate into the host cell nucleus to modulate nuclear processes. However, their target proteins and underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood in mycobacteria. Herein, we identified a conserved hypothetical protein Rv1075c, designated MgdE, as a nucleomodulin that enhances mycobacterial intracellular survival. MgdE undergoes nuclear translocation via two nuclear localization signals, KRIR<sup>108-111</sup> and RLRRPR<sup>300-305</sup>, and interacts with ASH2L and WDR5, two subunits of the host histone methyltransferase COMPASS complex. This interaction suppresses histone H3 lysine 4(H3K4) methylation-mediated transcription of pro-inflammatory genes, including <italic>il6</italic> and <italic>il1β</italic>, thereby promoting mycobacterial survival in both macrophages and mice. Our study provides the first experimental evidence that a bacterial nucleomodulin facilitates intracellular survival by directly targeting the host COMPASS complex. These findings advance our understanding of mycobacterial pathogenesis by revealing a novel mechanism that contributes to its intracellular survival strategy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Nucleomodulins constitute a distinct class of bacterial proteins capable of translocating into the nuclei of eukaryotic cells, where they strategically modulate nuclear processes to promote pathogen survival and persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Radoshevich et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hanford et al., 2021</xref>). These evolutionarily diverse effector proteins, secreted by distinct pathogens, exhibit remarkable adaptability in infiltrating host nuclei and reprogramming the transcriptional and epigenetic regulatory networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bierne et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bierne et al., 2020</xref>). Upon nuclear localization, nucleomodulins employ diverse molecular mechanisms to subvert host cellular processes, including but not limited to: (i) direct interactions with genomic DNA or nuclear proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Rennoll-Bankert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Sun et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Prokop et al., 2017</xref>), (ii) hijacking post-translational modification systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lebreton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Rolando et al., 2023</xref>), (iii) dysregulating signaling molecule activity or localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chambers et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Evans et al., 2018</xref>), and (iv) destabilizing nuclear architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Pourpre et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fu et al., 2021</xref>). Specific examples include AnkA, a bacterial protein from <italic>Anaplasma phagocytophilum,</italic> which binds to specific A/T-rich sequences in the host cell, alters chromatin architecture, and modulates gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Rennoll-Bankert et al., 2015</xref>). In <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, LntA interacts with the proline-rich domain of BAHD1, to disrupt BAHD1-mediated gene silencing and promote histone H3 acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lebreton et al., 2014</xref>). Another example is OspF from <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic>, which exploits its phosphothreonine lyase activity to irreversibly dephosphorylate MAPKs, thereby preventing the transcriptional activation of NF-κB-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chambers et al., 2020</xref>). Unlike these effectors, <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> InlP takes a different approach by hijacking the splicing factor RBM5. This interaction not only suppresses apoptosis but also reorganizes nuclear speckles through SC35 redistribution and RBM5-dependent granule formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Pourpre et al., 2022</xref>). These examples illustrate the diverse and sophisticated mechanisms used by nucleomodulins to reprogram host nuclear functions, ultimately manipulating the intracellular environment to their advantage.</p>
    <p>The evolutionary refinement of nucleomodulins is exemplified by their ability to exploit chromatin-based regulatory systems, with histone methylation emerging as a pivotal axis in host-pathogen interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bierne et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Khan et al., 2021</xref>). As a central epigenetic modification, histone methylation dynamically controls chromatin accessibility and transcriptional outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Yu et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Wang et al., 2025</xref>). By precisely targeting specific histone residues, nucleomodulins reprogram chromatin states to either suppress host immune responses or promote cellular pathways conducive to pathogen survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lebreton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Schator et al., 2023</xref>; Rolando et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Denzer et al., 2020</xref>). A paradigm of this molecular strategy is demonstrated by the <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> nuclear effector NUE, which utilizes its conserved SET domain to catalyze the methylation of histones H2B, H3, and H4, establishing a repressive chromatin state that downregulates antimicrobial gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fol et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, RomA uses its ankyrin and SET domains to bind and methylate histone H3, thereby altering the host chromatin to enhance <italic>Legionella</italic> intracellular survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Schator et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Rolando et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>Legionella</italic> LegAS4 catalyzes H3K4 methylation to promote an open chromatin state, enhancing ribosomal RNA transcription and facilitating bacterial intracellular replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Denzer et al., 2020</xref>). These cases emphasize how pathogens exploit histone methylation as a molecular lever to hijack the host epigenetic machinery.</p>
<p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis, is a highly successful pathogen because of its ability to survive within macrophages, evade the immune system, and persist in the host, ultimately leading to a chronic disease state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chandra et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chai et al., 2020</xref>). Central to its pathogenic strategy is the secretion of a diverse array of effector proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chai et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bates et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Qiang et al., 2023</xref>), including nucleomodulins that subvert host nuclear processes. The tyrosine phosphatase PtpA exemplifies this strategy by directly binding to the promoter regions of immune-related genes, including <italic>GADD45A</italic>, to suppress innate immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). The methyltransferase Rv1988 mediates an unconventional histone modification by methylating histone H3 at arginine 42 (H3R42me), thereby silencing antimicrobial defense mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Yaseen et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, the acetyltransferase Rv3423.1 modulates chromatin accessibility through acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 and 14 (H3K9/K14ac), attenuating pro-inflammatory signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Jose et al., 2016</xref>). Rv2966c represents a unique bacterial DNA methyltransferase that establishes non-canonical CpG methylation patterns to epigenetically silence host immune-related gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Sharma et al., 2015</xref>). Despite these molecular insights, the comprehensive landscape of the nuclear effector systems of Mtb, particularly the mechanistic details of nucleomodulin interactions with host chromatin-modifying complexes and their spatiotemporal regulation during infection, remains poorly defined. This critical knowledge gap impedes our understanding of how Mtb coordinates system-level transcriptional rewiring in the host cellular environment.</p>
<p>In this study, we utilized bioinformatics analysis combined with fluorescence imaging to rapidly screen for potential nucleomodulins in pathogenic mycobacterial species. Using this approach, the hypothetical protein Rv1075c (designated as MgdE) was identified and subsequently validated. MgdE undergoes nuclear translocation mediated by two nuclear localization signals, KRIR<sup>108-111</sup> and RLRRPR<sup>300-305</sup>, and interacts with the histone methyltransferase COMPASS complex subunits ASH2L and WDR5. This interaction suppresses H3K4me3-mediated inflammatory gene expression, thus dampening host immune responses and enhancing bacterial survival in macrophages and murine infection models. Our findings identify MgdE as a nucleomodulin that targets the COMPASS complex, revealing a novel epigenetic strategy exploited by mycobacteria for intracellular survival.</p>

<title>Functional screening of potential nucleomodulins in pathogenic mycobacterial species</title>
<p>To identify conserved nucleomodulins in pathogenic mycobacteria, we first conducted a pan-genomic comparative analysis across four relevant species, including <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv and H37Ra, <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG, <italic>M. marinum</italic>, and <italic>M. avium</italic>, to categorize the core genes. Subsequently, a dual-threshold screening approach was employed to predict the classical and non-canonical secreted proteins encoded by these shared genes using SignalP 5.0 and SecretomeP 2.0, with thresholds set at a D-score ≥0.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hammond et al., 2018</xref>) and a neural network (NN) score ≥0.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bendtsen et al., 2005</xref>) (Table S1). This analysis yielded 135 high confidence secreted protein candidates (Table S2). Further analysis of these candidates for nuclear localization signal (NLS) motifs using cNLS Mapper (NLS score ≥2) revealed that 56 proteins harbored at least one putative NLS. Following systematic classification based on secretion machinery dependencies, the candidate proteins were categorized into four distinct pathways: 26 Sec/SPI (signal peptide-driven), 7 Tat/SPI (twin-arginine translocase pathway), 18 Sec/SPII (lipoprotein-targeted), and eight unclassified candidates lacking canonical secretion motifs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A and B</xref>, Figure S1A and B). Functional validation of nuclear trafficking was conducted through the heterologous expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged constructs in HEK293T cells, followed by quantitative profiling of the subcellular distribution using laser confocal fluorescence microscopy. This orthogonal validation confirmed the nuclear enrichment of 23 effectors, including six Tat/SPI-associated candidates. Among these, Rv2577 exhibited the most pronounced nuclear enrichment, displaying a nuclear localization capacity stronger than that of the previously described nuclear modulator protein Rv1988 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Yaseen et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, MgdE not only localized to the host cell nucleus but also exhibited a distinct punctate distribution within the nucleus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Nucleomodulins are effector proteins secreted by pathogens that translocate into the host cell nucleus to modulate host functions. To assess whether MgdE is secreted by mycobacteria, recombinant <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG strains expressing C-terminally 2×Flag-tagged Ag85B (positive control) and MgdE were constructed. Immunoblot analysis confirmed high levels of Ag85B-2×Flag and MgdE-2×Flag in bacterial lysates. Notably, both proteins were also detected in the culture supernatants (Figure S1C), indicating that MgdE is secreted. These findings identify MgdE as a nucleomodulin in mycobacteria and led us to further investigate the mechanisms underlying its nuclear translocation and functional role during infection.</p>

<title>MgdE translocates into the host nucleus through its dual NLS</title>
<p>MgdE is a putative GDSL-like lipase characterized by conserved esterase sequence motifs, with the GDSx motif containing a nucleophilic Ser residue as part of block I (equivalent to the classical G-x-S-x-G motif of lipases/esterases), and the consensus amino acids Gly, Asn, and His located in blocks II, III, and V, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis across the mycobacterial species revealed strict evolutionary conservation of MgdE, with most strains encoding two predicted NLS: KRIR<sup>108-111</sup> (NLS1) and RLRRPR<sup>300-305</sup> (NLS2) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A and B</xref>). To further investigate the nuclear translocation capability of MgdE, MgdE-EGFP was transfected into HEK293T cells, and its subcellular localization was analyzed at various time points post-transfection. Confocal microscopy revealed a time-dependent decrease in the cytoplasmic levels of MgdE, accompanied by its progressive accumulation in the host cell nucleus. Notably, MgdE displayed a distinct punctate distribution pattern within the nucleus, with nearly all the protein localizing to the nucleus approximately 36 h post-transfection (Figure S2). To quantitatively validate these observations, the temporal dynamics of MgdE expression in HEK293T cells were monitored, and nuclear enrichment was further assessed through cell fractionation. The results demonstrated a time-dependent increase in MgdE expression levels, which closely correlated with its gradual and sustained nuclear accumulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Collectively, these findings indicate that MgdE is an evolutionarily conserved mycobacterial nucleomodulin with nuclear translocation capacity.</p>

Fluorescence intensity profiling revealed that individual deletion of either NLS1 or NLS2 partially reduced the nuclear targeting efficiency, whereas simultaneous deletion of both the NLS motifs (MgdE<sup>ΔNLS1-2</sup>) completely abrogated its nuclear localization (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D and E</xref>). These observations were further confirmed by immunoblot analysis of nuclear fractions, which showed that at 36 h post-transfection, MgdE-EGFP and its mutant variants were consistently detected in the cytoplasmic compartment, and nuclear accumulation of MgdE<sup>ΔNLS1-2</sup> was nearly undetectable compared to that of MgdE, MgdE<sup>ΔNLS1</sup>, and MgdE<sup>ΔNLS2</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>).

<title>Nuclear localization of MgdE enhances mycobacterial intracellular survival within macrophages</title>
<p>Given that MgdE exhibits nuclear translocation ability, we sought to determine whether this ability plays a role in bacterial survival during infection. We generated various recombinant <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG strains, including wild-type BCG (WT), a <italic>mgdE</italic> deletion mutant (ΔMgdE) (Figure S3A and B), ΔMgdE complemented with wild-type <italic>mgdE</italic> (Comp-MgdE), and ΔMgdE complemented with NLS-deleted variant (Comp-MgdE<sup>ΔNLS1-2</sup>). All strains exhibited similar growth under standard culture conditions (Figure S3C), and subsequently used them to infect THP-1 macrophages. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, the ΔMgdE mutant strain exhibited significantly reduced survival compared to the WT strain, with accelerated bacterial clearance over time. This defect was rescued in the Comp-MgdE strain, with intracellular survival levels restored to that in the WT strain. Notably, the Comp-MgdE<sup>ΔNLS1-2</sup> showed bacterial clearance equivalent to that in the ΔMgdE strains. These results were consistent with the infection experiments using RAW264.7 macrophage (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).

<title>MgdE physically interacts with the host COMPASS complex subunits ASH2L and WDR5</title>
<p>To identify the potential host target proteins of MgdE, we employed AlphaFold to predict the interactions between MgdE and majority of the nuclear proteins in the host. The prediction results showed that MgdE binds to WDR5, a core component of the histone methyltransferase COMPASS complex, with high confidence (pLDDT = 0.77) (Figure S4A and B). To experimentally validate this prediction, we performed yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assays. Strain co-expressing MgdE with either ASH2L or WDR5 exhibited robust growth on selective SD/-Trp-Leu-His-Ade medium, whereas strain co-expressing MgdE with DPY30 or RbBP5 showed no detectable growth, confirming specific interactions between MgdE and ASH2L/WDR5 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Further, these interactions were validated by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with Flag-tagged MgdE and HA-tagged ASH2L, WDR5, or RbBP5. The results revealed that HA-tagged ASH2L and WDR5, but not RbBP5, co-precipitated with Flag-tagged MgdE (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Conversely, Flag-tagged MgdE precipitated HA-tagged ASH2L and WDR5, but not RbBP5 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>).

<title>MgdE suppresses inflammatory responses mediated by the COMPASS complex via inhibition of H3K4 methylation</title>
<p>As H3K4me3, a hallmark of transcriptionally active promoters, facilitates transcriptional machinery assembly and RNA polymerase II recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Wang et al., 2023</xref>), we further investigated the transcriptional consequences of MgdE-mediated H3K4me3 suppression via its interaction with the COMPASS complex. To assess the genome-wide effects of MgdE on host gene expression, we performed RNA-seq profiling of THP-1 macrophages infected with either WT BCG (BCG/wt) or MgdE-deleted (Ko<italic>mgdE</italic>) strains. Transcriptomic analysis at 24 h post-infection revealed that 271 genes showed significant differential expression in the cells infected with Ko<italic>mgdE</italic> strain compared to that in the cells infected with WT BCG strain, with 222 genes being transcriptionally upregulated in the absence of MgdE (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis indicated that these upregulated genes were primarily associated with biological processes involved in immune responses, with a notable enrichment in “Positive regulation of cytokine production” (GO: 0001819), a critical pathway for amplifying inflammatory signaling (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Furthermore, the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis highlighted a significant activation of the “Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction” and “JAK-STAT signaling pathway” in THP-1 cells infected with the Ko<italic>mgdE</italic> strain (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, Figure S6A).

Protein-protein interaction network analysis of the upregulated genes revealed tightly interconnected clusters within inflammatory networks, particularly those orchestrated by the central inflammatory mediator IL-6 (Figure S6C). To validate this result, we infected macrophages with the <italic>M. bovis BCG</italic> strains, including WT, ΔMgdE, Comp-MgdE, and Comp-MgdE<sup>ΔNLS1-2</sup>, under identical conditions for 24 h and examined the expression of relevant inflammatory factors.

Collectively, these results demonstrate that MgdE effectively inhibits the production of inflammatory factors during BCG infection and highlights the critical role of its NLSs in this process.

These findings collectively establish that MgdE is essential for optimal bacterial survival during infection, with the NLS being critical for its full functionality. Furthermore, histopathological assessment of the lung tissues corroborated these observations.

Consistent with the attenuated bacterial survival observed in the lungs, mice infected with ΔMgdE and Comp-MgdE<sup>ΔNLS1-2</sup> exhibited a significantly reduced splenic bacterial load compared to those infected with WT or omp-MgdE (Figure S7).

<title>MgdE functions as a critical nucleomodulin that contributes to mycobacterial pathogenesis</title>
<p>Its evolutionary conservation across mycobacterial species, coupled with nuclear translocation via dual N-terminal and C-terminal NLSs, supports its classification as a nucleomodulin. Previous investigations have described MgdE as a secreted effector protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Penn et al., 2018</xref>), and our experimental results independently confirm its secretion (Figure S1C). Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that MgdE’s nuclear localization plays a critical role during infection. Disruption of MgdE expression or its NLS motifs significantly attenuated <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG viability within macrophages (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A and B</xref>) and reduced bacterial burden in mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref> and Figure S7), supporting the notion that nuclear targeting contributes to bacterial virulence. This phenotype aligns with the observed upregulation of MgdE during Mtb infection of alveolar macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Pisu et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that nuclear activity of MgdE may contribute to an adaptive persistence mechanism during infection. Although MgdE was previously characterized as a lipase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Yang et al., 2019</xref>), our findings reveal a novel functional duality wherein nuclear targeting coordinates bacterial survival through epigenetic interference while preserving its metabolic roles. This functional pleiotropy positions MgdE as a master virulence regulator, exploiting host-pathogen interface plasticity to sustain infection.</p>

<title>MgdE directly subverts the COMPASS complex to reprogram host epigenetics</title>
<p>To our knowledge, MgdE is the first identified bacterial effector that directly targets and subverts the COMPASS complex, a central regulator of H3K4 methylation. Nuclear-localized MgdE specifically interacts with the core COMPASS subunits ASH2L and WDR5, disrupting H3K4me3 deposition through structural interference. The COMPASS complex facilitates H3K4 methylation via a conserved assembly mechanism in which WDR5 scaffolds methyltransferases such as MLL1 through its WIN motif and stabilizes the ASH2L–RbBP5 dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Guarnaccia et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hsu et al., 2018</xref>). This dimer, in turn, positions the SET domain for efficient substrate recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Xue et al., 2019</xref>). MgdE appears to interfere with this assembly process, resembling strategies employed by host regulatory proteins.</p>
<p>Site-directed mutagenesis studies have identified critical residues (D<sup>224</sup> and H<sup>247</sup>) within MgdE that are essential for WDR5 binding. Mutating these residues abolished both WDR5 interaction and H3K4me3 suppression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, D), confirming their functional relevance. Moreover, nuclear MgdE accumulates in punctate subnuclear foci (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>), reminiscent of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> InlP, which modulates nuclear speckles to inhibit apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Pourpre et al., 2022</xref>).

Furthermore, during infection, the <italic>MgdE</italic>-deleted BCG strain markedly activated the expression of inflammatory factors compared to the WT BCG strain (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C-G</xref>). These results suggest that MgdE attenuates the expression of inflammatory mediators such as <italic>il6</italic> and <italic>il1β</italic> by reducing host H3K4me3 levels during Mycobacterium infection. This mechanism is similar to those observed in other pathogens, such as spirochete-derived factors that suppress inflammation by reducing H3K4me3 levels at the <italic>tnfα</italic> and <italic>il-6</italic> promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chauhan et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, our study identified MgdE as a critical mycobacterial nucleomodulin and uncovered a novel paradigm of pathogen-mediated epigenetic regulation through the “MgdE-COMPASS complex-H3K4me3-cytokine” axis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>). Mechanistically, MgdE specifically interacts with ASH2L and WDR5 to destabilize the COMPASS assembly, resulting in reduced H3K4me3 levels at the promoters of pro-inflammatory genes. This epigenetic suppression downregulates cytokine transcription (e.g., <italic>il6 and il1β</italic>) and enhances bacterial survival in macrophages and in mice. Our findings reveal the COMPASS complex as a previously unrecognized target of bacterial effectors and offers mechanistic insights into immune evasion and host-pathogen epigenetic interplay.</p>

<title>Pan-genomic nucleomodulin screening</title>
<p>To systematically identify evolutionarily conserved nucleomodulins in pathogenic mycobacteria, a pan-genomic comparative analysis was performed across four phylogenetically representative mycobacterium strains: <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv (NCBI RefSeq assembly GCF_000195955.2), <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> H37Ra (NCBI RefSeq assembly GCF_001938725.1), <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> BCG (NCBI RefSeq assembly GCF_000009445.1), <italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic> (NCBI RefSeq assembly GCF_000018345.1), and <italic>Mycobacterium avium</italic> subsp. (NCBI RefSeq assembly GCF_009741445.1). Complete genome sequences and annotations were obtained from NCBI RefSeq with strict inclusion criteria requiring “Complete Genome” status and fewer than 50 contigs to ensure the assembly integrity. Plasmid sequences, as well as low-complexity and repetitive regions, were filtered using the NCBI Genome Data Viewer toolkit. Genome quality control was rigorously conducted using CheckM v1.2.2 with a <italic>Mycobacteriaceae</italic>-specific marker set (including essential housekeeping genes such as <italic>dnaA</italic> and <italic>rpoB</italic>), confirming that all the selected genomes exhibited &gt;99% completeness and &lt;1% contamination.</p>
<p>Ortholog clustering of protein-coding sequences (CDS) was executed through OrthoFinder v2.5.4, employing Diamond alignment in ultra-sensitive mode (--ultra-sensitive), an E-value cutoff of ≤1e-5 (--blastp_evalue 1e-5), and a minimum sequence identity threshold of ≥50% (--min_percent_identity 50). The Markov cluster algorithm (MCL) was applied with an inflation parameter of 1.5 (--mcl_inflation 1.5) to define orthologous groups, balancing sensitivity, and specificity. Core orthologs were identified as clusters present in all four strains, with additional filtering to retain only single-copy genes in ≥90% of the strains, minimizing paralog-related artifacts.</p>
<p>Functional annotation of the core genes was conducted using InterProScan v5.62, which integrates domain predictions from the Pfam, TIGRFAM, and SUPERFAMILY databases. To prioritize candidate nucleomodulins, a sequential screening pipeline was applied, beginning with the prediction of classical secretory proteins using SignalP v5.0 (D-score ≥0.5), followed by the identification of non-classically secreted proteins via SecretomeP v2.0 (NN score ≥0.9), and culminating in NLS detection using cNLS Mapper (NLS score ≥2.0), which predicts both monopartite and bipartite NLSs. This integrated strategy enabled the systematic identification of conserved candidates that exhibit both secretory potential and nuclear targeting capacity.</p>

Bacterial cultures were centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 60 minutes to separate cells from supernatants. Pellets were washed and lysed by bead beating in PBS supplemented with protease inhibitors. Culture supernatants were passed through 0.22 μm filters to remove residual bacteria and subsequently concentrated to 2 mL using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters (10 kDa cutoff). Both bacterial lysates and concentrated supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-Flag antibodies to detect the expression and secretion of 2×Flag-tagged proteins.</p>

<title>Immunoblot analysis</title>
<p>For immunoblotting, the cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer supplemented with 1.5% protease inhibitor cocktail (Boster). Protein concentrations were quantified using the BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Equal amounts of protein (20–40 µg) were resolved by sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore). The membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% non-fat milk in TBST (25 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, and 0.2% Tween-20, pH 7.4) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies. After three washes with TBST (10 min each), the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. Following three additional TBST washes, protein signals were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) substrate and imaged on a ChemiDoc MP system (Bio-Rad). β-actin, GAPDH, or histone H3 served as housekeeping proteins for normalization. The antibody information is listed in Table S3.</p>
<p>Cell fractionation was performed using a Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Protein Extraction Kit (Beyotime) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

<title>Y2H assay</title>
<p>The Yeast Two-Hybrid System (Clontech) was used to assay protein-protein interactions between MgdE (WT and mutants) and subunits of the COMPASS complex (ASH2L, WDR5, RbBP5, and DPY30). Full-length cDNAs encoding WT MgdE and its mutants (see Table S5) were cloned into the bait vector pGBKT7, whereas genes encoding the COMPASS subunits were cloned into the prey vector pGADT7. The yeast strain Y2HGold was co-transformed with bait and prey plasmids using the lithium acetate/polyethylene glycol method, and the transformed colonies were initially selected on SD agar plates lacking leucine and tryptophan (-Leu/-Trp) to confirm plasmid retention. For interaction screening, colonies were replica-plated onto selective SD agar plates lacking leucine, tryptophan, adenine, and histidine (-Leu/-Trp/-Ade/-His) and supplemented with 200 ng/μL aureobasidin A (AbA, Sigma-Aldrich). The plates were incubated at 30 °C, and colony growth was monitored daily, with final assessments performed after 5 d of incubation. Interaction strength was qualitatively assessed by comparing colony density and growth rates with those of the controls. The positive controls included the co-transformation of pGBKT7-p53 with pGADT7-T, which produced robust growth on –Leu/-Trp/-Ade/-His plates. Negative controls included co-transformation of pGBKT7-Lam (human lamin C, a non-interacting bait) with pGADT7-T, as well as individual transformations with empty pGBKT7 or pGADT7 vectors to assess the background growth. The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table S4. All experiments were performed in triplicate with biologically independent yeast cultures.

CFU assays were performed on splenic homogenates from mice infected as described in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>. Bacterial loads (CFU/g tissue) were quantified at 2, 14, 21, 28, and 56 d post-infection. Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 3). Statistical significance was determined using a two-tailed unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, **<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, and ***<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p></caption>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study provides <bold>solid</bold> evidence that MgdE, a conserved mycobacterial nucleomodulin, downregulates inflammatory gene transcription by interacting with the histone methyltransferase COMPASS complex and altering histone H3 lysine methylation. There are areas where the evidence could be strengthened, for example, GFP immunoblotting and examining MgdE localization during infection. To enhance impact, the authors could consider Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection experiments and/or reworking the manuscript to emphasize general relevance to microbiologists and cell biologists.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This fundamental study identifies a new mechanism that involves a mycobacterial nucleomodulin manipulation of the host histone methyltransferase COMPASS complex to promote infection. Although other intracellular pathogens are known to manipulate histone methylation, this is the first report demonstrating the specific targeting of the COMPASS complex by a pathogen. The rigorous experimental design using state-of-the art bioinformatic analysis, protein modeling, molecular and cellular interaction, and functional approaches, culminating with in vivo infection modeling, provides convincing, unequivocal evidence that supports the authors' claims. This work will be of particular interest to cellular microbiologists working on microbial virulence mechanisms and effectors, specifically nucleomodulins, and cell/cancer biologists that examine COMPASS dysfunction in cancer biology.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The strengths of this study include the rigorous and comprehensive experimental design that involved numerous state-of-the-art approaches to identify potential nucleomodulins, define molecular nucleomodulin-host interactions, cellular nucleomodulin localization, intracellular survival, and inflammatory gene transcriptional responses, and confirmation of the inflammatory and infection phenotype in a small animal model.</p>
<p>(2) The use of bioinformatic, cellular, and in vivo modeling that are consistent and support the overall conclusions is a strength of the study. In addition, the rigorous experimental design and data analysis, including the supplemental data provided, further strengthen the evidence supporting the conclusions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) This work could be stronger if the MgdE-COMPASS subunit interactions that negatively impact COMPASS complex function were better defined. Since the COMPASS complex consists of many enzymes, examining the functional impact on each of the components would be interesting.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Chen et al addresses an important aspect of pathogenesis for mycobacterial pathogens, seeking to understand how bacterial effector proteins disrupt the host immune response. To address this question, the authors sought to identify bacterial effectors from M. tuberculosis (Mtb) that localize to the host nucleus and disrupt host gene expression as a means of impairing host immune function.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The researchers conducted a rigorous bioinformatic analysis to identify secreted effectors containing mammalian nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences, which formed the basis of quantitative microscopy analysis to identify bacterial proteins that had nuclear targeting within human cells. The study used two complementary methods to detect protein-protein interaction: yeast two-hybrid assays and reciprocal immunoprecipitation (IP). The combined use of these techniques provides strong evidence of interactions between MgdE and SET1 components and suggests that the interactions are, in fact, direct. The authors also carried out a rigorous analysis of changes in gene expression in macrophages infected with the mgdE mutant BCG. They found strong and consistent effects on key cytokines such as IL6 and CSF1/2, suggesting that nuclear-localized MgdE does, in fact, alter gene expression during infection of macrophages.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are some drawbacks in this study that limit the application of the findings to M. tuberculosis (Mtb) pathogenesis. The first concern is that much of the study relies on ectopic overexpression of proteins either in transfected non-immune cells (HEK293T) or in yeast, using 2-hybrid approaches. Some of their data in 293T cells is hard to interpret, and it is unclear if the protein-protein interactions they identify occur during natural infection with mycobacteria. The second major concern is that pathogenesis is studied using the BCG vaccine strain rather than virulent Mtb. However, overall, the key findings of the paper - that MgdE interacts with SET1 and alters gene expression are well-supported.</p>

<p>In this study, Chen L et al. systematically analyzed the mycobacterial nucleomodulins and identified MgdE as a key nucleomodulin in pathogenesis. They found that MgdE enters into host cell nucleus through two nuclear localization signals, KRIR108-111 and RLRRPR300-305, and then interacts with COMPASS complex subunits ASH2L and WDR5 to suppress H3K4 methylation-mediated transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby promoting mycobacterial survival. This study is potentially interesting, but there are several critical issues that need to be addressed to support the conclusions of the manuscript.</p>
<p>(1) Figure 2: The study identified MgdE as a nucleomodulin in mycobacteria and demonstrated its nuclear translocation via dual NLS motifs. The authors examined MgdE nuclear translocation through ectopic expression in HEK293T cells, which may not reflect physiological conditions.

<p>(3) Figure 3C-3H: The data showing that the expression of all detected genes in 24 h is comparable to that in 4 h (but not 0 h) during WT BCG infection is beyond comprehension. The issue is also present in Figure 7C, Figure 7D, and Figure S7. Moreover, since Il6, Il1β (pro-inflammatory), and Il10 (anti-inflammatory) were all upregulated upon MgdE deletion, how do the authors explain the phenomenon that MgdE deletion simultaneously enhanced these gene expressions?</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This fundamental study identifies a new mechanism that involves a mycobacterial nucleomodulin manipulation of the host histone methyltransferase COMPASS complex to promote infection. Although other intracellular pathogens are known to manipulate histone methylation, this is the first report demonstrating the specific targeting of the COMPASS complex by a pathogen. The rigorous experimental design using state-of-the art bioinformatic analysis, protein modeling, molecular and cellular interaction, and functional approaches, culminating with in vivo infection modeling, provides convincing, unequivocal evidence that supports the authors' claims. This work will be of particular interest to cellular microbiologists working on microbial virulence mechanisms and effectors, specifically nucleomodulins, and cell/cancer biologists that examine COMPASS dysfunction in cancer biology.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The strengths of this study include the rigorous and comprehensive experimental design that involved numerous state-of-the-art approaches to identify potential nucleomodulins, define molecular nucleomodulin-host interactions, cellular nucleomodulin localization, intracellular survival, and inflammatory gene transcriptional responses, and confirmation of the inflammatory and infection phenotype in a small animal model.</p>
<p>(2) The use of bioinformatic, cellular, and in vivo modeling that are consistent and support the overall conclusions is a strength of the study. In addition, the rigorous experimental design and data analysis, including the supplemental data provided, further strengthen the evidence supporting the conclusions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) This work could be stronger if the MgdE-COMPASS subunit interactions that negatively impact COMPASS complex function were better defined. Since the COMPASS complex consists of many enzymes, examining the functional impact on each of the components would be interesting.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment. A biochemistry assays could be helpful to interpret the functional impact on each of the components by MgdE interaction. However, the purification of the COMPASS complex could be a hard task itself due to the complexity of the full COMPASS complex along with its dynamic structural properties and limited solubility.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Examining the impact of WDR5 inhibitors on histone methylation, gene transcription, and mycobacterial infection could provide additional rigor and provide useful information related to the mechanisms and specific role of WDR5 inhibition on mycobacterial infection.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. A previous study showed that WIN-site inhibitors, such as compound C6, can displace WDR5 from chromatin, leading to a reduction in global H3K4me3 levels and suppression of immune-related gene expression (Hung et al., Nucleic Acids Res, 2018; Bryan et al., Nucleic Acids Res, 2020). These results closely mirror the functional effects we observed for MgdE, suggesting that MgdE may act as a functional mimic of WDR5 inhibition. This supports our proposed model in which MgdE disrupts COMPASS activity by targeting WDR5, thereby dampening host pro-inflammatory responses.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The interaction between MgdE and COMPASS complex subunit ASH2L is relatively undefined, and studies to understand the relationship between WDR5 and ASH2L in COMPASS complex function during infection could provide interesting molecular details that are undefined in this study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. In this study, we constructed single and multiple point mutants of MgdE at residues S<sup>80</sup>, D<sup>244</sup>, and H<sup>247</sup> to identify key amino acids involved in its interaction with ASH2L (Figure 5A and B; Figure S5). However these mutations did not interrupt the interaction with MgdE, suggesting that more residues are involved in the interaction.</p>
<p>ASH2L and WDR5 function cooperatively within the WRAD module to stabilize the SET domain and promote H3K4 methyltransferase activity with physiological conditions (Couture and Skiniotis, Epigenetics, 2013; Qu et al., Cell, 2018; Rahman et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 2022). ASH2L interacts with RbBP5 via its SPRY domain, whereas WDR5 bridges MLL1 and RbBP5 through the WIN and WBM motifs (Chen at al., Cell Res, 2012; Park et al., Nat Commun, 2019). The interaction status between ASH2L and WDR5 during mycobacterial infection could not be determined in our current study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The AlphaFold prediction results for all the nuclear proteins examined could be useful. Since the interaction predictions with COMPASS subunits range from 0.77 for WDR5 and 0.47 for ASH2L, it is not clear how the focus on COMPASS complex over other nuclear proteins was determined.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. We employed AlphaFold to predict the interactions between MgdE and the major nuclear proteins. This screen identified several subunits of the SET1/COMPASS complex as high-confidence candidates for interaction with MgdE (Supplementary Figure 4A). This result is consistent with a proteomic study by Penn et al. which reported potential interactions between MgdE and components of the human SET1/COMPASS complex based on affinity purification-mass spectrometry analysis (Penn et al., Mol Cell, 2018).</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. We agree that the ectopic overexpression could not completely reflect a natural status, although these approaches were adopted in many similar experiments (Drerup et al., Molecular plant, 2013; Chen et al., Cell host &amp; microbe, 2018; Ge et al., Autophagy, 2021). Further, the MgdE localization experiment using Mtb infected macrophages will be performed to increase the evidence in the natural infection.</p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that BCG strain could not fully recapitulate the pathogenicity or immunological complexity of M. tuberculosis infection.  We employed BCG as a biosafe surrogate model since it was acceptable in many related studies (Wang et al., Nat Immunol, 2025; Wang et al., Nat Commun, 2017; Péan et al., Nat Commun, 2017; Li et al., J Biol Chem, 2020).</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. A relative quantification method was used in our qPCR experiments to normalize the WT expression levels in Figure 3C–3H, Figure 7C, 7D, and Figure S7.</p>
<p>The concurrent induction of both types of cytokines likely represents a dynamic host strategy to fine-tune immune responses during infection. This interpretation is supported by previous studies (Podleśny-Drabiniok et al., Cell Rep, 2025; Cicchese et al., Immunological Reviews, 2018).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Figure 5: The authors confirmed the interactions between MgdE and WDR5/ASH2L. How does the interaction between MgdE and WDR5 inhibit COMPASS-dependent methyltransferase activity? Additionally, the precise MgdE-ASH2L binding interface and its functional impact on COMPASS assembly or activity require clarification.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment. We cautiously speculate that the MgdE interaction inhibits COMPASS-dependent methyltransferase activity by interfering with the integrity and stability of the COMPASS complex. Accordingly, we have incorporated the following discussion into the revised manuscript (Lines 298-310):</p>
<p>“The COMPASS complex facilitates H3K4 methylation through a conserved assembly mechanism involving multiple core subunits. WDR5, a central scaffolding component, interacts with RbBP5 and ASH2L to promote complex assembly and enzymatic activity (Qu et al., 2018; Wysocka et al., 2005). It also recognizes the WIN motif of methyltransferases such as MLL1, thereby anchoring them to the complex and stabilizing the ASH2L-RbBP5 dimer (Hsu et al., Cell, 2018). ASH2L further contributes to COMPASS activation by interacting with both RbBP5 and DPY30 and by stabilizing the SET domain, which is essential for efficient substrate recognition and catalysis (Qu et al., Cell, 2018; Park et al., Nat Commun, 2019). Our work shows that MgdE binds both WDR5 and ASH2L and inhibits the methyltransferase activity of the COMPASS complex. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that residues D<sup>224</sup> and H<sup>247</sup> of MgdE are critical for WDR5 binding, as the double mutant MgdE-D<sup>224</sup>A/H<sup>247</sup> A fails to interact with WDR5 and shows diminished suppression of H3K4me3 levels (Figure 5D).”</p>
<p>Regarding the precise MgdE-ASH2L binding interface, we attempted to identify the key interaction site by introducing point mutations into ASH2L. However, these mutations did not disrupt the interaction (Figure 5A and B; Figure S5), suggesting that more residues are involved in the interaction.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Figure 6: The authors proposed that the MgdE-regulated COMPASS complex-H3K4me3 axis suppresses pro-inflammatory responses, but the presented data do not sufficiently support this claim. H3K4me3 inhibitor should be employed to verify cytokine production during infection.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. We have now revised the description in lines 824825 “MgdE may suppresses COMPASS complex-mediated inflammatory responses by inhibiting H3K4 methylation” and in lines 219-220 &quot;MgdE suppresses host inflammatory responses probably by inhibition of COMPASS complex-mediated H3K4 methylation.&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) There appears to be a discrepancy between the results shown in Figure S7 and its accompanying legend. The data related to inflammatory responses seem to be missing, and the data on bacterial colonization are confusing (bacterial DNA expression or CFU assay?).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. Figure S7 specifically addresses the effect of MgdE on bacterial colonization in the spleens of infected mice, which was assessed by quantitative PCR rather than by CFU assay.</p>
<p>We have now revised the legend of Figure S7 as below (Lines 934-938):</p>
<p>“MgdE facilitates bacterial colonization in the spleens of infected mice. Bacterial colonization was assessed in splenic homogenates from infected mice (as described in Figure 7A) by quantifying bacterial DNA using quantitative PCR at 2, 14, 21, 28, and 56 days post-infection.”</p>
