<title>Abstract</title><p>Neural stem cells (NSCs) represent an interesting option for developing <italic>in vitro</italic> disease models and drug screening assays due to their differentiation capacity into neurons and glial cells. Additionally, NSCs are under investigation in on-going clinical trials for treatment of various human neurological disorders. NSCs can be isolated from the central nervous system or derived <italic>in vitro</italic> from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). However, the current methods for generating NSCs typically include a phase of neural rosette formation and subsequent manual isolation of these tiny structures. As this is a laborious process characterized by operator-dependent variability and scalability challenges, there is a pressing need to develop optimized and scalable protocols to obtain pure NSC populations. In this study, we present a new method for generating highly pure and expandable dorsal forebrain FOXG1<sup>+</sup>OTX2<sup>+</sup>TLE4<sup>+</sup>SOX5<sup>+</sup> neural rosette stem cell (NRSC) lines without the necessity for manual isolation of rosette structures. Our findings demonstrate the reproducibility of this protocol through the characterization of different NRSC lines over multiple passages, highlighting the robustness of the process. These NRSCs can be expanded for at least 12 passages without compromising their rosette-formation capacity or their initial dorsal forebrain identity. Furthermore, we show the differentiation capacity of these NRSCs to generate pure populations of TUBB3<sup>+</sup> neurons, and under specific conditions, their ability to differentiate into early glial progenitor cells including GFAP<sup>+</sup> astrocytes and O4<sup>+</sup> oligodendrocytes. Collectively, these results show the capabilities of our protocol to generate an expandable NRSC population suitable for <italic>in vitro</italic> disease modeling and drug screening, while also suggesting a viable strategy for scalable NRSC production for clinical application.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>NSCs are recognized as important tools for the development of drug screening platforms and <italic>in vitro</italic> disease models, particularly in the context of neurological disorders. Their unique capacity for self- renewal and differentiation into different types of neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes positions them as potential candidates for clinical translation. NSCs contribute to neuroprotection through mechanisms that include cellular replacement and the secretion of neuroprotective factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alonso-Olivares <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hudáčová, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>The generation of NSCs can be accomplished through direct isolation from the central nervous system or via differentiation of hPSCs. Currently, the most common methods utilize the formation of neural rosettes followed by manual isolation to increase purity, which introduces significant variability and challenges in scalability. As highlighted by several studies, this manual approach can be labor-intensive and inconsistent, reflecting the need for standardized protocols that enhance reproducibility across multiple passages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dady <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Verrier <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hříbková <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). The difficulties encountered in the isolation of neural rosettes emphasize the necessity of refining methodologies to ensure consistency and reliability in NSC production.</p>
<p>Recent explorations have focused on alternative protocols that avoid the manual selection step of neural rosettes. However, these newer approaches often lead to heterogeneous NSC populations that struggle with stability during passaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">D’Aiuto <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Knight <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). The optimization of protocols to facilitate scalable production of NSCs is therefore important to ensure their clinical applicability.</p>
<p>This study employs dynamic suspension culture coupled with single SMAD inhibition to generate neural rosette stem cells (NRSCs) with high purity and stability over extended passages. Furthermore, we have investigated the multipotency of these cells through differentiating them into functional neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, thus ensuring their differentiation potential.</p>
<p>Our research aims to overcome the limitations associated with traditional protocols by introducing an innovative strategy for generating highly pure dorsal forebrain populations of NRSCs characterized by markers such as FOXG1, OTX2, TLE4, and SOX5 without the necessity for manual isolation. Notably, these NRSCs maintain their capacity for rosette formation across more than 12 passages, simultaneously retaining their inherent identity associated with the dorsal forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kim <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Birtele <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). This protocol not only enhances the reproducibility of NSC generation but also aligns with the growing necessity for efficient and standardized procedures in stem cell research, paving the way for new <italic>in vitro</italic> modelling and future innovative therapeutic strategies.</p>

<title>Generation of high-purity populations of NRSCs without the need of manual selection</title>
<p>Most protocols for generating NSCs from hPSCs involve a manual selection step, where neural rosettes are either manually picked or selected using agents to achieve purer populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Elkabetz <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Koch <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bohaciakova <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). In contrast, protocols that do not perform manual selection of rosettes often demonstrate high heterogeneity or variability in marker composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Ebert <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Wen and Jin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fedorova <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>This study presents a protocol for deriving highly pure populations of NRSCs that are expandable and identified by the continuous formation of neural rosettes after multiple passages. Notably, our process does not require the manual selection step of neural rosettes to efficiently convert human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into NRSCs.</p>
<p>The protocol is divided into three different phases: neuroectoderm induction, rosette formation, and NRSC line establishment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). hESCs were dissociated into a suspension of single cells and placed into non-adhesive plates, where they were kept in static culture for 24 hours to allow for the natural formation of floating cell spheres. It is important not to disturb the cultures during this phase to avoid aggregation of the cell spheres. After 24 hours, the culture conditions were switched from static to dynamic culture by transferring the spheres onto an orbital shaker set to 40 RPM with a 3 second vibration step every 15 seconds. The cells were exposed to single SMAD inhibition from day 0 to 10 to induce neuroectoderm formation. We evaluated various SMAD signaling inhibitors and found that the small molecule RepSox was the most effective in promoting the formation of rosette structures and enhancing cell purity for NES (Nestin) and OTX2 (data not shown).</p>

<p>By day 6, most clusters ranged from 100 to 400 µm in size (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) and exhibited a morphologically smooth surface, with the onset of cavitation visible via brightfield imaging (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). Clusters were then seeded in 2D on laminin-coated plates for an additional 4 days, during which they initiated flattening into a cell monolayer of neural rosettes, observable by brightfield imaging (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). On day 10, the cells were positive for the typical NSC marker NES and the proliferation marker SOX2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Furthermore, we observed re-distribution of the tight junction protein TJP1 (also known as zonula occludens-1, ZO1) into the lumen of the rosettes, indicating a polarized organization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>The NRSCs generated with this protocol exhibit a defined forebrain regional identity, characterized by the rostral markers FOXG1 and OTX2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). On day 10, the flattened clusters were enzymatically dissociated into single cells and seeded at a density of 1.5 million cells/cm² for expansion. It is crucial to maintain a high density at these early passages to enhance cell survival and promote the reformation of small neural rosette structures. The NRSCs were cultured for 3 days before being passaged again at a density of 1.5 million cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. This process was repeated 3 times to obtain a homogeneous population of rosette-forming NRSCs, and to establish the NRSC line, which can subsequently be passaged at lower seeding densities of down to 0.5 million cells/cm<sup>2</sup> for up to 12 passages, while preserving their defining characteristics and regional identity. NRSCs could be dissociated into single cells and cryopreserved, with an average viability above 80% upon thawing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Suppl. Fig. 1A</xref>). This simplified approach demonstrates the generation of highly pure and expandable NRSCs within just 10 days.</p>

<title>Reproducibility of NRSC line generation and maintenance of homogeneity across passaging</title>
<p>The ability to generate stable and comparable NSC lines through multiple passages is essential for the feasibility of large-scale manufacturing. We evaluated the reproducibility of our differentiation protocol by establishing two distinct neural rosette-forming NSC lines from the same parental hPSC line. Both NRSC lines exhibited morphologically similar characteristics, primarily comprising small, proliferating rosette-forming NSCs that could be expanded for at least 12 passages (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Suppl. Fig. 2A</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The neural rosettes displayed small, centralized lumens, confirmed by TJP1 positivity of the neural rosette lumen, as well as a radial organization, with NSCs expressing the markers NES and SOX2. Assessment of the TJP1+ rosette lumens demonstrated that the NRSC populations consistently reformed rosettes throughout passaging. This pattern was maintained at least until passage 12, when we concluded the NRSC expansions. The NRSCs proliferated at a rate of approximately every 3-4 days (data not shown).</p>
<p>Moreover, our NRSCs were positive for the anterior identity markers FOXG1 and OTX2, along with PAX6, collectively indicating their forebrain identity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Suppl. Fig. 2B</xref>). Across passages 2 to 12, no significant changes were detected in the proportion of positive cells for FOXG1, OTX2, or PAX6, as determined by immunofluorescence. This was further validated by flow cytometry, which revealed that OTX2+ cells constituted over 95% of the population from passages 2 to 12, while PAX6+ cells exceeded 90%. Additionally, the early neuroepithelial marker SOX1 was present in over 88% of cells, and SOX2 positivity remained above 89% at passage 12 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>To further assess reproducibility across different hPSC lines, we applied the same 10-day differentiation protocol (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) to another hESC line. The results demonstrated that rosette- forming NRSC cultures with consistent morphological and immunocytochemical characteristics could be derived from different hPSC lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Suppl. Fig.3</xref>). These findings indicate that our protocol reliably and consistently generates stable and pure NRSC populations that retain their identity over extended passages.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Transcriptomic analysis reveals stability and forebrain identity of NRSCs during passaging</title>
<p>We proceeded to analyze our NRSCs at the transcriptomic level. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA- seq) was conducted at both passage 2 and passage 8 to investigate cellular identity and any potential changes occurring during passaging.</p>
<p>The expression levels of the common NSC markers <italic>SOX2</italic>, <italic>NES</italic>, and <italic>DACH1</italic>, remained relatively stable between passages 2 and 8 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). However, <italic>PAX6</italic> expression decreased by approximately 25% from passage 2 to passage 8 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), a finding that did not correlate with the flow cytometry and immunofluorescence data (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">C</xref>). A possible explanation for this discrepancy could be the negative autoregulation of <italic>PAX6</italic> expression, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Manuel <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). The high levels of <italic>DACH1</italic>, recognized as a marker of neural rosette progenitors <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Elkabetz <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>), further confirmed the identity of our NRSCs.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="656305v2_fig3.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>Next, we examined the regional identity of our NRSCs by assessing the expression of <italic>FOXG1</italic> and <italic>OTX2</italic>, which collectively confirm the forebrain identity of our NRSCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). The expression levels of these anterior markers appeared stable between passages 2 and 8, reinforcing a consistent forebrain identity. This stability is aligned with the immunofluorescence (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) and flow cytometry results (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Additionally, we observed consistent expression of <italic>TLE4</italic> and <italic>SOX5</italic>, both known to be present in the dorsal forebrain during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Azim <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Galazo, Sweetser and Macklis, 2023</xref>). In contrast, midbrain markers such as <italic>FOXA2</italic>, <italic>LMX1A</italic>, and <italic>EN1</italic> were absent in our NRSC cultures at both passages. Moreover, specific markers for the embryonic hindbrain, such as <italic>EGR2</italic> and <italic>GBX2</italic>, as well as the spinal cord markers <italic>HOXA2</italic>, <italic>HOXB4</italic>, and <italic>HOXC6</italic>, were not detected in our NRSCs. Interestingly, <italic>NKX2-2</italic>, primarily expressed in the ventral regions of the developing forebrain, was completely absent from our NRSC cultures. Furthermore, <italic>SHH</italic>, a marker for the ventral neural tube, was also absent, supporting the idea that our NRSCs corresponded to a dorsal forebrain identity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, it is notable that our NRSCs exhibit a remarkable regional purity, consisting almost entirely of dorsal forebrain NRSCs, with no contamination from other brain regions. Consistent examination of the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) plots for passages 2 and 8 revealed similar patterns, and integrating the datasets showed no major changes in the existing cell clusters (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>The clusters identified in the UMAP analyses were annotated based on the expression of known markers. A substantial proportion of NRSCs, cluster c1, expressed genes associated with common NSCs, including <italic>NES</italic>, <italic>SOX2</italic>, <italic>PAX6</italic>, <italic>OTX2</italic>, <italic>HES5</italic>, <italic>MSI1</italic>, <italic>TTYH1</italic>, <italic>PRDM16</italic>, <italic>VIM</italic>, <italic>MKI67</italic>, and <italic>PCNA</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">E</xref>, <bold>and </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Suppl. Fig. 4A</xref>). These NSC markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kaneko <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chuikov <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Zhang and Jiao, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Shimada <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kim <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>) facilitate the maintenance and differentiation of NSCs, whereas <italic>MKI67</italic> and <italic>PCNA</italic> are expressed by proliferating cells in the brain and other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Zhang and Jiao, 2015</xref>). This cluster represented 78% of the total cells at passage 2 and 77% at passage 8, demonstrating high purity and stability of our NRSC culture over multiple passages.</p>
<p>In addition to the NRSCs, we identified three major trajectories. Cluster c2 and c3 were associated with trajectories toward immature glutamatergic neuron differentiation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Cluster c2 expressed neural progenitor markers <italic>NEUROD1</italic> and <italic>NEUROG1</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Suppl. Fig. 4B</xref>). <italic>NEUROD1</italic> has been implicated in the fate specification of developing glutamatergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hevner <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>), while <italic>NEUROG1</italic> promotes glutamatergic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Reyes <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). In contrast, cluster c3 expressed more mature glutamatergic neuronal markers, including <italic>TBR1</italic>, <italic>EOMES</italic>, and <italic>SLC17A6</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Suppl. Fig. 4B</xref>). <italic>EOMES</italic> is recognized as a marker for intermediate progenitor cells committed to a glutamatergic fate, while <italic>TBR1</italic> is known to be expressed by all post-mitotic glutamatergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Englund <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hevner <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>), and <italic>SLC17A6</italic> serves as a well- established marker for glutamatergic axon terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Nakamura <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Cluster c4 was linked to trajectories toward immature GABAergic neuron differentiation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>), expressing progenitor markers <italic>ASCL1</italic>, <italic>NKX2.1</italic>, and <italic>DLX2</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Suppl. Fig. 4C</xref>). Both <italic>ASCL1</italic> and <italic>DLX2</italic> have been implicated in GABAergic neuron fate specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Casarosa, Fode and Guillemot, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Virolainen <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>), while <italic>NKX2.1</italic> is a marker of the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), giving rise to specific GABAergic neurons and glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Nóbrega-Pereira <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). This suggests that cluster c4 may represent a common progenitor for both GABAergic and glial trajectories. Cluster c5 was characterized by the presence of well-known GABAergic markers, including <italic>GAD1/2</italic> and <italic>DLX2</italic>.</p>
<p>Finally, clusters c6 and c7 comprised a glial progenitor pool characterized by <italic>GLIS3</italic>, <italic>NKX2.1</italic>, <italic>NR2F1/2</italic>, and <italic>WLS</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Suppl. Fig. 3D</xref>). Both c6 and c7 were enriched in <italic>GLIS3</italic>, a gene associated with the neuro-glial switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Van Bruggen <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Additionally, c6 expressed the oligodendrocyte lineage marker <italic>NKX2.1</italic>, while c7 exhibited high expression of <italic>NR2F1/2</italic> and <italic>WLS</italic>, which are crucial for glial commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Belgacem <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, these results indicate that our cell culture predominantly consists of a large pool of proliferating NRSCs with smaller populations differentiating into neural and glial lineages. Notably, it was possible to maintain these differentiating populations without significant changes over passages.</p>
<p>These findings demonstrate that our protocol reliably produces a highly pure population of proliferating dorsal forebrain NRSCs that maintain stable marker expression across several passages with minimal differentiation.</p>

<title>Neurogenic potential of forebrain NRSCs to differentiate into functional neurons</title>
<p>We investigated the ability of our forebrain NRSCs to differentiate into neurons. Notably, our NRSCs expressed the transcription factor gene <italic>GLI3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Suppl. Fig. 4A</xref>), which is crucial for the dorsal-ventral patterning in cooperation with SHH signaling in the forebrain, and regulates neuroepithelial cells in the dorsal telencephalon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fotaki, Price and Mason, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Quinn <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). In addition to SHH, gradients of FGF8 are essential for the development of medial and lateral forebrain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zelarayan <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>), while FGF10 is particularly important for the development of certain neuronal subtypes within the hypothalamus and interacts with SHH signaling pathways regulating forebrain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abler, Mansour and Sun, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>To induce differentiation, we cultured our NRSCs for a total of 8 days (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), beginning with exposure to SAG (Sonic Agonist) and recombinant SHH to activate the SHH signaling pathway and promote ventralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Belgacem <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). FGF8 and FGF10 were included to enhance regional patterning, guiding the cells toward a diencephalic identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Treier <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). On day 4, we inhibited Notch signaling by adding DAPT (tert-butyl (2S)-2-[[(2S)-2-[[2-(3,5- difluorophenyl)acetyl]amino]propanoyl]amino]-2-phenylacetate) to facilitate neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Louvi and Artavanis-Tsakonas, 2006</xref>).

<p>By day 8, significant morphological changes were observed and cells adopted common neuronal features with long axons observable via brightfield imaging (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). These immature neurons could be dissociated into single cells and cryopreserved, with an average viability above 80% upon thawing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Suppl. Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>scRNA-seq performed on day 8 characterized the cellular identities of our cryopreserved immature neurons after thawing. Analysis of 8,375 cells revealed the presence of immature glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in our cultures (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Predominantly, we identified proliferating neural progenitor cells (c1 and c2), marked by neural stem cell markers (NES) and proliferation markers (<italic>MKI67</italic> and <italic>PCNA</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Suppl. Fig. 5A</xref>). Cluster c3 represented neural progenitors positive for <italic>STMN2</italic>, <italic>ELAVL4</italic>, and <italic>GAD1</italic>, which transitioned into immature GABAergic neurons in clusters c4, c5, and c6. The GABAergic neurons expressed classic markers such as <italic>DLX2</italic>, <italic>GAD1/2</italic>, and <italic>SLC32A1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Virolainen <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; Zhou, Risold and Alvarez-Bolado, 2021) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Suppl.

Furthermore, c7 and c8 indicated a trajectory toward immature glutamatergic neurons, marked by <italic>STMN2</italic>, <italic>ELAVL4</italic>, <italic>RELN</italic>, <italic>ONECUT1</italic>, and the classic glutamatergic marker <italic>SLC17A6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Nakamura <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Suppl.

Notably, <italic>RELN</italic> has been shown to support glutamatergic synapse formation in the developing brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sasaki <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). Thus, by day 8, we observed a culture predominantly consisting of three major cell populations: <italic>NES<sup>+</sup>MKI67<sup>+</sup></italic> proliferating neural progenitors and two lineages of <italic>DCX<sup>+</sup></italic> progenitors differentiating into <italic>ELAVL4<sup>+</sup>GAD1<sup>+</sup></italic> GABAergic and <italic>ELAVL4<sup>+</sup>SLC17A6<sup>+</sup></italic> glutamatergic neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). This was corroborated by cell cycling analysis, where proliferating neural progenitors (c1 and c2) remained in a proliferative stage, while neurons exited the cell cycle and were in the G1 phase (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>).</p>
<p>The neuronal identity and morphology of the differentiated cells were further validated by immunofluorescence, which confirmed positive expression of pan-neuronal markers TUBB3, ELAV3/4, NeuN, and MAP2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). We also observed neuronal populations expressing markers associated with developing hypothalamic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kim <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; Zhou, Risold and Alvarez-Bolado, 2021) such as <italic>ONECUT2</italic>, <italic>LHX1/2/5/9</italic>, <italic>KLF7</italic>, <italic>FOXP2</italic>, <italic>MEIS1</italic>, and <italic>SIX3</italic> in the glutamatergic populations (clusters c7 and c8, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Suppl.

Fig. 6B</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, the scRNA-seq data provided a comprehensive characterization of the differentiated neurons, underscoring the capacity of our NRSCs to generate diverse neuronal populations.</p>
<p>To validate the functionality of our NRSC-derived neurons, we employed a high-density multi- electrode array system. On average, 5.1% (N=3) of electrodes were active from day 30 to day 110, with clusters exhibiting high firing rates indicative of active neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). Continuous spontaneous firing of the neurons was observed over time (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>). An axon tracking assay revealed four neurons on the chip, sharing a total axon length of 477.95 µm and conducting signals at a velocity of 0.504 m/s. Collectively, these results demonstrate the functional characteristics of our NRSC-derived neural progenitors.</p>
<p>In summary, our findings substantiate the potential to generate diverse and functional neuronal populations from our NRSCs. The successful differentiation and detailed characterization of these neurons highlights the applicability of NRSCs for <italic>in vitro</italic> production of functional neurons.</p>

<title>NRSCs retain the capacity to differentiate into astrocytes and oligodendrocytes</title>
<p>NSCs are defined by their ability to self-renew and differentiate into the three primary neural lineages: neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. The capacity for glial differentiation is a crucial criterion for validating multipotency.</p>
<p>To derive astrocytes from the NRSCs, we adopted a protocol based on Tcw et al. (2017), which identifies a commercial medium as an effective inducer of astrocyte differentiation from neural progenitor cells. Following this protocol, NRSCs were cultured in the commercial medium for 50 days, starting from the NRSC stage on day 0, leading to efficient conversion into astrocytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>).</p>

<p>During differentiation, the astrocytes gradually acquired a star-shaped morphology with minimal branching over the 50-day period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Suppl. Fig. 7A</xref>). A transient expression of Tenascin-C (TNC) was noted, with TNC<sup>+</sup> cells observed at day 20, which diminished substantially by day 50 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>), reflecting a common pattern in astrocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Faissner, Roll and Theocharidis, 2017</xref>). By day 50, we detected the astrocyte-specific markers GFAP and S100β (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>), and the fibrillar morphology characteristic of more mature astrocytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, we assessed the potential for oligodendrocyte differentiation using a protocol adapted from Gorris et al. (2015) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). This multi-stage differentiation protocol initiated with the activation of the SHH signaling pathway using SAG, promoting oligodendrocyte lineage commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Wang and Almazan, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Santos <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>).

<p>Beginning on day 14, Noggin was introduced to inhibit the BMP pathway, which is known to facilitate oligodendrocyte differentiation. Additionally, we supplemented the culture with triiodothyronine (T3) and ascorbic acid (AA) to promote myelination and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Santos <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). One week later, neurotrophin 3 (NT-3) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) were added to further stimulate myelination, along with laminin to support maturation and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Santos <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). The maturation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells continued until day 80 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>).</p>
<p>Morphological changes were monitored throughout this differentiation process. By day 80, characteristic features of oligodendrocytes, such as small cell bodies and multiple processes, were evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Suppl. Fig. 7B</xref>). The presence of oligodendrocyte-specific markers was evaluated, revealing clusters of cells positive for OLIG1/2 and SOX10 by day 62, alongside more mature markers like O4, GalC, and CNP by day 80, confirming the generation of oligodendrocytes in our cultures (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we present a new protocol for deriving homogeneous populations of expandable NRSCs. The NRSCs generated through our approach retain multipotency and stability over multiple passages. We confirm their multipotency by differentiating them into functional neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, showcasing their potential for diverse applications and potential for <italic>in vitro</italic> disease modeling, drug screening, and therapeutic interventions.</p>
<p>Our method addresses several limitations inherent in current NSC protocols, particularly the reliance on manual selection of neural rosettes, which represent challenges for scaling and manufacturing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Elkabetz <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Koch <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bohaciakova <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Recent developments aimed at eliminating manual selection, have often resulted in heterogeneous populations or instability during passaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Ebert <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Wen and Jin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fedorova <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). However, by integrating single SMAD inhibition with dynamic suspension culture, our protocol effectively removes the need for manual selection while maintaining high purity and stability, thereby streamlining the process for multiple applications. This approach facilitates a future transition into bioreactors to scale up the process.</p>
<p>Previous studies have indicated that NSCs tend to lose their regional identity <italic>in vitro</italic> over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Elkabetz <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Koch <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Ebert <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). Notably, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Koch et al. (2009)</xref> demonstrated a consistent decline in the expression of anterior markers such as OTX2 and FOXG1 after 2-10 passages. In contrast, our monitoring of FOXG1, OTX2, and PAX6, which are markers associated with anterior brain regions, showed stable expression for at least 12 passages, suggesting that our NRSCs maintain regional identity over time (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>The observed decrease in PAX6 mRNA expression, approximately 25% from passage 2 to passage 8, juxtaposed with stable protein levels detected via flow cytometry and immunofluorescence, may suggest a complex regulatory mechanism driving <italic>PAX6</italic> expression. One possible explanation is the phenomenon of negative autoregulation of PAX6, where increased levels of PAX6 protein feedback inhibit its own mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Manuel <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). This autoregulatory feedback loop can lead to a scenario where mRNA levels diminish while protein levels remain elevated due to translation efficiency or stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hsieh and Yang, 2009</xref>). As reported previously, during neurogenesis, PAX6 protein levels may not correlate linearly with mRNA levels, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hsieh and Yang, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Characterization of our NRSCs revealed high expression levels of genes associated with stemness and proliferation. However, we also encountered minor lineages of neural progenitor cells, including GABAergic and glutamatergic progenitors, as well as glial progenitors. While the NRSCs exhibited significant stemness, the differentiating cells were enriched in genes related to differentiation and maturation.</p>
<p>NSCs are inherently localized along the neural tube of the developing brain, each displaying distinct regional identities crucial for brain patterning and the formation of specific neuronal and glial cell types. Studies have indicated that rosette-forming NSCs, when cultured <italic>in vitro</italic>, can exhibit a re- specification from anterior identities toward more caudal fates, simulating the natural progression of neural tube morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Sasai and De Robertis, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Elkabetz <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Koch <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Ebert <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Meinhardt <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). For example, Elkabetz et al. describe how NSCs derived from embryonic stem cells undergo differentiation into a variety of region-specific neuronal fates, but they remain partially limited in their differentiation potential without appropriate instructive cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Elkabetz <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). This process highlights the intrinsic variability among NSCs, which can potentially lead to instability in the derived neurons and glial cells, presenting significant challenges for <italic>in vitro</italic> and therapeutic applications.</p>
<p>In contrast to this inherent variability, our protocol has yielded a population of highly pure FOXG1<sup>+</sup>OTX2<sup>+</sup>TLE4<sup>+</sup>SOX5<sup>+</sup> forebrain NRSCs that exhibit remarkable regional stability across multiple passages. This retained stability throughout cell passaging represents a novel characteristic of our NRSCs, potentially offering a more consistent platform for differentiation into specific neuronal lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lu, 2012</xref>). However, our observations need further research to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this stability, as our current insights are limited to 12 passages, and to better understand the transcriptional and environmental factors that may contribute to these observations.</p>
<p>The multipotency of NRSCs is a promising asset, as demonstrated by our ability to differentiate these cells into both neuronal and glial lineages, essential for developing cell-based models and therapies. Following the findings of Julia et al. (2017), we exposed NRSCs to a commercial medium for 50 days, generating GFAP+ and S100β+ astrocytes. Moreover, we adapted an established multi-stage protocol from Gorris et al. (2015) to differentiate NRSCs into lineage-specific oligodendrocytes marked by O4, GalC, and CNP. Additionally, our NRSCs differentiated into early glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, validated by scRNA-seq and functionality assessments using multi-electrode arrays. Our neuronal differentiation protocol aimed to generate forebrain neural progenitors. Our results suggest that we generated hypothalamic neural progenitors, denoted by markers such as <italic>DLX6-AS1</italic>, <italic>ARX</italic>, <italic>GAD2</italic>, <italic>FOXP2</italic>, <italic>LHX2</italic>, and <italic>SCL17A6</italic>, though our current findings are restricted to early neural progenitors. Future studies should focus on extended differentiation and comprehensive late-stage characterization to further explore hypothalamic neuronal specifications. Given the limited existing protocols for hypothalamic neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Merkle <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ozaki <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>), our NRSCs might provide a stable progenitor stage for generating hypothalamic neurons with reduced batch-to-batch variability. Future research should prioritize refining our protocol and further investigating the differentiation potential of NRSCs into specific neuronal subtypes.</p>
<p>Our NRSCs exhibit considerable differentiation potential, successfully generating pure populations of TUBB3+ neurons and early glial progenitor cells, including GFAP+ astrocytes and O4+ oligodendrocytes. This ability is critical, considering the potential of NSCs in regenerative medicine and their capacity to contribute to repair processes post-injury, underscoring their utility in therapeutic applications for neurodegenerative diseases and other neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Jimenez-Vergara <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, our results present an optimized protocol for generating highly pure NRSC populations, eliminating the need for manual rosette selection. Over multiple passages, the NRSCs consistently exhibited positivity for NSC markers such as NES and SOX2, with minimal presence of contaminating cells. Furthermore, they retained their differentiation capability into astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and functional neurons. The protocol presented here for generating NRSC populations provides a reliable framework for advancing NSC applications in disease modeling and drug screening, as well as facilitating the exploration of their therapeutic potential in neurological diseases. This work addresses a critical gap in current methodologies, promoting the large-scale generation of pure NSC populations essential for future research and therapeutic interventions.</p>

<p>The studies outlined in this manuscript were conducted in accordance with ethical guidelines and are covered by the following Danish ethical permits: H-20056277 and H-23039171 (De Videnskabsetiske Komiteer for Region Hovedstaden) for forebrain neural differentiation. hESCs lines (NOVOe001-A and E1C3 NN GMP0050E1C3) were used for several experiments conducted in this study. hESCs were cultured in Nutristem® (Sartorius: 05-100-1A) supplemented with 0,2% penicillin streptomycin (Gibco: 15140-122) in plates or flasks coated with laminin-521 (Biolamina: LN521-05). Medium was changed daily, and cells were passaged every 3-4 day before reaching 90% confluency. When passaging, the cells would first be washed with PBS-/- (GibcoTM: 14190-094) and then dissociated with TrypLETM Select (GibcoTM: 12563011) for 5-7 min at 37° C. After 5-7 min, TrypLE (GibcoTM: 12563011) was removed, and cells were resuspended immediately in Nutri supplemented with 0,2% PenStrep and Y-27632 (FujiFilm: 257-00614). The cells were counted in Nucleocounter (chemometec: NC-200) and diluted appropriately and seeded at densities of 150.000-350.000 cells/cm2. The media was changed the next day to remove Y-27632 (FujiFilm: 257- 00614). Cells were kept in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2. Daily assessments of cell morphology were conducted in brightfield microscope. Representative images of NOVOe001-A can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Supplemental Figure 8</xref>.</p>

<title>Differentiation of hESCs into NRSCs</title>
<p>NRSCs were differentiated from hESCs by dissociating hESCs with TrypLE<sup>TM</sup> select (Gibco<sup>TM</sup>: 12563011) and resuspending them in NutriStem (Sartorius: 05-100-1A) supplemented with Y-27632 (FujiFilm: 257-00614) and 50 µM RepSox (Tocris: 3742). In a 12-well format, 200 000 cells were seeded in each well and kept static for 24 hours. The next day the media was changed into DMEM/F12 GlutaMAX supplement (Gibco: 31331-028), supplemented with 0,2% penicillin streptomycin (Gibco: 15140-122), 1% N2 supplement CTS (Gibco<sup>TM</sup>: A1370701) and 50 µM RepSox (Tocris: 3742) and the cells were placed on a Multi-bio 3D mini shaker (Biosan) at 40 rpm; 15 sec. (orbital), 5 degrees; 3 sec. (vibration) and reciprocal setting, until Day 6 to form clusters. Half the media was changed daily. Clusters were collected on Day 6 and analyzed in a BioRep (BioRep diabetes: ICC4-115/230) to determine concentration and size. Then seeded in 2D on laminin-coated (Sigma: L2020) plates, where media was changed daily. At Day 10 neural rosettes would be visible. To establish a NRSC-line we passaged and cultured the cells 3-4 times in media consisting of DMEM/F12 GlutaMAX supplement (Gibco: 31331-028), supplemented with 0,2% penicillin streptomycin (Gibco: 15140-122), 1% N2 supplement CTS (Gibco<sup>TM</sup>: A1370701), 1‰ B27 Supplement (Gibco<sup>TM</sup>: A33535-01), 10 µg/L EGF (R&amp;D systems: 236-EG) and 10 µg/L bFGF (PeproTech: 100-18B).

The cells were incubated with LIVE/DEAD™ Fixable Near- IR viability dye (1:1000, Invitrogen: L10119) for 15 min at room temperature, protected from light, to identify dead cells. Subsequently, the cells underwent a single wash in Wash buffer (PBS-/- (Gibco<sup>TM</sup>: 14190-094) supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin (Miltenyi Biotec: 130-091-376) followed by centrifugation (400xg for 10 min). The cells were fixed and permeabilized using the Transcription Factor Buffer Set (BD Pharmingen: 562574) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For each intracellular staining, 250 000 fixed cells were pelleted by centrifugation (800xg for 3 minutes) and then incubated with a cocktail of conjugated antibodies (see detailed list below) diluted in Perm/Wash buffer for 30 minutes at +4°C. After incubation, the cells were washed twice with Perm/Wash buffer, pelleted by centrifugation (800xg for 3 minutes), and finally resuspended in Wash buffer. Prior to acquisition on a BD FACSymphony A5 flow cytometer, the cells were filtered through a 40-µm MultiScreen-MESH Filter Plate (Millipore: MANMN4010). 20,000 live single cells were acquired per sample. Compensation was achieved using UltraComp eBeads™ Plus Compensation Beads (Invitrogen: 01-3333-42) and the ArC Amine Reactive Compensation Bead Kit (Invitrogen: A10346).

<title>Single cell RNA sequencing</title>
<p>scRNA-seq of NSC and neuronal cultures was conducted using the 10X Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kit version 3.1 protocol. Libraries were prepared with unique molecular index (UMI) barcoding, amplified, and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform. The resulting sequence reads underwent processing using the Cell Ranger pipeline (v7.1, 10X Genomics). The preprocessing steps included quality control, alignment, filtering, barcode counting, and UMI counting. Specifically, reads were aligned to the human reference genome GRCh38 (Ensembl release 107) following Cell Ranger’s standard workflow. The resulting feature-barcode matrices were subjected to further analysis using R (v4.2) and the Seurat package (v5). Initial quality control involved filtering cells based on two criteria: (1) the number of detected genes (nFeature_RNA) within the range of 1000 to 10 000 and (2) a mitochondrial read percentage of less than 10%. For samples P2 and P8, integration was carried out to correct for batch effects utilizing Seurat’s canonical correlation analysis (CCA) approach, while NRSC samples were processed using a standard merge workflow without batch correction. Following normalization, cell cycle scoring was implemented using Seurat’s built-in cell cycle markers, with subsequent regression of cell cycle effects during data scaling to mitigate cell cycle-associated variation. Dimensionality reduction was achieved through principal component analysis (PCA), followed by UMAP for visualization. Graph-based clustering was performed to discern distinct cell populations. Differential expression analysis between clusters was conducted using Seurat’s FindAllMarkers function. Cluster identification was achieved through the integration of known literature markers and differentially expressed genes. Visualizations were created using the Seurat, scCustomize, and ggplot2 packages in R.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors aimed to develop a fully scalable, feeder-free protocol for deriving dorsal forebrain neural rosette stem cells (NRSCs) from human pluripotent stem cells, eliminating the need for manual rosette isolation. Using dynamic suspension culture combined with single-SMAD inhibition (RepSox), they sought to generate FOXG1⁺/OTX2⁺ NRSCs within ten days and expand them through at least twelve passages while retaining regional identity. They also aimed to demonstrate the cells' capacity to differentiate into functional neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes under defined conditions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A key strength is the elimination of labour-intensive manual rosette picking, which significantly reduces operator variability and enhances throughput. The authors provide diverse validation in the form of flow cytometry showing &gt;95% OTX2⁺ over passages 2-12, immunocytochemistry, single-cell RNA-seq, and functional MEA recordings, confirming both regional fidelity and neuronal activity. They also demonstrate glial differentiation and reproducibility across two hESC lines.</p>
<p>The results convincingly demonstrate that the RepSox/suspension approach yields high-purity dorsal forebrain neural progenitor cells (NRSCs) that maintain marker expression and multipotency through passage 12 and differentiate into electrophysiologically active neurons and mature glia. Thus, the authors have achieved their primary objectives.</p>
<p>This protocol addresses a significant bottleneck in neural stem cell production by providing a reproducible, high-throughput alternative that is well-suited to drug screening, disease modelling, and potential cell therapy manufacturing. Standardised, scalable NRSC banks will accelerate neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorder studies, enable automated bioreactor workflows, and encourage the sharing of resources across academia and industry.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Weaknesses include a lack of direct comparison to conventional manual-selection protocols, and the need to improve the statistical rigor of all quantitative assays by applying appropriate hypothesis tests (e.g., t-tests or ANOVA with multiple-comparison correction) rather than reporting mean {plus minus} SD alone.</p>
<p>Additional Context:</p>
<p>Beyond the core technical advance, it's important to situate this work within the broader landscape of neural stem cell research and its downstream applications. Traditionally, dorsal forebrain NSCs have been generated via manual rosette picking after dual-SMAD inhibition (Chambers et al., 2009), a process that is labor-intensive, low-throughput, and prone to operator-dependent variability. By eliminating that step, this protocol directly addresses a key barrier to standardizing NSC production under GMP-compatible conditions - critical for both large-scale drug screening and eventual clinical use. Stable, regionally specified forebrain NSCs are especially valuable for modeling early neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, microcephaly) and late-onset pathologies (e.g., Alzheimer's disease) in vitro, where precise cortical patterning is essential to recapitulate disease phenotypes. Moreover, establishing long-term epigenetic fidelity (e.g., via future ATAC-seq or histone-mark profiling) will further reassure users that transcriptional consistency reflects preserved regulatory networks, not just transient marker expression. Finally, demonstrating robust cryopreservation viability (&gt;80%) makes these cells a readily shareable resource for the community, accelerating cross-lab reproducibility and comparative studies of patient-derived iPSC lines. This context underscores how scalable, high-purity forebrain NSCs can transform both basic neuroscience research and translational pipelines.</p>

<p>In the present manuscript, Dannulat Frazier et al. provide a novel and advanced protocol for obtaining almost pure populations of neural rosette stem cells (NRSCs) expressing the general markers NES and SOX2. These NSCs are expandable and exhibit dorsal forebrain properties and markers that are maintained throughout passages in culture (at least until passage 12). The authors also demonstrate the multipotency of these NSCs by their ability to differentiate into functional neurons, and precursors of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.</p>
<p>This method does not require the usual step of manual rosette selection and allows a greater homogeneity of the NSCs obtained and the standardization of the protocol, which will allow greater advances in the applications of these NSCs in research and as models of disease or compound testing. The manuscript is of great interest for the research area, since it describes a new methodology that can facilitate the research and therapeutic application of NSCs.</p>
<p>The manuscript is well-written; the results are clear, robust, and well-explained. The conclusions reached in this paper are well-supported by the data, but some aspects could be better clarified.</p>
<p>(1) The results presented in the present manuscript of the NSCS are performed up to passage 12; it would be interesting to know up to which passages these cells can be expanded, maintaining their initial properties. Have the authors analyzed passages beyond 12?</p>
<p>(2) In Figure 2A, where different markers are shown in NSCs at different passages, it seems that at passage 12, there is a decrease in TJP1+ zones in relation to earlier passages, which could indicate a reduction in the potential to generate rosettes. Have the authors done any quantification along these lines? Could this be the case, or is it just an effect of the image chosen?</p>
<p>(3) In Figure 3A, it is very striking and intriguing that the decrease in the expression of the PAX6 gene in passage 8 in relation to passage 2, which does not correspond to what is observed at the protein level. Have the authors verified this result using another technique, such as for example RT-q-PCR?</p>
<p>(4) In Figure 5B, the labeling for GFAP, appears rather nuclear, despite being a cytoskeleton protein. How can the authors explain this?</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer</bold> <bold>#1</bold> <bold>(Public</bold> <bold>review):</bold></p>
<p>Thank you for your thoughtful and constructive feedback on our manuscript. We greatly appreciate your insights regarding our work, as they are invaluable in refining our research.</p>
<p>We are very happy to hear that you recognize the strengths of our method, particularly the elimination of manual rosette picking, which significantly enhances throughput and reduces variability. We are also pleased that our validation efforts—through flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, single-cell RNA-sequencing, and functional MEA recordings—effectively demonstrate both the identity and functionality of our derived dorsal forebrain neural rosette stem cells (NRSCs).</p>
<p>Regarding the identified weaknesses, we agree that a direct comparison with conventional manual-selection protocols, specifically those utilizing dual-SMAD inhibition, would be a significant improvement. To address this, we have initiated additional experiments that will directly compare our single-SMAD inhibition approach (RepSox) with dual-SMAD inhibition (SB/LDN), aiming for a comprehensive evaluation of both protocols.</p>
<p>In terms of statistical rigor, we appreciate your suggestion on improving our quantitative assays. All data were collected from at least three independent experiments and presented as mean ±standard deviation unless otherwise specified. Due to the qualitative nature of the data, no formal statistical tests were performed for most of the experiments and the mean and standard deviation were calculated for some quantitative measurements obtained, providing a descriptive summary of the data. When possible, we will incorporate appropriate statistical tests, to present our data in a more robust manner, rather than merely reporting mean ± SD.</p>
<p>Finally, we recognize the importance of situating our work within the broader landscape of neural stem cell research. We aim to elucidate the potential downstream applications for our protocol, which we believe will significantly impact neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorder studies.</p>
<p>Thank you again for your valuable suggestions. We look forward to refining our manuscript and enhancing the contribution of our research to the field.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer</bold> <bold>#2</bold> <bold>(Public</bold> <bold>review):</bold></p>
<p>Thank you for your thoughtful and constructive feedback on our manuscript. We appreciate your recognition of the novelty and potential impact of our protocol for obtaining neural rosette stem cells (NRSCs). Your comments are invaluable in improving our work.</p>
<p>We are pleased that you found our methodology to be a significant advancement in the field, particularly the elimination of the manual rosette selection step, which hopefully will enhance homogeneity and standardization. We agree that this development has implications for research, disease modelling, and compound testing.</p>
<p>Regarding your specific points:</p>
<p>Passage expansion: Thank you for your insightful suggestion regarding the analysis beyond passage 12. We have continued passaging our NRSC line for more than 12 passages while maintaining the rosette structure. Although we do not yet have comprehensive and detailed analyses at these later passages, we will include some data and relevant information on our findings in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>TJP1+ zones: We appreciate your observation regarding the decreased TJP1+ zones at passage 12. We have not consistently detected a reduction in the number of rosettes or TJP1+ lumens across our cultures between passages. While some variability has been noted, we occasionally observe minor reductions at specific time points, followed by a recovery of rosettes in subsequent passages. This suggests that monitoring the number of rosettes is indeed a useful indicator of cell culture health. Cultures should be discarded if rosettes are completely lost. We will take a closer look at this aspect and report the findings in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>PAX6 Gene expression verification: Thank you for highlighting the discrepancy between PAX6 gene expression levels and protein levels. Unfortunately, we have not yet validated these results using an alternative technique. One potential explanation for this discrepancy may be the phenomenon of negative autoregulation, where increased levels of PAX6 protein can inhibit its own mRNA expression (Manuel et al., 2007). Moreover, Hsieh and Yang (2009) observed that during neurogenesis, PAX6 protein levels may not correlate linearly with mRNA levels, particularly in variable cellular environments. Additionally, post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, such as translation initiation mediated by Internal Ribosome Entry Sites (IRES), have been documented in various contexts involving PAX6, suggesting that mRNA levels may not fully represent functional protein levels in developing tissues (Li et al., 2023). We will go deeper into this discussion in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>GFAP Labeling: We appreciate your comments regarding the nuclear labeling of GFAP. In our astrocyte cultures, we have indeed observed GFAP localization in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Figure 5B). We will investigate this phenomenon further and provide a clearer explanation, supported by relevant literature, in the revised version. Although GFAP is primarily categorized as an intermediate filament protein localized in the cytoplasm, evidence suggests its nuclear localization may indicate additional regulatory roles during astrocyte development, activation, and pathology. This finding highlights the potential complexity of GFAP's role during fetal development and cellular stress, suggesting a broader functional scope that may extend into the nuclear space.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you for your insightful feedback and for recognizing the potential of our research. We are committed to addressing your comments and enhancing the quality of our manuscript.</p>
