<title>Abstract</title><p>Effective mucosal immunity in the intestine involves a fine balance between tolerance of the microbiome, recognition and elimination of pathogens, and inflammatory tissue injury. The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 regulates these processes in the intestines of mice and humans; the anti-inflammatory activity of IL10 is also conserved in birds. To determine the function of IL10 in avian mucosal immunity, we generated germ line modifications of the chicken <italic>IL10</italic> locus to abolish or reduce IL10 expression. <italic>In vitro</italic> analysis of macrophage response to lipopolysaccharide confirmed the loss of IL10 protein expression, the lack of dosage compensation in heterozygotes, and prevention of autocrine inhibition of nitric oxide production in homozygous IL10 knockout macrophages. IL10-deficiency significantly altered the composition of the caecal microbiome, but unlike IL10-deficient mice and humans, IL10-deficient chickens did not exhibit spontaneous colitis. Following experimental challenge with <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium or <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic> in IL10-deficient chickens, enhanced clearance of the pathogens was associated with elevated transcription of pro-inflammatory genes and increased infiltration of inflammatory cells into gut mucosa. In IL10-deficient chickens challenged with the parasite <italic>Eimeria tenella,</italic> pathogen clearance was accelerated but caecal lesions were more severe and weight gain was compromised. Neither the heterozygous IL10 knockout nor a homozygous IL10 enhancer mutation had a major effect on pathogen clearance or inflammation in any of the challenge models. Our findings highlight the intrinsic compromise in mucosal immune response and have important implications for the development of strategies to combat avian and zoonotic pathogens in poultry.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Elimination of potential pathogens by the innate and acquired immune systems involves an intrinsic compromise between host protection and tissue injury that requires mechanisms to control the nature, magnitude, duration and specificity of effector pathways. A key component of specificity is the capacity to distinguish between pathogens and the commensal microbiome, and nowhere is this challenge more pressing than in the intestine. The anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin 10 (IL10), has long been recognized as an essential feedback regulator of intestinal inflammation in mammals (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]). IL10-deficient mice generated by homologous recombination developed spontaneous enterocolitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Subsequent studies revealed that components of the intestinal microbiome were essential to development of pathology and determined the extent and location of lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. In humans, homozygous mutations in genes encoding IL10 or its receptor, IL10RA, have been associated with early-onset inflammatory bowel disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>].</p>
<p>In mammals, IL10 is produced by both myeloid and T and B lymphoid cells following activation by immune stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>], with subtle differences between mice and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. In the specific context of the intestine, conditional deletion of the <italic>IL10</italic> and <italic>IL10RA</italic> genes in mice indicated that production of the ligand by macrophages was not required for pathology, consistent with T cells being the major source of intestinal IL10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. By contrast, macrophage-specific deletion of the <italic>IL10RA</italic> gene encoding the IL10 receptor was sufficient to elicit spontaneous colitis in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. The contribution of IL10 to feedback modulation of host defense is not restricted to the gut. There have been countless studies of the impact of IL10 deficiency in mouse parasite, bacterial, fungal and viral disease models (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]). The primary focus of these studies has been on the mitigation of immunopathology by IL10, with less attention given to pathogen elimination. By contrast to studies in mice, analysis of the quantitative importance of IL10 in other species has been largely correlative. Both ligand and receptor are conserved in vertebrates, and zebrafish has been discussed as a model for understanding IL10 biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Here we focus on the chicken, both a model vertebrate and an economically important livestock species.</p>
<p>The original cloning and sequencing of chicken <italic>IL10</italic> cDNA and genomic DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>] described the immunomodulatory activity of the recombinant protein on T cell production of interferon-gamma (IFNŒ≥), its regulated expression in T cells and macrophages <italic>in vitro</italic>, and increased mRNA expression during parasite (<italic>Eimeria maxima</italic>) infection. Like the mammalian transcript, chicken <italic>IL10</italic> mRNA contains multiple copies of the AUUUA instability motif in the 3‚Äô-untranslated region (UTR). We and others have provided evidence that quantitative variation in IL10 production may contribute to inter-individual or inter-breed variation in infectious disease susceptibility in chickens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. To test this hypothesis directly, and more generally to determine the conservation of IL10 biological function across vertebrates, we have generated germ line modifications of the chicken <italic>IL10</italic> locus that abolish or reduce IL10 expression. We describe the lack of dosage compensation in heterozygous mutation, and present evidence that the reduced expression of IL10 leads to increased pathogen clearance at the expense of increased inflammation.</p>

<title>Generation of IL10-deficient chickens</title>
<p>The emergence of CRISPR/Cas9 technology and the ability to culture, cryopreserve, genetically modify and subsequently transfer chicken primordial germ cells (PGCs) into sterile surrogate host embryos has expedited the analysis of gene function in the chick (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]). We used this approach to edit the <italic>IL10</italic> locus in chicken PGCs and create two independent lines of IL10-deficient chickens (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). We first created an IL10 knockout (IL10KO) line by introducing a premature in-frame stop codon in exon 1 of the <italic>IL10</italic> gene in chicken PGCs, 75 bp downstream of the start codon (C26&gt;*; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">D</xref>, and SI Appendix, Figure S1). To generate a potential expression hypomorph, we created an IL10-Enhancer knockout (IL10EnKO) line by deleting a 533-bp genomic fragment encompassing a non-coding sequence located approximately 2.3-2.8 kb upstream of the <italic>IL10</italic> transcription start site, in chicken PGCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-C</xref> and SI Appendix, Figure S2). This sequence was targeted based upon alignment of sequences from multiple avian species that identified a core of 300 bp with conservation around 85%, containing perfectly conserved motifs for known transcriptional regulators, including AP1, FOXP3 and members of the NFAT/ETS family (SI Appendix, Figure S3). The size and species conservation of this element resembles the well-characterized intronic enhancer of the <italic>Csf1r</italic> locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>].</p>

<title>Confirmation of the IL10 mutation in bone marrow-derived macrophages</title>
<p>Chicken bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) cultured in recombinant macrophage colony-stimulating factor respond to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by secreting IL10 that can be detected by ELISA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. The autocrine function of IL10 in this assay was demonstrated by the addition of neutralizing anti-IL10 antibody, which amplified the expression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) and production of nitric oxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> confirms the release of IL10 by LPS-stimulated BMDMs derived from WT embryos and the complete absence of detectable IL10 release by BMDMs derived from IL10KO HOM embryos. The absence of IL10 was associated with a significant increase in nitric oxide production that was not additive with the impact of added anti-IL10 antibody (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Since IL10 mediates feedback control it is conceivable that the loss of one functional allele could be compensated by increased expression from the other allele. However, we found that expression of IL10 was reduced by up to 50% in BMDMs derived from IL10KO HET embryos, with a corresponding partial impact on nitric oxide production (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-B</xref>). The impact of the IL10EnKO HOM mutation was more variable between samples in both assays, but consistent with a partial expression hypomorph (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-B</xref>).</p>

<p>Spontaneous colitis in <italic>Il10</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice is associated with and dependent upon dysbiosis in the intestinal microbiome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. We compared the caecal microbiome of IL10KO WT and HOM birds at 4 weeks of age using 16S rDNA V3-V4 hypervariable amplicon sequencing as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. The caecal microbiome of both genotypes was dominated by the phylum <italic>Firmicutes</italic> (SI Appendix, Figure S5A) and the most abundant genera were <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic> (SI Appendix, Figure S5B). Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) Effect Size (LEfSe) analysis showed enrichment of the phylum <italic>Firmicutes</italic> and the genera <italic>Defluviitaleaceae_UCG-011</italic> and <italic>Paludicola</italic> in the IL10KO HOM group, while the phylum <italic>Bacteroidota</italic> and the genera <italic>Alistipes</italic> and <italic>UCG_008</italic> were enriched in the WT group (SI Appendix, Figure S5C). Principal component analyses showed clear separation of the microbial communities based on beta diversity (SI Appendix, Figure S5D, R¬≤ = 0.25, <italic>P</italic> = 0.017). These findings confirm that mucosal IL10 regulates the composition of the chicken microbiome.</p>
<p>To evaluate a potential environmental impact on the phenotype of IL10-deficient birds, a cohort of IL10KO WT and HOM birds was hatched and raised in the NARF conventional avian facility. IL10KO HOM birds remained healthy in that environment as they aged. Post-growth hatch rates were comparable between IL10KO WT and HOM hens, with the exception of a marginal effect on growth that resolved with age (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>); there was also no evidence of overt intestinal pathology in IL10KO HOM birds compared to WT controls (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Cellular infiltration scores were however significantly higher in the duodenum and proximal colon of both IL10KO WT and HOM birds raised in the conventional facility as opposed to the SPF environment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>).</p>
<p>Two important differences exist between the IL10KO mouse and chicken models. Firstly, the birds are outbred. Most mouse studies are conducted on an inbred background and the impact of the <italic>IL10</italic> mutation is strain-specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Secondly, chickens in the NARF conventional avian facility are routinely immunised against major avian pathogens (SI Appendix, Table S2). The original analysis of IL10-deficient mice revealed little impact on T cell-dependent antibody responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. We measured antibody titres in 29-weeks old IL10KO WT and HOM birds raised in the NARF conventional facility for 7 of the pathogens that the birds were vaccinated against (SI Appendix, Figure S6): avian encephalomyelitis virus (AEV), chicken anaemia virus (CAV), duck adenovirus (the agent of egg drop syndrome, EDS), infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV), and Newcastle disease virus (NDV). The administration schedule, nature and delivery mode of these vaccines is summarised in SI Appendix, Table S2.</p>
<p>Statistical analyses revealed differences in vaccine response between IL10KO WT and HOM birds. Antibody titres to AEV and IBDV were significantly lower in IL10KO HOM birds compared to WT controls, whereas those to EDS and IBV were significantly higher in IL10KO HOM birds compared to WT controls (SI Appendix, Figure S6). AEV and IBDV vaccination were carried out with live vaccines delivered in the drinking water, whereas EDS and the last dose of IBV vaccination were done with inactivated vaccines given by intramuscular injection (SI Appendix, Table S2). Antibody titres to CAV, ILTV and NDV were not significantly different between IL10KO HOM birds and WT controls (SI Appendix, Figure S6).</p>

Similarly, IL10-deficient C57BL/6J mice exhibited severe inflammation in the caecum and colon upon <italic>C. jejuni</italic> infection, whereas congenic wild-type mice were persistently colonised in the absence of gut pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>].

However, this was not sustained and by 2-weeks post-infection all groups had caecal colonisation at &gt;9 log<sub>10</sub> CFU g<sup>-1</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). In the second cohort, median counts were not statistically different between IL10KO WT and HOM birds at 1-week post-infection, but caecal colonisation decreased by ‚àº2 log<sub>10</sub> CFU g<sup>-1</sup> in IL10KO HOM birds at 2-weeks post-infection relative to WT birds (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). The IL10KO HET birds did not differ significantly from WT in either cohort (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Histopathological analysis revealed that the caecal mucosa of IL10KO HOM birds presents with significantly increased numbers of lymphocytes and plasma cells, admixed with infiltrating heterophils, when compared to WT and IL10KO HET birds in both cohorts (SI Appendix, Figures S7 and S8). To confirm the apparent hyperinflammatory response in IL10KO HOM birds, we used multiplex quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR) to measure expression of immunity-related genes in the caecum, as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>].

The regulatory function of IL10 is especially important in preventing inappropriate responses to the intestinal microbiome with the potential to drive spontaneous enterocolitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Here we have generated two <italic>IL10</italic> mutations in the chicken genome, a definitive knockout and a putative enhancer mutation. Notwithstanding the development of robust technologies based upon CRISPR/Cas9, the development of models of immune deficiency in chickens remains time consuming and logistically challenging, and relatively few informative mutations have been generated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. The enhancer mutation was intended to generate a quantitative impact on IL10 expression to model selection for reduced expression in production lines of birds. Based upon the mouse <italic>Il10</italic><sup>-/-</sup> phenotype, we also anticipated a possible severe post-hatch failure to thrive due to spontaneous colitis in IL10KO HOM chicks. An unexpected outcome was the discovery that the IL10KO in chicken is not dosage compensated, therefore the HET provides a second model of the impact of reduced expression. In overview, neither the IL10KO HET nor the IL10EnKO HOM had a large effect on pathogen clearance or inflammation in either of the challenge models, indicating that IL10 biology is not highly sensitive to changes in expression of the magnitude that has been detected in individual lines of commercial broilers and layers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>].</p>
<p>Detailed analysis of the IL10KO HOM birds in SPF or conventional avian facilities revealed no evidence of spontaneous intestinal inflammation or compromised body weight gain, and only a small and inconsistent effect on specific antibody responses to routine live or inactivated vaccines. Since spontaneous colitis in mice depends upon resident enteric bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], it is possible that the difference compared to the rodent models lies in the nature of the chicken intestinal microbiome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>], in which case the changes that we observed in the microbiome of IL10KO HOM chicks may serve to mitigate potential spontaneous intestinal pathology. In any case, the results indicate that deletion of IL10 from the genome or selection in favour of low IL10 expression alleles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>] need not necessarily affect production traits.</p>
<p>In both the bacterial challenge models, and in the <italic>Eimeria</italic> challenge, the response of IL10KO HOM bird highlights for the first time in a non-rodent species the compromise between pathogen elimination and pathology. Accelerated pathogen clearance is associated with increased inflammatory gene expression and local inflammation, and in the case of <italic>Eimeria</italic>, reduced body weight gain. The models we have chosen are not lethal and there is effective pathogen clearance even in WT birds. Findings with <italic>Campylobacter</italic> in IL10KO HOM birds are consistent with elevated intestinal inflammation in a broiler breed with relatively low IL10 expression, albeit a significant reduction in caecal colonisation relative to breeds with higher IL10 expression was not observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. While the caecal load of <italic>C. jejuni</italic> was markedly reduced in IL10KO HOM birds at most intervals examined, some inconsistency existed in the timepoints when the reduction reached statistical significance between cohorts, likely as a consequence of inter-animal variation. This is typical of <italic>C. jejuni</italic> colonisation in chickens, where bacterial population structures have been reported to be variable and unpredictable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. Similar variation between time intervals, birds and repeated experiments has been reported when evaluating vaccines against <italic>C. jejuni</italic> colonisation (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]). In mammals, <italic>Salmonella</italic> has been reported to gain a competitive advantage from intestinal inflammation, both owing to availability of tetrathionate that <italic>Salmonella</italic> can uniquely use as a respiratory electron acceptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>] and remodelling of the indigenous microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. It is unclear if <italic>Salmonella</italic> derives the same benefits during colonisation of the avian intestine and the counts of viable bacteria recovered from the caeca of WT and IL10KO HOM birds can only be interpreted as the balance of bacterial growth and killing.</p>
<p>Our results with <italic>Eimeria</italic> are relevant to commercial studies aimed at targeting IL10 to mitigate disease. Coccidiosis has been estimated to exert costs in excess of ¬£10 billion every year to the chicken production industry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>], with <italic>E. tenella</italic> among the most common and pathogenic species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. Feeding neutralizing anti-IL10 antibody to chickens during <italic>Eimeria</italic> infection was reported to mitigate reduced body weight gain (BWG) but had an inconsistent impact on parasite replication and pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]. Similarly, feeding antibody to IL10 receptor 2 (but not receptor 1) reduced lost BWG, but had no effect on oocyst shedding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. Feeding chickens genetically modified corn (<italic>Zea mays</italic>) expressing IL10 improved BWG and reduced oocyst shedding and caecal lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]. These results are consistent with the phenotypes associated with a reduction, rather than complete absence, of IL10 observed here.</p>
<p>Given the excessive inflammatory activation we observed in non-lethal infections, and the literature in mice, IL10KO HOM birds or hypomorphs might be hyper-sensitive to more virulent bacterial infections and viral pathogens, such as avian influenza, that can elicit a cytokine storm. On the other hand, they may be primed for a more rapid and effective response. These possibilities can now be tested using the models we have developed.</p>

Melting curve analysis was performed for 15 s at 95¬∞C, before cooling to 65¬∞C for 60 s, then heating to 95¬∞C in 0.5¬∞C increments for 0.5 s. Absolute quantification was performed against a standard curve generated using serially diluted plasmid DNA containing the amplicon of interest (EtenSCAR or ChickenTBP), to generate a standard curve ranging from 10<sup>6</sup> to 10<sup>1</sup> genome copies per mL. Parasite genome copy number was normalised by division with host (chicken) genome copy number.</p>

<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>Minitab Statistical Software was used to analyse IL10 protein levels and nitric oxide production in BMDMs using two-tailed unpaired t tests, growth curves were analysed using two-tailed unpaired t tests or one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni multiple comparison tests, and histopathological scores were analysed using Mann-Whitney U tests or Kruskal-Wallis tests. Analysis of bacterial counts, histopathology, and heatmaps was performed with GraphPad Prism software version 10.2.0. Data from multiplex RT-qPCR was analysed with GenEx6 software. The distribution of data was analysed by D‚ÄôAgostino-Pearson and Shapiro-Wilk normality tests. <italic>Eimeria</italic> replication and chicken body weight gain during parasite infection were analysed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey‚Äôs multiple comparison tests, and differences in lesion scores were tested by Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn‚Äôs multiple comparison tests. Bacterial counts and histopathology scores were analysed by Mann-Whitney U tests or Kruskal-Wallis tests. Fold change in transcript abundance was analysed by t tests using normalised data.</p>

<p>IL-10 balances protective and deleterious immune functions in mice and humans, but if IL-10 also controls avian intestinal homeostasis remains unclear. Generating genetic knockouts, Meunier et al. established that a complete lack of IL-10 strengthened immunity against enteric bacteria in chickens, while also aggravating infection-inflicted inflammatory tissue damage and dysbiosis upon parasite infection, but unlike mouse models, IL-10 deficiency did not provoke spontaneous colitis in chickens. The findings presented are <bold>valuable</bold>, and the strength of evidence is <bold>convincing</bold>. The observation may have implications for the livestock industry and additional studies involving genetic knockouts may further unravel conserved and distinct avian IL-10 controls.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Meunier et al. investigated the functional role of IL-10 in avian mucosal immunity. While the anti-inflammatory role of IL-10 is well established in mammals, and several confirmatory Knock-out models available in mice, IL-10's role in avian mucosal immunity is so far correlative. In this study the authors generated two different models of IL-10 ablation in Chickens. A whole body knock-out model, and an enhancer KO model leading to reduced IL10 expression. The authors first performed in vitro LPS stimulation based experiments, and then in vivo two different infection models employing C. jejuni and E. tenella, to demonstrate that complete ablation of IL10 leads to enhanced inflammation related pathology and gene expression, and enhanced pathogen clearance. At a steady-state level, however, IL-10 ablation did not lead to spontaneous colitis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall the study is well executed and establishes an anti-inflammatory role of IL-10 in birds. While the results are expected, and not surprising, this appears to be the first report to conclusively demonstrate IL-10's anti-inflammatory role upon its genetic ablation in avian model. Provided the applicability of this information in combating pathogen infection in livestock species in sustainable industries like poultry, the study is worth publishing.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study is primarily a confirmation of the already established anti-inflammatory role of IL-10.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>The authors have incorporated most of the points raised, and provided a reasonable argument for not considering DSS mediated colitis as an additional model.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors were to investigate functional role of IL10 on mucosal immunity in chickens. CRISPR technology was employed to generate IL10 knock out chickens in both exon and putative enhancer regions. IL10 expressions were either abolished (knockout in exon) or reduced (enhancer knock-out). IL-10 play an important role in the composition of the caecal microbiome. Through various enteric pathogens challenge, deficient IL10 expression was associated with enhanced pathogen clearance, but with more severe lesion score and body weight loss.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Both in vitro and in vivo knock-out in abolished and reduced IL10 expression and broad enteric pathogens were challenged in vivo and various parameters were examined to evaluate the functional role of IL10 on mucosal immunity.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Overexpression of IL10 either in vitro or in vivo may further support the findings from this study.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>The authors' response and justifications are appropriate.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We do not agree that this work is primarily confirmatory. The anti-inflammatory role of IL10 was indeed known previously from studies in mammals. The much more general insight from the current study is our demonstration of the intrinsic trade-off between inflammation and tolerance in the response to both the microbiome (which was significantly altered in the IL10 knockout birds) and mucosal pathogens. The study of Eimeria challenge in particular highlights the fact that it may be better for the host to tolerate a potential pathogen than to take on the cost of elimination.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors were to investigate the functional role of IL10 on mucosal immunity in chickens. CRISPR technology was employed to generate IL10 knock-out chickens in both exon and putative enhancer regions. IL10 expressions were either abolished (knockout in exon) or reduced (enhancer knock-out). IL-10 plays an important role in the composition of the caecal microbiome.

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Overexpression of IL-10 either in vitro or in vivo may further support the findings from this study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>An overexpression experiment, regardless of outcome, would not necessarily support or invalidate the findings of the current study. It would address the question of whether the absolute concentration of IL10 produced alters the outcome of an infection.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>The following are the recommendations that, in my opinion, will be helpful to enhance the quality of the study.</p>
<p>Major point:</p>
<p>The authors at a steady state did not observe any sign of spontaneous colitis. Since IL-10 KO in mice leads to enhanced pathological score upon DSS-mediated induction of colitis, and several colitis models are well established in birds, it will be worthwhile to test the consequence of experimentally inducing colitis in this context.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>One of the novel features of this study is the observation that the microbiome is modified in the IL10KO HOM chicks, which may serve to mitigate potential spontaneous pathology; we now mention this in the discussion. We agree that it could be worthwhile in the future to look at additional challenge models. However, we would argue that the Eimeria challenge is a sufficiently adequate experimentally-induced model of colitis to demonstrate the increased inflammation that occurs in an IL10-deficient bird. This is further supported by evidence of enhanced inflammatory responses in the caeca of IL10KO HOM birds challenged with Campylobacter or Salmonella relative to WT controls.

<p>Minor points:</p>
<p>(1) In Figure 2B, the authors should confirm whether the ROS-AV163 groups also have LPS treatment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The legend for Figure 2B already states that neutralizing anti-IL10 antibody was added to LPS-stimulated BMDMs: ‚ÄúNitric oxide production was assessed by measuring nitrite levels using Griess assay for LPS-stimulated BMDMs [‚Ä¶] in the absence or presence of neutralizing anti-IL10 antibody ROS-AV163‚Äù. However, for added clarity we have now modified the x-axis label for Figure 2B (‚Äú+ROS-AV163‚Äù replaced by ‚Äú+LPS +anti-IL10‚Äù) and we have also made minor changes to the figure legend. See in the revised manuscript (page 33).</p>

<p>(2) In Figure 3F, the authors should discuss why the duodenum of KO birds has enhanced infiltration compared to WT?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are not sure what the reviewer is referring to here. Although not specifically mentioned in Figure 3F, there is no statistically significant difference in cellular infiltration in the duodenum of IL10KO WT and HOM birds raised in our specified pathogen-free (SPF) facility, nor in the duodenum of IL10KO WT and HOM birds raised in our conventional facility (Mann-Whitney U tests, p&gt;0.1 in both cases); this can be seen in the sums of histopathological scores shown in Figures 3C (SPF facility) and 3E (conventional facility). Figure 3F shows that there is a statistically significant difference in cellular infiltration scores in the duodenum and proximal colon of both IL10KO WT and HOM birds based on the environment they are raised in (SPF vs conventional). We have made minor changes to the text to clarify this. See in the revised manuscript (page 7).</p>

<p>(3) The authors should discuss the observed differences in the C. jejuni colonization results among the two cohorts at week 1 and week 2 post-infection.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Numbers of C. jejuni in the caeca of IL10KO HOM birds were markedly lower than for WT controls at 1-week post-infection in cohort 1, and at both time intervals post-infection in cohort 2 (Figure 4A). This reached statistical significance at 1-week post-infection in cohort 1 and at 2-weeks post-infection in cohort 2. It is evident from Figure 4A that considerable inter-animal variance existed in each group, and in the IL10KO HOM birds in particular. This is typical of C. jejuni colonisation in chickens, where bacterial population structures have been reported to be variable and unpredictable (Coward et al., Appl Environ Microbiol 2008, PMID: 18424530). Similar variation between time intervals, birds and repeated experiments has been reported when evaluating vaccines against C. jejuni colonisation (e.g. Buckley et al., Vaccine 2010, PMID: 19853682; Nothaft et al., Front Microbiol 2021, PMID: 34867850). We performed two independent studies for this reason. Taken together, we consider that our data provide convincing evidence of elevated pro-inflammatory responses upon C. jejuni infection in IL10KO HOM birds relative to WT controls that associates with reduced bacterial burden. Our data is also consistent with a published observation that a commercial broiler line with low IL10 expression had correspondingly elevated expression of CXCLi-1, CXCLi-2 and IL-1b (Humphrey et al., mBio 2014, reference 33 in our original submission). We have added text to the discussion to capture the points above.  See in the revised manuscript (page 13).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>For the animal challenging experiments, both IL10KO HOM and IL10EnKO HOM chickens were used for Eimeria challenge, but not for Salmonella and Campylobacter. Could the authors justify why?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The Eimeria challenge produced a much higher and more reproducible level of inflammation than either of the bacterial challenge models. Within the parasite challenge cohorts, IL10KO HET and IL10EnKO HOM birds were only marginally different from WT controls (e.g. parasite replication: Figures 5A and B; lesion scores: Figures 5E and F; body weight gain: Figures 5G and H). Given the more limited response and the inter-individual variation in the bacterial challenge models, we felt that analysis of a sufficiently large cohort of the IL10KO HOM was appropriate, while additional cohorts of IL10KO HET and IL10EnKO HOM birds large enough to detect statistically significant differences could not be justified.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In the M&amp;M, there was no mention of # of birds generated for IL10EnKO HOM, HET, etc.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Full details of bird numbers can be found in SI Appendix Table S1 ‚ÄúNumber of IL10KO and IL10EnKO WT, HET and HOM chicks hatched in the NARF SPF chicken facility in the first (G1) and second (G2) generations‚Äù. Table S1 is already referred to in the Results section ‚ÄúGeneration of IL10-deficient chickens‚Äù; we have now also clearly referred to it in the ‚ÄúAnimals‚Äù and ‚ÄúGeneration of surrogate host chickens and establishment of the IL10KO and IL10EnKO lines under SPF conditions‚Äù sections of the Materials and Methods. In all three sections we have also added some text to clarify that the table details G1 and G2 bird numbers. See in the revised manuscript (pages 5, 15, 17).</p>

<p>From the results of Campylobacter challenge, the results from the cohort 1 and cohort 2 were not consistent at both 1 and 2 weeks of post-infection. There is not much discussion on this inconsistency. What is the final conclusion: significant difference in week 1 or week 2, OR none of them, OR both of them. What would happen if an additional cohort were conducted for Salmonella and Eimeria?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As noted in response to Reviewer 1 (minor point 3), we have now added text to the discussion on the partial inconsistency between independent C. jejuni challenge studies. We do not feel that additional experiments to address this comment are required. Highly significant increases in the infiltration of lymphoplasmacytic cells and heterophils were detected in IL10KO HOM chickens relative to WT controls in the caeca, a key site of Campylobacter colonisation. This was consistently observed in two independent cohorts at both 1- and 2-weeks post-infection (SI Appendix Figures S7 and S8) and was reflected in similar patterns of expression of pro-inflammatory genes at these intervals in both cohorts (Figure 4B). As our laboratory has observed substantially less variation between repeated Salmonella challenges, a single study was performed, but with adequate power to detect statistical differences.  The effects of E. tenella infection in IL10KO WT and HOM birds were replicated (compare Figure 4 with data from day 6 in Figure 5).</p>
