<title>Summary</title>
<p>From a forward mutagenetic screen to discover mutations associated with obesity, we identified mutations in the <italic>spag7</italic> gene linked to metabolic dysfunction in mice. Here we show that SPAG7 KO mice are born smaller and develop obesity and glucose intolerance in adulthood. This obesity does not stem from hyperphagia, but a decrease in energy expenditure. The KO animals also display reduced exercise tolerance and muscle function due to impaired mitochondrial function. Furthermore, SPAG7-deficiency in developing embryos leads to intrauterine growth restriction, brought on by placental insufficiency, likely due to abnormal development of the placental junctional zone. This insufficiency leads to loss of SPAG7-deficient fetuses in utero and reduced birth weights of those that survive. We hypothesize that a “thrifty phenotype” is ingrained in SPAG7 KO animals during development that leads to adult obesity. Collectively, these results indicate that SPAG7 is essential for embryonic development and energy homeostasis later in life.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Obesity and associated metabolic disorders, such as insulin resistance and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), are major sources of morbidity and mortality that are reaching epidemic proportions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">WHO, 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zimmet, Alberti, Magliano, &amp; Bennett, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cawley et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kelly, Yang, Chen, Reynolds, &amp; He, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Stokes &amp; Preston, 2017</xref>). Lifestyle interventions, such as diet and exercise, can be effective in combating these afflictions in some patients. However, low adherence and counter-regulatory mechanisms that limit weight reduction and long-term weight maintenance impede the effectiveness of such interventions. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brownell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Miller et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Roberts &amp; Barnard, 2005</xref>). The new anti-obesity drugs, semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, and tirzepatide, a dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, have demonstrated remarkable efficacy for weight loss and hold great promise as anti-obesity treatments to alleviate metabolic dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Venniyoor, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wilding et al., 2021</xref>). However, even with their recent success, there are many patients who do not respond to GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment or have to discontinue the treatment due to side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chao, Tronieri, Amaro, &amp; Wadden, 2022</xref>). Thus, there remains a need for additional new therapies to combat obesity.</p>
<p>To identify new targets for the treatment of obesity and diabetes, we began a large-scale forward genetic phenotypic screen in mice (T. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Random mutations in the mouse genome were generated using the chemical ENU (N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea). The genomes of the animals were sequenced, and various metabolic endpoints were evaluated to identify genes with mutations associated with obesity and insulin resistance phenotypes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Through this process, mutations in the gene <italic>spag7</italic> (sperm-associated antigen 7) were identified. SPAG7 is well-conserved with 97% of the amino acid sequence being identical in humans and mice. Structurally, it contains a nuclear localization signal, making it likely a nuclear protein, and an R3H domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Nagata, 2005</xref>). The function of the R3H domain is also not fully understood; however, it is predicted to bind polynucleotides, and other proteins that contain R3H domains are known to bind single-stranded DNA or RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Grishin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">He, Zhang, Liu, &amp; Yan, 2013</xref>).</p>

<p>The biological function of SPAG7 has been largely unstudied. It was first identified in the inner acrosomal compartment of fox sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Beaton, Cleary, ten Have, &amp; Bradley, 1994</xref>). However, the gene is expressed in every tissue and cell in humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Noguchi et al., 2017</xref>). It has been implicated in various disease states, including Asperger syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Tentler et al., 2003</xref>), parvovirus B19 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kerr et al., 2005</xref>), synovial sarcoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fernebro et al., 2006</xref>), azoospermia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ayhan et al., 2014</xref>), periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenopathy (PFAPA) syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bens et al., 2014</xref>), squamous cell carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Singh et al., 2020</xref>) and oligoasthenozoospermia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abu-Halima et al., 2023</xref>). However, the role SPAG7 plays in these diseases remains elusive.</p>
<p>Mice carrying SPAG7 mutations displayed interesting metabolic phenotypes, suggesting that SPAG7 may play a role in regulating metabolism in vivo. The goals of this study are to determine whether SPAG7 loss of function affects systemic metabolism and to establish a mechanism of action for SPAG7.</p>

<title>SPAG7-deficient animals are obese and insulin resistant</title>
<p>To investigate the role of SPAG7 in metabolism, we generated a germline SPAG7-deficient mouse model (SPAG7 KO). SPAG7 KO animals are obese in adulthood (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). But they have an unexpected growth curve; they are underweight early in life, catch up around six weeks of age, and then continue to outgrow WT littermates into and throughout adulthood (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). SPAG7-deficient mice demonstrate decreased lean mass early in life that remains below that of WT littermates throughout their lifespan (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). In contrast, fat mass in the animals increases continually, growing to three-to-five-times the fat mass of WTs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). SPAG7-deficient animals display decreased body length, measured nose to base of tail (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Bone mass density is also decreased in SPAG7 KO animals, which may contribute to the decreased lean mass (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>).</p>
<p>The majority of the increased body weight in SPAG7-deficient animals stems from increased adipose tissue mass (Fig. S1A-D). All adipose tissue depots more than double in size (Fig. S1A-D). SPAG7-deficient adipose tissues display adipocyte hypertrophy and increased immune cell infiltration, consistent with chronic obesity (Fig. S1E-H). However, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and brain weights are all decreased in SPAG7-deficient animals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1H-L</xref>). Livers display no change in mass but do have increased triglyceride content, indicating hepatic steatosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1M</xref>, Fig. S1I-K). No changes in circulating liver enzymes were observed, indicating that the lipid accumulation was not severe enough to induce significant liver damage (Fig. S1L-O). Plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, and free fatty acids are all increased, consistent with an obesity phenotype (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1N-S</xref>).</p>
<p>SPAG7-deficient animals display severely impaired glucose uptake in response to oral glucose gavage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1T</xref>). Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is increased in these animals, consistent with an insulin resistance phenotype (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1U</xref>). The animals also display an insulin intolerance phenotype, with decreased glucose uptake following an insulin injection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1V</xref>). This is, perhaps, unsurprising, given the rather extreme fat mass phenotype.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Obesity in SPAG7-deficient animals is caused by decreased energy expenditure</title>
<p>A change in food intake was not detectable in SPAG7-deficient animals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). In fact, a trend towards decreased food intake was consistently observed. When placed in metabolic cages, SPAG7-deficient animals display a significant decrease in energy expenditure that is present during the light cycle, but particularly clear in the dark cycle, when we would expect the animals to be active and moving about the cage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B, 2C</xref>). Consistent with this finding, SPAG7-deficient animals display decreased locomotor activity, as measured by home-cage beam break (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To determine if thermogenesis also contributes to the decreased energy expenditure observed in the SPAG7 KO mice, SPAG7-deficient animals were housed at thermoneutrality (TN). At TN the animals display the same phenotypes: increased body weight in adulthood, dramatically increased fat mass, no change in food intake, and a decrease in total energy expenditure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E-H</xref>). This indicates that thermogenesis is unlikely to play a significant role in the decreased energy expenditure and weight gain observed in the animals. SPAG7-deficient animals fed a 60% high-fat diet (HFD) also display the same phenotypes with no increase in food intake in SPAG7 KOs compared to WTs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I-L</xref>). The percent body weight gain in SPAG7-deficient animals vs WT was very similar at room temperature on normal chow, at thermoneutrality on normal chow, and at room temperature on HFD: an increase of 15-17% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2M</xref>), indicating that decreased energy expenditure due to reduced locomotor activity is the key driver for the obesity phenotype in the SPAG7 KO mice.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>SPAG7-deficient animals display decreased exercise capacity and muscle function</title>
<p>The observation of reduced locomotor activity in the SPAG7 KO mice prompted us to investigate if there are defects in exercise performance and muscle function in these mice. WT and SPAG7 KO animals were subjected to treadmill endurance tests; the KO mice ran a significantly shorter distance than the WT animals before becoming exhausted (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Additionally, the maximum oxygen consumption reached during the treadmill endurance test was significantly reduced in SPAG7-deficient animals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). The maximum force produced by gastrocnemius complex hindlimb muscles when stimulated in anaesthetized animals was measured as indicative of muscle function and is severely impaired in SPAG7-deficient animals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Skeletal muscle histology indicates a significant reduction in the cross-sectional area of Type IIa (fast-twitch) muscle fiber (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>), indicating muscle atrophy. SPAG7-deficient skeletal muscle was also found to contain elevated levels of triglyceride content (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). Skeletal muscle vascularization appeared normal (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F-H</xref>). We did, however, observe a marked reduction in oxidative capacity in skeletal muscle, as indicated by succinate dehydrogenase b activity staining and citrate synthase activity in gastrocnemius muscle (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I, 3J</xref>).</p>

Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed many gene expression pathways that were affected by SPAG7-deficiency; among the most significantly downregulated were pathways involved in mitochondrial function (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3L</xref>). The most significantly downregulated gene was <italic>hsd17b10</italic>. This is a ubiquitously expressed mitochondrial protein that acts as both a short-chain dehydrogenase reductase and as a part of the RNase P complex, which is responsible for the maturation of all mitochondrial tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Holzmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Vilardo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Yang, He, &amp; Schulz, 2005</xref>).

<title>Induction of SPAG7-deficiency after early development does not cause obesity or skeletal muscle abnormalities</title>
<p>SPAG7 KO mice were smaller than WT mice during the neonatal stage and profoundly obese in adulthood (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). This raised the question whether SPAG7-deficiency affects embryonic development, which may potentially cause the metabolic perturbations later in life. To test this hypothesis, an inducible whole-body SPAG7 KO (iSPAG7) mouse was developed. Using a globally expressed Cre-ERT2 along with a globally floxed SPAG7 gene, tamoxifen injection would induce global recombination and deletion of the SPAG7 gene (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). To test the effects of SPAG7-deficiency in adulthood, iSPAG7 animals were aged to 7 weeks before being dosed with tamoxifen. In this manner, tamoxifen dosing was able to establish effective knockout of SPAG7 protein levels in all tissues examined, including liver, brain, kidney, muscle, and fat (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). In contrast to the germline SPAG7 KO, iSPAG7 KO animals displayed no differences in body weight, lean mass, fat mass, or food intake (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C-F</xref>). There is no difference in glucose tolerance and total energy expenditure between the iSPAG7 KO and the WT mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G-J</xref>). Home cage locomotor activity, hindlimb max force generation, and treadmill endurance were all normal, as well (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4K-M</xref>). These results indicate that the metabolic phenotypes are downstream of the effects of SPAG7-deficiency on the developing animal, suggesting that SPAG7 may play a role during embryonic development.</p>

<title>SPAG7-deficiency causes placental insufficiency and intrauterine growth restriction</title>
<p>SPAG7-deficient mice are born significantly underweight (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A. 5B</xref>). They are also born below the expected rate. In heterozygous x heterozygous breeding, Mendelian ratios would predict roughly 25% of pups born to be SPAG7-deficient. We observe roughly 10% of pups to be SPAG7-deficient, indicating significant loss of SPAG7-deficient animals prior to birth (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Throughout mouse (and human) development there are key stages where significant loss of embryos is more likely to occur. These include fertilization (e0), gastrulation (e6.5-e8), organogenesis (e8-e11.5), and birth (e19-e20). Genotyping embryos before and after each of these developmental stages, we observe expected Mendelian ratios of SPAG7-deficient animals from e6.5 through e11.5, indicating no loss of embryos during fertilization, gastrulation, and organogenesis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D-F</xref>). We do see a significant decrease in SPAG7-deficient percentage at e18.5, indicating that SPAG7-deficient embryos are lost at some point after e11.5 and prior to birth (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>). However, it should be noted that SPAG7-deficient embryos appear to be smaller and less well-developed than WT embryos within the same dam, at each of these stages.</p>

<p>At e18.5, SPAG7-deficient animals display decreased fetal and placental weight (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H-J</xref>), indicating intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Other than the smaller size, the SPAG7-deficient fetus lacks any specific morphologic abnormalities: all organs and limbs appear appropriately developed for their size. To further characterize the IUGR phenotype, we measured markers relevant to IUGR in the fetus. SPAG7-deficient fetuses have lower blood glucose and plasma insulin compared with WT controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5K, 5L</xref>). Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling has been implicated as essential for fetal growth and is dysregulated in IUGR fetuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Agrogiannis, Sifakis, Patsouris, &amp; Konstantinidou, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Reid, Flozak, &amp; Simmons, 2002</xref>). SPAG7-deficient fetal liver displays decreased IGF1 and 2 protein and gene expression levels, indicating reduced IGF signaling (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5M-O</xref>). These findings are consistent with an intrauterine growth restriction phenotype (IUGR) caused by placental insufficiency and suggest SPAG7 may be necessary to maintain placental function.</p>
<p>SPAG7 is expressed highly in mouse and human placenta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Uhlen et al., 2015</xref>), it is also highly expressed in every mouse tissue during the earliest stages of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baldarelli et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brunskill et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Schmitt et al., 2014</xref>). SPAG7-deficient placenta is smaller in cross-sectional area compared to the placenta of WT littermates (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A-C</xref>). SPAG7-deficient placenta displayed no significant changes in vascularization as measured by CD34 IHC staining and gene expression of vascularization markers (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B, 6D, 6E</xref>). There is a significant increase in mitochondrial DNA content in SPAG7 KO placenta (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>). This finding is consistent with previous findings in IUGR and is generally thought to be a compensatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Mando et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Naha et al., 2020</xref>). Histological analyses showed that SPAG7 KO placenta displayed abnormal morphology, exhibiting disruption of both the labyrinth and junctional zones. The junctional zone, however, was particularly severely affected, as demonstrated by decreased junctional:labyrinth zone ratios and percent junctional zone (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G-I</xref>). The junctional zone of the placenta plays a key role in the production of hormones and the transport of metabolites from dam to pup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Woods, Perez-Garcia, &amp; Hemberger, 2018</xref>). A disruption in this area is likely to reduce nutrient availability to the fetus.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We identified mutations in the gene <italic>spag7</italic> that induce obesity and insulin resistance in mice from a mouse forward genetic screen. The biological function of SPAG7 is largely unknown. Utilizing constitutive and inducible SPAG7 knockout mouse models, we investigated the function of SPAG7 in vivo. The results show that SPAG7-deficient mice were born with lower body weight; however, they developed obesity and insulin resistance in adulthood. The metabolic disturbance in the SPAG7 KO animals is due to a decrease in energy expenditure, driven by decreased locomotor activity. Skeletal muscle function and exercise endurance in SPAG7-deficient animals are significantly impaired, displaying decreased force generation and oxidative capacity. In addition, these phenotypes are downstream of developmental effects, as knocking out SPAG7 in adulthood did not cause these metabolic disturbances. Furthermore, SPAG7 KO embryos display intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), and aberrant development of the junctional zone of SPAG7-deficient placenta. These results demonstrate that SPAG7 is essential for fetal growth and placental function. Lack of SPAG7 results in IUGR, which leads to the development of obesity, insulin resistance, and other metabolic disturbances later in life.</p>
<p>Fetal nutritional status is well-known to drive metabolic health in adulthood. Perhaps the most famous example of this is the Dutch Hunger Winter. Pregnant women, exposed to acute and extreme decreases in nutritional intake, gave birth to low birthweight newborns, who were then at higher risk for developing obesity and diabetes in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Roseboom, de Rooij, &amp; Painter, 2006</xref>). Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) has been linked to the development of metabolic syndrome later in life. However, the mechanisms that cause IUGR and influence its association with adult metabolic health remain poorly understood. Bilateral uterine artery ligation during gestation in rats leads to decreased birth weights, but obesity in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Simmons, Templeton, &amp; Gertz, 2001</xref>). Placental insufficiency is a common cause of IUGR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Malhotra et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wood, 2020</xref>). In fact, junctional zone deficiency, in particular, has been shown to negatively affect fetal growth and birth weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Mark, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Woods et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>IUGR has been shown to affect skeletal muscle health and performance. Humans that experience IUGR, for any given population, display decreased skeletal muscle mass that is not compensated for after birth and persists through adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Nastase, Cretoiu, &amp; Stoicescu, 2018</xref>). The skeletal muscle of IUGR fetuses in sheep display decreased intracellular ATP content and decreased amino acid uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Sarkar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Stremming, Jansson, Powell, Rozance, &amp; Brown, 2020</xref>). Muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity can also be lower in IUGR skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Stremming et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>The deleterious effects of SPAG7-deficiency on the fetus clearly indicate an important function for SPAG7 during embryonic development. The most common cause for IUGR is placental insufficiency. In the rodent, the placenta can be roughly broken up into three zones: the decidua, the labyrinth zone, and the junctional zone. The decidua and labyrinth zones contain the vasculature of the mother and fetus, respectively. The junctional zone is the main site of nutrient and gas exchange and also the main endocrine compartment of the placenta, producing hormones, growth factors, and cytokines that are important for the normal progression of pregnancy and fetal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Woods et al., 2018</xref>). Histological examination of SPAG7 KO placenta revealed abnormal morphology of both the labyrinth and junctional zones. In addition, the junctional zone was markedly diminished in SPAG7 KO placenta, as demonstrated by decreased junctional:labyrinth zone ratios and decreased percent junctional zone (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G-I</xref>). The mature mouse placenta is established mid-gestation (∼e10.5) and continues to grow, in size and complexity, throughout the pregnancy. Early in gestation, the yolk sac supports the nutritional needs of the embryo, however, from mid-gestation onward, the fetal nutrient supply requires the transport capacity of the placenta. The success of this transition is critical for fetal survival and continued growth. During our studies, we did not observe significant loss of SPAG7 KO embryos until after the switch to placental nutrition supply, which could be due to the disruption of labyrinth and junctional zone development in the placenta.</p>

</fig>
<p>We hypothesize the SPAG7 KO fetuses that survive do so by decreasing the mitochondrial metabolic capacity of their skeletal muscle and other tissues. Reducing muscle energy consumption in response to the decreased nutrient availability in the IUGR fetus is advantageous to ensure fetal survival. However, when these animals are born and age, this reduction predisposes them towards metabolic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Pendleton, Wesolowski, Regnault, Lynch, &amp; Limesand, 2021</xref>). After birth, when nutrition is readily available, the decrease in energy expenditure, combined with food intake normalized to wild-type littermates, eventually leads to increased body weight and fat mass. It is worth noting that SPAG7 KO mice are not hyperphagic, a phenotype observed in some IUGR models, suggesting that other perturbations in SPAG7 KO animals may counter-regulate hyperphagia. The key driver for the development of obesity and metabolic syndrome in the SPAG7 KO mouse is reduced energy expenditure. Models that produce obesity, primarily driven by decreased locomotor activity, are rare. Further investigation of SPAG7-deficient mice may provide valuable information for drugs targeting energy expenditure in the treatment of obesity.</p>
<p>Overall, our results demonstrate that SPAG7 plays an important role in fetal development. SPAG7 is essential for the proper formation of the junctional and labyrinth zones of the placenta, which contributes to IUGR in the SPAG7 KO fetus (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). The surviving SPAG7 KO mice develop a range of metabolic disorders including obesity, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, exercise impairment, reduced energy expenditure, and reduced skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity in adulthood. Our results uncover, for the first time, the biological function for the <italic>spag7</italic> gene in vivo. Furthermore, these findings shed light into a new biological pathway regulating fetal development. The results provide insights into how skeletal muscle function contributes to systemic energy balance and how fetal nutritional status can have far-reaching effects, influencing the nutritional status of the adult. Deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in placental insufficiency, IUGR, and SPAG7 biology may give us the opportunity to reverse aberrations in fetal growth rate and prevent the metabolic co-morbidities associated with low birth weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wood, 2020</xref>).</p>

Two 1000 µm x 1000 µm samples from homogeneous adipocyte areas of each image were sent to ImageJ and further analyzed with the Adipocyte Tools plugin using the option for large cells and the settings of minimum size 500 µm2 and number of erosions rounds 3. Faulty detections were manually corrected. Cell diameter was calculated assuming circular shape of adipocytes. Crownlike structures (CLS) were identified in subcutaneous AT sections as single adipocytes surrounded by at least 4 F4/80-positive macrophages.</p>

<title>Treadmill Endurance Test</title>
<p>Mice were progressively acclimatized to treadmill exposure by increasing intensity and duration for 3 days. For the incremental test, mice ran on an enclosed, single lane treadmill (molecular enclosed metabolic treadmill for mice; Columbus Instruments), and real-time measurements of oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>) and carbon dioxide output (VCO<sub>2</sub>) were performed using an Oxymax/Comprehensive Laboratory Animal Monitoring System (CLAMS; Columbus Instruments). Mice ran at 6, 9, 12, 18, 21, and 23 m·min<sup>-1</sup> for 3 min at each velocity at a 0°, 5°, 10°, and 15° inclination for 6 min at each inclination. Exhaustion was defined as the inability to return to treadmill running after 10 seconds.</p>

<title>In Vivo Muscle Max Force Generation</title>
<p>Mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane and placed supine on a platform heated via a circulating water bath at 37°C. The right leg was shaved up to the patella and right knee stabilized via knee clamp. Once stabilized, the right foot was affixed to a Dual Mode Foot Plate (300-C FP, Aurora Scientific Inc., Aurora, Canada), and two electrodes were placed subcutaneously near the mid-belly of the gastrocnemius to achieve plantar flexion. A 1 Hz electrical stimulation was delivered (0.2 s duration, 1 s between stimulations) via stimulator (701C, Aurora Scientific Inc.) while increasing amperes to generate a maximum twitch measurement. After a maximum twitch was established, a force frequency of isometric contractions was initiated (0.2 s duration, 120 s between stimulations). All data were collected and analysed using the manufacturer supplied software (DMC and DMA, Aurora Sci entific Inc.). Mice were housed at thermoneutral temperature prior to analysis.</p>

<title>Histology and Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Formalin fixed adipose tissue, livers, and gastrocnemius muscles were dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. One paraffin-embedded cross-section (5 μm thickness) through the adipose tissue, the left lateral lobe of the liver, and the mid-body of the gastrocnemius muscle from each animal was stained with hematoxylin and eosin using an automatic slide stainer (Leica) and microscopic evaluation was performed by a veterinary pathologist.</p>
<p>For muscle vascularity staining, mouse gastrocnemius muscle was isolated, mounted on a cork and snap-frozen in cold isopentane (Sigma-Aldrich, 277258) for cryo-sectioning. Cross-sections of 10-μm thickness were collected from the belly of the samples and placed on Superfrost Plus microscope slides. For capillary density and fiber size evaluation, the sections were stained with CD31 antibody (Biocare, CM-303A) and Dylight 594 tomato lectin (Vector Laboratories, DL-1177) for 1 hr under room temperature followed by an 1-hr incubation of an alexa 488 goat anti-rat secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher, A-11006). The slides were mounted with VECTASHIELD Antifade Mounting Medium with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Vector Laboratories, H-1800) and were imaged using a Zeiss AxioScan Z.1 slide scanner (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The images were analyzed using Visiopharm (Version 2020.09.0.8195) and custom-designed applications. The capillary/fiber ratio was calculated by dividing the total count of capillary (CD31+ lectin+) by the total count of fiber in the cross-section. The fiber size was the median surface area of all fibers in the cross-section.</p>
<p>For placenta vascularity staining, paraffin-embedded sections (5 μm thickness) were deparaffinized and rehydrated. Sections were blocked in 5% goat serum for 1 hour at room temperature. Sections were incubated with anti-CD34 primary antibody (Abcam ab81289) at a 1:200 concentration for 1 hour at room temperature and then overnight at 4 degree s. Sections were washed with PBS before incubation with secondary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature. Sections were washed again and imaged using a Zeiss AxioScan Z.1 slide scanner (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).</p>

<title>Skeletal Muscle SDH Activity Stain</title>
<p>Transverse sections (5 μm) were cut from the mid-body of the gastrocnemius muscle. The sections were dried at room temperature for 30 minutes before incubation in a solution made up of 0.2 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 0.1 M MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 M succinic acid (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 2.4 mM nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT, Sigma) at 37°C in a humidity chamber for 45 minutes. The sections were then washed in deionized water for three minutes, dehydrated in 50% ethanol for two minutes, and mounted for viewing with DPX mount medium (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA). Digital photographs were taken from each section at 10X magnification under a Nikon Eclipse TE 2000 -U microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY, USA) with a Nikon digital camera (Digital Sight DS-Fi1), and fibers were quantified with imaging software (Image J, NIH).</p>

<title>RNAseq Sample Preparation</title>
<p>28-week-old WT and SPAG7 KO animals were sacrificed and gastrocnemius muscle was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissue was pulverized and total RNA was extracted using Qiagen Rneasy Plus Universal mini kit following manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The RNA samples were quantified using Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and RNA integrity was checked using TapeStation (Agilent Techn ologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). RNA sequencing libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina following manufacturer’s instructions (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA). Briefly, mRNAs were first enriched with Oligo(dT) bead s. Enriched mRNAs were fragmented for 15 minutes at 94 °C. First strand and second strand cDNAs were subsequently synthesized. cDNA fragments were end repaired and adenylated at 3’ends, and universal adapters were ligated to cDNA fragments, followed by index addition and library enrichment by limited-cycle PCR. The sequencing libraries were validated on the Agilent TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA), and quantified by using Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as well as by quantitative PCR (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA).</p>

<title>RNA Sequencing</title>
<p>The sequencing libraries were multiplexed and clustered onto a Illumina flowcell. After clustering, the flow cell was loaded onto the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument according to manufacturer’s instructions. The samples were sequenced using a 2×150bp Paired End (PE) configuration and targeting 30 million reads/sample. Image analysis and base calling were conducted by the Illumina Control Software (HCS). Raw sequence data (.bcl files) generated from Illumina were converted into fastq files and de-multiplexed using Illumina bcl2fastq 2.20 software. One mis-match was allowed for index sequence identification.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study combines molecular genetics and target validation to discover genes involved in obesity and determine their role. The reviewers unanimously agree that the work is <bold>important</bold> in terms of significance: it has conceptual and practical implications beyond metabolism, including embryonic and placental development. They also considered that the strength of evidence is <bold>convincing</bold> from the use of their forward genetic screen in mice. In some instances, reviewers considered that the work was not more than <bold>solid</bold> because although the methods, data, and analyses broadly support the claims, minor weaknesses emerge on which they suggest improvements for you to consider and selectively address.</p>

<p>Drawing on insights from preceding studies, the researchers pinpointed mutations within the spag7 gene that correlate with metabolic aberrations in mice. The precise function of spag7 has not been fully described yet, thereby the primary objective of this investigation is to unravel its pivotal role in the development of obesity and metabolic disease in mice. First, they generated a mice model lacking spag7 and observed that KO mice exhibited diminished birth size, which subsequently progressed to manifest obesity and impaired glucose tolerance upon reaching adulthood. This behaviour was primarily attributed to a reduction in energy expenditure. In fact, KO animals demonstrated compromised exercise endurance and muscle functionality, stemming from a deterioration in mitochondrial activity. Intriguingly, none of these effects was observed when using a tamoxifen-induced KO mouse model, implying that Spag7's influence is predominantly confined to the embryonic developmental phase. Explorations within placental tissue unveiled that mice afflicted by Spag7 deficiency experienced placental insufficiency, likely due to aberrant development of the placental junctional zone, a phenomenon that could impede optimal nutrient conveyance to the developing fetus. Overall, the authors assert that Spag7 emerges as a crucial determinant orchestrating accurate embryogenesis and subsequent energy balance in the later stages of life.</p>
<p>The study boasts several noteworthy strengths. Notably, it employs a combination of animal models and a thorough analysis of metabolic and exercise parameters, underscoring a meticulous approach. Furthermore, the investigation encompasses a comprehensive evaluation of fetal loss across distinct pregnancy stages, alongside a transcriptomic analysis of skeletal muscle, thereby imparting substantial value. However, a pivotal weakness of the study centres on its translational applicability. While the authors claim that &quot;SPAG7 is well-conserved with 97% of the amino acid sequence being identical in humans and mice&quot;, the precise role of spag7 in the human context remains enigmatic. This limitation hampers a direct extrapolation of findings to human scenarios. Additionally, the study's elucidation of the molecular underpinnings behind the spag7-mediated anomalous development of the placental junction zone remains incomplete.

<p>Hence, in order to fortify the solidity of their conclusions, these concerns necessitate meticulous attention and resolution in the forthcoming version of the manuscript. Upon the comprehensive addressing of these aspects, the study is poised to exert a substantial influence on the field, its significance reverberating significantly. The methodologies and data presented undoubtedly hold the potential to facilitate the community's deeper understanding of the ramifications stemming from disruptions during pregnancy, shedding light on their enduring impact on the metabolic well-being of subsequent generations.</p>

<p>Summary: The authors of this manuscript are interested in discovering and functionally characterizing genes that might cause obesity. To find such genes, they conducted a forward genetic screen in mice, selecting strains which displayed increased body weight and adiposity. They found a strain, with germ-line deficiency in the gene Spag7, which displayed significantly increased body weight, fat mass, and adipose depot sizes manifesting after the onset of adulthood (20 weeks). The mice also display decreased organ sizes, leading to decreased lean body mass. The increased adiposity was traced to decreased energy expenditure at both room temperature and thermoneutrality, correlating with decreased locomotor activity and muscle atrophy. Major metabolic abnormalities such as impaired glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity also accompanied the phenotype. Unexpectedly, when the authors generated an inducible, whole body knockout mouse using a globally expressed Cre-ERT2 along with a globally floxed Spag7, and induced Spag7 knockout before the onset of obesity, none of the phenotypes seen in the original strain were recapitulated. The authors trace this discrepancy to the major effect of Spag7 being on placental development.</p>
<p>Strengths: Strengths of the manuscript are its inherently unbiased approach, using a forward genetic screen to discover previously unknown genes linked to obesity phenotypes. Another strong aspect of the work was the generation of an independent, complementary, strain consisting of an inducible knockout model, in which the deficiency of the gene could be assessed in a more granular form. This approach enabled the discovery of Spag7 as a gene involved in the establishment of the mature placenta, which determines the metabolic fate of the offspring. Additional strengths include the extensive array of physiological parameters measured, which provided a deep understanding of the whole-body metabolic phenotype and pinpointed its likely origin to muscle energetic dysfunction.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: Weaknesses that can be raised are the lack of molecular mechanistic understanding of the numerous phenotypic observations. For example, the specific role of Spag7 to promote placental development remains unclear. Also, the reason why placental developmental abnormalities lead to muscle dysfunction, and whether indeed the entire metabolic phenotype of the offspring can be attributed solely to decreased muscle energetics is not fully explored.</p>
<p>Overall, the authors achieved a remarkable success in identifying genes associated with development of obesity and metabolic disease, discovering the role of Spag7 in placental development, and highlighting the fundamental role of in-utero development in setting future metabolic state of the offspring.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The manuscript by Flaherty III S.E. et al identified SPAG7 gene in their forward mutagenetic screening and created the germline knockout and inducible knockout mice. The authors reported that the SPAG7 germline knockout mice had lower birth weight likely due to intrauterine growth restriction and placental insufficiency. The SPAG7 KO mice later developed obesity phenotype as a result of reduced energy expenditure. However, the inducible SPAG7 knockout mice had normal body weight and composition.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
In this reviewer's opinion, this study has high significance in the field of metabolic research for the following reasons.</p>
<p>
(1) The authors' findings are significant in the field of obesity research, especially from the perspective of maternal-fetal medicine. The authors created and analyzed the SPAG7 KO mice and found that the KO mice had a &quot;thrifty phenotype&quot; and developed obesity.</p>
<p>
(2) SPAG7 gene function hasn't been thoroughly studied. The reported phenotype will fill the gap of knowledge.</p>
<p>
Overall, the authors have presented their results in a clear and logically organized structure, clearly stated the key question to be addressed, used the appropriate methodology, produced significant and innovative main findings.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The manuscript can be further strengthened with more clarification on the following points.</p>
<p>
1. The germline whole-body KO mice were female mice (Line293), however the inducible knockout mice were male mice (Line549). Sexual dimorphism is often observed in metabolic studies, therefore the metabolic phenotype of both female and male mice needs to be reported for the germline and inducible knockouts in order to make the justified conclusion.</p>
<p>
2. SPAG7 has an NLS. Does this protein function in gene expression? Whether the overall metabolic phenotype is the direct cause of SPAG7 ablation is unclear. For example, the Hsd17b10 gene was downregulated in all tissues in the KO mice. Could this have been coincidentally selected for and thus be the cause of the developmental issues and adulthood obesity? Do the iSpag7 mice demonstrate reduced expression of Hsd17b10?</p>
<p>
3. Figure 2c should display the energy expenditure normalized to body weight (or lean body mass).</p>
<p>
4. Please provide more information for the figure legend, including the statistical test that was conducted for each data set, animal numbers for each genotype and sexes.</p>
<p>
5. The authors should report how long after treatment the data was collected for figures 4F-M.</p>
<p>
6. The authors should justify ending the data collection after 8 weeks for the iSPAG7 mice in Figures 4C-E. In the WT vs germline KO mice, there was no clear difference in body weight or lean mass at 15 weeks of age.</p>

<p>Thanks to this reviewer for their thoughtful analysis and commentary. Human mutations in SPAG7 are exceedingly rare (SPAG7 | pLoF (genebass.org)), potentially because of the deleterious effects of SPAG7-deficiency on prenatal development. This makes investigation into the causative effects of SPAG7 in humans challenging. There exist mutations in the SPAG7 region of the genome that are associated with BMI, but no direct coding variants within the spag7 gene itself have been studied.</p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that the precise role of spag7 in the placenta remains unknown. However, given its robust expression and high protein levels in the placenta, including in key cells, such as the syncytiotrophoblast (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000091640-SPAG7/tissue/Placenta">https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000091640-SPAG7/tissue/Placenta</ext-link>), it is highly likely that spag7 is critical for normal placenta development and function. Multiple studies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9716072/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9716072/</ext-link>) have recently shown that sperm associated RNAs play a critical role in embryonic and early placenta development. Our findings will provide the basis for future studies that can elucidate the role of spag7 in human placenta.</p>

<p>We thank this reviewer for their thoughtful analysis and commentary. Significant effort has been made to understand the causes of the metabolic phenotypes observed in SPAG7-deficient mouse models.  It is clear that hyperphagia is not the cause and the muscle energetics deficit is likely not the sole cause. We expect that decreased access to nutrition in utero will lead to widespread and varied metabolic adaptation.</p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that further work can be done to understand the molecular mechanism driving the metabolic phenotypes of SPAG7-deficient animals. We believe that full investigation of the processes behind the developmental abnormalities is beyond the scope of this paper and best to be done under a separate paper.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for their thoughtful analysis and commentary. All inducible KO animals described in the paper are female (the typo in Line 549 has been corrected). We did perform studies in both male and female animals for both of these lines. Males display similar metabolic phenotypes, though not as robustly as the females. A table summarizing key data from male and female germline KO animals and inducible KO animals has been included in Author response table 1.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>SPAG7 contains an R3H domain, which is predicted to bind polynucleotides, and other proteins that contain R3H domains are known to bind RNA or ssDNA. The iSPAG7 mice do display decreased hsd17b10 expression (to a lesser degree than the germline KOs) in the tissues examined. When we knock-down SPAG7 in specific tissues, we also see hsd17b10 expression decrease specifically in those tissues. These data all suggest that hsd17b10 expression is, at least, linked to spag7 expression. They also raise the question of why these animals have no metabolic phenotype. Some possible explanations are that hsd17b10 expression is essential only during early development, or that the lower magnitude of downregulation of hsd17b10 in the iSPAG7 is insufficient to produce the metabolic phenotypes seen in the germline Kos with higher magnitude of downregulation.</p>

<p>1. Figure 2c should display the energy expenditure normalized to body weight (or lean body mass).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>How best to normalize total energy expenditure data is a subject of debate within the energy expenditure field. As the animals have increased body weight and decreased lean mass, normalizing to either will skew the results in different directions. We have included the data normalized to body weight and to lean mass in Author response image 1. The decrease in total energy expenditure remains significant in either scenario.</p>

<p>Highly significant changes in fat mass, glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity are already present in the germline SPAG7 KO mice at age of 15 week or earlier. Tamoxifen injection effectively induced SPA7 gene KO in less than a week in the iSPAG7 KO mice. Given the absence of significant changes or any trends towards significance in glucose and insulin tolerance test as well as other metabolic testes in the iSPAG7 KO mice at age of 15 week (same age as the germline KO when these changes observed) and 8 week after SPAG7 gene KO, we did not anticipate to see the changes beyond this point and decided to stop the study at 9 weeks after treatment.</p>
