<title>Abstract</title><p>Stem cells contribute to organismal homeostasis by balancing division, self-renewal and differentiation. Elucidating the strategies by which stem cells achieve this balance is critical for understanding homeostasis, and for addressing pathogenesis associated with the disruption of this balance (e.g., cancer). Planarians, highly regenerative flatworms, use pluripotent stem cells called neoblasts to maintain and regrow organs. A single neoblast can rescue an entire animal depleted from stem cells and regenerate all cell lineages. How neoblast differentiation and clonal expansion are governed to produce all the required cell types is unclear. Here, we integrated experimental and computational approaches to develop a quantitative model revealing basic principles of clonal growth of individual neoblasts. By experimentally suppressing differentiation to major lineages, we elucidated the interplay between colony growth and lineage decisions. Our findings suggest that neoblasts pre-select their progenitor lineage based on a cell-intrinsic fate distribution. Arresting differentiation into specific lineages disrupts neoblast proliferative capacity without inducing compensatory expression of other lineages. Our analysis of neoblast colonies is consistent with a cell-intrinsic decision model that can operate without memory or communication between neoblasts. This simple cell fate decision process breaks down in homeostasis, likely because of the activity of feedback mechanisms. Our findings uncover essential principles of stem cell regulation in planarians, which are distinct from those observed in many vertebrate models. These mechanisms enable robust production of diverse cell types, and facilitate regeneration of missing tissues.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Stem cells are crucial for achieving and maintaining homeostasis. Paradoxically, they contribute to an organism’s equilibrium through highly dynamic behavior, continuously balancing their population size by regulating rates of self-renewal and differentiation. Understanding the strategies used to accomplish this balance can provide the key to elucidating organismal homeostasis, as well as to modeling pathogenesis associated with disruption to this balance (e.g., cancer) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Passegué et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Singh et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Valuable insights into stem cell behavior can be derived from studying systems that rely on principles differing significantly from those characterizing vertebrate stem cells. Neoblasts, the pluripotent stem cells in planarians, function in tissue regeneration and maintenance, providing an intriguing platform in this regard. Neoblasts avoid quiescence, and quickly adapt to changes in organismal requirements by adjusting the quantities and types of cells they produce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">González-Estévez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>). These strategies challenge fundamental concepts of vertebrate stem cells. For example, in adult vertebrates, hematopoietic stem cells typically divide slowly, giving rise to rapidly dividing transit amplifying cells forming tissue-specific progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abkowitz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Becker et al., 2006</xref>). These progenitors bear the primary responsibility for maintaining homeostasis. Planarian neoblasts, by contrast, divide rapidly and do not employ transit amplifying cells for progeny production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Pearson, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Raz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, neoblasts do not seem to retain memory of the progeny cell types they generate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Raz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, despite being essentially ageless and immortal, neoblasts do not display cancerous-like states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Van Roten et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, elucidating how neoblasts balance self-renewal and differentiation can contribute to understanding fundamental strategies that facilitate tissue homeostasis and regeneration of lost or damaged tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Levin et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Prior modeling of neoblast dynamics in planarians has produced a valuable analytical framework for studying the dynamics of the entire neoblast system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Mangel et al., 2016</xref>). However, analyzing isolated neoblasts and their progeny can be instrumental for understanding how decisions are made at a single cell resolution, as well as for deriving physiological parameter values (e.g., corresponding to proliferation and differentiation) that are relevant to the larger system. <italic>In vivo</italic> analysis of individual neoblasts and their progeny is often achieved by applying subtotal irradiation to whole planarians, which results in near-complete neoblast ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>). Surviving neoblasts proliferate to form distinct colonies, allowing analysis of growth dynamics and progeny identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lei et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wagner et al., 2012</xref>). Though such analysis has been instrumental in uncovering regulators of proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wagner et al., 2012</xref>), a quantitative analysis of neoblast colony growth that integrates these principles has yet to be established and experimentally validated.</p>
<p>Several open questions need to be addressed in the development of such a model. For example, it is unclear whether neoblasts select their lineage identity in a synchronous manner or function independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bohr et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Reddien, 2018</xref>). Moreover, as indicated above, it is unclear whether neoblasts maintain memory of their decisions over successive rounds of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Pearson, 2022</xref>). In addition, as discussed in what follows, critical knowledge is lacking regarding the ability of neoblasts to switch from producing differentiating lineage to contributing to neoblast colony growth; an understanding of this switch is fundamental for analyzing the overall development of a colony, and for describing new tissue production in regeneration.</p>
<p>Herein, we begin to address these gaps, integrating experimental and computational approaches to analyze neoblast colony growth. Our analysis does not assume communication between neoblasts or memory of cell fate decisions; rather, it explores whether straightforward stochastic selection of division outcome can adequately describe the growth of a neoblast colony. Based on <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis of neoblast clone growth, neoblast division can result in three potential outcomes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lei et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Raz et al., 2021</xref>): (1) symmetric renewal, which generates two neoblasts; (2) symmetric differentiation, which generates two post-mitotic cells; and (3) asymmetric division, which produces a neoblast and a post-mitotic cell.</p>

</fig>
<p>In what follows, we study and analyze colony growth based on these principles. We derive key parameter values from experimental data and show that these values predict colony growth with high accuracy. Next, in a series of experiments, we seek to uncover whether the core principles that drive neoblast colony growth (as proposed in our model) are further shaped by individual neoblasts’ decisions regarding progeny lineage commitment. In particular, many S/G2/M neoblasts express fate-specifying transcription factors (FSTFs), which direct the differentiation of their progeny into specific lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Reddien, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Scimone et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, a neoblast can express different FSTFs in successive rounds of division, which results in production of post-mitotic progenitors of different lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Raz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the growth potential of the colony is not compromised by FSTF expression. Yet, it remains unclear how the growth of a colony might be affected when expression of a particular FSTF (and thus the corresponding cell lineage) is blocked: for example, does colony growth remain stable, with other lineages being overexpressed to compensate for the blocked lineage? Notably, our experimental perturbation analysis shows that blocking the expression of an FSTF incapacitates a proportion of neoblasts equivalent to the size of the lineage affected. This observation reveals a critical dependency: once a neoblast commits to a specific lineage, it retains this identity until cell division concludes. By contrast, inhibiting FSTFs during homeostasis resulted in an increase in the number of cycling cells, consistent with an activity of feedback mechanisms that regulate cell proliferation in homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Pearson and Sánchez Alvarado, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, our findings imply that simple design principles govern cell fate choices in neoblast colonies, and that accurate prediction of colony growth does not require assumptions of fate-specification memory, or coordination of cell fate choices between neoblasts. Moreover, our findings suggest that all neoblasts in a colony are functionally equivalent (i.e., able to self-renew and to divide to all cell types), and elucidate the contribution of decisions in individual planarian stem cells to achieving systemic homeostasis.</p>

<title>Analysis of neoblast colony growth</title>
<p>Following subtotal irradiation, a surviving neoblast may proliferate to form a colony (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). The growing colony is the exclusive source of new cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wagner et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">2011</xref>). We used an exponential growth equation to estimate the change in colony size over time of a successfully established colony by a surviving neoblast (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eq 1</xref>). The function incorporates three parameters to estimate colony growth: (1) average cell cycle length (<italic>τ</italic>); (2) symmetric renewal probability (<italic>p</italic>), where symmetric renewal rate per hour is <italic>p’ = p/τ</italic>; and (3) symmetric differentiation or neoblast elimination probability (<italic>q</italic>), where symmetric differentiation or neoblast elimination rate per hour is <italic>q’ = q/τ</italic>. Asymmetric divisions do not alter neoblast count (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).

<p>(A) Outline of colony growth following subtotal irradiation. Planarians are irradiated to eliminate all neoblasts (purple dots) except for a single survivor. The surviving neoblast forms a proliferating neoblast colony. (B) The impact of average cell cycle length (τ) and probability of symmetric renewal division (<italic>p</italic>) on colony size is shown (<italic>q</italic> was set to 0). (C) Re-analysis of BrdU incorporation time series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lei et al., 2016</xref>) in expanding planarian colonies was used for determining the average cell cycle length (Methods). Linear regression (blue line; y = 59.77 + 2.81 * t; Pearson r = 0.997) was used to identify the doubling time of the colony, and was determined as 29.7 hours (black arrow). (D) The fraction of symmetric renewal divisions was estimated by examining neoblast pairs in colonies (Methods). Scale = 10 µm. (E) The impact of symmetric differentiation or neoblast elimination on colony size was tested, assuming a 29.7 hour long cell cycle. Experimental data of colony sizes at different time points were overlaid to determine the value of biologically relevant parameter. Frankovits data collected here; Wagner, reanalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wagner et al., 2012</xref>); Raz, reanalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Raz et al., 2021</xref>).

<p>We used the solution to the equation, and included the initial colony size (<italic>N</italic>0), to predict colony sizes (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq 2</xref>) using a range of parameter values and evaluated the model predictions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig S1</xref>) with our own and published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Raz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wagner et al., 2012</xref>).

</disp-formula>
The plots in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> show how varying the value of growth parameters is predicted to affect colony size. The cell division time (<italic>τ</italic>) has the most substantial impact on colony growth. For example, a simulated colony with a fast (16 hours) cell cycle (with <italic>p</italic> and <italic>q</italic> set at 0.5 and 0, respectively) had a neoblast count approximately ten times larger than that reported in literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lei et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Raz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wagner et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>). To determine the average cell cycle time (<italic>τ</italic>), we re-analyzed available colony growth data that had previously been experimentally obtained using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) metabolic labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lei et al., 2016</xref>). In those experiments, BrdU was incorporated into DNA during both symmetric and asymmetric divisions using a pulse (4 hours) significantly shorter than the cell cycle time, followed by a chase of up to 72 hours (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). We predicted that the BrdU<sup>+</sup> cell number would grow linearly until the entire population doubles. Then, completion of successive cell divisions would lead to exponential growth in BrdU<sup>+</sup> cell number. Indeed, the colony growth was initially linear (Pearson r = 0.997), and using linear regression, we estimated that the colony doubling time, and hence the average cell cycle length, was 29.7 hours (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>The symmetric renewal probability (<italic>p</italic>) is a vital factor in colony growth, and even slight variations in <italic>p</italic> have large cumulative effects (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). We experimentally determined the symmetric renewal probability by subjecting planarians to subtotal irradiation (1750 rad; Methods) and identifying neoblasts via fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) with the <italic>smedwi-1</italic> marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Reddien et al., 2005b</xref>), a pan-neoblast marker. We imaged pairs of adjacent <italic>smedwi-1</italic><sup>+</sup> cell in the colony, and classified the <italic>smedwi-1</italic><sup>+</sup> cell pairs based on their <italic>smedwi-1</italic> expression levels: high-level pairs indicated symmetric renewal, while pairs with one high and one low <italic>smedwi-1</italic><sup>+</sup> cell categorized as asymmetric division (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). By analyzing 40 dividing pairs we estimated that 50% of divisions that produce at least one neoblast are symmetric renewal divisions, in agreement with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lei et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Raz et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>The value of <italic>q</italic>, representing symmetric differentiation and neoblast loss probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Raz et al., 2021</xref>), also plays a role in colony dynamics (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>, S1B). Yet the value of this parameter is more difficult to estimate experimentally (e.g., naïve measurement of cell death using TUNEL in irradiated planarians would be insufficient, because cell death is not limited to neoblasts). We analyzed the effect of different neoblast elimination probabilities on colony size (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig S1B-E</xref>), and compared the estimates of the analysis with colony size in our experimental data and by extracting colony size measurements from published literature (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E-F</xref>; Methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Raz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wagner et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">2011</xref>). Considering an average cell cycle length of 29.7 hours, the experimental data indicated that the average colony size was affected by symmetric differentiation or loss probability (<italic>q</italic>), estimated at ∼10% of the neoblasts in each cycle (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig S1B-E</xref>). Given the values derived for <italic>q</italic>, we can conclude that symmetric renewal (<italic>p</italic>) and asymmetrically dividing neoblasts each account for 45% of cell divisions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2G</xref>; Methods).</p>
<p><italic>In vivo</italic>, we observed a large variation in the size of the colonies at each time point (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>). This could be a consequence of an altered delay between irradiation and the onset of colony growth, or from a stochastic decision to undergo symmetrical or asymmetrical division in the early colony. Despite this variability, the observed exponential growth suggested a steady proliferation rate once the colony founding neoblast recovered at day four (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>, S1A).</p>

<title>Inhibition of lineage differentiation reduces neoblast colony size</title>
<p>Regulating growth and homeostasis requires balancing self-renewal and progeny production. To better understand how neoblasts maintain this balance, we focused on the interplay between the overall growth of the colony and the ability of individual neoblasts to express FSTFs, which are required for specific progeny production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Scimone et al., 2014</xref>). More specifically, we investigated how inhibiting differentiation into specific lineages, by suppressing FSTF expression, influences colony size. Considering the linear correlation between post-mitotic progeny production and neoblast number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wagner et al., 2012</xref>), we hypothesized three potential outcomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>) and their probable effects on symmetric renewal (<italic>p</italic>) and symmetric differentiation or elimination (<italic>q</italic>): (1) Unchanged: <italic>p</italic> and <italic>q</italic> remain balanced, resulting in no change in colony size. This outcome would suggest that the balance of self-renewal and progeny generation is preserved through compensatory production of alternative cell types when differentiation to a specific lineage is suppressed. (2) Larger: An increase in <italic>p</italic>, leading to larger colonies, possibly due to fewer asymmetric divisions in the blocked lineage. (3) Smaller: An increase in <italic>q</italic>, leading to smaller colonies, possibly because neoblasts committed to the blocked lineage have become dysfunctional. We used published frequencies of three major lineages (epidermis, intestine, and <italic>foxF-1</italic><sup>+</sup> neoblasts) to estimate the size of the colony in each of the described scenarios (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Raz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Scimone et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>). Theoretically, inhibiting a predominant lineage, such as the epidermal lineage (28%), may significantly affect colony size, which could be observed experimentally, whereas changes in colony size following inhibition of smaller lineages could be difficult to distinguish within the experimental time scale.</p>

<p>(A) Models for lineage growth. Potential outcomes of lineage inhibitions were assessed by altering the colony growth and degradation parameters. Applying known lineage frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Raz et al., 2021</xref>) to the models indicated that inhibiting production of a major lineage could dramatically impact colony size (left, epidermis). By contrast, inhibition of smaller lineages (middle, right) might have a smaller impact, which would be difficult to detect (Blue: increase in symmetric renewal; red: unchanged renewal and degradation; yellow: increase neoblast degradation). Growth was calculated using the following values: <italic>N0</italic> = 5, <italic>τ</italic> = 29.7 hr, and growth lag time of 5 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Raz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wagner et al., 2012</xref>).

<p>On the basis of this assumption, we inhibited differentiation into the epidermal lineage after subtotally irradiating planarians. Following a four-day recovery after subtotal irradiation, we suppressed the FSTF <italic>zfp-1</italic>, which is critical for production of differentiating epidermal progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig S2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>), but does not impact directly other lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>). Then, we evaluated neoblast colony sizes in <italic>zfp-1</italic>-suppressed (<italic>zfp-1</italic> (RNAi)) planarians at three time points (7, 9, and 12 days post-irradiation; dpi), and compared them with control colony sizes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>, Methods). Initially (7 dpi), colony sizes were similar. However, at 9 dpi, <italic>zfp-1</italic> (RNAi) colonies were significantly smaller than in controls. Moreover, unlike in controls, <italic>zfp-1</italic> (RNAi) colonies showed no additional growth, on average, during the period between 9 dpi and 12 dpi, though there was a slight increase in the median colony size (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>Our basic assumption was that reduction in colony size (vs. control) following <italic>zfp-1</italic> inhibition would indicate an increase in symmetric differentiation or elimination (<italic>q</italic>). However, an alternative possibility is that <italic>zfp-1</italic> inhibition causes mitotic arrest in neoblasts—which would prevent proliferation but would not necessarily result in cell death. We tested whether <italic>zfp-1</italic> (RNAi) colonies had a lower number of cycling neoblasts. We detected neoblasts in mitosis using immunofluorescence (IF) with an anti-H3P-antibody (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>; Methods). We found that control colonies did not significantly differ from <italic>zfp-1</italic> (RNAi) colonies in the number of H3P<sup>+</sup> cells, either in absolute numbers or normalized to average neoblast counts in colonies (Methods). This result suggested that FSTF inhibition did not cause a general mitotic arrest. Further analysis with 2’-Deoxy-2’-fluoro-5-ethynyluridine (EdU) labeling (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>; Methods) showed a substantial decrease in EdU<sup>+</sup> nuclei in <italic>zfp-1</italic> (RNAi) animals (vs. controls), indicating reduced new cell production. However, normalizing EdU<sup>+</sup> nuclei to average colony size (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>; Methods) revealed a comparable proportion of cells entering S-phase. Given the unchanged ratios of cycling and mitotic cells, we can conclude that the diminished colony size following <italic>zfp-1</italic> suppression is indeed likely to result either from increased symmetric differentiation or neoblast elimination (<italic>q</italic>). We further suggest that neoblast elimination is a more plausible explanation than increased symmetric differentiation: If <italic>zfp-1</italic> suppression were to lead to increased symmetric differentiation, we would expect to observe a noticeable decline in the number of neoblasts within colonies, while proliferation rates remained stable. Yet, the non-significant difference in EdU-labeling (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>) between <italic>zfp-1</italic> (RNAi) and control colonies suggested that inhibition of the FSTF <italic>zfp-1</italic> likely led to increased neoblast elimination.</p>

<title>Specialized neoblasts are produced in <italic>zfp-1</italic> (RNAi) colonies</title>
<p>Building upon our findings regarding lineage-specific inhibition effects, we next investigated how RNAi of <italic>zfp-1</italic> affected the prevalence of other specialized neoblasts in colonies. We hypothesized that if neoblast elimination was the primary effect of <italic>zfp-1</italic> inhibition, we would observe an absolute decrease in specialized neoblasts of other lineages (e.g., intestine), but not necessarily a relative decrease. We used subtotal irradiation, and following recovery we inhibited <italic>zfp-1</italic>. Then, we counted specialized neoblasts expressing intestine lineage markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Scimone et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>), and <italic>tgs-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Raz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>), which is suggested to label neural progenitors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A-B</xref>; Methods). Both control and <italic>zfp-1</italic> (RNAi) colonies contained specialized neoblasts. Notably, a decrease in intestine specialized neoblasts was detectable, aligned with the reduced colony size (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). Small numbers of <italic>tgs-1</italic><sup>+</sup> neoblasts were observed, with no significant reduction in their counts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). Together, these results suggested that specialized neoblasts were produced in <italic>zfp-1</italic> (RNAi) colonies, but that production of other (non-suppressed) lineages did not increase. This indicated that neoblast elimination predominantly accounts for the reduction in colony size following suppression of the epidermal lineage, without compensation by overproduction of other lineages.</p>

<p>To further analyze the impact of <italic>zfp-1</italic> inhibition on colony growth, we examined the numbers of neoblasts in 64 control colonies and in 53 <italic>zfp-1</italic> (RNAi) colonies, at 12 dpi (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C-D</xref>).

Importantly, more <italic>zfp-1</italic> (RNAi) animals failed to develop colonies compared to controls (55% and 25%, <italic>zfp-1</italic> (RNAi) and control colonies, respectively). This might have resulted from the stochastic selection of a <italic>zfp-1</italic> identity by the neoblasts that initially established the colony, and which led to their further dysfunction, and was therefore detrimental to the development of the colony.</p>

<title>Simulation of colony growth following <italic>zfp-1</italic> inhibition</title>
<p>We developed a simulation to recapitulate the observed reduction in colony growth following <italic>zfp-</italic>1 inhibition. Our simulation methodology was designed to mimic real-world neoblast dynamics under <italic>zfp-1</italic> inhibition in a colony, using empirically derived probabilities for each cell cycle outcome. First, we randomly sampled initial colony sizes from the set counted at 7 dpi (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). In every simulation cycle, each neoblast fate was selected based on the probabilities of cell cycle outcomes identified above, derived from empirical data (symmetric renewal, asymmetric division, symmetric differentiation or elimination; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2G</xref>). The change in colony size was calculated over approximately six cell cycles. We conducted 100 iterations per simulation and compared the results with experimental data (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>; Methods). The simulated colony sizes closely matched the experimental observations. When simulating <italic>zfp-1</italic> (RNAi) colony growth by increasing the symmetric differentiation or elimination probability (<italic>q</italic>) by the known proportion of <italic>zfp-1</italic><sup>+</sup> neoblasts, the model recapitulated the experimental findings (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E-F</xref>). Notably, many simulated <italic>zfp-1</italic> (RNAi) colonies failed to grow, often because of initial sampling of a state of symmetric differentiation or elimination, prohibiting further development of the colony (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4F</xref>).</p>
<p>The agreement of these simulations with the experimental results is aligned with a model where neoblasts independently select their cell cycle outcome based on a replication outcome distribution without maintaining any memory of previous replication outcomes. Moreover, inhibition of a gene required for neoblast differentiation (e.g., FSTF) impedes the contribution of neoblasts that randomly selected this identity from any further contribution to colony growth across the timescale of the simulation.</p>

<title>Combined suppression of low-frequency lineages affects neoblast colony formation</title>
<p>Our model and simulations indicate that inhibition of smaller lineages will not result in detectably smaller colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig S3A-C</xref>). We tested this model prediction by comparing colonies produced following suppression of intestine lineage progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Forsthoefel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>), which account for 14% of the produced progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Raz et al., 2021</xref>). Indeed, highly efficient inhibition of the intestine lineage by RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig S3D</xref>), did not result in reduced colony size or colony production, in agreement with our model (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4G-H</xref>, S3A). This result corroborated the model’s predictions regarding lower-frequency lineages (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>): the potential increase in <italic>q</italic> following suppression of differentiation to a lower-frequency lineage had undetectable effect on colony size. However, the model predicts that inhibition of several lineages, which collectively amount to a larger fraction of produced progenitors, may generate a detectable difference in successful colony establishment. We co-suppressed the production of intestine lineage together with <italic>foxF-1</italic><sup>+</sup> progenitors, which together amount to 25% of the progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Raz et al., 2021</xref>), following subtotal irradiation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4I</xref>). The co-inhibition of the two lineages resulted in a highly significant increase in the failure to establish colonies (8/9; 88.9%), compared to their controls (3/19; 15.8%; Fisher’s exact test two-tailed P = 4×10<sup>-4</sup>).</p>
<p>These results reinforce the hypothesis that FSTF inhibition reduces colony growth (vs. control), primarily through increased neoblast elimination, without compensatory increases in other lineages. The results also suggest that a neoblast that has selected an identity, but that cannot complete proliferation and differentiation, will not be able to adopt any other identity in this experimental timescale. Based on these conclusions, we propose a semi-stochastic model for selecting the outcome of neoblast division, assuming no memory or coordination between cells, that is sufficient for describing neoblast colony growth.</p>

<title>Inhibition of <italic>zfp-1</italic> does not induce overexpression of other lineages in homeostasis</title>
<p>Clonal analysis is a powerful approach for studying neoblast proliferation and progeny production. However, stem cell behavior in homeostasis may differ from that observed in clonal growth. For example, unlike in clonal expansion, the stem cell population size remains unchanged during homeostasis, indicating the differential activity of feedback mechanisms. Moreover, the vastness of the neoblast population in homeostasis allows to examine the ability of neoblasts to respecify their lineage overtime, and to determine if FSTF inhibition results in an increase to cell loss rate.</p>
<p>We examined whether the suppression of a major lineage production has resulted in overproduction of other lineages, a phenomenon that we did not observe in colonies. First, we used two published gene expression datasets from FACS-purified S/G2/M neoblasts in <italic>zfp-1</italic> (RNAi) and control animals collected at various time points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>) (Methods).

<p>Methods). Conversely, upregulated genes following <italic>zfp-1</italic> suppression were primarily associated with protonephridial or neural neoblasts (30/57 and 20/57 genes, respectively; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>; Table S2), consistent with the original data analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>). Notable upregulated genes included transcription factors, such as <italic>nkx2-like</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Currie et al., 2016</xref>), <italic>hunchback-like</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Reddien et al., 2005a</xref>), <italic>runt-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Sandmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wenemoser et al., 2012</xref>), and <italic>tgs-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>). Overexpression was evident from an intermediate timepoint (9 days post RNAi), whereas epidermal genes downregulation occurred earlier (6 days post RNAi; 30%, 20/67; FDR &lt; 1E-5).</p>
<p>We hypothesized that biologically meaningful upregulation of neuron- and protonephridia-associated genes in neoblasts following <italic>zfp-1</italic> inhibition would result in overexpression of genes associated with these cell types in whole tissues, reflecting their increased production. To test this hypothesis, we examined published gene expression data from whole and regenerated tissues following <italic>zfp-1</italic> inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>). Predictably, the majority of downregulated genes were associated with the epidermis (70%, 490/698; Fold change &lt; -2; FDR &lt; 1E-5; Table S3; Methods). Examination of upregulated genes showed that only a small fraction of the genes was associated with either protonephridial (4.9%) or neural (12.7%) expression at any examined time point (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>; Table S4; Methods). Therefore, gene expression analysis of whole tissues provided no evidence of an overrepresentation of neural or protonephridia cells in <italic>zfp-1</italic> (RNAi) animals, suggesting that cells related to these lineages were not excessively produced. Conversely, 37% of the overexpressed genes following <italic>zfp-1</italic> (RNAi) in the whole tissue libraries were associated with intestinal cell types, despite no evidence for overrepresentation of intestine-associated FSTFs in neoblasts isolated from <italic>zfp-1</italic> (RNAi) animals compared to controls (Table S4).</p>
<p>In <italic>zfp-1</italic> (RNAi) neoblast colonies, we observed an absolute reduction in cycling cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). We tested whether this phenotype was recapitulated in homeostatic, unirradiated, <italic>zfp-1</italic> (RNAi) animals by EdU labeling. We injected <italic>zfp-1</italic> or control double-stranded (dsRNA; Methods), and following three and five days, we performed EdU labeling by a 16 hour EdU pulse (Methods). Interestingly, there was an increase in EdU<sup>+</sup> nuclei in the <italic>zfp-1</italic> (RNAi) animals at both timepoints (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>). Investigating the potential correlation with apoptosis via TUNEL labeling revealed no early increase in cell death, only appearing at later stages (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>; Methods). Therefore, <italic>zfp-1</italic> inhibition does not trigger an acute rise in neoblast cell death that might induce hyperproliferation.</p>
<p>Colony sizes following <italic>zfp-1</italic> (RNAi) were reduced, yet cycling cell numbers in homeostasis were increased. Similar results were reported for the epidermal regulator <italic>Smed-p53</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Pearson and Sánchez Alvarado, 2010</xref>): neoblast colonies following <italic>p53</italic> (RNAi) are strikingly smaller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wagner et al., 2012</xref>), yet in homeostasis, <italic>p53</italic> (RNAi) animals show an increased number of mitoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Pearson and Sánchez Alvarado, 2010</xref>), and even initially an increase in canonical neoblast markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Pearson and Sánchez Alvarado, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Considering that in homeostasis <italic>zfp-1</italic> (RNAi) planarians show greater numbers of cycling cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>) and intestinal gene overexpression in tissue (Table S4) as compared with controls, we conducted a targeted analysis to quantify the number of newly generated intestine progenitors in <italic>zfp-1</italic> (RNAi) animals. We counted intestine progenitors <italic>in situ</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref>; Methods), and found a higher proportion of intestine progenitors in the <italic>zfp-1</italic> (RNAi) animals as compared with controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref>; Mann–Whitney two-tailed U test <italic>P</italic> = 0.008). Interestingly, in our analyses of growing colonies, we did not observe a parallel difference in intestine neoblast proportion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>), leading us to speculate that the rise in cycling cells in homeostasis was an indirect effect of <italic>zfp-1</italic> RNAi suppression, and indicating of the limits of neoblast analysis in colonies. In other words, integration of the analysis from homeostasis with our colony data suggests that <italic>zfp-1</italic> inhibition did not lead to a direct amplification of other lineages, but more likely to an indirect amplification of the intestine lineage.</p>

Herein, we sought to test whether growth in a neoblast colony is consistent with a model that does not assume communication between neoblasts or memory of cell fate decisions, but instead relies on stochastic selection of division outcome (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). We further sought to enrich this model by understanding the interplay between neoblast lineage decisions and colony growth.</p>

<title>Analysis of neoblast colony expansion</title>
<p>The initial model we developed was grounded in simple principles of colony growth (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eq 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>), in which cell fate decisions are made stochastically and independently of one another, as a function of the following parameters: average cell cycle length, symmetric renewal rate, and symmetric differentiation and neoblast elimination rate. We experimentally derived parameter values and compared the model’s predictions to experimental data. Our findings suggested that the reliance on minimal assumptions provides a good description of neoblast colony growth following subtotal irradiation. The model captured the average colony growth within the tested time range, despite notable variability in observed colony sizes at a given time point. Based on these results, we suggest that if slow cycling neoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Molinaro et al., 2021</xref>) emerge in colonies, their contribution for colony growth is likely negligible, allowing their exclusion from the model without sacrificing accuracy.</p>
<p>To better understand the potential consequences of random neoblast loss or excessive symmetric differentiation at early stages of colony growth, we used colony growth simulations, where each cell selected independently the outcome of its division. These simulations predicted that a fraction of colonies would fail to develop because of these random effects, a prediction that was corroborated by experimental results. This alignment demonstrates the utility of neoblasts as a system for studying stem cell colony formation and exploring concepts of stem cell behavior.</p>

<title>Consequences of lineage-specific differentiation inhibition</title>
<p>Moving from the fundamental aspects of neoblast colony growth, we next tested how limiting lineage identity selection affected neoblasts. We suppressed the expression of key fate-specifying genes to dissect how stem cells respond to inhibition of their differentiation trajectory. The transition from measuring general colony growth to specific lineage perturbations allowed us to examine the association of proliferation and lineage specification. In particular, suppressing the master epidermal regulator <italic>zfp-1</italic>, corresponding to the most abundant planarian cell lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Raz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>), drastically reduced neoblast colony growth. This observation led us to consider how stem cells in a colony balance self-renewal and differentiation, and why both processes were disrupted by blocking differentiation to a single lineage. We suggest several interpretations for this observation: First, if we assume that a neoblast can alternate between self-renewal and production of differentiated progeny in each cell cycle, then a decision to produce a blocked progeny may preclude further divisions of the neoblast. A second possibility is that the presence of a specific lineage, epidermal progenitors in this case, is required for other neoblasts to proliferate; in this case, suppression of differentiation could indirectly limit colony growth. The first interpretation is more likely relevant for understanding colony growth given our observation that combined suppression of several smaller lineages produced a similar inhibition to colony establishment.</p>
<p>The progressive reduction in colony size indicated that inhibition of a specific lineage reduced the fraction of neoblasts that contributed to colony growth, possibly due to their failure to produce the blocked lineage and to alter their progeny identity. Interestingly, in unirradiated animals with abundant neoblasts, <italic>zfp-1</italic> inhibition led to increased cell proliferation – a response also noted after suppressing other regulatory genes like <italic>Smed-p53</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Pearson and Sánchez Alvarado, 2010</xref>). This proliferation increase appeared before a rise in cell death, suggesting that cell death did not induce excessive proliferation in early stages. The difference in the consequence of lineage suppression in a neoblast colony and in unirradiated animals indicates that differential activity of feedback mechanisms regulates neoblast proliferation. We speculate that following subtotal irradiation, the near complete depletion of neoblasts and their progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Eisenhoffer et al., 2008</xref>), alters the regulation of surviving neoblasts, and leading to their rapid proliferation, which is not typical for neoblasts in homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wenemoser and Reddien, 2010</xref>). Further investigation is needed into compensatory mechanisms that planarians use to maintain overall tissue integrity when differentiation processes are disrupted.</p>

<title>A stochastic model for independent selection of cell division outcome in colonies</title>
<p>Our study investigates the mechanism behind neoblast division outcome selection. An exponential growth function describes the increase in colony size and the differentiation of progeny in the timescale of the analysis, closely aligning with our experimental results and published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Raz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wagner et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, this function operates without parameters for coordination of division outcome between neoblasts, or neoblast memory. It posits that division outcomes are guided by an innate distribution of cell fates encoded within the neoblasts. We hypothesize that this distribution is modifiable by regional signals (e.g., Wnt, BMP), which indicate the neoblast location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gaviño and Reddien, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Petersen and Reddien, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wurtzel et al., 2017</xref>), and by injury signals (e.g., ERK), that modulate division rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bohr et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tasaki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wurtzel et al., 2015</xref>). This strategy facilitates the dynamic balance in cell lineage production and meeting the organism needs without direct communication between neoblasts, and promotes return to homeostasis.</p>
<p>The emerging model enhances the understanding of neoblast dynamics and contributes to broader knowledge of stem cell behavior. The interplay between lineage-specific differentiation, proliferation, and resultant physiological adaptations presents a robust strategy for using pluripotent stem cells for re-achieving balance, in a manner that is not found in many non-regenerative organisms. This could inspire future research of pluripotent stem cells and their applications for regenerative biology.</p>

<p>(A) Simulation (gray) and comparison to experimental data (red) of neoblast colonies in control and <italic>hnf-4</italic> (RNAi) animals. The simulation indicates that given the variability in colony size, detecting significant differences in colony size is unlikely for this lineage. Each dot represents a single simulation (gray) or an experimentally determined size (red). (B-C) Simulations of colony sizes over 6 cycles of replication starting approximately at day seven post irradiation. (B) Boxplots showing the distribution of colony sizes (horizontal line, median; box, interquartile range (IQR); vertical line, 99% range). Each dot represents a single simulation. (C) Simulation of colony growth (line) shows growth over time (dot, median; vertical line, IQR). (D) The RNAi efficacy was evaluated through assessment of viability of fragments obtained from animals following a single feeding of dsRNA that targeted intestine FSTFs (<italic>hnf-4, gata4/5/6, nkx2.2</italic>), compared to a non-targeting control dsRNA (<italic>unc22</italic>). All fragments derived from worms fed with dsRNA targeting intestine FSTFs died within four days post-feeding, demonstrating that a single dsRNA feeding induced a robust effect.</p></caption>

<p>This manuscript establishes a mathematical model to estimate the key parameters that control the repopulation of planarian stem cells after sublethal irradiation as they undergo fate-switching as part of their differentiation and self-renewal process. The findings are <bold>valuable</bold> for future investigation of stem cell division in planarians. The methods are <bold>solid</bold>, integrating modeling with perturbations of key transcription factors known to be critical for cell fate decisions, but the authors have only shown that this is the case for a small number of stem cell types.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is a very creative study using modeling and measurement of neoblast dynamics to gain insight into the mechanism that allows these highly potent cells to undergo fate-switching as part of their differentiation and self-renewal process. The authors estimate growth equation parameters for expanding neoblast clones based on new and prior experimental observations. These results indicate neoblast likely undergo much more symmetric self-amplifying division than loss of the population through symmetric differentiation, in the case of clone expansion assays after sublethal irradiation. Neoblasts take on multiple distinct transcriptional fates related to their terminally differentiated cell types, and prior work indicated neoblasts have a high plasticity to switch fates in a way linked to cell cycle progression and possibly through a random process. Here, the authors explore the impact of inhibition of key transcription factors defining such states (ie &quot;fate specifying transcription factors&quot;, FSTFs) plus measurement and modeling in the clone expansion assay, to find that inhibition of factors like zfp1 likely cause otherwise zfp1-fated neoblasts to fail to proliferate and differentiation without causing compensatory gains in other lineages. A mathematical model of this process assuming that neoblasts do not retain a memory of prior states while they proliferate, and transition across specified states can mimic the experimentally determined decreased sizes of clones following inhibition of zfp1. Complementary approaches to inhibit more than one lineage (muscle plus intestine) supports the idea that this is a more general process in planarian stem cells. These results provide an important advance for understanding the fate-switching process and its relationship to neoblast growth.</p>
<p>Overall I find the evidence very well presented and the study compelling. It offers an important new perspective on the key properties of neoblasts. I do have some comments to clarify the presentation and significance of the work.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Cell cycle duration and cell fate choice are critical to understanding the cellular plasticity of neoblasts in planarians. In this study, Tamar et al. integrated experimental and computational approaches to simulate a model for neoblast behaviors during colony expansion.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The finding that &quot;arresting differentiation into specific lineages disrupts neoblast proliferative capacities without inducing compensatory expression of other lineages&quot; is particularly intriguing. This concept could inspire further studies on pluripotent stem cells and their application for regenerative biology.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, the absence of a cell-cell feedback mechanism during colony growth and the likelihood of the difference needs to be clarified. Is there any difference in interpreting the results if this mechanism is considered? More explanation and discussion should be included to distinguish the stages controlled by the one-step model from those discussed in this study. Although hnf-4 and foxF have been silenced together to validate the model, a deeper understanding of the tgs-1+ cell type and the non-significant reduction of tgs-1+ neoblasts in zfp-1 RNAi colonies is necessary, considering a high neural lineage frequency.</p>
