<title>Abstract</title>
<p>De Barsy syndrome is a recessive progeroid disease classified under the group of cutis laxa syndromes. The disease is attributed to loss-of-function mutations in <italic>PYCR1</italic> or <italic>ALDH18A1</italic>, leading to premature skin aging. Here we report five <italic>PYCR1</italic> pathogenic alleles and a mouse knockout model of the disease. Through these investigations, we have confirmed the key role of PYCR1 in preventing dermal thinning and other connective tissue abnormalities. However, it remains unknown whether endogenous PYCR1 levels undergo changes during normal aging. To address this query, we examined its levels in cultured human cutaneous fibroblasts subjected to induced or replicative senescence. In both instances, PYCR1 levels dropped and correlated with the loss of proliferative capacity. Furthermore, we validated the relevance of these findings <italic>in vivo</italic>, by comparing young and chronologically aged human skin, and found that the levels of PYCR1 in the dermis, but not the epidermis, significantly decreased with age. Our results confirm that the loss of PYCR1 is a driver of human skin aging and that its levels in healthy individuals can serve as a biomarker for connective tissues undergoing normal chronological aging.</p>

<p>De Barsy Syndrome (DBS, <underline>MIM:614438, MIM:219150</underline> and <underline>MIM:616603</underline>) is a recessive progeroid disease belonging to cutis laxa syndromes, which are characterized by wrinkled, thin and translucent skin that is more prominent at the hands, feet and the abdomen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Zampatti et al. 2012</xref>). Patients’ skin exhibits fragmentation and rarefaction of elastic fibers and only mild collagen irregularities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Reversade et al. 2009</xref>). The syndrome is caused by loss-of-function mutations affecting either PYCR1 <italic>(pyroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1)</italic> or P5CS (<italic>pyroline-5-carboxylate synthase)</italic>, the two main enzymes responsible for proline anabolism (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Fischer-Zirnsak et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Reversade et al. 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>Unexpectedly, proline levels in sera or primary fibroblasts from affected PYCR-deficient individuals are within normal range arguing against proline auxotrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Dimopoulou et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Escande-Beillard et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Fischer-Zirnsak et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Reversade et al. 2009</xref>). The exact molecular etiology of PYCR1-deficiency remains largely enigmatic and its link to normal chronological aging has not been examined.</p>
<p>We report here five additional patients (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) that displayed prominent acrogeria and a typical DBS face gestalt (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Sanger sequencing revealed four novel germline mutations in <italic>PYCR1</italic> that were homozygous in the affected children and had never been described in UK10K or gnomAD databases. In family 1, a single homozygous c.3G&gt;A variant leading to the loss of p.Met1 resulted in the total absence of endogenous PYCR1 and a significant reduction in PYCR2 level (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">E</xref>). In family 2, a homozygous intronic splice site mutation c.633+5G&gt;A, which caused an in-frame exon 5 skipping, resulted in reduced full-length PYCR1 and a smaller isoform corresponding to PYCR1<sup>Δe5</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">F</xref>). Patients from families 3 and 4 segregated the following germline recessive variants c.721G&gt;A; p.(Ala241Thr) and c.197T&gt;C; p.(Leu66Pro), respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">D</xref>). These five patients extend the allelic spectrum of DBS and confirm the importance of PYCR1 for ensuring skin homeostasis in humans.</p>
<p>To obtain a potential animal model of DBS, we generated a constitutive <italic>Pycr1</italic> mouse knockout line. mRNA and protein analysis showed that <italic>Pycr1</italic> mutant mice had little, to no, residual <italic>Pycr1</italic> left, consistent with a complete deletion of both alleles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1G, H</xref> and Supplementary Figures S1A-D). <italic>Pycr1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice were born to Mendelian ratios, were viable and fertile with a lifespan comparable to <italic>WT</italic> siblings (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref> and Supplementary Figure S1E).</p>
<p>We next sought to characterize the effects of <italic>Pycr1</italic> depletion in the dermal lineage, which is the most severely affected tissue in DBS patients. While their epidermis remained unaffected, <italic>Pycr1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice exhibited significant dermis thinning compared to <italic>WT</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>), with significantly less collagen fibers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1K</xref> and Supplementary Figures S1F-G).</p>
<p>Although the thinning of the dermis seen in <italic>Pycr1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> animals suggests a partial resemblance to the human disease, the mice’s overall phenotype remains relatively normal. We thus speculate that PYCR2 might have the potential to compensate for the loss of PYCR1 in mice. In <italic>Pycr1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mouse fibroblasts, the levels of PYCR2 remained unchanged (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). In contrast, human fibroblasts lacking PYCR1 see a knock-off effect resulting in a significant decrease in PYCR2 levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). This species-specific difference, where the loss of <italic>Pycr1</italic> can be rescued by <italic>Pycr2</italic> in mice but not in human cutaneous fibroblasts, suggest that only double <italic>Pycr1/Pycr2</italic> knockout mice could phenocopy the full spectrum of DBS symptoms.</p>
<p>The progeroid phenotype caused by the loss of <italic>PYCR1</italic> in humans and its validation in mice highlight the importance of PYCR1 for sustaining the integrity of the skin. It is, however, unknown whether endogenous PYCR1 levels correlate with natural aging. To address this, we examined proline metabolism in the context of cellular senescence. The overexpression of <italic>P16, TP53</italic> or <italic>BRAF</italic><sup><italic>V600E</italic></sup> is known to trigger stress-induced senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">van Deursen 2014</xref>). Human dermal fibroblasts were thus engineered to overexpress these transgenes. Cellular senescence was assessed by Lamin B1 (LB1) and DCR2, two inversely regulated senescence markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Althubiti et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Dreesen et al. 2013</xref>), and by the loss of proliferation measured by PCNA. The RNA level of proline metabolic pathway components was unchanged (Supplementary Figure S2A), but the protein levels of endogenous PYCR1 and PYCR2 were decreased, while the levels of P5CS, PRODH and PYCR3 remained stable (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The changes in PYCR1 levels were specific to senescence, and not a general consequence of growth arrest, as contact inhibition induced-quiescence did not alter PYCR1 protein levels (Supplementary Figure S2B).</p>

<caption><title>PYCR1 levels are reduced in human senescent fibroblasts and aged dermis.</title>
<p><bold>(A)</bold> Western blot data show overexpression (o/e) of the transgenes <italic>P16, TP53</italic> and <italic>BRAF</italic><sup><italic>V600E</italic></sup> upon 4 days of doxycycline treatment. Levels of LB1 and DCR2 which are established senescence markers, decreased and increased respectively. PCNA, an established proliferation marker, is reduced upon doxycycline treatment. Endogenous PYCR1 and PYCR2 protein levels are reduced while PYCR3, P5CS and PRODH do not change significantly. <bold>(B)</bold> Senescence-induced by oxidative stress (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) leads to LB1, PCNA, PYCR1 and P5CS protein level reduction, and no changes in PYCR2 levels. GAPDH serves as loading control. <bold>(C)</bold> Three independent primary dermal fibroblast lines derived from three young healthy individuals were serially cultured to replicative senescence. Western blots on the three dermal primary fibroblast lines show that endogenous PYCR1, P5CS and LB1 protein levels decrease with loss of replicative capacity in human primary fibroblasts. GAPDH levels are unchanged and serve as a loading control. <bold>(D)</bold> β-galactosidase staining quantification shows that the percentage of blue stained fibroblasts in the late PDs is significantly higher compared to the early PDs. Error bars indicate mean ± SEM. Two-tailed Student’s t test ***p&lt;0.001, ****p&lt;0.0001 (n = 6). <bold>(E)</bold> Representative immunohistochemistry images illustrating PYCR1 expression (brown) and hematoxylin (blue) on skin samples from young (15 to 30 years old) and old donors (70 to 80 years old). Black arrows indicate PYCR1 positive staining in the dermis. Pairwise comparison was performed according to gender (M, male; F, female) and anatomical region of the skin where the biopsy was taken. Scale bar, 50 μm. <bold>(F)</bold> Staining quantification for pairs 1 and 2 reveals that PYCR1 level is lower in the dermis of old compared to young individuals (n=5 pictures/pair). Percentages of PYCR1 positive cells were calculated in 5 independent pictures from each sample. In each picture 3 sections of 20 cells were measured and averaged. Error bars indicate mean ± SEM. Two-tailed Student’s t test, *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001, ****p&lt;0.0001. <bold>(G)</bold> Graph demonstrates that the combined dermis quantification of PYCR1 positively stained cells is significantly lower in old compared to young individuals (n = 6 pairs). Error bars indicate mean ± SEM. Two-tailed Student’s t test, *p&lt;0.05. <bold>(H)</bold> Western blot illustrates that PYCR1 and P5CS protein levels reduce in <italic>WT</italic> cells upon replicative senescence, like LB1, whose reduction indicates that senescence is induced. After overexpression of PYCR1, LB1 level reduces, suggestive of no changes in senescence. GAPDH serves as loading control. <bold>(I)</bold> Schematic representation summarizing the findings of this study.

<p>The reduction of PYCR1 protein level was also observed upon oxidative stress, while PYCR2 protein levels remained stable and those of P5CS were reduced (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Although stress-induced senescence occurs physiologically, chronological telomere erosion serves as a stable contributing factor to normal aging. Thus, we sought to further characterize the effect of replicative senescence by culturing three healthy human fibroblast lines for extended population doublings (PD). Increased SA-β-galactosidase staining and reduced LB1 protein level (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">D</xref> and Supplementary Figure S2C) confirmed the occurrence of senescence, and were correlated with a gradual decline of PYCR1 and P5CS protein levels particularly at late time points (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Collectively, these findings along with the induced senescence experiments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), confirm a positive correlation between senescence and reduction of endogenous PYCR1 protein levels in human dermal fibroblasts.</p>
<p>To validate these results <italic>in vivo</italic>, we obtained healthy skin tissue from six young (aged 15-30 years) and six older (aged 65-80 years) individuals. Immunohistochemistry revealed that endogenous PYCR1 expression was significantly reduced in the dermis, but not epidermis, of old compared to young individuals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2E</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">G</xref> and Supplementary Figure 2D-E). These results are consistent with PYCR1 being an essential component for the homeostasis of dermal lineages, which is acutely compromised in DBS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Zampatti et al. 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall our data suggests that increasing PYCR1 activity in humans could potentially delay or mitigate connective tissue aging. To assess this hypothesis, human dermal fibroblasts engineered to overexpress PYCR1 were cultured to replicative senescence. In this <italic>in vitro</italic> model, senescence assessed by the level of LB1 could not be significantly rescued by overexpression of PYCR1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). However, several studies have shown that overexpression of PYCR1 is linked to hyperproliferation in a variety of solid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Chen et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Kuo et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Loayza-Puch et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Yan et al. 2019</xref>), suggesting that greater-then-normal PYCR1 expression can promote proliferation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Having been first documented in hepatocellular carcinoma, this phenomenon is likely to be lineage restricted and may become mobilized only once a cell has been oncogenically transformed. At this stage, it is fair to state that the genetic loss of PYCR1 is a driver of premature skin aging, while it can also serve as a marker of normal chronological aging in the human dermis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). It thus remains to be demonstrated if rewiring a cell’s metabolic flux towards increased proline anabolism, via PYCR1/2 and P5CS gain of activity, can mitigate the effect of chronological cellular aging.</p>

<title>Mice</title>
<p>The Pycr1 knockout line was generated by homologous recombination in murine ES cells. A targeting vector with 4.3 kb and 3.3 kb homology regions to the <italic>Pycr1</italic> locus was constructed to flank exons 3 to 6 with loxP sites in the same orientation to obtain an excision of the genomic region between the two loxP sites after cre-recombination (Supplementary Figure S1a). ES cells were screened by Southern blot and aggregated with tetraploid morulae. For genotyping gDNA was extracted from tail cuts of 21-25 days old mice using lysis buffer with the following components: 5 mM EDTA, 100 mM Tris pH8, 200 mM NaCl and 0.2% SDS. Nested PCR was performed to amplify the targeted regions of <italic>Pycr1</italic> (Supplementary data Figure S1b), followed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis.

<p>The article by Reversade and colleagues reports new mutations in the PYCR1 in a progeroid disease associated with premature skin aging. Using human cell culture and a newly generated mouse model of PYCR1deficiency they identify a role for this factor in maintaining dermal homeostasis and ECM production. I have some minor concerns about the role of PYCR1 in fibroblast survival vs function and the quantification of western blots.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Sotiropoulou et al. present an interesting study of an incredibly rare premature aging disease (De Barsy syndrome), examining both the underlying mechanisms at play behind the condition as well as how that biology may have a larger role in understanding features of normal aging, and in particular, human skin aging. The authors link one of the underlying genetic defects in De Barsy syndrome (PYCR1 mutations) to its phenotypic manifestations and then extrapolate those findings to present more preliminary data to suggest that a loss of PYCR1 may be a biomarker of normal human skin aging.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
- The study is important as De Barsy syndrome is challenging to study given its rarity, thus making it an understudied condition. Here the authors combine both human patient samples and murine models to offer a nice contribution to further understanding the pathophysiology of this disease.</p>
<p>- The authors are able to link some of the observed features in De Barsy syndrome preliminarily to more common aging models and processes (senescence, human skin dermal aging). They nicely show that the loss of Pycr1 in mice can provoke thinning of the dermis of mice while not affecting the epidermis. Furthermore, they present compelling data to suggest that Pycr2 may be compensating in mice (while not in humans) and this may contribute to the differences in lifespan observed between the mice and humans.</p>
<p>- Should these results be further verified, this could suggest that further study of Pycr1 and Pycr2 biology may offer new insights into aging and senescence in other tissues.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
- Some of the data appears preliminary and seems like it needs further analysis as described further below in my suggestions for the authors:</p>
<p>1. While the authors report that there is no difference in the lifespan of the Pycr1-KO mice, can they report whether there was overall weight loss or any size differences between the mice? This is helpful particularly when comparing the dermal thickness as well as considering how the global loss of Pycr1 may affect overall systemic health.</p>
<p>2. In Figure S2E, the comparison &quot;pairs&quot; seems somewhat arbitrarily chosen and it seems from the quantifications of these pairs that depending upon which young sample you compare to which old sample, you may end up with differing results. I think the more appropriate way to make this quantitative comparison would be to average the young samples and average the old samples and then compare them and perform statistics. This seems critical to really assess whether PYCR1 loss would be a consistent marker of human skin dermal aging. Additionally, it would be helpful to also look at Pycr2 expression in the normal young versus old dermis to see if the reported difference in Pycr1 is really something specific for Pycr1 and not something more general.</p>
<p>3. Are the labels mixed up in Figures 1J and 1K or am I reading it incorrectly? From what I can see the graph is showing that the dermal thickness and collagen intensity is higher in the Pycr1-/- mice. Similarly, the authors state that there is &quot;significantly less collagen fiber staining&quot;, although in Figure S1G neither the quantification of collagen I or collagen III are shown to be significant. These discrepancies need to be discussed or corrected.</p>
<p>4. Can the authors speculate further on why Pycr2 is also diminished in human patients (while it clearly remains present in the mice).</p>
<p>5. Can the authors comment on whether other canonical senescence features are seen in De Barsy syndrome (p16 positivity, senescence associated secretory phenotype, etc.)? Along these lines, there is an abundance of publicly available RNA-seq datasets from various forms of senescent cells. It would be interesting to examine these and see whether there is any loss of expression of PYCR1 or PYCR2 in these data, or is the loss of PYCR1 only seen at the protein level?</p>
