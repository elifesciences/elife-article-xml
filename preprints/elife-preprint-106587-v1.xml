<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Mitochondrial electron transport flavoprotein (ETF) insufficiency causes metabolic diseases known as a multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD). Although essential in muscle, we identified ETF dehydrogenase (ETFDH) as one of the most dispensable metabolic genes in neoplasia, and its expression is reduced across human cancers. ETF insufficiency caused by decreased ETFDH expression limits flexibility of OXPHOS fuel utilization but paradoxically increases cancer cell bioenergetics and accelerates neoplastic growth by retrograde activation of the mTORC1/BCL-6/4E-BP1 axis. Collectively, these findings reveal that while ETF insufficiency is rare and has detrimental effects in non-malignant tissues, it is common in neoplasia, where ETFDH downregulation leads to bioenergetic and signaling reprogramming that accelerate neoplastic growth.</p>

<title>Main</title>
<p>The mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) transfers electrons from reducing equivalents (NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub>) towards complexes I/II, or from peripheral metabolic enzymes that reduce coenzyme Q (ubiquinone, Q) to ubiquinol (QH<sub>2</sub>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. The electron transfer flavoproteins (ETFA and ETFB) accept electrons generated by the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids and fatty acids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. ETFs interact with ETF dehydrogenase (ETFDH or ETF-ubiquinone oxidoreductase) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, which controls electron flow towards complex III (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig.1A</xref>). Loss-of-function mutations in ETF/ETFDH occur in metabolic diseases known as multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. ETFDH is also essential for complex III activity in skeletal muscle <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Surprisingly, we observed that in contrast to muscle, ETFDH is one of the most non-essential metabolic genes in cancer cells. Paradoxically, ETFDH downregulation leads to enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and increased bioenergetic capacity of cancer cells. ETF insufficiency resulting from reduction in ETFDH levels triggers a tradeoff favored by cancer cells, whereby reduced flexibility in fuel utilization for oxidative phosphorylation is offset by retrograde signaling that remodels cancer cell bioenergetics to augment neoplastic growth.</p>

<title><italic>ETFDH</italic> is dispensable in cancer cells and its abrogation accelerates tumor growth</title>
<p>ETFDH is essential in skeletal muscle cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, a CRISPR-Cas9 knock out (KO) screen performed in a human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line (NALM6) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> ranked <italic>ETFDH</italic> as a top non-essential metabolic gene that clustered with well-established tumor suppressors <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>RB1</italic> (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig.1B</xref>). Mining DepMap also revealed that <italic>ETFDH</italic> is essential in only 1 out of 1150 cancer cell lines <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. This motivated us to examine the role of ETFDH in cancer. <italic>ETFDH</italic> mRNA levels are reduced in patient samples across different cancer types, including colon (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig.1C</xref>) and breast cancer (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig.1D</xref>). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining confirmed that ETFDH protein levels are significantly reduced in colorectal cancer vs. non-adjacent patient-derived tissues (NAT) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1A</xref>).</p>

<p>We next abrogated the <italic>ETFDH</italic> gene using a CRISPR-Cas9 approach in a variety of cancer cell lines including HCT-116 (human colorectal cancer), NT2197 (murine HER2+ breast cancer), 4T1 (murine triple negative breast cancer cells), and NALM6 cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig.1E-H</xref>). We also investigated the effects of ETFDH loss in non-transformed normal murine mammary gland (NMuMG) cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig.1I</xref>), a parental immortalized mammary epithelial cell line that was transformed with an oncogenic ErbB2 variant to generate NT2197 cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Notwithstanding their high baseline proliferation rates, ETFDH ablation significantly increased proliferation across all tested cancer cell lines (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig.1E-H</xref>). This was not caused by the inadvertent effects of the CRISPR-Cas9, as rescuing ETFDH expression in HCT-116 and NT2197 cells reverted proliferation rates to levels comparable to ETFDH-proficient controls (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig.1E-F</xref>). In contrast, ETFDH abrogation did not affect proliferation of non-transformed NMuMG cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig.1I</xref>). ETFDH KO HCT-116 cells also formed more colonies in soft agar (surrogate measurement of cellular neoplastic potential <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>) as compared to empty vector infected controls (WT EV), and ETFDH KO cells in which ETFDH was re-expressed (ETFDH Rescue) (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig.1J</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on these findings, we tested the impact of ETFDH loss on neoplastic growth <italic>in vivo.</italic> WT EV, ETFDH KO, or ETFDH Rescue HCT-116 cells were injected orthotopically in the caeca of SCID-BEIGE mice. Loss of ETFDH significantly increased the tumor growth rate and volume at endpoint relative to control and ETFDH Rescue cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1B-C</xref>). ETFDH loss also increased NT2197 tumor growth and the final tumor volume as compared to ETFDH-proficient tumors following orthotopic mammary fat pad injections in SCID-BEIGE mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1D-E</xref>). Altogether, these results show that <italic>ETFDH</italic> is an non-essential gene in cancer that is under-expressed across different cancer types, and that its disruption enhances neoplastic growth, while not affecting proliferation of non-transformed cells.</p>

<sec id="s1b">
<title>ETFDH abrogation results in ETF insufficiency that paradoxically increases bioenergetic capacity of cancer cells</title>
<p>In non-cancerous cells, ETFDH transfers electrons from catabolism of fatty acids and amino acids to the ETC (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig.2A</xref>). Palmitate oxidation (monitored by oxygen consumption) and <sup>13</sup>C leucine labelling into citrate (citrate m+2) were strongly attenuated by ETFDH abrogation in HCT-116 cells (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig.2B-C</xref>), which confirmed that ETF plays a role in fatty and amino acid catabolism in malignant cells. Thus, ETFDH loss induces ETF insufficiency in cancer cells that mirrors defects observed in non-malignant tissues. Surprisingly, ETFDH loss in HCT- 116 cells increased oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification, relative to control WT EV and ETFDH Rescues (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2A-B</xref>). ETFDH KO HCT-116 cells produced higher levels of ATP from oxidative phosphorylation (<italic>J</italic> ATP ox) as compared to ETFDH-proficient cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2C-D</xref>). Consequently, ETFDH loss increased the bioenergetic capacity of HCT-116 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2E</xref>). Comparable results were observed in NT2197 cells (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig.2D-H</xref>). Collectively, these findings suggest that although ETF insufficiency limits the ability of cancer cells to utilize lipids and amino acids, it paradoxically upregulates their mitochondrial metabolism and bioenergetic capacity.</p>

To further determine which mTOR complex is responsible for mediating the hyper-proliferative phenotype triggered by ETFDH loss, we selectively inactivated mTORC1 or mTORC2 by depleting RAPTOR or RICTOR, respectively using small hairpin RNA (shRNA) in WT and ETFDH KO HCT-116 cells (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig.3D</xref>). Depletion of RAPTOR, but not RICTOR strongly attenuated the proliferation of ETFDH KO cells (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig.3E-F</xref>). Moreover, the anti-proliferative effects of bisteric mTORC1-specific inhibitor BiS-35x <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> were stronger in ETFDH KO vs. ETFDH Rescue HCT-116 cells (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig.3G</xref>). Altogether, these data suggest that mTORC1, but not mTORC2 acts as a major mediator of hyper-proliferative phenotype triggered by ETFDH loss in cancer cells. Accordingly, the effects of amino acid deprivation on phospho-rpS6 (Ser240/244), and phospho-4E-BP1 (Ser65) were attenuated in ETFDH KO vs. WT control cells, which is consistent with the intracellular accumulation of amino acids upon ETFDH disruption (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3E-G</xref>). In turn, serum stimulation (Stim) resulted in comparable induction in phosphorylation of rpS6 (Ser240/244) and 4E-BP1 (Ser65) in ETFDH-deficient and proficient cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3E</xref>). Collectively, these findings suggest that ETFDH loss induces mTORC1 signaling at least in part by increasing intracellular amino acid levels.</p>
<p>Amino acid deprivation leads to general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2)-dependent phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eIF2 and subsequent induction of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) synthesis during the integrated stress response (ISR) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.

However, the ETFDH status in the cells did not affect ATF4 levels at baseline or upon amino acid depletion (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig.3H</xref>).

<title>ETFDH acts as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor</title>
<p>Data available in cBioPortal from 2683 samples across cancer types <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> indicate that missense or truncating mutations in ETFDH are rare (0.3%) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6A</xref>). This suggests that ETFDH is not lost, but rather downregulated in human cancers. We observed that DNA methylation inhibitors, 5-azacytidine (5-aza) and 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-2-deoxyC) increased ETFDH protein levels in HCT-116 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6B</xref>), thus suggesting that one of the potential mechanisms of downregulated <italic>ETFDH</italic> expression in neoplasia may stem from increased DNA methylation. Based on these observations, we developed a model that more closely reflects ETFDH downregulation, but not a complete loss, in human tumors using a method based on targeted poly(A) track insertion within endogenous genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. The length of the poly(A) track directly correlates with the reduction in amount of protein produced, allowing for the investigation of gene-dosage effects on ensuing phenotypes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Accordingly, mutants were designed by inserting poly(A) tracks of 12 and 18 adenosines [12A, equivalent to 4 consecutive AAA (Lys) codons (AAA)<sub>4</sub>; 18A, equivalent to 6 consecutive AAA (Lys) codons (AAA)<sub>6</sub>], as well as a control track (CTRL) [6 consecutive lysine AAG codons (AAG)<sub>6</sub>] (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig.6A</xref>, see methods). Based on an Alphafold rendered structure (version 2) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, we chose residue 38 in an unstructured loop as an insertion site (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig.6B</xref>). Of note, (AAA)<sub>6</sub> and (AAG)<sub>6</sub> stretches are translated in the equal number of Lys residues, whereby (AAA), but not (AAG), stretches decrease ETFDH protein levels (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6C</xref>). (AAG)<sub>6</sub> construct was thus used as a control to mitigate potential inadvertent effects of the insertion of poly-Lys on the ETFDH function. (AAA)<sub>4</sub> and (AAA)<sub>6</sub> stretches progressively reduced ETFDH protein abundance as compared to constructs harboring the (AAG)<sub>6</sub> track (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6C</xref>). The reduction in ETFDH protein levels was mirrored by a gene-dose dependent increase in mTORC1 signaling, BCL-6 expression and reduction in 4E-BP1, but not 4E-BP2 protein levels (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6C</xref>). Accordingly, <italic>Eif4ebp1</italic> mRNA levels were reduced in <italic>ETFDH</italic> dose-dependent manner, while <italic>Eif4ebp2</italic> mRNA levels remained unaffected (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6D</xref>). Moreover, reduction in ETFDH protein levels correlated with increased mtDNA content (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6E</xref>), oxygen consumption (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6F</xref>), ATP production from OXPHOS (<italic>J</italic>ATPox) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6G</xref>), bioenergetic capacity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6H</xref>), and cell proliferation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6I</xref>). Finally, ETFDH KO NT2197 tumors carrying (AAA)<sub>6</sub> insertions exhibit increased tumor growth and larger final tumor volumes relative to control tumors expressing (AAG)<sub>6</sub> insertions in SCID-BEIGE mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6J-K</xref>). Altogether, these findings show that ETFDH gene-dosage influences neoplastic growth, thus suggesting that ETFDH may act as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Notwithstanding that ETFDH mutations play a detrimental role in MADD metabolic disorders, we show that ETF insufficiency caused by reduced <italic>ETFDH</italic> expression plays a major role in rewiring cancer metabolism and signaling to stimulate neoplastic growth. Reduction of ETFDH levels appears to be a near-universal feature of cancer cells and is likely a consequence of DNA hypermethylation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6B</xref>), an event that is frequently observed among tumor suppressor genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Indeed, ETFDH was found among the most under-expressed metabolic enzymes in a study that compiled cancer microarray datasets <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Moreover, recent studies highlighted crosstalk between aberrant mTOR signaling and epigenetic perturbations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, which further reinforces the plausibility that epigenetic reprograming in cancer cells may underpin the pro-neoplastic role of ETFDH downregulation and/or explain resulting phenotypes.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, although ETF insufficiency limits the flexibility of cancer cells in using fuels (e.g., lipids and amino acids) for OXPHOS, it triggers retrograde signalling that established feed-forward loop via mTORC1 which leads to increased BCL-6 levels and reduced <italic>EIF4EBP1</italic> transcription (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6L</xref>). ETF insufficiency thus orchestrates enhanced mTORC1 signaling with downregulation of 4E-BP1 protein levels to reprogram protein synthesis and ultimately increase mitochondrial biogenesis and functions thereby providing selective proliferative advantage to cancer cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6L</xref>). To this end, ETF insufficiency allows cancer cells to trade of their metabolic flexibility for increased bioenergetic capacity and a re-wired signaling state that favors neoplastic growth. Importantly, while ETFDH plays an essential role in muscle, we did not observe a major effect of ETFDH disruption on proliferation, mTOR signaling or 4E-BP1 levels in non-transformed murine breast epithelial NMuMG cells. These observations suggest that ETF insufficiency causes remodeling of signaling and metabolic networks that are favourable to cancer cells.</p>
<p>Our findings are consistent with previously attributed tumor-suppressive effects of 4E-BP1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. More recently, it has been demonstrated that under certain contexts 4E-BPs may play a beneficial role for tumor survival. For instance, 4E-BPs may facilitate tumor growth by regulating global and selective mRNA translation under periods of cellular stress <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, including suppression of fatty acid biosynthesis under glucose deprivation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that 4E-BPs are likely to play more complex, context dependent roles during cancer progression than previously anticipated. Moreover, the role of different 4E-BP proteoforms in cancer was in general thought to be redundant. Our findings however demonstrate that in the context of ETF insufficiency selective decrease in 4E-BP1, but not 4E-BP2 levels plays a role in driving neoplastic growth thereby suggesting that 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 may play hitherto unappreciated non-overlapping roles in neoplasia.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we show that ETF insufficiency caused by reduced ETFDH expression causes retrograde signaling that remodels mitochondrial metabolism in a manner that drives neoplastic growth (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6L</xref>), while either being neutral (NMuMG) or deleterious (muscle cells) in non-malignant cells. These findings explain how disruption of mitochondrial enzyme, rather than reducing cellular fitness, is common in cancer because it increases mitochondrial energy flux to drive neoplastic growth.</p>

<title>Generation of ETFDH Knockout Cell Lines</title>
<p>To deplete endogenous ETFDH expression in HCT-116 and NALM6 cells, two guides RNA (gRNAs) targeting exon 6 and exon 9 of human ETFDH (against ETFDH sequences AGGTTGGCCGAATGCTAGGATGG and GATGTAGGGATACAAAAGGATGG) (refer to Supplementary Table 4 for gRNA sequences) were designed using CHOPCHOP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://chopchop.cbu.uib.no/">https://chopchop.cbu.uib.no/</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup> and purchased with the appropriate overhangs to be cloned into LentiCRISPRv2(GFP) (Addgene #82416). Cloning was carried out as previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>, with the following modifications: BsmBI-v2 (New England Biolabs) was used to digest the lentiCRISPRv2 plasmid; plasmid DNA was recovered using Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery Kit (Zymo Research), and ligation was performed overnight at 4°C. Transformation of the ligated plasmid was carried out at 42°C in chemically competent Stbl3 cells (Fisher Scientific). Bacteria were plated on Lysogeny Broth (LB)-agar plates containing ampicillin (1 µg/mL) (BioBasic). Extraction of plasmid DNA was conducted using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen) and samples were sequenced using primer for human U6 promoter (refer to Supplementary Table 5 for sequence). Nucleofection was used to deliver the validated lentiCRISPRv2 plasmids into HCT-116 and NALM6 cells. Transfections of the plasmids were carried out in Nucleofector cuvettes, according to the optimized protocols for NALM6 and HCT-116 cells (Lonza Bioscience), with 1×10<sup>6</sup> cells used and 1X PBS was used instead of the commercial 4-D Nucleofector solution. Post-nucleofection, cells were allowed to grow for 72 hours at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, prior to cell sorting (BD FACSAria™ Fusion Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences)). Cells expressing GFP were selected and grown in 96-well plates containing conditioned media (45% filtered culture media, 45% fresh media, &amp; 10% FBS). After two weeks, sorted clones were transferred into 24-well plates and later into 6-well plates to be collected and validated. Depletion of endogenous ETFDH protein levels in both HCT-116 and NALM-6 cells was initially confirmed by immunoblotting. Candidate clones with loss of ETFDH expression were kept for further validation. Moreover, the genomic DNA loci of candidate clones were sequenced and analyzed for insertion–deletion mutations (INDELs). Two sets of PCR primers were designed in regions flanking the CRISPR target sites (refer to Supplementary Table 5 for validation PCR sequences). Extraction of genomic DNA for each clone was carried out using the PureLink Genomic DNA Mini Kit (Fisher Scientific). Two rounds of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on the extracted genomic DNA (35 PCR cycles with Set 1 followed by 45 PCR cycles with Set 2) were carried out and gel electrophoresis was utilized to separate the PCR products. The smaller PCR product for each clone was excised and purified using the Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery Kit (Zymo Research). The products were sequenced, and chromatograms were analyzed for the presence of mutations causing a premature stop-codon or a frameshift. Insertion–deletion mutations (INDELs) in <italic>ETFDH</italic> were verified by PCR followed by sequencing, while the absence of ETFDH protein was confirmed by western blotting for HCT-116 cells and NALM6 cells.</p>
<p>To deplete ETFDH expression in NMuMG, NT2197 and 4T1 cells, two guides (gRNAs) targeting exon 2 of mouse Etfdh (against mEtfdh sequences 5’-ATTTTTATGCAGCGTATCACTGG-3’ and 5’-GAACATCTTGGAGCACACAGAGG-3’) were designed using CHOPCHOP and cloned in LentiCRISPRv2(GFP) (Addgene #82416) and sequenced as shown above. For lentiviral production, 2.5×10<sup>5</sup> HEK293T cells were seeded overnight in a 6-cm dish (Sarstedt). The next day, cells were co-transfected with 4µg of respective lentiCRISPRV2 GFP plasmid containing either one of the gRNA inserts or empty-lentiCRISPRV2 GFP plasmid, 2.66µg of psPAX2 packaging plasmid (Addgene 35002), and 1.66 µg of pMD2.G plasmid (Addgene #12259) using the jetPRIME transfection reagent as described by the manufacturer’s protocol (Polyplus transfection). Growth media was changed after 24 hours. After 48 hours, viral supernatant was filtered (0.45 µm filter; (Frogga Bio)), mixed 1:1 with fresh culture media, and applied to target cells grown in 6-well plates along with 8 µg/mL polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were re-transduced the following two days with viral supernatant. Cells were allowed to recover for 48 hours post-transduction. Cells were sorted into 96-well plates (Sarstedt) and grown to generate stable cell lines, as shown above. Depletion of mouse Etfdh protein levels was initially confirmed via immunoblotting for NT2197, 4T1, and NMuMG. The presence of INDELs leading to a premature stop codon or frameshift was determined by sequencing as shown above. Two sets of PCR primers were designed in the regions flanking the CRISPR target sites (refer to Supplementary Table 5).</p>

<p>The authors present an <bold>important</bold> set of data implicating ETFDH as an epigenetically suppressed gene in cancer with tumor suppressive functions. The evidence is <bold>solid</bold>, with the authors demonstrating that ETFDH suppression results in accumulation of amino acids that impact metabolism via hyperactive mTORC1.</p>

<p>In their manuscript, Papadopoli et al explore the role of ETFDH in transformation. They note that ETFDH protein levels are decreased in cancer, and that deletion of ETFDH in cancer cell lines results in increased tumorigenesis, elevated OXPHOS and glycolysis, and a reduction in lipid and amino acid oxidation. The authors attribute these effects to increased amino acid levels stimulating mTORC1 signaling and driving alterations in BCL6 and EIF4EBP1. They conclude that ETFDH1 is epigenetically silenced in a proportion of neoplasms, suggesting a tumor-suppressive function. Overall, the authors logically present clear data and perform appropriate experiments to support their hypotheses. I only have a few minor points related to the semantics of a few of the author's statements.</p>
<p>Minor Points</p>
<p>Authors state, &quot;we identified ETF dehydrogenase (ETFDH) as one of the most dispensable metabolic genes in neoplasia.&quot; Surely there are thousands of genes that are dispensable for neoplasia. Perhaps the authors can revise this sentence and similar sentiments in the text.</p>
<p>Authors state, &quot; These findings show that ETFDH loss elevates glutamine utilization in the CAC to support mitochondrial metabolism.&quot; While elevated glutamine to CAC flux is consistent with the statement that increased glutamine, the authors have not measured the effect of restoring glutamine utilization to baseline on mitochondrial metabolism. Thus, the causality implied by the authors can only be inferred based on the data presented. Indeed, the increased glutamine consumption may be linked to the increase in ROS, as glutamate efflux via system xCT is a major determinant of glutamine catabolism in vitro.</p>
<p>Authors state that the mechanism described is an example of &quot;retrograde signaling&quot;. However, the mechanism seems to be related to a reduction in BCAA catabolism, suggesting that the observed effects may be a consequence of altered metabolic flux rather than a direct signaling pathway. The data presented do not delineate whether the observed effects stem from disrupted mitochondrial communication or from shifts in nutrient availability and metabolic regulation.</p>
<p>The authors should discuss which amino acids that are ETFDH substrates might affect mTORC1 activity, or consider whether other ETFDH substrates might also affect mTORC1 in their discussion. Along these lines, the authors might consider discussing why amino acids that are not ETFDH substrates are increased upon ETFDH loss.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The altered metabolism of tumors enables their growth and survival. Classically, tumor metabolism often involves increased activity of a given pathway in intermediary metabolism to provide energy or substrates needed for growth. Papadopoli et al. investigate the converse - the role of mitochondrial electron transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase (ETFDH) in cancer metabolism and growth. The authors present compelling evidence that ETFDH insufficiency, which is detrimental in non-malignant tissues, paradoxically enhances bioenergetic capacity and accelerates neoplastic growth in cancer cells in spite of the decreased metabolic fuel flexibility that this affords tumor cells. This is achieved through the retrograde activation of the mTORC1/BCL-6/4E-BP1 axis, leading to metabolic and signaling reprogramming that favors tumor progression.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This review focuses primarily on the cancer metabolism aspects of the manuscript.</p>
<p>The study provides robust evidence linking ETFDH insufficiency to enhanced cancer cell bioenergetics and tumor growth.</p>
<p>The use of multiple cancer cell lines and in vivo models strengthens the generalizability of the findings.</p>
<p>The mechanistic insights into the mTORC1/BCL-6/4E-BP1 axis and its role in metabolic reprogramming are of general interest within and outside the immediate field of tumor metabolism.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The ETFDH knockout experiments are well-controlled by the addback of sgRNA-resistant ETFDH, but do not determine if the catalytic activity of this enzyme is required for the phenotypes induced by ETFDH loss.</p>
<p>Although this is not critical, it would be nice to see if the increased labeled aspartate pools result in higher nucleotide pools to support tumor growth.</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>This manuscript provides significant insights into the role of ETFDH insufficiency in cancer metabolism and growth. The findings highlight the potential of targeting the mTORC1/BCL-6/4E-BP1 axis in ETFDH-deficient cancers. The compelling data support the conclusions presented in the manuscript, which will be valuable to the cancer metabolism community.</p>

<p>We are highly appreciative of your constructive criticism and that you found that our findings of interest and significance. Based on your helpful suggestions, we plan to revise the paper as following:</p>
<p>(1) Although ETFDH is reduced, but not mutated across neoplasia, we appreciate your point pertinent to catalytically activity of ETFDH. To this end, in the revision we are planning to compare the effects of rescues using wild type ETFDH or one of the MADD-associated mutants with compromised catalytic activity.</p>
<p>(2) We intend to measure steady-state nucleotide levels as a function of ETFDH status in the cell. If time and/or funding allow, we will also perform appropriate labelling experiments.</p>
<p>(3) We will revise the text of the manuscript to address the minor points raised by the reviewers.</p>
<p>Again, we would like to thank you for helpful comments, which we aim to address as outlined above and hopefully further improve our report.</p>
