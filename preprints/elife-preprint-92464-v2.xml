<title>Abstract</title><p>In insects and mammals, 3D genome topology has been linked to transcriptional states yet whether this link holds for other eukaryotes is unclear. Using both ligation proximity and fluorescence microscopy assays, we show that in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>Heat Shock Response</italic> (<italic>HSR</italic>) genes dispersed across multiple chromosomes and under the control of Heat Shock Factor (Hsf1) rapidly reposition in cells exposed to acute ethanol stress and engage in concerted, Hsf1-dependent intergenic interactions. Accompanying 3D genome reconfiguration is equally rapid formation of Hsf1-containing condensates. However, in contrast to the transience of Hsf1-driven intergenic interactions that peak within 10-20 min and dissipate within 1 h in the presence of 8.5% (v/v) ethanol, transcriptional condensates are stably maintained for hours. Moreover, under the same conditions, Pol II occupancy of <italic>HSR</italic> genes and RNA expression are detectable only later in the response and peak much later (&gt;1 h). This contrasts with the coordinate response of <italic>HSR</italic> genes to thermal stress (39°C) where Pol II occupancy, transcription, intergenic interactions, and formation of Hsf1 condensates are all rapid yet transient (peak within 2.5-10 min and dissipate within 1 h). Therefore, Hsf1 forms condensates, restructures the genome and transcriptionally activates <italic>HSR</italic> genes in response to both forms of proteotoxic stress but does so with strikingly different kinetics. In cells subjected to ethanol stress, Hsf1 forms condensates and repositions target genes before transcriptionally activating them.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Genomes of higher eukaryotes are organized into multiple hierarchical levels. Chromosomes are segregated within individual territories, and within chromosomal territories active and inactive regions are separated into topologically associated domains (TADs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Wendt &amp; Grosveld, 2014</xref>). Within TADs, DNA loops are formed to permit the interaction between enhancers or silencers and the promoters of their target loci. Although this hierarchy suggests a static view of the genome, recent studies have suggested that the genome is quite dynamic, as multiple points of interaction form in response to developmental cues and other stimuli. This dynamic restructuring ranges from the interactions between co-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Fanucchi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Papantonis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Park et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Schoenfelder et al., 2010</xref>), to the convergence of enhancers dispersed across multiple chromosomes into a hub that regulates a single gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Monahan &amp; Lomvardas, 2015</xref>), to the reorganization of the genome that occurs in the zygote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Schulz &amp; Harrison, 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite its evolutionary distance, the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> also possesses an organized genome. Centromeres are located in a cluster at the spindle pole body, while chromosomal arms are extended with telomeres and the nucleolus located at the opposite side of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Duan et al., 2010</xref>), resulting in a Rabl-like configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Taddei &amp; Gasser, 2012</xref>). And as in higher eukaryotes, the budding yeast genome is organized into TAD-like structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Eser et al., 2017</xref>) subdivided into smaller loop domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Hsieh et al., 2015</xref>). Also as is the case in mammalian cells, the yeast genome is not static. Genes, including <italic>INO1, GAL1</italic> and <italic>GAL10</italic>, have been observed to reposition from the nuclear interior to the nuclear periphery upon their activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Brickner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Brickner &amp; Walter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cabal et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Casolari et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Dieppois et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Green et al., 2012</xref>). In response to methionine starvation, several Met4-regulated genes have been observed to cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Du et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Lee et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>More dramatic still are <italic>Heat Shock Response</italic> (<italic>HSR</italic>) genes under the regulation of Heat Shock Factor 1 (Hsf1). Upon exposure to acute thermal stress (heat shock [HS]), <italic>HSR</italic> genes dispersed across multiple chromosomes transcriptionally activate and engage in novel <italic>cis-</italic> and <italic>trans</italic>-intergenic interactions between one another – principally although not exclusively involving coding regions – that culminate in their coalescence into intranuclear foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Chowdhary et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">2019</xref>). These stress-induced foci, comprised of Hsf1 and components of the transcriptional machinery, form quickly, rearrange rapidly and dissolve suddenly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Chowdhary et al., 2022</xref>). As such, Hsf1 clusters exhibit properties of biomolecular condensates, defined as self-organized membrane-free compartments enriched in specific macromolecules that may or may not be phase-separated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Banani et al., 2017</xref>). Hsf1 condensate formation elicited by heat shock, like that of <italic>HSR</italic> gene interactions, parallels the kinetics of induction and attenuation of Hsf1-dependent genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Chowdhary et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">2022</xref>).</p>
<p>The Hsf1-driven heat shock response is a fundamental, evolutionarily conserved transcriptional program characterized by the gene-specific transcription factor (TF) Hsf1, its DNA recognition element (heat shock element (HSE)) and a core set of target genes encoding molecular chaperones and co-chaperones (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Verghese et al., 2012</xref>)). In absence of proteotoxic stress, yeast Hsf1 is bound by Hsp70 and its co-chaperone Sis1 in the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Feder et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Krakowiak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Peffer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>). Upon encountering stress, Hsp70 is titrated by unfolded proteins, particularly orphan ribosomal proteins located in the nucleolus and nascent polypeptides in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Albert et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ali et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Tye et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Tye &amp; Churchman, 2021</xref>). This results in the release of Hsf1 which then trimerizes and binds to HSEs located upstream of ∼50 genes whose transactivation is dependent on this factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Pincus et al., 2018</xref>). Once proteostasis is reestablished, excess Hsp70 binds Hsf1, inactivating it, thereby closing the negative feedback loop that regulates Hsf1 transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Krakowiak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>). Note that in yeast, a fraction of Hsf1 is constitutively trimeric and it is this species that binds high-affinity HSEs even under non-stressful conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Giardina &amp; Lis, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Pincus et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to thermal stress, Hsf1 can be activated by chemical stressors such as ethanol. Ethanol is a metabolite of glucose breakdown that budding yeast cells secrete into their surroundings. Ethanol production helps yeast outcompete other microbes in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Liti, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Piškur et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Rozpedowska et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, once glucose is depleted, ethanol serves as an alternative carbon source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Piškur et al., 2006</xref>). Given this strategic use of ethanol, it is of fundamental importance for yeast to have a mechanism in place to respond to the stress that ethanol elicits. Similar to thermal stress, exposure to ethanol causes a large number of cellular perturbations including disruption of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Piper et al., 1994</xref>); disruption of the H<sup>+</sup> ATPase and intracellular acidification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Rosa &amp; Sá-Correia, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Triandafillou et al., 2020</xref>); production of reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bandas &amp; Zakharov, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Davidson et al., 1996</xref>); depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Homoto &amp; Izawa, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Tan et al., 2017</xref>); cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Johnston &amp; Singer, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Kubota et al., 2004</xref>); disruption of mRNP transport to the daughter cell and formation of stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Grouši et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Kato et al., 2011</xref>); global inhibition of transcription and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bresson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Gasch et al., 2000</xref>); and formation of protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Piper, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Plesset et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Stanley et al., 2010</xref>). The cell counteracts many of these perturbations through the enhanced production of molecular chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Altamirano et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Verghese et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we investigate activation of the HSR in yeast exposed to 8.5% ethanol (ethanol stress (ES)) and compare it to the response induced by exposure to 39°C (HS). We find that like HS, exposure to ES induces transcription of Hsf1-regulated <italic>HSR</italic> genes and induces concerted intergenic interactions between them. In contrast to HS, however, Hsf1 condensate formation and <italic>HSR</italic> intergenic interactions cells peak well before transcription. The delay in transcriptional induction may be linked to a widespread increase in nucleosome occupancy that occurs upon exposure of cells to ethanol. At longer times of ethanol exposure, <italic>HSR</italic> gene transcript accumulation continues to increase while <italic>HSR</italic> gene coalescence has already dissipated. Likewise, ES-induced Hsf1 condensates are present for a prolonged period, in contrast to HS-induced condensates that begin to dissipate shortly after they appear. Collectively, our data indicate that different stimuli drive distinct transcription, chromatin, topologic and condensation phenomena, yet all are dependent on Hsf1.</p>

<title>Thermal stress and ethanol stress elicit distinct proteotoxic responses in yeast</title>
<p><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> in the wild metabolizes glucose and other sugars into ethanol, which the yeast secretes into the environment to suppress microbial competition. Therefore, it is likely that yeast has evolved mechanisms to contend with ethanol toxicity. Indeed, a common laboratory strain (W303) retains viability when cultivated in the presence of 8.5% ethanol, although its ability to proliferate is diminished (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, B</xref>). As assessed by the presence of Hsp104-containing foci (a measure of protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Liu et al., 2010</xref>)), the rate of cytosolic protein aggregation is similar in cells exposed to either 8.5% ethanol or 39°C thermal stress (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1D</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>; see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> for experimental design). However, it is notable that the number and volume of Hsp104 foci, and by extension protein aggregation, is substantially higher in cells subjected to ethanol stress.</p>

<p>We next investigated the subcellular localization of the Hsp70 co-chaperone, Sis1, in cells exposed to ethanol versus thermal stress. Previous work has shown that Sis1 is diffusely localized within the nucleus under control conditions where it promotes binding of Hsp70 to Hsf1, thereby repressing the HSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Feder et al., 2021</xref>). In response to acute HS, Sis1 relocates to nucleolus where it forms a perinucleolar ring, and to the cytoplasm where it forms cytosolic clusters that colocalize with Hsp104 and spatially associate with the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Feder et al., 2021</xref>). Consistent with these previous observations, we observed rapid relocalization of Sis1 in response to a 39°C HS. It formed a ring-like structure within 2.5 min consistent with a perinuclear location. Such relocalization lasted at least 60 min and spatially separated Sis1 from Hsf1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). A similar result was obtained when cells were exposed to 42°C. In response to ES, Sis1 remained largely co-localized with Hsf1 within the nucleoplasm although some enrichment at the nuclear periphery was evident. This was the case whether cells were exposed to 5% or 8.5% ethanol (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). In addition, a 60 min exposure to 8.5% ethanol resulted in the formation of prominent cytosolic Sis1 puncta that were less evident in the HS sample (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). These observations suggest that these two stressful treatments elicit a qualitatively distinct response. Experiments described below provide further support for this possibility.</p>

<title>Ethanol stress induces transcriptional activation of Hsf1-dependent genes but with delayed kinetics and reduced expression compared to thermal stress</title>
<p>To gain further insight into the mechanism by which <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> contends with ethanol-induced proteotoxicity, we assessed the kinetics of transcriptional activation of <italic>HSR</italic> genes in cells exposed to ethanol stress. Cells were cultivated to early log phase in rich YPD medium, then ethanol was added to a final concentration of 8.5% and cell aliquots were removed at 0-, 10-, 20- and 60-min. Transcription was terminated through addition of sodium azide (see Materials and Methods). A parallel culture was exposed to an instantaneous 30° to 39°C heat shock and cells were removed at the corresponding time points. Transcription was terminated as above.</p>
<p>While cells exposed to heat shock displayed a rapid and substantial increase in <italic>HSR</italic> mRNA levels (typically &gt;10-fold increase within 10 min of thermal upshift), those exposed to ethanol stress only weakly induced the same cohort of genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). However, while HS induced a transient increase in RNA expression, ES induced a sustained increase that was evident at all Hsf1-dependent genes tested (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3– figure supplements 1</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig3s2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). A corresponding immunoblot analysis of two Hsf1 targets, Hsp104 and Btn2, strengthens the notion that HS induces a rapid yet transient response whereas ES induces a delayed, yet far more sustained increase in gene expression (<xref rid="fig3s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3–figure supplement 3</xref>). In the case of <italic>HSP12</italic> and <italic>HSP26</italic>, whose transcription is under the dual regulation of Msn2 and Hsf1, exposure to heat shock resulted in a high level of induction as previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Chowdhary et al., 2019</xref>) yet exposure to 8.5% ethanol failed to cause detectable activation during the first 20 min (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>). Nonetheless, as described below, both <italic>HSP12</italic> and <italic>HSP26</italic> respond to acute ethanol stress but do so through their inducible and dramatic 3D genomic repositioning.</p>

<title>Pol II recruitment and histone eviction are delayed in ethanol-stressed cells and this correlates with a transient, widespread increase in nucleosome density</title>
<p>The delayed transcriptional response of <italic>HSR</italic> genes in ES-versus HS-treated cells prompted us to investigate occupancy of Hsf1, RNA Pol II and histones at these genes over a time course. A possible explanation for the delay in activation in cells exposed to ethanol stress is less rapid (or reduced) Hsf1 binding to the genes’ upstream regulatory regions. To explore this possibility, we exposed cells to either thermal or chemical stress and processed them for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis. As previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Kim &amp; Gross, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Pincus et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Sekinger &amp; Gross, 2001</xref>), occupancy of Hsf1 at its target loci increases many-fold following a brief heat shock (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, left, dark red; see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> for location of primers). Hsf1 occupancy typically declines after 60 min of continuous thermal stress and in the case of <italic>TMA10</italic>, dissociation begins much sooner. In response to ethanol stress, Hsf1 occupancy steadily increased, in most cases reaching maximal levels by 20 min and plateauing thereafter (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, left, black). These results suggest that ethanol stress induces binding of Hsf1 to its cognate HSEs to a degree similar to heat shock, yet such binding is more gradual. Moreover, given the above, Hsf1’s binding to these sites fails to elicit a corresponding transcriptional response.</p>

<p>In light of this disconnect between Hsf1 binding and <italic>HSR</italic> mRNA production, we evaluated abundance of the large subunit of Pol II at representative genes over the same time course. In response to heat shock, Rpb1 is rapidly recruited to the promoters and coding regions of each <italic>HSR</italic> gene, peaking within 2.5 min and then gradually declining over the next ∼60 min (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, middle, red and pink traces). By contrast, its occupancy is noticeably delayed in cells exposed to ethanol stress (blue traces), consistent with reduced transcript levels (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4–figure supplement 1B</xref>). The increase in <italic>HSR</italic> mRNA in heat-shocked cells parallels, yet consistently lags, the abundance of Pol II within <italic>HSR</italic> gene coding regions (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4–figure supplement 1A</xref>). This delay in reaching peak accumulation may reflect contributions beyond RNA synthesis, such as transient enhanced stability of <italic>HSR</italic> transcripts during the acute phase of heat shock.</p>
<p>To obtain further insight into the chromatin landscape present during the two stresses, we assayed histone H3 abundance as a measure of nucleosome density. In response to heat shock, nucleosomes are rapidly displaced over the promoter and coding regions of strongly expressed <italic>HSR</italic> genes (<italic>HSP82, HSP104</italic> and <italic>SSA4);</italic> a similar, albeit less robust, response is observed for <italic>TMA10</italic> and <italic>HSP12</italic>. Following this initial phase (∼20 min), nucleosomes reassemble over these genes and in certain cases return to their original density by 60 min (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, right, red and pink traces). This dramatic and dynamic remodeling has been previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Kremer &amp; Gross, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Zhao et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, ethanol stress elicits a transient increase in H3 abundance over all five genes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, right, blue traces). This apparent increase in chromatin compaction is not restricted to <italic>HSR</italic> genes; a variety of unrelated loci, including a stress-responsive, Msn2-regulated gene (<italic>PGM2</italic>), two constitutively expressed genes (<italic>TUB1, ACT1</italic>), two genes assembled into <italic>SIR</italic>-dependent heterochromatin (<italic>HMLα1, YFR057w</italic>) and a non-transcribed region (<italic>ARS504</italic>) also exhibit a transient increase in nucleosome density in ethanol-exposed cells (<xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4– figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p>
<p>In agreement with this idea, chromatin volume (as assessed by the signal arising from an H2A-mCherry protein fusion) decreases upon exposure of cells to ethanol stress (and much more transiently to heat stress; <xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4–figure supplement 2[B, C]</xref>). These data suggest that the increase in nucleosome density antagonizes Pol II recruitment and its subsequent release into the coding regions of <italic>HSR</italic> genes in ES cells. Once Pol II has been stably recruited, elongation and concomitant histone eviction ensues (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Altogether, our ChIP data indicate that Hsf1 binds to its target enhancers less readily in ethanol-stressed than in thermally stressed cells. This impediment to Hsf1 occupancy is magnified by a corresponding, and more severe, hindrance to Pol II recruitment resulting in a pronounced delay in <italic>HSR</italic> gene transcription.</p>

<title>Acute ethanol stress induces rapid and profound 3D genomic repositioning of <italic>HSR</italic> loci</title>
<p>An intriguing feature of <italic>HSR</italic> genes is the fact that they coalesce into discrete intranuclear foci in response to heat shock. Such interactions have been documented using both molecular (chromosome conformation capture (3C)) and imaging (fluorescence microscopy) approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Chowdhary et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Rubio &amp; Gross, 2023</xref>). Intriguingly, physical interactions specifically involve Hsf1 targets irrespective of their location in the genome. Other loci, including adjacent, transcriptionally active genes, show little or no tendency to interact with Hsf1-dependent genes. Such <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-interactions principally involve gene coding regions and are highly dynamic, typically peaking at 2.5 min and dissipating by 30- to 60-min. The kinetics of HS-induced coalescence often, although not always, correlate with kinetics of transcriptional induction; they also parallel the formation of Hsf1 condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Chowdhary et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">2022</xref>) as discussed further below.</p>
<p>Given these previous observations, we wished to know if ethanol stress induced similar 3D genome restructuring. It seemed unlikely that such topological changes would occur during the initial phase of ES since only weak Pol II occupancy and low <italic>HSR</italic> transcript levels are observed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). However, as shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, exposure to 8.5% ethanol triggered frequent intergenic interactions between Hsf1 targets during the first 10 min as revealed by Taq I-3C, a highly sensitive, quantitative version of 3C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Chowdhary et al., 2020</xref>) (see <xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 – figure supplement 1</xref> for location of 3C primers). Both intra- and interchromosomal interactions can be detected. Moreover, the interaction frequencies following this exposure in most cases equaled, and in some instances exceeded, those detected in cells heat-shocked for 2.5 min (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5A</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>), when peak 3C interactions occur in thermally stressed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Chowdhary et al., 2017</xref>). A detailed kinetic analysis revealed that intergenic interactions elicited by ethanol stress, similar to those induced by thermal stress, are highly dynamic: detectable within 2.5 min, peak shortly thereafter (within 10-20 min) and largely attenuate by 60 min (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>).</p>

<p>It has been previously suggested that a functional link exists between gene looping and transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ansari &amp; Hampsey, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">O’Sullivan et al., 2004</xref>). Indeed, gene loops and other intragenic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Chowdhary et al., 2017</xref>) are readily detected within <italic>HSR</italic> genes in cells exposed to ethanol. However, as is the case with intergenic interactions, these topological changes are kinetically uncoupled from both transcription and Pol II occupancy. They are detected quite early (within 2.5 min), peak soon thereafter (at 10 min) and attenuate by 60 min (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 – figure supplement 2</xref>). Taken together, our 3C and expression analyses indicate that 3D genomic repositioning and intragenic looping of <italic>HSR</italic> genes precedes the maxima of transcript levels and Pol II occupancy. Moreover, for certain loci (e.g., <italic>HSP12</italic> and <italic>HSP26</italic>), they argue that neither transcription nor Pol II recruitment is required to drive 3D topological changes in these genes. Further evidence in support of this is provided below.</p>

<title>Live cell imaging reveals that <italic>HSR</italic> genes coalesce to a similar degree under ethanol stress and heat stress conditions</title>
<p>To provide an orthogonal line of evidence for <italic>HSR</italic> gene interaction, we employed fluorescence microscopy to image live cells bearing <italic>LacO</italic>-tagged <italic>HSP104</italic> and <italic>TetO</italic>-tagged <italic>TMA10</italic> loci in cells expressing GFP-LacI and TetR-mCherry fusion proteins. Both genes are located on Chromosome XII, on opposite arms, and are physically separated by the nucleolus (100-200 rDNA repeats) that lies between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Duan et al., 2010</xref>) (schematically depicted in <xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 1A</xref>). In the absence of stress, fluorescence signals representing these two genes are typically well-separated (<xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 1B</xref>, 0 min). Upon heat shock, they rapidly converge, usually within 2.5 min. Upon exposure to ethanol, gene convergence is also observed, albeit less rapidly (<xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 1B</xref>; see also below). Despite the slight delay, these results demonstrate that <italic>HSP104</italic> and <italic>TMA10</italic> coalesce in ethanol stressed cells and do so with similar frequency as in thermally stressed cells (<xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 1C</xref>), consistent with the 3C analysis described above.</p>
<p>Having confirmed the physical interaction of Hsf1-dependent genes under ethanol stress, we assessed the transcriptional status of coalesced genes. Our RT-qPCR analysis indicated that the increase in <italic>HSR</italic> mRNA levels in ES-induced cells is delayed compared to those in HS-induced cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). To obtain insight into <italic>HSR</italic> gene transcription kinetics in single cells, we integrated a stem loop array (24xMS2) upstream of <italic>HSP104</italic>, allowing production of a chimeric transcript visualized upon binding of the MCP-mCherry fusion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Haim et al., 2007</xref>). This strain also harbored <italic>LacO</italic>-tagged <italic>HSP104</italic> and <italic>HSP12</italic> genes and expressed GFP-LacI (schematically illustrated in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>).

Heat shock induced rapid coalescence between <italic>HSP104</italic> and <italic>HSP12</italic>, as well as transcription from <italic>HSP104</italic>. These phenomena were detectable by 2.5 min as a merged signal of the chimeric transcript and the two GFP-labeled genes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). This visualization method allowed us to quantify the percentage of the population that is actively engaged in transcription, revealing that during heat shock, transcription and coalescence are positively correlated (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7[C, F]</xref>).

<p>Given the temporal link between Hsf1 condensation and transcription established in heat-shocked yeast cells, we anticipated that the appearance of Hsf1 condensates in ethanol-stressed cells would be delayed relative to what is seen in heat-shocked cells. However, we found that ethanol stress induced formation of Hsf1-GFP condensates as rapidly as did heat shock. These were visible in virtually all ES cells as early as 2.5 min, paralleling their rapid appearance in HS cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8 B-D</xref>). However, in contrast to the rapid dissolution of condensates in HS cells, those formed in cells exposed to 8.5% ethanol showed no evidence of dissipating even after 60 min of continuous exposure (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B, D</xref>). An independent analysis of Hsf1 tagged with a monomeric GFP, mNeonGreen, gave virtually identical results: &gt;90% of cells exhibited Hsf1 puncta as early as 2.5 min and such puncta were stably maintained for 150 min (<xref rid="fig8s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 8 – figure supplement 1</xref>).

Therefore, in 8.5% ethanol-stressed cells, formation of Hsf1 condensates is uncoupled from <italic>HSR</italic> gene transcription and their maintenance is uncoupled from <italic>HSR</italic> gene repositioning. An important implication is that although condensates may initiate or promote <italic>HSR</italic> gene repositioning, they cannot maintain the 3D restructured state of the genome.</p>
<p>Does the enhanced stability of ES-induced puncta arise from the nature of the stress or its intensity? To test this, we examined the behavior of yeast cells exposed to a lower concentration of ethanol. As shown in <xref rid="fig8s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 8 – figure supplement 1</xref>, Hsf1 puncta formed in &gt;95% of 5% ethanol-treated cells within 2.5 min, resembling what was seen in cells exposed to either 8.5% ethanol or 39°C HS. Yet such puncta dissipated in a majority of 5% ES cells within 30 min, resembling the case with HS but strongly contrasting to what was seen with 8.5% ethanol. Therefore, although 5% and 8.5% ES elicit a similar pattern of Sis1 subcellular relocalization, one that is distinct from that caused by either a 39° or 42°C HS (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), it is the greater intensity of 8.5% ethanol stress, not its intrinsic nature, that most closely correlates with the stability of Hsf1 condensates.</p>

<title>Hsf1 and Pol II are required for <italic>HSR</italic> gene interactions in response to both heat shock and ethanol stress</title>
<p>The above analyses reveal several unexpected differences in the way yeast responds to ethanol stress versus heat stress.

<p>Consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Chowdhary et al., 2019</xref>), intergenic interactions between <italic>HSR</italic> genes, located on the same or different chromosomes, were nearly obviated in cells conditionally depleted of either Hsf1 or Rpb1 and then heat shocked (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B</xref> and data not shown). While a similar strong dependence on Hsf1 is observed in 8.5% ethanol-treated cells, close inspection of the data suggests that residual <italic>HSR-HSR</italic> gene interactions are retained in Rpb1-depleted cells for certain loci. Particularly noteworthy is the inducible interaction between <italic>HSP12</italic> and <italic>HSP26</italic>, genes co-regulated by Msn2 and Hsf1.

Together with the kinetic uncoupling of <italic>HSR</italic> gene repositioning with Pol II recruitment/transcription and the relative permanence of Hsf1 condensates described above, these observations raise the possibility that 8.5% (v/v) ethanol-induced Hsf1 condensates are compositionally different from those formed in response to heat shock and drive <italic>HSR</italic> gene repositioning and transcription in a mechanistically distinct way (see <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref> for model).</p>

<sec id="s3a">
<title>Ethanol stress induces <italic>HSR</italic> gene transcription, <italic>HSR</italic> gene coalescence and formation of Hsf1 condensates</title>
<p>Here we have shown that exposure of budding yeast to a high, but sub-lethal, concentration of ethanol strongly stimulates the binding of Hsf1 to the upstream regulatory regions of <italic>HSR</italic> genes. Unexpectedly, such binding – which is evident as early as 2.5 min – does not lead to concurrent recruitment of Pol II and transcription of <italic>HSR</italic> genes. Instead, Pol II recruitment and transcription are delayed, typically for 10 min or longer. As exposure to 8.5% ethanol causes a global yet transient increase in H3 occupancy – which we interpret as an increase in the compaction of chromatin (see below) – the increase in nucleosome density may present a barrier to both Pol II recruitment and elongation. In addition, another feature of heat shocked-induced Hsf1 activation, repositioning of <italic>HSR</italic> genes within the 3D genome, is observed in cells exposed to ethanol. However, unlike transcription, this phenomenon occurs rapidly and is transient, resembling what is observed in heat shocked cells. The lack of temporal linkage between <italic>HSR</italic> gene transcription and <italic>HSR</italic> intergenic interactions is consistent with the idea that <italic>HSR</italic> gene coalescence and transcription are distinct phenomena and that Hsf1 can instigate long-range changes in 3D genome structure independently of inducing transcription. Thus, Hsf1 represents an example of a gene-specific TF that has functions independent of regulating transcription (discussed further below).</p>
<p>It has recently been demonstrated that in response to heat shock, inducible transcriptional condensates drive 3D genome reorganization in budding yeast. This conclusion arose from several features, including the tight temporal linkage between Hsf1 condensation and <italic>HSR</italic> intergenic interactions and the similar sensitivity of these two phenomena to the aliphatic alcohol, 1,6-hexanediol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Chowdhary et al., 2022</xref>). Similar to previous observations of heat-shocked cells (and confirmed here), we have found that in cells exposed to 8.5% ethanol, Hsf1 forms discrete puncta within 2.5 min. However, Hsf1-containing condensates formed in response to 8.5% ES are stable – persisting for hours – while such assemblies dissipate within 30 min in cells exposed to HS. In addition, while Hsf1 condensates formed as rapidly in cells exposed to 5% versus 8.5% ethanol, those formed in the presence of 5% ethanol proved to be transient, resembling their counterparts in HS cells. Relevant to this observation is the finding that Hsf1 activation in yeast exposed to 5% ethanol is dependent on the misfolding of nascent proteins, while in cells exposed to 8% ethanol, Hsf1 activation is dependent on the misfolding of both nascent and mature proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Tye &amp; Churchman, 2021</xref>). Therefore, the persistence of Hsf1 condensates in 8.5% ethanol may derive from widespread unfolded mature proteins that are more difficult to refold than short nascent polypeptides attached to ribosomes.</p>
<p>Additional features might account for the way in which these two proteotoxic stresses elicit the HSR in budding yeast. For example, while ethanol denatures proteins similar to thermal stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Furutani &amp; Izawa, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Kato et al., 2011</xref>), it impacts the cell at other levels. Actively growing yeast preferentially consume sugars and even in the presence of oxygen can produce ethanol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Dashko et al., 2014</xref>). This change in carbon source, termed the diauxic shift, is marked by a reduction in growth rate due to the less efficient generation of energy as well as accumulation of waste products and depletion of nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Herman, 2002</xref>). Consistent with activation of the HSR, this physiological adjustment is accompanied by increased chaperone synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Piper, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Piper et al., 1994</xref>) as well as an increase in the activity of alcohol metabolism-related enzymes. Such an adaptation likely takes time. In contrast to the gradual increase in ethanol that occurs under natural conditions, here we have imposed an instantaneous ethanol shock. The addition of ethanol elicits a heat shock transcriptional response and synthesis of chaperones. The cell growth arrest seen here (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) may arise as part of the adaptive program deployed upon encountering ethanol stress, such as a transition into quiescence. However, we fail to see activation of Msn2 targets, a signature of quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Breeden &amp; Tsukiyama, 2022</xref>), early in the exposure to ES at a time when Hsf1 itself is activated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). While other possibilities exist, our results suggest that the activation of programs involved in proteome protection are likely the first line of defense against sudden ethanol stress. Salient differences by which yeast cells respond to heat versus ethanol stress are summarized in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; a model summarizing the Hsf1 response under both HS and ES conditions is provided in <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>.</p>

<title>Exposure to ethanol transiently induces the global compaction of chromatin</title>
<p>An important observation is that exposure of cells to 8.5% ethanol leads to a widespread increase in H3 ChIP signal that we interpret as increased compaction of chromatin. Although this effect is temporary, both euchromatic and heterochromatic regions are impacted, and this is consistent with measurements of total chromatin volume that reveal a decrease lasting nearly 60 min. A similar outcome was recently reported for both yeast and mammalian cells exposed to aliphatic di-alcohols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Itoh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Meduri et al., 2022</xref>). It is probable that the effect of ethanol exposure is nearly instantaneous since, as discussed above, ethanol is known to denature proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Kato et al., 2019</xref>), likely by dehydration (disruption of biomolecules’ hydration shell). While such denaturation may contribute to chromatin compaction, the effect is reversible, possibly due to refolding / renaturation mediated by Hsp70 and other molecular chaperones whose intracellular concentration increases during ethanol exposure. As mentioned above, this temporary increased density of chromatin could suppress Pol II recruitment and subsequent elongation. Also not ruled out is a direct effect of 8.5% ethanol on one or more components of the Pol II machinery. Possible advantages of chromatin compaction could be to downregulate global transcription, as well as to limit chromatin damage by reactive oxygen species or other potentially damaging molecules present in the cell during ethanol stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bradley et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Costa et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Davidson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Davidson &amp; Schiestl, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Shen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Voordeckers et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

<title>A novel function for a TF that is uncoupled from regulating the transcription of its target gene</title>
<p>A key finding is that in response to ethanol stress, <italic>HSR</italic> genes reposition and Hsf1 condensates form well before transcription of Hsf1-dependent genes peaks, and in certain cases, is even detected. This suggests that Hsf1 has a function distinct from transactivating its target genes: it drives <italic>HSR</italic> gene repositioning that culminates in their physical coalescence. Likewise, deletion of the N-terminal IDR (NTA, amino acids 1-140; see <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>) was observed to have little effect on <italic>HSR</italic> gene transcription during an acute heat shock yet formation of Hsf1 condensates and intergenic 3C interactions were suppressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Chowdhary et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, as discussed above, recruitment of Hsf1 to its target HSEs is delayed in response to ES versus HS. Nevertheless, formation of Hsf1 condensates occurs with similar kinetics under both conditions, well prior to the peak of Hsf1 DNA binding in ES cells. This suggests the possibility that two types of Hsf1 clusters exist: one that is DNA-bound and the other that hovers over the <italic>HSR</italic> genes. It is possible that this cloud-forming Hsf1 cluster aids in target searching, by analogy with Gal4 that can also form clusters without binding DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Meeussen et al., 2023</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s3d">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>While Hsf1 is known to induce interactions between transcriptionally active <italic>HSR</italic> genes in response to heat shock, here we have demonstrated a similar role for this transcription factor in response to ethanol stress. Despite minimal <italic>HSR</italic> gene transcription during the initial 10 min exposure to ethanol, <italic>HSR</italic> genes engage in robust physical interactions, rivaling those seen for 2.5 min HS. This interaction correlates with an increase in definition of Hsf1 condensates yet is not accompanied by concurrent recruitment of Pol II to promoters, perhaps due to the compaction of chromatin in ethanol-stressed cells. Hsf1 therefore forms condensates and drives 3D repositioning of its target genes without appreciably activating these genes. Furthermore, Hsf1 does this through formation of condensates that may be materially different than those that form in response to HS. Our results also argue that formation of TF clusters, while sufficient for TF DNA binding and 3D genome restructuring, are not sufficient to drive transcription. Additional factors and/or activities – such as the opening of chromatin – are necessary. Further research into the biophysical properties, molecular regulation, and functional consequences of HSF1 condensates will deepen our understanding of how cells respond to both thermal and chemical stress and maintain cellular homeostasis.</p>

<title>Taq I chromosome conformation capture (Taq I-3C)</title>
<p>TaqI-3C was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Rubio &amp; Gross, 2023</xref>). A master cell culture was grown at 30°C in YPDA from OD<sub>600</sub>=0.15 to a final OD<sub>600</sub>=0.8. Aliquots of 50 mL were used for each condition. Heat shock and ethanol stress were conducted as described above. Primers for analysis of 3C templates are listed in <bold>Supplemental File 1 – Table 6</bold>.</p>

<title>Widefield Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
<p>For <xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7 – figure supplement 1 [B, C]</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>, cells were grown at 30°C in Synthetic Complete Dextrose (SDC) medium supplemented with 0.1 mg/mL adenine to early log phase. From this culture, 90 µL were removed and cells were immobilized onto a concanavalin A (ConA, Sigma Aldrich, 100 μg/mL in ddH<sub>2</sub>O)-coated coverslip for 20 min. The medium was then removed and replaced by either SDC or SDC + 8.5% v/v ethanol. The coverslip was mounted onto a concave microscope slide to reduce media evaporation (2-Well Concavity Slide, Electron Microscopy Sciences). Images were acquired using an AX70 Olympus epifluorescence microscope across 11 z-planes with 0.5 µm of interplanar distance. Filter set 89021 (Chroma Technology) and a Photometrics Prime 95B camera were used to image GFP and mCherry. SlideBook Software version 6.0.15 (Intelligent Imaging Innovations) was used for image capturing and z-axis stepping motor operation (Ludl Electronic products).</p>
<p>For heat shock, No Stress (NS) control images were taken using an Olympus Ach 100/1.25-NA objective coupled to a heating device (Bioptechs objective heater system). Heat-shocked sample imaging was done by rotating the objective away from the coverslip, switching the heating system on, and allowing it to reach 38°C before returning the objective to the coverslip for an instantaneous heat shock. The same field of view on the coverslip was imaged for both NS and HS timepoints. For ethanol stress, an Olympus UPlanFl 100/1.4-NA objective was used for image acquisition. Analysis of the images after acquisition was done using ImageJ (v. 1.52).</p>
<p>In the <italic>HSP104-TMA10</italic> coalescence analysis, cells in which the fluorophore-tagged genes had undergone replication (two green or two red fluorescent spots, indicative of late S/G2 phase) were excluded from the analysis. The locations of the two tagged loci were analyzed over 11 different z-planes, encompassing the whole nucleus. Cells were deemed coalescence positive if they displayed colocalized, non-resolvable fluorophore signals with a distance of &lt;0.4 µm between centroids.</p>

<title>Spinning Disk Confocal Microscopy</title>
<p>For all other imaging, cells were grown as described above and image acquisition was done using an UPlan Apo 100x/1.50 NA objective in an Olympus Yokogawa CSU W1 Spinning Disk Confocal System coupled to sCMOS cameras (Hamamatsu Fusion) controlled by cellSens Dimension software. A 50 µm pinhole disk was used for imaging in combination with 10% of laser power employed for excitation using 405 nm, 488 nm, and 561 nm lasers. Z-stacks were captured as for widefield fluorescence. For heat shock, cells were attached to a VAHEAT substrate (Interherence GmbH, Germany) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Icha et al., 2022</xref>) using ConA as above. The substrate was mounted onto the VAHEAT holder and control images were captured before heat was applied. Samples were instantaneously heated to 39° or 42°C. The substrate reservoir was covered with a coverslip to prevent media evaporation. Imaging was done over multiple timepoints as indicated in the figures. For ethanol stress, cells were mounted onto a coverslip as above, petroleum jelly was used to hold the coverslip against the concave slide and to reduce media evaporation. The slide was inverted and placed on the stage for visualization at room temperature.</p>
<p>Image reconstruction and analysis was done using FIJI/ImageJ (v. 1.53t) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Hsp104-BFP (LRY033) and Hsf1-mNeonGreen (LRY040) foci count and volume were performed using the “Cells” feature in Imaris v.10.0.0. The background fluorescence was used to delimit the region of interest (ROI). This ROI was then used to quantify the number of foci per cell. For Hsp104, the ROI (whole cell) was delimited to volumes between 20 and 140 µ<italic>m</italic><sup>3</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Uchida et al., 2011</xref>). Foci size was measured to an average of 0.4 µ<italic>m</italic> in diameter, which was used to train Imaris to recognize foci of distinct sizes [“Different Spot Sizes (Region Growing)” option]. A similar approach was taken to identify the nucleus (as the cell) and the Hsf1 foci (as nucleus) using the “Cells” feature in Imaris. Nuclei with volume of 10 µ<italic>m</italic><sup>3</sup> ±3.7 µ<italic>m</italic><sup>3</sup> were used for the analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Larson et al., 2011</xref>). Data obtained from these analyses were plotted using GraphPad Prism 8. Plot profile for signal arising from Hsf1-mNeonGreen, Sis1-mKate, and Hsp104-BFP was done using ImageJ/FIJI.</p>
<p>For analysis of transcription in VPY705, <italic>24xMS2-HSP104</italic> mRNA was visualized using the signal arising from MCP-mCherry binding to the chimeric transcript. Cells were interrogated for transcription by assaying the presence of an mCherry focus adjacent to <italic>HSP104-LacO<sub>256</sub></italic> bound by LacI-GFP. The high background signal from MCP-mCherry made it difficult to assess the localization of transcripts once they dissociated from the <italic>HSP104</italic>-tagged gene.</p>

<p>This is a <bold>valuable</bold> contribution to our understanding of how different cell stressors (ethanol or heat-shock) elicit unique responses at the genomic and topographical level under the regulation of yeast transcription factor Hsf1, providing <bold>solid</bold> evidence documenting the temporal coupling (or lack thereof) between Hsf1 aggregation and long-range communication among co-regulated heat-shock loci versus chromatin remodeling and transcriptional activation. A particular strength is the combination of genomic and imaging-based experimental approaches applied to genetically engineered in vivo systems.</p>

<p>Significance:</p>
<p>Rubio et al. study the behavior of the transcription factor Hsf1 under ethanol stress, examining its distribution within the nucleus and the coalescence of heat shock response genes in budding yeast. In comparison to the heat shock response, the response to ethanol stress shows similar gene coalescence and Hsf1 binding. However, there is a notable delay in the transcriptional response to ethanol, and a disconnect between it and the appearance of irreversible Hsf1 condensates/puncta, highlighting important differences in how Hsf1 responds to these two related but distinct environmental stresses.</p>
<p>Overview and general concerns (from the original review):</p>
<p>The authors studied how yeast responds to ethanol stress (8.5%) and compared it to the heat shock response (from 25{degree sign}C to 39{degree sign}C). They observed a more gradual increase in the expression of heat shock response (HSR) genes during ethanol stress compared to heat shock. Additionally, the recruitment of Hsf1 and Pol II to HSR genes, and the inter- and intrachromosomal interactions among these genes, showed slower kinetics under ethanol stress. They attribute the delay in transcriptional response to chromatin compaction induced by ethanol. Despite this delay, these interactions persisted longer. Hsf1 clusters, previously documented during the heat shock response, were also observed during ethanol stress and persisted for an extended period. The conditional degradation of Hsf1 and Rpb1 eliminated most inter- and intrachromosomal interactions for heat shock responsive genes in both ethanol stress and heat shock conditions, indicating the importance of these factors for long distance interactions between HSR genes. Overall, this manuscript provides novel insights into the differential behavior of HSR genes under different stress conditions. This contributes to the broader understanding of how different stressors might elicit unique responses at the genomic and topographical level under the regulation of transcription factor Hsf1.</p>
<p>The central finding of the study highlights the different dynamics of Hsf1, Pol II, and gene organization in response to heat shock versus ethanol stress. However, one important limitation to consider is that the two chosen conditions may not be directly comparable. For a balanced assessment, the authors should ideally expose yeast to various ethanol concentrations and different heat shock temperatures, ensuring the observed differences stem from the nature of the stressor rather than suboptimal stress intensity. At the very least, an additional single ethanol concentration point on each side of 8.5% should be investigated to ensure that 8.5% is near the optimum. In fact, comparing the number of Hsp104 foci in the two conditions in Fig. 1E and F suggests that the yeast is likely experiencing different intensities of stress for the chosen heat shock condition and ethanol concentration used in this study.</p>
<p>A second significant concern is the use of the term &quot;Hsf1 condensate&quot;. Chowdhary et al.'s 2022 Molecular Cell study highlighted an inhomogeneous distribution and rapid dynamics of Hsf1 clustering upon heat shock, with sensitivity to 1,6-hexandiol, which is interpreted as evidence for condensation by LLPS. But this interpretation has been criticized severely by McSwiggen at al. Genes Dev 2019 and Mussacchio EMBO J 2022. It is important to mention that 1,6-hexandiol is known to affect chromatin organization (Itoh et al. Life Science Alliance 2021). Describing such clusters as 'condensates' without further experimental evidence is premature. I encourage authors to settle on their neutral term 'puncta' which they use interchangeably with 'condensate' so as not to confuse the reader. The dynamic binding and unbinding of the low-abundance Hsf1 at coalescent chromatin target sites might explain the liquid-like properties of these clusters without the need for invoking the phase-separation hypothesis. While Hsf1 clusters exhibit features consistent with phase-separated condensates, other equally plausible alternative mechanisms, such as dynamic site-specific interactions (Musacchio, EMBO J, 2022), should also be considered. This is best left for the discussion where the underlying mechanism for puncta formation can be addressed.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>The authors have addressed the majority of my comments effectively. The new Sis1 experiment provides a clear illustration of a distinctive response to ethanol and heat. This work offers a comprehensive perspective on Hsf1 in stress response from multiple angles. I have two additional comments to improve the paper without re-review:</p>
<p>(Original point #3) Could the authors clarify the differences between DPY1561 and the original strain used? There appears to be missing statistical analysis for Figure 1E at the bottom.</p>
<p>(Original point #4) In the new Figure 7F, '% transcription' and '% coalescence' are presented. My understanding is that Figures 7D and 7E aim to demonstrate the correlation between HSP104 transcription (a continuous variable) and HSP104-HSP12 coalescence (a binary variable) at the single-cell level. However, averaging the data across cells masks individual variations and potential anti-correlations. The authors could explore statistical methods that handle correlations between a continuous variable and a binary variable. Alternatively, consider converting 'HSP104 transcription' to a binary variable and then performing a chi-square test to assess the association.</p>

<p>This is an interesting manuscript that builds off of this group's previous work focused on the interface between Hsf1, heat shock protein (HSP) mRNA production, and 3D genome topology. Here the group subjects the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to either heat stress (HS) or ethanol stress (ES) and examines Hsf1 and Pol II chromatin binding, Histone occupancy, Hsf1 condensates, HSP gene coalescence (by 3C and live cell imaging), and HSP mRNA expression (by RT-qPCR and live cell imaging). The manuscript is well written, and the experiments seem well done, and generally rigorous, with orthogonal approaches performed to support conclusions. The main findings are that both HS and ES result in Hsf1/Pol II-dependent intergenic interactions, along with formation of Hsf1 condensates. Yet, while HS results in rapid and strong induction of HSP gene expression and Hsf1 condensate resolution, ES result in slow and weak induction of HSP gene expression without Hsf1 condensate resolution. Thus, the conclusion is somewhat phenomenological - that the same transcription factor can drive distinct transcription, topologic, and phase-separation behavior in response to different types of stress. While identifying a mechanistic basis for these results would be a tough task perhaps beyond the scope of this study, it would nevertheless be helpful to place these results in context with a series of other studies demonstrating across various organisms showing Hsf1 driving distinct activities dependent on the context of activation. Perhaps even more importantly, this work left out PMID: 32015439 which is particularly relevant considering that it shows that it is human HSF1 condensate resolution rather than simple condensate formation that is associated with HSF1 transcriptional activity - which are similar to the findings here with this particular dose of HS resulting in resolution and high transcriptional activity versus ES resulting in resolution failure and lower activity. It is also worth noting that the stresses themselves are quite different - ethanol can be used as a carbon source and so beyond inducing proteotoxic stress, the yeast are presumably adapting to this distinct metabolic state. Basically, it is not clear whether these differences are due to the dose of stress, versus we are looking at an early timepoint as ES initiates a genome-wide chromatin restructuring and gene expression reprogramming that goes beyond a response to proteotoxic stress. This reviewer is not suggesting a barrage of new experiments, but perhaps discussion points to contextualize results.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>Overall, the conclusions appear appropriately supported by the data, and the data appear of high quality.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The particular strengths of the paper include an impressive combination of genomic and imaging-based approaches and insightful genetically engineered cell systems. The manuscript reports interesting and potentially important findings. The text is generally very well written, the ideas are clearly explained, and the reasoning is easy to follow.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The main weakness seems to be that the heat and ethanol shock approaches likely elicit pleiotropic effects, and therefore it is a challenge to test the causal relationship between various observations. Nevertheless, even as indirect effects might contribute to some of the authors' observations, the results are definitively worth reporting.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that these two proteotoxic stresses can impact cell physiology in multiple ways and discuss this on lines 132-143 and 500-519. Moreover, in this revision we have more rigorously quantified the extent of proteotoxic stress elicited by the 39°C heat shock and 8.5% ethanol stress (Figure 1E; see response 1 to Reviewer 2). We have additionally added new Figure 2 that reveals an important difference in the way Hsf1 and its negative regulator, the Hsp70 co-chaperone Sis1, respond to HS and ES. This difference is evident at two different intensities for each stress as described in more detail below (see response 1 to Reviewer 2).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Presentation of some of the data could be improved.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree and have made improvements/data additions to multiple figures: Figure 1E; Figures 3A, B; Figures 4A, B; Figure 7 (data drawn from original Fig. 6 and Fig. 6 – fig. suppl. 1 and reorganized); Fig. 8B; Figure 9; Figure 10. Corresponding enhancements to the supplemental figures have been made as well.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p>
<p>(1) The central finding of the study highlights the different dynamics of Hsf1, Pol II, and gene organization in response to heat shock versus ethanol stress. However, one important limitation to consider is that the two chosen conditions may not be directly comparable. For a balanced assessment, the authors should ideally expose yeast to various ethanol concentrations and different heat shock temperatures, ensuring the observed differences stem from the nature of the stressor rather than suboptimal stress intensity. At the very least, an additional single ethanol concentration point on each side of 8.5% should be investigated to ensure that 8.5% is near the optimum. In fact, comparing the number of Hsp104 foci in the two conditions in Fig. 1E and F suggests that the yeast is likely experiencing different intensities of stress for the chosen heat shock condition and ethanol concentration used in this study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this important suggestion. In this revision, we have included an enhanced analysis of the yeast cellular response to each of these stresses. As illustrated in revised Figure 1, the two stresses used throughout this study – 39°C heat shock and 8.5% ethanol stress – both elicit a proteotoxic response, as assayed by the de novo formation of Hsp104 clusters. While 10 min exposure to 8.5% ethanol results in the formation of multiple discrete (spherical) foci, a 10 min exposure to the elevated temperature leads the appearance of multiple, largely diffuse Hsp104 clusters, some of which are spherical (new Fig. 1D). The difference in morphology notwithstanding, we have attempted to quantify these clusters using Imaris v. 10.0.1 image analysis software; the results are depicted in Fig. 1E. Such quantification suggests that 8.5% ethanol elicits a more intense stress than exposure to 39°C. A caveat is that it is unclear whether diffuse Hsp104 clusters are comparable to compact Hsp104 foci (see response 3 below).</p>
<p>Beyond the apparent difference in intensity, a new analysis presented in new Figure 2 reveals that heat shock, elicited by temperature upshift to either 39°C or 42°C, induces relocalization of the J-protein Sis1 – a key negative regulator of Hsf1 – from the nucleoplasm to the nucleolar periphery. Sis1’s perinucleolar ring localization agrees with previous findings of 39°C heat-shocked cells (Feder et al., 2021). Ethanol stress, whether 5% or 8.5%, initially causes Sis1 to relocalize diffusely throughout the nucleus and cytosol. At 10 min, Sis1 localizes to the periphery of the nucleus, thereby providing a marked contrast to what is observed in response to heat shock. These new results are described on lines 174-191.</p>
<p>Taking these two observations together, we asked whether a less severe ethanol stress (5%) would induce Hsf1 puncta. It does, and as rapidly as 8.5% ethanol (data are presented in revised Figure 8-figure supplement 1). Interestingly, in the presence of 5% ethanol, Hsf1 puncta begin to dissolve at 30 min. This strongly contrasts with the case when cells are exposed to 8.5% ethanol (Figure 8; Figure 8-figure supplement 1). As we state in this revision (lines 414-424), the sustained presence of condensates that we originally observed is likely the consequence of the intensity of the proteotoxic stress elicited by exposure to 8.5% ethanol; analogous responses to these two stress conditions have been observed before (lines 495-501).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) A second significant concern is the use of the term &quot;Hsf1 condensate&quot;. Chowdhary et al.'s 2022 Molecular Cell study highlighted an inhomogeneous distribution and rapid dynamics of Hsf1 clustering upon heat shock, with sensitivity to 1,6-hexandiol, which is interpreted as evidence for condensation by LLPS. However this interpretation has been criticized severely by McSwiggen et al. Genes Dev 2019 and Mussacchio EMBO J 2022. It is important to mention that 1,6-hexandiol is known to affect chromatin organization (Itoh et al. Life Science Alliance 2021). Describing such clusters as 'condensates' without further experimental evidence is premature.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While we appreciate and largely agree with the point made by this reviewer, we prefer to maintain the term “condensate”. Banani et al (2017) originally defined “biomolecular condensate” to mean selforganized membrane-free compartments that concentrate specific biomolecules. It was never meant to imply LLPS although its widespread use in the literature has led to that implication. We clarify our use of this term on lines 99-104.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Figure 1: Why does ethanol stress at 0 min display a larger number of Hsp104 foci per cell than heat shock at the same time? How are foci defined by the authors? In Fig. 1D, there are many smaller puncta. A comparative assessment of the number and size of foci for heat shock and ethanol stress would be beneficial.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point and have addressed it as follows.  First, we repeated the assay with a different strain (DPY1561) and increased the number of cells assayed from 40 to 200. This larger sample size created the same T=0 baseline for both stresses (Figure 1E). Second, we define Hsp104 foci as diffraction-limited structures with a diameter of ~0.4 µm (lines 747-749).  Third, employing Imaris v. 10.0.1, we quantified foci size (= volume) and a summary graph has been added to Figure 1E that also displays the number of foci per cell. In the legend to this figure, we point out that to conduct this analysis we assumed that the diffuse Hsp104 clusters seen in HS cells are comparable to the compact Hsp104 foci in ES cells (lines 1169-1171).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Figure 2: Selecting a housekeeping gene with consistent expression levels is crucial for meaningful qPCR analysis. Do <italic>SCR1</italic> mRNA levels fluctuate during heat shock or ethanol stress?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this question. In revised Figure 3 – figure supplement 1C we provide a new graph (reproduced here) revealing that the levels of <italic>SCR1</italic> do not significantly change under either heat shock or ethanol stress relative to the non-stressed control (0 min). One-way ANOVA analysis was performed for both HS and ES and <italic>p</italic> values were 0.094 and 0.083, respectively (calculated using GraphPad Prism 8).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Additionally, certain genes, such as <italic>TMA10</italic> and <italic>SSA4</italic>, lack visible bars at time 0. Are these levels undetectable? The varying y-axis scales are confusing; presenting data as relative fold changes could offer a clearer perspective.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Transcript levels for all genes evaluated here are detectable, even in the basal unstressed state. They are not visible on the histogram for certain genes at T= 0 due to the prodigious fold-increase in RNA elicited by heat shock.  However, to address this concern, we have added a bar graph inset displaying basal transcript levels for each gene in revised Figure 3. We reproduce data for <italic>SSA4</italic> and <italic>TMA10</italic> in the graphs below. In addition, we present transcript levels in new Figure 3 - figure supplement 1 for cells subjected to ethanol stress to allow a better appreciation of their increase over time.</p>

<p>(6) Line 239: The evidence for chromatin compaction is unconvincing. An increase in H3 occupancy by ChIP might indicate a reduction in histone exchange dynamics but may not relate to overall chromatin compaction. The authors use H2A-mCherry to suggest a decrease in chromatin volume, but this data is not persuasive. Did the authors observe any changes in nuclear size? Perhaps quantifying chromatin compaction more directly, using signal intensity per volume, would be informative.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To address this concern, we attempted to quantify integrated density for H2A-mCherry using Image J software. While the volume decreased for both stresses, the integrated density only increased for ethanol stress. We speculate that this may be due to photobleaching which has been reported for heat shock. The combination of heat and acidic pH contribute to loss of fluorescence signal (Alkaabi et al., 2005). While the integrated density supports the idea of global chromatin compaction in the ethanol stress condition, given the above concerns with the HS sample we elected to not present these data.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Line 340: The claim of a &quot;strong spatiotemporal correlation&quot; isn't evident from the data. Could correlation coefficients be provided? There is potential anti-correlation in Fig. 6 - Figure Supplement 1C.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion. We now present an analysis of the correlation between HSP104 – HSP12 coalescence and HSP104 transcription for both HS and ES time courses, using single cell data of Figures 7D, 7E and Figure 7- suppl. 1D.  This analysis is presented in new Figure 7F.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Figure 8: The WT data in Fig 8 seem inconsistent with Fig. 4 (e.g. the interaction frequency for HSP104 and SSA2). Are these fluctuations between experiments, or are they side effects of IAA treatment? The use of ethanol as an IAA solvent vehicle raises concerns. It would be beneficial if the authors could demonstrate that 1.7% ethanol in the control does not induce ethanol stress.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge that there existed an inconsistency in the magnitude of intergenic interaction frequencies reported in the two experiments for <italic>HSP104</italic> and <italic>SSA2</italic>. Some of this might be attributed to the fact that different strains were used, W303-1B in Figure 4 and LRY016 (W303-1B; <italic>LEU2::pGPD1osTIR1</italic>) in Figure 8. Nonetheless, in each experiment there was a prodigious fold-increase in interaction frequency over the no stress (T= 0 min) control for both HS and ES conditions and moreover, in each experiment the magnitude of this interaction was greater for the 2.5 min HS sample vs. the 10 min ES sample. However, to obviate this concern, we have removed the HSP104-SSA2 analysis from Figure 9 (corresponds to original Fig. 8).</p>
<p>Regarding the second point, we cannot entirely rule out the concern that the 1.7% ethanol vehicle might impact 3C interaction frequencies. It is unlikely to be significant, however, given that most other pairwise tests evaluated in the two experiments (Figs. 5 and 9) resulted in similar 3C values. In particular, there was no consistent trend towards higher (or lower) interaction frequencies in the IAA experiment of Fig. 9.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for pointing out this oversight. In this revision, we cite Gaglia et al., 2020 and several others reporting HSF1 foci formation in human cells exposed to heat shock. The single cell analysis of Gaglia et al argued that dissolution of large HSF1 foci (aka “nuclear stress bodies”), typically several µm in diameter and localized over satellite III DNA repeats (Jolly et al., 1997, 2002), correlates with HSP gene activation. Importantly, these condensates are postulated to act as reservoirs of HSF1, sequestered away from HSP genes (Gaglia et al., 2020).  In contrast, Zhang et al., 2022 has shown that human HSF1 inducibly forms small condensates (~300 nm) that localize over HSP genes and whose formation directly correlates with HSP gene activation (we discuss the Jolly, Gaglia and Zhang findings on lines 382-394). Likewise, our work shows that in yeast, Hsf1 inducibly forms small, dynamic clusters that colocalize with <italic>HSR</italic> genes within 2.5 min of exposure to elevated temperature; these dissolve ~20-60 min later (Figure 8 and Figure 8-supp. 1). In concert with Hsf1 condensate formation, <italic>HSR</italic> gene repositioning and transcription/ Pol II recruitment are likewise evident within 2.5 min. Therefore, in HS cells there exists coordinate induction of condensate <italic>formation</italic>, Pol II recruitment, transcription and intergenic interactions (for a detailed kinetic analysis of <italic>HSR</italic> gene interactions, see Figures 5 and 6 of Chowdhary et al, 2017).  This tight temporal relationship is absent in ethanol stressed cells (Figures 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8; summarized in Figure 10 and Table 1).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It is also worth noting that the stresses themselves are quite different - ethanol can be used as a carbon source and so beyond inducing proteotoxic stress, the yeast are presumably adapting to this distinct metabolic state. Basically, it is not clear whether these differences are due to the dose of stress, versus we are looking at an early timepoint as ES initiates a genome-wide chromatin restructuring and gene expression reprogramming that goes beyond a response to proteotoxic stress. This reviewer is not suggesting a barrage of new experiments, but perhaps discussion points to contextualize results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and in our revised manuscript discuss these issues (lines 414424 and 486-498 [5% vs. 8.5% ethanol]; lines 500-519 [ethanol as a metabolite]).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>(1) In Figure 1E, the number of foci in control (0 min) cells is very different for the two conditions. Could the authors clarify/check this? Based on the mean numbers at time point 0, the control cells for the ethanol treatment already contain about 10-20 Hsp104 foci, compared to around 5 foci per cell in the control for heat shock.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point and have repeated the assay with a different strain (DPY1561).  And as shown in Figure 1E, have confirmed that the control samples have similar number of foci.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In the same Figure 1E, is the P-value relative to the control or the same time point in the other treatment? A comparison across treatments would be necessary to support the claim in lines 168-171 of the text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The statistical analysis (Mann Whitney test) was performed by comparing each stress timepoint to the no stress control. We clarify this in the figure legend.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In Figure 1D, the heat-shock condition shows the same cells that are used in the control, but the cells in the ethanol-shock condition are different. This is a bit visually misleading compared to the experimental setup shown in panel 1C. The authors could show the control cells for the ethanol condition as well.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion and have added the 0 min image for the ethanol stress conditions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In Figure 7B adding images at 60min would help underscore the point that the condensates are stable in ethanol shocked cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this suggestion as well and have included a 60 min timepoint for both stresses (Figure 8B).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p>
<p>(1) Line 113: Has it not been established that yeast Hsf1 is constitutively trimeric?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In yeast, only a fraction of Hsf1 is thought to be constitutively trimeric and it is this species that binds high-affinity HSEs even under non-stressful conditions (Giardina &amp; Lis, 1995; Pincus et al., 2018). We have added this clarification to the text (lines 121-123).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Ethanol can precipitate proteins, especially in rich media like YPD. Did the authors notice any protein precipitation? If yes, how do they account for effects due to nutrient loss by precipitation?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an interesting point, but we did not notice any precipitates in either rich or synthetic liquid media containing 8.5% (v/v) ethanol for any of the time points used in the experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Figure 3: The figure appears incomplete. Can enhancer, promoter, coding region, and 3'UTR be shown consistently for all genes examined?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In response to this point, we have simplified this figure (new Fig. 4) by uniform presentation of factor occupancy at enhancer, promoter, and coding region loci for all but one of the genes evaluated. For <italic>HSP12</italic> (330 bp), we were unable to distinguish promoter from coding region since the average sonicated chromatin fragment obtained using a Bioruptor is ~300 bp. Therefore, we evaluated only the <italic>HSP12</italic> coding region for Pol II and histone H3 occupancy.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Figure 4: The comparison between heat shock at 2.5 min and ethanol stress at later points is puzzling. Why not use consistent time points as in Fig. 3?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Time points for the two stresses examined in this figure (new Fig. 5) were selected to represent times of peak intergenic interaction between <italic>HSR</italic> genes. These times were derived from our earlier analysis of 3C interactions during a heat shock time course (Figs. 5, 6 of Chowdhary et al., 2017) and ES data presented in this study, including Fig. 4 (Pol II ChIP time course) and Fig. 6 (3C time course). Data presented in Figs. 5 and 6 are consistent with the notion that intergenic interactions in cells subjected to ethanol stress are delayed relative to those observed in heat shocked cells, peaking in most cases at ~10 min (vs. ~2.5 min for heat stress (Chowdhary et al., 2017)).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Figure 5: Fig. 5B top panel seems to show color inconsistencies for bars at 0 and 120 min. Also, the xaxis on the top left panel seems to have a typo; should it read &quot;10,&quot; not &quot;0?&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the observation. We changed the graphs in new Figure 6 to display the same color for all time points.  We also fixed the typo.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Line 302: The evidence presented supports maximal mRNA levels, but the claim of &quot;maximal transcription&quot; requires support from nascent RNA analysis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that RT-qPCR measures mRNA abundance, not nascent transcription. We have changed the text to refer to “transcript levels” where pertinent (lines 301-302; 1331-1332).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) How long do loci remain coalescent during heat shock versus ethanol stress? Both 3C and imaging analyses do not differentiate between frequency and duration, which seems essential for understanding interaction dynamics.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this excellent question. In new Fig. 7D,E (data drawn from Fig. 6 – fig. suppl. 1), <italic>HSR</italic> gene coalescence detected in single cells over a HS or ES time course is charted.  Interpretable data exist for a small number of cells. Moreover, for both HS and ES states, in certain cells coalescence between the representative Hsf1 target genes <italic>HSP104</italic> and <italic>HSP12</italic> dissolves and then reappears. With this caveat in mind, the data suggest that <italic>HSP104-HSP12</italic> coalescence can last at least 15 min in HS cells and up to 30 min in ES cells. We have not emphasized this point in the manuscript since a far more comprehensive analysis – beyond the scope of this study – is required.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) For longer analyses, how do the authors accommodate potential ethanol concentration changes due to evaporation?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>For liquid cultures, we relied on maintaining minimal changes in the vapor pressure within the experimental vessel; to facilitate that, flasks were tightly covered to minimize evaporation and temperature was kept at 25°C. For most molecular analyses (RT-qPCR, ChIP, 3C), we confined our analysis to the first 60 min. For microscopy, the samples were encased within a concave slide, covered by a coverslip, as illustrated below. In addition, to tightly seal the coverslip on the slide we used petrolatum.  This arrangement minimized evaporation.</p>
