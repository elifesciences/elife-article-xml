<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Transcription factor partners can cooperatively bind to DNA composite elements to augment gene transcription. Here, we report a novel protein-DNA binding screening pipeline, termed Spacing Preference Identification of Composite Elements (SPICE), that can systematically predict protein binding partners and DNA motif spacing preferences. SPICE de novo predicted known composite elements, including AP1-IRF composite elements (AICE) and STAT5 tetramers, and also predicted a range of novel binding partners, including JUN-IKZF1 composite elements, including at an upstream conserved noncoding region, CNS9, in the human <italic>IL10</italic> gene, which contains a non-canonical IKZF1 site. We confirmed cooperative binding of JUN and IKZF1 and showed that the activity of an <italic>IL10</italic>-luciferase reporter construct in primary B and T cells depended on both this site and the AP1 binding site within this composite element. Overall, our findings reveal an unappreciated global association of IKZF1 and AP1 and establish SPICE as a valuable new pipeline for predicting novel transcription binding complexes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Genome-wide studies investigating cooperative interactions of transcription factors (TFs), histone modifications, and higher-order chromatin conformation are critical for the systematic evaluation of mechanisms of gene expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with DNA sequencing (ChIP-Seq) has been used to map genome-wide DNA binding proteins of interest, thereby enhancing our understanding of genomics and epigenomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>), with important discoveries related to disease-associated transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>), tissue-specificity of epigenetic regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>), and chromatin organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). To extract biologically relevant information from ChIP-Seq data, many computational tools, such as Model-based Analysis for ChIP-Seq (MACS)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>), MUltiScale enrIchment Calling for ChIP-Seq (MUSIC)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), and Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Algorithm (ZINBA)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), have been developed to understand transcription factor cooperation and interactions. Genomic regions that are significantly enriched represent candidates for protein/DNA-binding sites that can be used to predict binding motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), and ChIP-Seq analysis can be integrated with other types of genomic assays, including RNA-Seq gene expression profiling and long-distance chromatin interaction analyses to elucidate mechanisms of genomic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>) and gene ontology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Moreover, given a set of identified ChIP-Seq peaks, motif enrichment analysis tools such as MEME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) can de novo discover the motif(s) corresponding to the TF’s DNA binding domain. When binding to genomic DNA, some TFs may cooperatively bind and physically interact with specific partner TFs, and there often is preferred spacing between their binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). These cooperative interactions at composite elements are critical for transcriptional regulation of genes and are used by cells to integrate diverse signals and potently drive transcription even at low concentrations of transcription factors. However, few computational tools to date can predict composite elements and their optimal spacing using transcription factor ChIP-Seq data. SpaMo (space motif analysis) in MEME suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) can infer interactions between a pair of specific TFs at near sites on the DNA sequence, however, it cannot systematically predict TF-TF composite elements genome wide. Here, we report a new computational pipeline denoted “Spacing Preference Identification of Composite Elements” (SPICE), which can predict in a genome-wide fashion novel composite elements for pairs of transcription factors and the spacing between the elements. SPICE is versatile and efficient and can use any ChIP-Seq dataset to make predictions that can be tested to confirm cooperative binding and corresponding effects on gene expression. We found SPICE predictions to be highly accurate in predicting previously established binding partners/compositve motifs, and in this study we demonstrate genome-wide JUN-IKZF1 interactions. SPICE therefore has potentially broad utility and provides a powerful method to identify a range of new transcription-factor interactions and mechanisms underlying gene regulation.</p>

<title>The SPICE pipeline predicts known and novel protein complexes</title>
<p>The SPICE schematic pipeline is summarized in <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold> and detailed in the Methods. First, we aligned the sequenced reads from ChIP-Seq datasets to the reference genome and identified significant TF binding sites (peaks) using MACS. Second, we performed de novo peak analysis, designated the top-enriched motif among the identified peaks as the primary motif, kept peaks containing the primary motif, and eliminated sequences without primary matches. Third, we loaded secondary motifs using motif databases (e.g., HOCOMOCO, etc.), centered the primary motifs and scanned for secondary motifs within 500 bp of the primary motif, specifically checking for enrichment of known TF DNA-binding motifs. Finally, we sorted the significant secondary motifs and spacing, and grouped those that were redundant. We then visualized their interaction matrices with the primary and secondary motifs as a heat map (see illustrative schematic in <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>, where each red square indicates a predicted composite element containing the motifs at the corresponding primary and secondary motifs on the x- and y-axis, respectively). Based on the distance from the primary to secondary motif, we displayed the spacing distributions as bar graphs highlighting the most significant spacing preferences (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>). To validate the predictive accuracy of SPICE, we used our previously published IRF4 ChIP-Seq data in mouse pre-activated T cells to see if we could de novo re-discover AP-1/IRF4 composite elements (AICE, 5′-TGAnTCA/GAAA-3′)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Indeed, SPICE successfully predicted these elements, including optimal spacing between AP1 and IRF4 as 0 or 4 bp (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figures S1A</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1B</xref></bold>), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>), thus validating the pipeline.</p>

<title>SPICE can predict known and novel composite elements from the human Encode database</title>
<p>To assess SPICE’s ability to predict novel TF binding complexes, we utilized ChIP-Seq data from the ENCODE project, as standardized by the ENCODE Analysis Working Group; this allowed us to perform integrated analysis of all ENCODE data types based on uniform processing. We evaluated the performance of SPICE using ENCODE ChIP-Seq libraries from Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBS) generated by ENCODE/Stanford/Yale/USC/Harvard (SYUH), which comprise a total of 343 libraries in 20 different cell lines, with K562 human erythroleukemia, GM12878 EBV-transformed B cell, and HeLa S3 human cervical carcinoma cell lines being heavily used to generate these libraries. For each selected TF ChIP-Seq library that contains a primary motif (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref></bold>, x-axis), we extracted 500 bp of DNA sequence centered on the primary motif and searched for 401 known human transcription factor binding motifs using the Homo sapiens Comprehensive Model Collection database (HOCOMOCO, v11)(<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>,</bold> y-axis), and generated a 343 x 401 spatial interaction matrix, in which each cell was assigned an E-value indicating the significance of primary-secondary motif pairs (<bold>Table 2</bold>). The E-values were then log transformed (-log10(E-value)) and shown as an interaction heat map (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref></bold>). As is evident, most of the motif pairs were not significant, suggesting that transcription factor composite elements are relatively rare events; in addition, some interactions that exist in some cell types may not be observed if they are not present in the cell lines that were used to generate the ENCODE datasets. After applying a filtering criterion that only included motif pairs with an E-value &lt; 1e<sup>-10</sup>, the resulting interaction matrix had dimensions of 118 x 205 and exhibited reduced spatial complexity. Very interestingly, we could immediately identify multiple potential TF-TF composite elements (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref></bold>), which include putative associations of JUN with STAT3 and IKZF1, of CEBPβ with E2F, KLF, and BACH family members, and a range of others including ZNF241/NF-κB, GATA1/NDF1, and CTCF/ETS. Importantly, association of JUN with STAT3 has been known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) and a functional CTCF-ETS1 interaction was recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>), further validating the predictive power of SPICE. Regarding the CTCF-ETS association, SPICE successfully defined an optimal spacing of 8 bp for CTCF/ETS complexes (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figures S1E</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1F</xref></bold>), something that was not defined in the earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) and thereby further underscoring the robustness of our pipeline.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Most IKZF1 binding sites co-localize with JUN</title>
<p>We decided to focus on the putative JUN-IKZF1 given that both JUN and IKZF1 play critical roles in immune cells but have not been reported to physically associate or functionally cooperate. IKZF1 (Ikaros) has crucial functions in the hematopoietic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) and is a regulator of immune cell development in early B cells and T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). JUN family factors are part of AP-1 complexes, forming homodimers or hetero-dimers with FOS family basic leucine zipper proteins and playing prominent roles in T cell biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). By ChIP-Seq, IKZF1 and JUN extensively co-localized in the human cell line GM12878 (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A</xref>)</bold>, for example at multiple sites in the <italic>TNFRSF8</italic> and <italic>IL10</italic> loci. The <italic>IL10</italic> locus included a highly conserved CNS9 region (highlighted in a red box and labeled in <bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B</xref></bold>), located approximately 9.1 kb upstream of the <italic>IL10</italic> promoter. Pairwise sequence alignment confirms the CNS9 region is highly conserved between human and mouse (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3C</xref></bold>). BATF, a FOS family member, also bound at these loci (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B</xref>)</bold>, consistent with BATF’s ability to partner with JUN in AICEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). To further characterize IKZF1-JUN complexes and validate their existence in vitro and in vivo, we performed ChIP-Seq experiments with antibodies to IKZF1 and JUN in primary mouse B cells that were either untreated or treated with LPS or LPS + IL-21 for 3 hours. We used B cells given the importance of IKZF1 for B cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). When cells were stimulated with LPS + IL-21, we identified a total of 9197 and 14433 binding sites for IKZF1 and JUN, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). The de novo motif analysis (HOMER) on the IKZF1 peaks (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>) indicated the most enriched motifs include ETS-like motif (ranks 1<sup>st</sup>) and EBF1-like motif (ranks 2<sup>nd</sup>), which are comparable to the previously identified IKZF1 motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>) as well as an IRF-like motif (ranks 3<sup>rd</sup>), etc., all of which ostensibly could be utilized by IKZF1 to bind to DNA. Strikingly, 8125 out of 9197 (88.3%) of IKZF1 peaks co-localized with JUN (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>), and the Reactome Pathway Analysis from the 8125 co-localized peaks suggested that the IKZF1-JUN complex might play broad biological roles as there were multiple enriched pathways, including “Cytokine Signaling in Immune System”, “Signaling by Interleukins”, TLR4-related cascades, and more. (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4</xref></bold>). IKZF1 binding was induced when cells were treated with LPS or LPS + IL-21, while JUN binding was prominent only with LPS + IL-21 treatment. IKZF1 sites globally co-localized with JUN (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref></bold>), including at known regulatory elements, for example at the <italic>Prdm1</italic> and <italic>Il10</italic> genes (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref></bold>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>), which are critical for plasma cell differentiation in IL-10-producing B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Importantly, the CNS9 region was identified not only in the human <italic>IL10</italic> gene (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B</xref></bold>) but also in the mouse <italic>Il10</italic> gene (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref></bold>), suggesting that this conserved region might be biologically important and dependent on the binding of both IKZF1 and JUN.</p>

<title>Cooperative binding of IKZF1 and JUN at the <italic>IL10</italic> upstream region</title>
<p>To identify potential physical interactions between IKZF1 and JUN, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments in the MINO cell line, a human mantle cell lymphoma B cell line. We confirmed that both JUN and IKZF1 were expressed in these cells, as assessed by western blotting (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). Although we could not co-immunoprecipiate IKZF1 with anti-JUN, JUN was weakly co-precipitated by anti-IKZF1, suggesting these factors might form a complex (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>), consistent with their binding in proximity in a genome-wide fashion as shown in <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref></bold>. The gene encoding IL-10 in both humans and mice is expressed in both T cells and B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>) and contains a canonical AP-1 motif and a nearby sequence (GTTGCAGTTTC) that is an 11 bp match for the variant 3<sup>rd</sup> IKZF1 motif peak in <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>.</bold>. These motifs were located in the CNS9 region (∼9.1 kb upstream of the <italic>IL10</italic> promoter) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2F and S3B</xref></bold>), which is a highly conserved non-coding region in the mouse and human genes (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3C</xref></bold>) and is critical for regulation of the <italic>IL10</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). We wished to assess whether this might be a variant IKZF1 motif and performed EMSAs using wild-type or mutant probes corresponding to CNS9 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>; the GTTGCAGTTTC motif 3 region and AP1 motifs are underlined) and MINO nuclear extracts. A strong complex formed with the WT CNS9 probe (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>, lane 2), but the intensity was weaker when the variant IKZF1 sequence was mutated (lane 4) and abolished when the AP-1 motif (lane 6) or both motifs (lane 8) were mutated (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref></bold>). We next evaluated the presence of IKZF1 and JUN by super-shifting with antibodies. As expected, a strong complex was seen only in the presence of nuclear extract (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref></bold>, lane 2 vs. 1). Neither mouse nor rabbit IgG affected the complex (lanes 3 and 4), but anti-IKZF1 consistently altered the appearance of the shift and anti-JUN gave a discrete slower mobility super-shifted band, consistent with both IKZF1 and JUN being part of the complex (lanes 5 and 6).</p>

<title>Both IKZF1 and JUN are critical for cooperative binding and transcriptional activation</title>
<p>We next performed EMSAs using the WT IR700 probe and 25, 50, 100, and 200 molar excess of cold competitor oligonucleotides corresponding to the WT or the variant IKZF1 mutant, AP-1 mutant, or double mutant CNS9 probes. The WT competitor dramatically reduced the binding activity and the variant IKZF1 mutant competitor moderately reduced the intensity of the shift, whereas AP-1 mutant or IKZF1/AP-1 double mutant oligonucleotides had little if any effect (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref></bold>). To determine whether IKZF1 and AP-1 proteins cooperatively bound to the CNS9 region, we used recombinant IKZF1 and cJUN/cFOS AP1 protein to perform EMSAs with wild-type and mutant IR700 probes corresponding to the <italic>IL10</italic> CNS9 site (data shown in <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold> and quantified in <bold>4D</bold>). With the wild-type probe, no binding activity was observed with IKZF1 alone (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>, lane 2</bold>), but binding occurred with AP-1 (<bold>lane 3</bold>), and stronger binding occurred when both IKZF1 and AP1 proteins were added (<bold>lane 4</bold>), suggesting cooperative binding of these factors. Binding was not detected to the AP-1 mutant probe (<bold>lane 8</bold>) and was lower with the variant IKZF1 mutant probe (<bold>lane 6</bold>), suggesting that the AP-1 site is absolutely required for the cooperative binding and that the putative variant IKZF1 site had low affinity in its own right but cooperated with the AP1 site to allow cooperative binding of the factors. Correspondingly, activity of the WT <italic>IL10</italic> luciferase reporter was potently induced by LPS in primary B cells compared to vector but not when IKZF1, AP-1, or both motifs were mutated (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref></bold>), suggesting both IKZF1 and AP-1 are important for transcriptional activation of this gene. Besides B cells, IKZF1 has been shown to be a regulator of <italic>Il10</italic> gene expression in mouse T cells, in which <italic>Il10</italic> expression was significantly lower compared with wild-type T cells in response to TCR stimulation or during Th2 differentiation in <italic>Ikzf1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). We therefore also analyzed activity in T cells. <italic>IL10</italic> reporter activity was potently induced, but expression was diminished when the variant IKZF1 motif, or particularly the AP1 motif or both motifs were mutated (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref></bold>), demonstrating cooperative binding and transcriptional activation by IKZF1 and AP1 proteins in this setting as well. These results provide mechanistic insights into the actions of IKZF1 and underscore the power of the SPICE pipeline for identifying new transcription factor cooperative effects.</p>

<p>We have developed a computational pipeline, SPICE, that can predict novel transcription factor binding partners and optimal DNA spacing of motifs. In this report, we analyzed the ENCODE database using the SPICE pipeline, successfully predicting a range of known interactions as well as a multitude of novel interactions. Here, we focused on JUN-IKZF composite elements, an association not previously demonstrated. ChIP-Seq analysis demonstrated that IKZF1 co-localizes with JUN in a genome-wide manner, and that the major two motifs identified were canonical IKZF1 motifs, but that non-canonical variant motifs were also identified, including at the <italic>IL10</italic> gene locus. We could coprecipitate JUN with anti-IKZF1, and moreover, we found functional cooperation between IKZF1 and AP1 motifs. Specifically, we found that IKZF1 and JUN not only cooperatively bound to the CNS9 region in the <italic>IL10</italic> locus but that both IKZF1 and AP1 motifs were critical for transcriptional activity of a reporter construct in both B and T cells. Although we focused on the <italic>IL10</italic> locus, we demonstrated genome-wide co-localization of these factors, and reactome pathway analysis linked the genes in which they were found to a range of pathways including but not limited to cytokine signaling pathways (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref></bold>); thus, the physiological relevance of cooperation of these transcription factors may be broad, potentially including in the context of cellular function and diseases. The identification of JUN-IKZF1complexes demonstrates that our computational approach and novel pipeline, SPICE, can predict novel transcription factors binding complexes and their optimal spacing, providing a valuable new way to discover composite elements that contribute to a highly specific pattern of gene transcriptional regulation and to better understand gene regulatory networks in the immune response.</p>

<p>All mapped files of Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBS) were downloaded from ENCODE project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/encodeDCC/wgEncodeSydhTfbs/">http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/encodeDCC/wgEncodeSydhTfbs/</ext-link>), from a collection of libraries generated by Stanford/Yale/USC/Harvard (SYUH). The following are the step-by-step analysis corresponding to the flowcart in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>. <italic>“Idenfity TF peaks”</italic>: MACS 1.4.2(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>) was used to identifiy significant peaks for each transcription factor using input IgG as control, <italic>p-value</italic> threshold was set as 1e<sup>-10</sup>. Alternatively, one can directly download SYUH pre-defined peaks--i.e., SydhTfbsGm12878JundIggrabPk.narrowPeak. <italic>“De novo motif analysis”</italic>: MEME (multiple EM for motif elicitation) was used to to “de novo” discover consensus primary motifs from the 1000 most significant TF binding sites (sorted by <italic>-log10(p-value)</italic> in peak file). <italic>“Using top-enriched motif as primary motif”</italic>: The top-enriched motif (sorted by <italic>e-value</italic>, which is based on its log likelihood ratio, width, sites, the background letter frequencies) was selected as the primary motif. <italic>“Loading all sequences”, “Determining best primary motif matches”, and “Eliminating sequences without primary matches”</italic>: If there was indeed a primary motif from a particular TF ChIP-Seq, we extracted 500 bp DNA sequences centered on TF peak summits and only kept sequences containing primary motif matches and eliminated sequences without primary matches. <italic>“Loading secondary motifs from database” and “Scanning for secondary motifs”</italic>: We performed a spacing distribution analysis using SpaMo from MEME suite(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) from DNA sequences containing primary motif to search for the strongest secondary motif from a motif database (HOCOMOCO, v11) to identify significantly enriched spacings. The relative spacings of the primary and secondary motifs in all identified ChIP-Seq peaks were counted and the probability of each spacing was calculated. A <italic>p-value</italic> was assigned based on the Binomial Test, using the number of observed secondary spacings falling into the given 1-bp bin, adjusted for the number of bins tested. <italic>“Sorting significant secondary motifs and spacing” and “Grouping redundant secondary motifs</italic>”: After all the calculations were done, SPICE ranked the non-redundant secondary motifs with the best spacing, or gap (e.g., 4 bp) that passed the significance threshold (<italic>p-value</italic> &lt; 0.01) in order of significance. Similar secondary motifs belonging to the same cluster (e.g., ETS1 and ELF1 belong to the same ETS cluster) were grouped together and ranked in order of <italic>p-value</italic>. We performed the above step-by-step analysis iteratively for each individual TF ChIP-Seq and generated the final result of interaction sparse matrix to plot in heat map.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study presents a screening pipeline (SPICE) for detecting DNA motif spacing preferences between TF partners. SPICE predicts previously known composite elements, but experiments to elucidate the nature of the predicted novel interaction between JUN and IKZF1 are <bold>incomplete</bold>. These experiments would benefit from more rigorous approaches using other databases to explore additional relevant data. The work will be of broad interest to those involved in dissecting the regulatory logic of mammalian enhancers and promoters.</p>

<p>The authors report a new bioinformatics pipeline (&quot;SPICE&quot;) to predict pairwise cooperative binding-sites based on input ChIP-seq data for transcription factor (TF)-of-interest, analyzed against DNA-binding sites (DNA motifs) in a database (HOCOMOCO). The pipeline also predicts the optimal distance between the paired binding sites. The pipeline correctly predicted known/reported transcription factor cooperations, and also predicted new cooperations, not yet reported in literature. The authors choose to follow up on the predicted interaction between Ikaros and Jun. Using ChIP-seq in mouse B cells, they show extensive overlap in binding regions between Ikaros and Jun in LPS+IL21 stimulated cells. In a human B-lineage cell line (MINO) they show that anti-Ikaros Ab can co-immunoprecipitate Jun protein, and that the MINO cell extracts contain protein(s) that can bind to the CNS9 probe (conserved region upstream of IL10 gene), and that binding is lost upon mutation of two basepairs in the AP1 binding motif, and reduced upon mutation of two basepairs in the non-canonical Ikaros binding motif. Part of this protein complex is super-shifted with an anti-Jun antibody, and more DNA is shifted with addition of an anti-Ikaros antibody.</p>
<p>The authors perform EMSA showing that recombinant Jun can bind to the tested DNA-region (IL10 CNS9) and that addition of recombinant Ikaros (or anti-Ikaros antibody in Fig 3E) can enhance binding (increase amount of DNA shifted). The authors lastly show that the IL10 CNS9 DNA region can enhance transcription in B- and T-cells with a luciferase reporter assay, and that 2 bp mutation of the Ikaros or Jun DNA motifs greatly reduce or abolish this activity.</p>
<p>This is interesting work, with two main contributions: The SPICE pipeline (if made available to the scientific community), and the report of interaction between Ikaros and Jun. However, the distinction between DNA motifs, and the proteins actually binding and having a biological function, should be made clear consistently throughout the manuscript. The same DNA motifs can be bound by multiple factors, for instance within transcription factor families with highly homology in the DNA-binding regions of the proteins.</p>
<p>Some specific points:</p>
<p>SPICE: It is unclear if this is uploaded somewhere to be available to the scientific community.</p>
<p>It was unclear if Ikaros-Jun interaction was initially found from primary Jun ChIP-seq (and secondary Ikaros motif from HOCOMOCO) or from primary Ikaros CHIP-seq (and secondary Jun motif from HOCOMOCO). And - what were the two DNA motifs (primary and secondary, and their distance) from the SPICE analysis?</p>
<p>Authors have mostly careful considerations and statements. One additional comment is that binding does not equal function (Fig 2D), and that opening of chromatin (by any other factor(s)) can give DNA-binding factors (like Ikaros and Jun) the opportunity to bind, without functional consequence for the biological process studied.</p>
<p>Figure 2E: Ikaros is reported to be expressed at baseline in murine B cells, yet the Ikaros ChIP-seq in unstimulated cells had what looks to be no significant or low peaks. LPS stimulation induced strong Ikaros ChIP-seq signal. A western blot showing the Ikaros protein levels in the 3 conditions could help understand if the binding pattern is due to protein expression level induction. Similar for Jun (western in the 3 conditions), which seemed to mainly bind in the LPS+IL21 condition. Furthermore, as also suggested below, tracks showing Ikaros and Jun binding from all conditions (unstimulated, LPS only and LPS+IL21 stimulated cells), at select genomic loci, would be helpful in illustrating this difference in signal between the different cell conditions. This is relevant in regards to the point of cooperativity of binding.</p>
<p>ChIP-seq in mouse B cells showed that Ikaros bound strongly in LPS stimulated cells, in the (relative) absence of Jun binding (Fig. 2C). However, in EMSA (Fig 3C), there is no binding when the AP1 site is mutated, and the authors describe this as Ikaros binding site. What does the Ikaros binding look like at this genomic location in LPS (only) stimulated cells? The authors could show the same figure as in Fig 2F but show Ikaros and Jun ChIP-seq tracks at IL10 CNS9 locus from all conditions to compare binding in unstimulated, LPS and LPS+IL21 cells.</p>
<p>Also: How does this reconcile with the luciferase assay in Fig 4E, where LPS (only) stimulation is used, which in Fig 2E only/mainly induced Ikaros, and not Jun ChIP-seq signal (while EMSA indicate Ikaros cannot bind the site alone, but can enhance Jun-dependent binding).</p>
<p>Comment on statements in results section: The luciferase assays in B and T cells do not demonstrate the role of the proteins Ikaros or Jun directly (page 10, lines 208 and surrounding text). The assay measures an effect of the DNA sequences (implying binding of some transcription factor(s)), but does not identify which protein factors bind there.</p>
<p>Lastly, the authors only discuss Ikaros (using the term IKZF1 which is the gene symbol for the Ikaros protein). There are other Ikaros family members that have high homology and that are reported to bind similar DNA sequences (for instance Aiolos and Helios), which are expressed in B-cells and T-cells. A discussion of this is of relevance, as these are different proteins, although belonging to the same family (the Ikaros-family) of transcription factors. For instance, western for Aiolos and Helios will likely detect Aiolos in the B cells used, and Helios in the T cells used.</p>

<p>The authors of this study have designed a novel screening pipeline to detect DNA motif spacing preferences between TF partners using publicly available data. They were able to recapitulate previously known composite elements, such as the AP-1/IRF4 composite elements (AICE) and predict many composite elements that are expected to be very useful to the community of researchers interested in dissecting the regulatory logic of mammalian enhancers and promoters. The authors then focus on a novel, SPICE predicted interaction between JUN and IKZF1, and show that under LPS and IL-21 treatment, JUN and IKZF1 in B cells have significant overlap in their genomic localization. Next, to know whether the two TFs physically interact, a co-immunoprecipitation experiment was performed. While JUN immunoprecipitated with an anti-IKZF1 antibody, curiously IKZF1 did not immunoprecipitate with an anti-JUN antibody. Finally, EMSA and luciferase experiments were performed to show that the two TFs bind cooperatively at an IL20 upstream probe.</p>
<p>Major strengths:</p>
<p>
1. SPICE was able to recapitulate previously known composite elements, such as the AP-1/IRF4 composite elements (AICE).</p>
<p>
2. Under LPS and IL-21 treatment, JUN and IKZF1 in B cells have significant overlap in their genomic localization. This is very good supporting evidence for the efficacy of SPICE in detecting TF partners.</p>
<p>Major weaknesses:</p>
<p>
1. The authors fail to convincingly show that IKZF1 and Jun physically interact. A quantitative measurement of their interaction strength would have been ideal.</p>
<p>
2. The super-shift experiment to show that the proteins bound to their EMSA probe were indeed IKZF1 and JUN are not very convincing and would benefit from efforts to quantify the shift (Figure 3E). Nuclear extracts from cells with single or double CRISPR knock outs of the two TFs would have been ideal.</p>
<p>
3. There is a second band beneath the more prominent band in the EMSA experiment with recombinant IKZF1 and JUN (Figure 4C). This second band is most probably bound by IKZF1 because it becomes weaker when the IKZF1 site is mutated and is completely absent when only JUN is added. This is completely ignored by the authors. Therefore, experiments with EMSA fail to convincingly show that IKZF1 and Jun bind cooperatively. They could just as well bind independently to the two sites.</p>

Moreover, the AP-1 site in Fig. 4D and 4E can be bound by other AP-1 factors as well, such as JUND, JUNB, BATF, etc. These points can be made in the manuscript.

<p>Regarding the above two points, we respectfully disagree with the reviewer. Although SpaMo was used, the pipeline we developed is new and our findings are distinctive. The pipeline can systematically screen and predict novel protein-protein binding complex, and our discovery related to IKZF1-JUN composite element is new and the biological findings and validation are distinctive. This point is now made in the revised manuscript. As requested, we have added some additional references.</p>

<p>We agree that it is not conclusive that the factors interact directly as opposed to binding to nearby sites on DNA, which is what SPICE was intended to detect. We never intended to claim that we established a definite physical interaction. The coIP worked in one direction, but not reliably in the other, even though we have tried a total of four different antibodies. We now mention in the revised manuscript that we have tried the additional anti-JUN antibodies, cJun (60A8, CST) and JunD (D17G2, CST).</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that using single or double knockouts would be helpful, but other Ikaros family or Jun family members could be involved, so such studies might not be definitive. That is why we used purified proteins to show apparent cooperative binding (Figure 4C).</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>The second band has a faster mobility and might relate to IKZF1, although this is difficult to know. We comment on this band on revised manuscript. As noted above, the purified protein experiments do suggest cooperativity. However, our overall intent was to identify factors binding in proximity, which SPICE has successfully done, even if the binding was “independent”.</p>
