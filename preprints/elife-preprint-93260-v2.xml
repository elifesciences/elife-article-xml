<title>Abstract</title><p>Maternal smoking has been linked to adverse health outcomes in newborns but the extent to which it impacts newborn health has not been quantified through an aggregated cord blood DNA methylation (DNAm) score. Here we examine the feasibility of using cord blood DNAm scores leveraging large external studies as discovery samples to capture the epigenetic signature of maternal smoking and its influence on newborns in White European and South Asian populations. We first examined association between individual CpGs and cigarette smoking during pregnancy, smoking exposure in two White European birth cohorts (n = 744). Several previously reported genes for maternal smoking were supported, with the strongest and most consistent signal from the <italic>GFI1</italic> gene (6 CpGs with <italic>p</italic> &lt; 5×10<sup>-5</sup>). Leveraging established CpGs for maternal smoking, we constructed a cord blood epigenetic score of maternal smoking that was internally validated in one of the European-origin cohorts (n = 347). This score was then tested for association with smoking status, secondary smoking exposure during pregnancy, and health outcomes in offspring measured after birth in an independent white European (n = 397) and a South Asian birth cohort (n = 504). The epigenetic maternal smoking score was strongly associated with smoking status during pregnancy (OR=1.09 [1.07,1.10], <italic>p</italic>=1.96×10<sup>-32</sup>) and more hours of self-reported smoking exposure per week (1.97 [1.22, 2.71], <italic>p</italic>=2.80×10<sup>-7</sup>) in White Europeans, but not with self-reported exposure (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) in South Asians. The same score was consistently associated with smaller birth size (-0.22 cm [-0.35, -0.083], <italic>p</italic>=0.0016) and lower birth weight (-0.05kg [-0.075, -0.025], <italic>p</italic> =3.42×10<sup>-4</sup>) in the combined South Asian and White European cohorts. This cord blood epigenetic score can help identify babies exposed to maternal smoking and assess its long-term impact on growth. Notably, these results indicate a consistent association between the DNAm signature of maternal smoking and a small body size and low birthweight in newborns, in both white European mothers who exhibited some amount of smoking and in South Asian mothers who themselves were not active smokers.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>In the revised manuscript, we have taken the key suggestions by reviewers to 1) better illustrate the analytical flow and statistical methods, in particular, to show which datasets had been used in discovery, validation, and testing of the score, as a main figure in the manuscript and in the graphical abstract; 2) demonstrate there is no possibility of overfitting in our approach using statistical metrics of performance; 3) emphasize the goal was not for discovery (e.g. our own EWAS was not used for the score), but to compare with existing EWASs and contrast the results from the white European and SA populations; 4) and supplement the analysis with previously derived maternal smoking, smoking and air pollution methylation score and to explore additional health outcomes in relation to lung health in newborns.</p></fn>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Maternal smoking has adverse effects on offspring health including pre-term delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>), stillbirth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>), and low birth weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>), and is associated with pregnancy complications such as maternal higher blood pressure, and gestational diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Consistent with the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) hypothesis, maternal smoking exposes the developing fetus to harmful chemicals in tobacco that negatively impact the health of newborns, resulting in early-onset metabolic diseases, such as childhood obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Yet self-reported smoking status is subject to underreporting among pregnant women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). This could subsequently impact the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing smoking during pregnancy and may skew data on the risks associated with maternal smoking.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is one of the most commonly studied epigenetic mechanisms by which cells regulate gene expression, and is increasingly recognized for its potential as a biomarker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Differential DNA methylation has been established as a reliable biochemical response to cigarette smoking and was shown to capture the long-lasting effects of persistent smoking in ex-smokers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Recent large epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have robustly identified differentially methylated cytosine–phosphate–guanine (CpG) sites associated with adult smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>) and maternal smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Our recent systematic review of 17 cord blood epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) found that out of the 290 CpG sites reported to be associated with at least one of the following: maternal diabetes, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), diet during pregnancy, smoking, and gestational age, 19 sites were identified in more than one study and all of them associated with maternal smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Furthermore, these findings have led to a more thorough investigation of the epigenetic mechanisms underlying associations between well-established epidemiological exposures and outcomes, such as the relationship between maternal smoking and birth weight in Europeans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) and the less studied African American populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) as well as between maternal diet and cardiovascular health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>).</p>
<p>Only a handful of cohort studies were designed to assess the influence of maternal exposures on DNA methylation changes in non-Europeans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). It has been suggested that systematic patterns of methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>), such as cell composition, could differ between individuals of different ancestral backgrounds, which could in turn confound the association between differential DNAm and smoking behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). These systematic differences also contribute to different smoking-related methylation signals at individual CpGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Thus, a comparative study of maternal smoking exposure is a first step towards generalizing existing EWAS results to other populations and a necessary step towards addressing health disparities that exist between populations due to societal privilege, including race or ethnicity and socioeconomic factors.</p>
<p>A promising direction in epigenetic studies of adult smoking is the application of a methylation score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>); this strategy can also be applied to disseminate current knowledge on differential DNA methylation studies of maternal smoking. A methylation score is usually tissue-specific and combines information from multiple CpGs using statistical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Reducing the number of predictors and measurement noise in the data can lead to better statistical power and a more parsimonious instrument for subsequent analyses. It is also of interest to determine whether methylation scores demonstrate the capacity to predict outcomes in diverse human populations, given the presence of systematic differences in methylation patterns due to ancestral backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>).</p>
<p>In this paper, we investigated the epigenetic signature of maternal smoking on cord blood DNA methylation in newborns, as well as its association with newborn and later life outcomes in one South Asian which refers to people who originate from the Indian subcontinent, and two predominantly European-origin birth cohorts. Similar to the Born in Bradford study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>), we observed several differentiating epidemiological characteristics between South Asian and European-origin mothers. Notably, almost none of the South Asian mothers were current smokers and had low smoking rates pre-pregnancy as compared to European mothers, which is consistent with the broader trends of lower smoking rates in South Asian females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Another relevant observation is the small birth size and low birth weight in the South Asian newborns. These differences in newborn size and weight may be influenced by various factors, including maternal nutrition, genetics, and socioeconomic status. Keeping these differences in mind, we first conducted cohort-specific epigenetic association studies between available CpGs and maternal smoking in the predominantly European-origin cohorts, benchmarking with previously identified CpGs for maternal smoking and adult smoking. Second, we leveraged the reported summary statistics from existing large EWASs to construct a methylation risk score (MRS) for maternal smoking. The MRS was first internally validated in one of the European-origin cohorts and then tested in a second independent European-origin cohort. Third, we examined the association between maternal smoking MRS and newborn health outcomes, including length, weight, BMI ponderal index, and early-life anthropometrics in both European and South Asian cohorts.</p>

<title>Study population</title>
<p>The NutriGen Alliance is a consortium consisting of four prospective, population-based birth cohorts that enrolled birthing mother and newborn pairs in Canada. Details of these cohorts have been described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). The current investigation focused on i). European-origin offspring from the population-based CHILD study who were selected for methylation analysis, ii). The Family Atherosclerosis Monitoring In early life (FAMILY) study that is predominately European-origin, and iii). The SouTh Asian biRth cohorT (START) study that is exclusively comprised of people who originated from the Indian subcontinent known as South Asians. The ethnicity of the parents was self-reported and recorded at baseline in all three cohorts. Biological samples, clinical assessments, and questionnaires were used to derive health phenotypes and an array of genetic, epigenetic, and metabolomic data. The superordinate goal of the NutriGen study is to understand how nutrition, environmental exposures, and physical health of mothers impact the health and early development of their offspring using a multi-omics approach.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Methylation data processing and quality controls</title>
<p>Newborn cord blood samples were processed using two methylation array technologies. About half of the START samples and selected samples from CHILD were hybridized to the Illumina Human-Methylation450K BeadChip (HM450K) array, which covers CpGs in the entire genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>) The raw methylation data were generated by the Illumina iScan software and separately pre-processed for START and CHILD using the “<italic>sesame</italic>” R package following pipelines designed for HM450K BeadChip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). The FAMILY samples were profiled using a targeted array based on the Infinium Methylation EPIC designed by the Genetic and Molecular Epidemiology Laboratory (GMEL; Hamilton, Canada). The GMEL customized array includes ∼3000 CpG sites that were previously reported to associate with complex traits or exposures and was designed to maximize discovery while keeping the costs of profiling epigenome-wide DNA methylation down. The targeted methylation data were pre-processed using a customized quality control pipeline and functions from the “<italic>sesame</italic>” R package recommended for EPIC.</p>
<p>Pre-processed data were then used to derive the β-value matrix, where each column gives the methylation level at a CpG site as a ratio of the probe intensity to the overall probe intensity. Additional quality control filters were applied to the final beta-value matrices to remove samples with &gt; 10% missing probes and CpG probes with &gt;10% samples missing. Cross-reactive probes and SNP probes were removed as recommended for HM450 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>) and EPIC arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). For CpG probes with a missing rate &lt;10%, mean imputation was used to fill in the missing values. We further excluded samples that were either mismatches between reported sex and methylation-inferred sex or were duplicates. Finally, considering the low prevalence of smokers, we sought to reduce spurious associations by removing non-informative probes that were either all hypomethylated (β-value &lt; 0.1) or hypermethylated (β-value &gt; 0.9), which have been shown to have less optimal performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). A summary of the sample and probe inclusion/exclusion is shown in Supplementary Table 1. A detailed description of pre-processing and quality control steps is included in Supplementary Material.</p>
<p>Cell-type proportions (CD8T, CD4T, Natural Killer cells, B cells, monocytes, granulocytes, and nucleated red blood cells) were estimated following a reference-based approach developed for cord blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>) and using R packages “<italic>FlowSorted.CordBloodCombined.450k</italic>” and “<italic>FlowSorted.Blood.EPIC</italic>”.

<title>Phenotype data processing and quality controls</title>
<p>At the time of enrollment, all pregnant women completed a comprehensive questionnaire that collected information on prenatal diet, smoking, education, socioeconomic factors, physical activities and health as detailed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Maternal smoking history (0=never smoked, 1=quit before this pregnancy, 2=quit during this pregnancy, or 3=current smoker) was assessed during the second trimester (at baseline). Smoke exposure was measured as “number of hours exposed per week”. GDM was determined based on a combination of oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), self-report, and reported diabetic treatments (insulin, pills, or restricted diet). For South Asian mothers in START, the same OGTT threshold as Born in Bradford (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>) was used, while the International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IASDPSG) criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>) for OGTT were used in CHILD and FAMILY cohorts. Mode of delivery (emergency c-section vs. other) was collected at the time of delivery.</p>
<p>Newborn length and weight were collected immediately after birth and extracted from medical chart. The newborns were then followed up at 1, 2, 3, and 5 years of age and provided basic anthropometric measurements, including height, weight, hip and waist circumference, BMI, sum of the skinfolds (triceps skinfold and subscapular skinfold). Additional phenotypes included smoking exposures (hours per week) at home, potential allergy based on mother reporting any of: eczema, hay fever, wheeze, asthma, food allergy (egg, cow milk, soy, other) for her child in FAMILY and START, and asthma based on mother’s opinion in CHILD (“In your opinion, does the child have any of the following? Asthma”).</p>

<title>Phenotype and Methylation Data Consolidation</title>
<p>The current investigation examines the impact of maternal smoking or smoke exposure on DNA methylation derived from newborn cord blood in START and the two predominately European cohorts (CHILD and FAMILY). To maximize sample size in FAMILY and CHILD, we retained either self-identified or genetically confirmed Europeans based on available genetic data (Supplementary Table 1). The cohorts consist of representative population samples without enrichment for any clinical conditions, though only singleton mothers were invited to participate. For continuous phenotypes, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) using the F-statistics or a two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test was used to compare the mean difference across the three cohorts or two groups, respectively. For categorical phenotypes, a chi-square test of independence was used to compare the difference in frequencies of observed categories. Note that three of the categories under smoking history in the START cohort had expected cell counts less than 5, and was thus excluded from the comparison, the reported <italic>p</italic>-value was for CHILD and FAMILY.</p>
<p>The final analytical datasets, after combining the quality-controlled methylation data and phenotypic data, included 352, 411, and 504 mother-newborn pairs from CHILD, FAMILY, and START, respectively. Demographic characteristics and relevant covariates of the epigenetic subsample and the overall sample are summarized in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and Supplementary Table 2, respectively.</p>

<title>Epigenome-Wide Association of Maternal Smoking in European Cohorts</title>
<p>Since there were no current smokers in START (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), we tested the association between maternal smoking and differential methylated sites in FAMILY (# of CpG = 2,544) and CHILD (# of CpG = 200,050). The primary outcome variable was “current smoker”, defined by mothers self-identified as currently smoking during the pregnancy vs. those who never smoked or quit either before or during pregnancy. We also included a secondary outcome variable “ever smoker”, defined by mothers who are current smokers or have quit smoking vs. those who never smoked. A tertiary outcome was smoking exposure, measured by the number of hours per week reported by the expectant mothers, and was available in all cohorts. We summarized the type of analyses for different outcomes in Supplementary Table 3.</p>
<p>We first conducted a separate epigenetic association study in each cohort, testing the association between methylation β-values at individual CpGs and the smoking phenotype using either a logistic regression model for smoking status or a linear regression for smoking exposure as the outcome. The model adjusted for additional covariates including the estimated cord blood cell proportions, maternal age, social disadvantage index, which is a continuous composite measure of social and economic exposures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>), mother’s years of education, GDM, and parity. The smoking exposure variable was skewed, and a rank-based transformation was applied to mimic a standard normal distribution.</p>
<p>We then meta-analyzed association results for maternal smoking status in the European cohorts using an inverse variance-weighted fixed-effect model. The meta-analysis was conducted for 2,112 CpGs that were available in both CHILD (profiled using HM450K) and FAMILY (profiled using the targeted array). For the tertiary outcome, we conducted an inverse variance meta-analysis including START using both a fixed-effect model. For each EWAS or meta-analysis, the false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment was used to control multiple testing and we considered CpGs that passed an FDR-adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05 to be relevant for maternal smoking.</p>

<title>Using DNA Methylation to Construct Predictive Models for Maternal Smoking</title>
<p>We sought to construct a predictive model in the form of a methylation risk score (MRS) using reported associations of maternal smoking. The proposed solution adapted the existing lassosum method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>) that was originally designed for polygenic risk scores, where the matrix of SNP genotypes (<italic>X</italic>) can be conveniently replaced by the β-value matrix. For more details, see the Supplementary Material. Briefly, an objective function under elastic-net constraint was minimized to obtain the elastic-net solution y, where only summary statistics (b) and a scalar of the covariance between the β-values of the CpGs (X<sup>I</sup>X) are needed. The tuning parameters A and A<sub>2</sub> were chosen by validating on the observed smoking history (as a continuous outcome) in CHILD that produced the most significant model. The optimized A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> were then used to create a final model that entails a list of CpGs and their corresponding weights, which were then used to calculate a MRS for maternal smoking in the FAMILY and START samples.</p>
<p>The summary statistics of the discovery EWAS were obtained from EWAS catalog (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ewascatalog.org/">http://www.ewascatalog.org/</ext-link>) reported under “PubMed ID 27040690” by Joubert and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). The summary statistics were restricted to the analysis “sustained maternal smoking in pregnancy effect on newborns adjusted for cell composition”. Of the 2620 maternal smoking CpGs that passed the initial screening, 2,107 were available in CHILD but only 128 were common to CHILD, FAMILY, and START. To evaluate whether the targeted GMEL-EPIC array design has comparable performance as the epigenome-wide array to evaluate the epigenetic signature of maternal smoking, a total of three MRSs were constructed, two using the 128 CpGs available in all cohorts – across the HM450K and targeted GMEL-EPIC arrays – and with either CHILD (n = 347 with non-missing smoking history) or FAMILY (n = 397 with non-missing smoking history) as the validation cohort, and another using 2,107 CpGs that were only available in CHILD and START samples with CHILD as the validation cohort. The validation model considered the continuous smoking history without modification as the outcome, while accounting for covariates, which included the estimated cord blood cell proportions, maternal age, social disadvantage index, mother’s years of education, GDM, and parity. Henceforth, we referred to these derived maternal smoking scores as the FAMILY targeted MRS, CHILD targeted MRS, and the HM450K MRS, respectively. To benchmark and compare with existing maternal smoking MRSs, we calculated the Reese score using 28 CpGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>), Richmond score using 568 CpGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>), Rauschert score using 204 CpGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>), Joubert score using all 2,620 CpGs with evidence of association for maternal smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), and finally a three-CpG score for air pollution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). The details of these scores and score weight can be found in Supplementary Table 4.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2g">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>For each cohort, we contrasted the three versions of the derived scores using an analysis of variance analysis (ANOVA) along with pairwise comparisons using a two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test to examine how much information might be lost due to the exclusion of more than 10-fold CpGs at the validation stage, in all samples and in non-smokers. We also examined the correlation structure between all derived and external MRSs using a heatmap summarizing their pairwise Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Then, we compared the mean difference of each MRS score among smoking history using an ANOVA <italic>F</italic>-test and two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test to understand whether there was a dosage dependence in the cord blood DNAm signature of maternal smoking. Additionally, each score was tested against a binary outcome for current smoker vs. not, and two continuous measures for smoking history and weekly smoking exposure. The binary outcome was tested using a logistic regression model and the predictive performance was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The continuous outcome was examined using a linear regression model and its performance was quantified using the adjusted R<sup>2</sup>. For the derived MRS, we empirically assessed whether the resulting score was portable to the START cohort by examining the distribution of the final score among the overall samples and never smokers. The comparison examined a mean difference using an analysis of variance <italic>F</italic>-test, a variance difference using a Levene’s test, and the overall distribution using a non-parametric Anderson-Darling test. Finally, we tested the association between each maternal smoking MRS and smoking phenotypes in mothers, as well as offspring phenotypes using a linear regression model, when applicable, adjusting for the child’s age at each visit. The association results were meta-analyzed for phenotypes with homogeneous effects across the cohorts using a fixed-effect model.</p>

<title>Cohort Sample Characteristics</title>
<p>The analyses included 763 European mother-child pairs with cord blood DNAm data from the CHILD study (CHILD; <italic>n</italic> = 352)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>) and The Family Atherosclerosis Monitoring In earLY life (FAMILY; <italic>n</italic> = 411) study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>), and 503 South Asian mother-child pairs from The SouTh Asian biRth cohorT (START) study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). We observed lower past smoking and missingness on smoking history among pregnant women in START as compared to CHILD or FAMILY using the epigenetic subsample (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and the overall sample (Supplementary Table 2). Pregnant women in START were significantly different from CHILD or FAMILY in that they were on average younger at delivery, had a lower BMI, and a higher rate of GDM, in line with other cohort studies in South Asian populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). As compared to START, newborn infants from CHILD and FAMILY had a longer gestational period, a higher birth weight, and a higher BMI at birth (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; Supplementary Table 2). We observed no difference between cohorts in terms of parity or newborn sex in the epigenetic subsample (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Within the European epigenetic subsample, of the 744 mother–newborn pairs with complete smoking history data, 40 (5.3%) newborns were exposed to current maternal smoking, which is on the lower end of the spectrum for the prevalence of smoking during pregnancy (9.2%-32.5%) among Canadians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). In addition, mothers who smoked during pregnancy were on average younger, had fewer years of education, and had higher household exposure to smoking (Supplementary Table 6). However, there was no statistically significant difference between newborns exposed to current and none or previous smoking in terms of birth weight, birth length, gestational age, or estimated cord blood cell proportions.</p>

<title>Epigenetic Association of Maternal Smoking in White Europeans</title>
<p>The two predominantly White European cohorts, FAMILY (<italic>n</italic> = 397) and CHILD (<italic>n</italic> = 347), contributed to the meta-analysis of maternal smoking for both the primary outcome of current smoking (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-A</xref>) and the secondary outcome of ever smoking (Supplementary Figure 1). The top associated CpGs with current maternal smoking were mapped to the growth factor independent 1 (<italic>GFI1</italic>) gene on chromosome 1, with cg12876356 as the lead (meta-analyzed effect = -1.11±0.22; meta-analyzed <italic>p</italic> = 2.6×10<sup>-6</sup>; FDR adjusted <italic>p</italic> = 0.006; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).

The top associated CpG from the meta-analysis of smoking exposure (hours per week) in the European-origin cohorts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-B</xref>) was cpg01798813 on chromosome 17, which was also associated with maternal smoking and was consistent in the direction of association (meta-analyzed effect = -0.18±0.04; meta-analyzed <italic>p</italic> = 1.4×10<sup>-5</sup>; FDR adjusted <italic>p</italic> = 0.04; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). There was no noticeable inflation of empirical type I error in the association p-values from the meta-analysis, with the median of the observed association test statistic roughly equal to the expected median (Supplementary Figure 2). As a sensitivity analysis, we repeated the analysis for the continuous smoking exposure under rank transformation vs. raw phenotype for the associated CpG in <italic>GFI1</italic> and examined the regression diagnostics (Supplementary Material), and found that the model under rank-transformation deviated less from assumptions. Further, we observed consistency in the direction of association for the 128 CpGs that overlapped between our meta-analysis and the 2,620 CpGs with evidence of association for maternal smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) (Supplementary Figure 3). Specifically, the Pearson’s correlation coefficient for maternal smoking and weekly smoking exposure was 0.72 and 0.60, respectively.

<title>Methylation Risk Score (MRS) Captures Maternal Smoking and Smoking Exposure</title>
<p>The final MRSs, validated using CHILD European samples (n = 347), included 15 and 143 CpG markers (Supplementary Table 7) from the targeted array and the epigenome-wide HM450 array, respectively. Both produced methylation scores that were significantly associated with maternal smoking history (ANOVA F-test <italic>p</italic>-values =1.0×10<sup>-6</sup> and 2.4×10<sup>-14</sup> in CHILD and 6.9×10<sup>-16</sup> and &lt;2.2×10<sup>-16</sup> in FAMILY; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), and the best among alternative scores for CHILD and FAMILY (Supplementary Table 5). With the exception of the air pollution MRS, all remaining scores were marginally associated with smoking history in both CHILD and FAMILY (Supplementary Figure 5) and correlated with each other (Supplementary Figure 6). There was no statistically significant difference in mean between the two scores in any of the three cohorts (two-sample t-test <italic>p</italic>s &gt; 0.6) or among non-smokers (two-sample t-test <italic>p</italic>s&gt; 0.6; Supplementary Figure 7). Since the HM450 score provides statistically more significant results in both CHILD and FAMILY with smoking history, despite the reduction in CpGs included (only 10 out of 143 CpGs present in FAMILY; Supplementary Table 5), we proceeded with the HM450 MRS model constructed using the 143 CpGs in subsequent analyses.</p>

<p>The HM450 MRS was significantly associated with maternal smoking history in CHILD and FAMILY (n = 397), but not in START (n = 503; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) – not surprisingly – due to the low number of ever-smokers (<italic>n</italic> = 2). A weak dose-dependent relationship between the MRS and the four categories of maternal smoking status in the severity of exposure ([0] = never smoked; [1] = quit before this pregnancy; [2] = quit during this pregnancy; [3] = currently smoking) was present in CHILD but was not replicated in FAMILY (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). The areas under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (area under the curve or AUC) for detecting current smokers were 0.95 and 0.89 in CHILD and FAMILY, respectively, while the AUCs for detecting ever-smokers were 0.61 and 0.60 (Supplementary Table 5), respectively. Meanwhile, the maternal smoking MRS was significantly associated with increased number of hours exposed to smoking per week in the two White European cohorts (1.97±0.38 hours per 1 unit of increase in MRS, FDR adjusted <italic>p</italic> = 4.2×10<sup>-6</sup>; Supplementary Table 8; cohort specific <italic>p</italic>=0.0087 in CHILD and 0.51±0.15, <italic>p</italic>=6.9×10<sup>-5</sup> in FAMILY; <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), but not in the South Asian birth cohort (<italic>p</italic> = 0.41; Supplementary Table 8).</p>

A higher maternal smoking MRS was significantly associated with lower birth weight (-0.05±0.01, <italic>p</italic>=3.4×10<sup>-4</sup>) and smaller birth size (-0.22±0.07, <italic>p</italic>=0.0016) in the combined European and South Asian cohorts (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>; Supplementary Table 8). The meta-analysis revealed no heterogeneity in the direction nor the effect size of associations for body size and weight between populations at birth or at later visits (heterogeneity <italic>p</italic>-values = 0.18–1; Supplementary Table 8). The association between the MRS and several children phenotypes, including height or length, weight, and skinfolds, appeared to persist with similar estimated effects throughout early developmental years (Supplementary Table 8), albeit the most significant effects were at birth, and the significance attenuated at later visits. We did not find any association with self-reported allergy or asthma in children at later visits (Supplementary Table 8). Further, there was no evidence of association between the MRS and any maternal outcomes (Supplementary Table 8).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We examined the epigenetic signature of maternal smoking and smoking exposure using newborn cord blood samples from predominately European-origin and South Asian cohorts via two strategies: an individual CpG-level EWAS approach, and a multivariate approach in the form of a methylation score. The EWAS results replicated the association between maternal smoking and CpGs in the <italic>GFI1</italic> gene that is well described in the literature with respect to smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>), maternal smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>), and birth weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). In the latter case, we observed a significant association with maternal smoking history and smoking exposure in European-origin newborns. Further, we noted a weak dose-dependent relationship between maternal smoking history and the methylation score in one European cohort (CHILD) but this was not replicated in the other (FAMILY). Since the timing and duration of maternal smoking during pregnancy were not directly available, these differences could play a role in the magnitude and specificity of DNA methylation changes in cord blood. Finally, the significant association of the MRS with the newborn health metrics in START, in the absence of mothers’ active smoking, could be the result of underreporting of smoking, poor recall of the time of quitting, and/or due to air pollution exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>), leading to oxidative stress. This suggests that our cord blood DNAm signature of maternal smoking is perhaps not unique to cigarette smoking, but captures similar biochemical responses, for example, via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). Our observation that a higher MRS was associated with lower birth weight and smaller birth length in both ethnic populations is thus consistent with the established link between oxidative stress and metabolic syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>).</p>
<p>Contrary to DNA methylation studies of smoking in adults, where whole blood is often used as a proxy tissue, there are multiple relevant tissues for maternal smoking during pregnancy, including the placenta of the mother, newborn cord blood, and children’s whole blood. However, methylation changes measured in whole blood or placenta of the mother, or cord blood of infants showed substantially different patterns of association signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). There are several advantages of using a cord blood based biomarker from the DoHaD perspective. Firstly, cord blood provides a direct reflection of the <italic>in utero</italic> environment and fetal exposure to maternal smoking. Additionally, since cord blood is collected at birth, it eliminates potential confounding factors such as postnatal exposures that may affect maternal blood samples. Furthermore, studying cord blood DNAm allows for the assessment of epigenetic changes specifically relevant to the newborn, offering valuable information on the potential long-term health implications. Meanwhile, methylation signals are known to be tissue-specific, thus it would be of interest for future research to combine differential methylation patterns from all relevant tissue to assess the immediate and long-term effects of maternal smoking. Another direction to further this line of research is to explore postnatal factors that mitigate prenatal exposures, for example, breastfeeding, which has been shown to have a protective effect against maternal tobacco smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). Indeed, more research is necessary to understand the critical periods of exposure and the dose-response relationship between maternal smoking and cord blood DNA methylation changes. Ongoing efforts to monitor the offspring and collect data in the next decade are in progress to establish the long-term association between maternal smoking and cardio-metabolic health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). As such, the constructed MRS can facilitate future research in child health and will be included as part of the generated data for others to access.</p>
<p>The strengths of this report include ethnic diversity, and fine phenotyping in a prospective and harmonized way with follow-up at multiple early childhood stages. This work is the first major multi-ancestry study that utilizes methylation scores to study maternal smoking and examines their portability from European-origin populations to South Asians. The use of MRS, as compared to individual CpGs, is a powerful tool to systematically investigate the influence of DNA methylation changes and whether it has lasting functional consequences on health outcomes. Our results converge with previous findings that epigenetic associations of maternal smoking are associated with newborn health, and add to the small body of evidence that these relationships extend to non-European populations and that different ancestral populations can experience the early developmental periods differently.</p>
<p>A few limitations should be mentioned. In the context of existing epigenetic studies of maternal smoking, we were not able to replicate signals in other well-reported genes such as <italic>AHRR</italic>, <italic>CYP1A1</italic>, and <italic>MYO1G</italic>, however, the MRS was able to pick up signals from these genes (Supplementary Table 7). This could be due to several reasons. First, the customized array with a limited number of CpGs (&lt;3,000) was designed in 2016 and many large EWASs on smoking and maternal smoking conducted more recently had not been included. Nonetheless, we have shown that from a multivariate perspective, the MRS constructed using a targeted approach that was carefully designed can be equally powerful with the advantage of being cost-effective. Second, contrary to existing EWASs where the methylation values are typically treated as the outcome, and the exposure, such as smoking, as the predictor; we reversed the regression such that the methylation levels were the predictors and smoking exposure as the outcome. This reverse regression approach is robust and our choice to reverse the regression was motivated by the goal of constructing a smoking score that combines the additive effects at multiple CpGs, which would otherwise be unfeasible. Third, systematic ancestral differences in DNA methylation patterns had been shown to vary at individual CpGs in terms of their association with smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Converging with this conclusion, we also found the association with <italic>GFI1</italic> to be most consistent after adjusting for cell composition. Finally, maternal smoking is often associated with other confounding factors, such as socioeconomic status, other lifestyle behaviours, and environmental exposures. While we have done our best to control for well-known confounders that were available by study design, as in all observational studies, we could not account for unknown confounding effects. Finally, in recent years, maternal smoking is on a decline as a result of changes in social norms and public health policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). This is also consistent with the lower smoking rates observed in our European cohorts (CHILD and FAMILY).</p>
<p>In conclusion, the epigenetic maternal smoking score we constructed was strongly associated with smoking status during pregnancy and self-reported smoking exposure in White Europeans, and with smaller birth size and lower birth weight in the combined South Asian and White European cohorts. The proposed cord blood epigenetic signature of maternal smoking has the potential to identify newborns who were exposed to maternal smoking <italic>in utero</italic> and to assess the long-term impact of smoking exposure on offspring health. In South Asian mothers with minimal smoking behaviour, the relationship between the methylation score and negative health outcomes in newborns is still apparent, indicating that DNA methylation response is sensitive to smoking exposure, even in the absence of active smoking.</p>

<title>Ethics Statement</title>
<p>Ethical approval was obtained independently from the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board: CHILD (REB 07–2929), FAMILY (REB 02–060), and START (REB 10–640). CHILD was additionally approved by the respective Human Research Ethics Boards at McMaster University, the Universities of Manitoba, Alberta, and British Columbia, and the Hospital for Sick Children. Legal guardians of each participant provided written informed consent. Written informed consent was obtained from the parent/guardian (participating mother) for each study separately. We also have now obtained additional ethics board approval from HiREB (REB 16592) for using the data from the three cohorts together without additional consent from the participants.</p>

<p>This study offers a <bold>useful</bold> advance by introducing a cord blood DNA methylation score for maternal smoking effects, with the inclusion of cohorts from diverse backgrounds. However, the overall strength of evidence is deemed <bold>incomplete</bold>, due to concerns regarding low exposure levels and low statistical power, which hampers the generalisability of their findings. The study provides an interesting basis for future studies, but would benefit from the addition of more cohorts to validate the findings and a focus on more diverse health outcomes.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors generated a DNA methylation score in cord blood for detecting exposure to cigarette smoke during pregnancy. They then asked if it could be used to predict height, weight, BMI, adiposity and WHR throughout early childhood.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study included two cohorts of European ancestry and one of South Asian ancestry.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Numbers of mothers who self-reported any smoking was very low likely resulting in underpowered analyses.</p>
<p>(2) Although it was likely that some mothers were exposed to second-hand smoke and/or pollution, data on this was not available.</p>
<p>(3) One of the European cohorts and half of the South Asian cohort had DNA methylation measured on only 2500 CpG sites including only 125 sites previously linked to prenatal smoking.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Deng et al. assess neonatal cord blood methylation profiles and the association with (self-reported) maternal smoking in multiple populations, including two European (CHILD, FAMILY) and one South Asian (START), via two approaches: 1) they perform an independent epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) and meta-analysis across the CHILD and FAMILY cohort, during which they also benchmark previously reported maternal-smoking associated sites, and 2) they generate new composite methylation risk scores for maternal smoking, and assess their performance and association with phenotypic characteristics in the three populations, in addition to previously described maternal smoking methylation risk scores.</p>
<p>Strengths and weaknesses:</p>
<p>Their meta-analysis across multiple cohorts and comparison with previous findings represents a strength. In particular the inclusion of a South Asian birth cohort is commendable as it may help to bolster generalizability. However, their conclusions are limited by several important weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) the low number of (self-reported) maternal smokers in particular their South Asian population, resulting in an inability to conduct benchmarking of maternal smoking sites in this cohort. As such, the inclusion of the START cohort in certain figures is not warranted (e.g., Figure 3) and the overall statement that smoking-associated MRS are portable across populations are not fully supported;</p>
<p>
(2) different methylation profiling tools were used: START and CHILD methylation profiles were generated using the more comprehensive 450K array while the FAMILY cohort blood samples were profiled using a targeted array covering only 3,000, as opposed to 450,000 sites, resulting in different coverage of certain sites which affects downstream analyses and MRS, and importantly, omission of potentially relevant sites as the array was designed in 2016 and substantial additional work into epigenetic traits has been conducted since then;</p>
<p>
(3) the authors train methylation risk scores (MRS) in CHILD or FAMILY populations based on sites that are associated with maternal smoking in both cohorts and internally validate them in the other cohort, respectively. As START cohort due to insufficient numbers of self-reported maternal smokers, the authors cannot fully independently validated their MRS, thus limiting the strength of their results.</p>
<p>Overall strength of evidence and conclusions:</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, the study overall does explore the feasibility of using neonatal cord blood for the assessment of maternal smoking. However, their conclusion on generalizability of the maternal smoking risk score is currently not supported by their data as they were not able to validate their score in a sufficiently large number of maternal smokers and never smokers of South Asian populations.</p>
<p>While their generalizability remains limited due to small sample numbers and previous studies with methylation risk scores exist, their findings may nonetheless provide the basis for future work into prenatal exposures which will be of interest to the research community. In particular their finding that the maternal smoking-associated MRS was associated with small birth sizes and weights across birth cohorts, including the South Asian birth cohort that had very few self-reported smokers, is interesting and the author suggest these findings could be associated with factors other than smoking alone (e.g., pollution), which warrant further investigation and would be highly novel.</p>
<p>
Future exploration should also include a strong focus on more diverse health outcomes, including respiratory conditions that may have long-lasting health consequences.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<p>We thank the reviewers for their time and the thoughtful reviews on our manuscript. The reviewers brought good points regarding the sample size, and the low exposure in the South Asian cohort owing to their unique cultural and social practices. We recognize these as limitations of the paper and discussed these in the revised version. In the revised manuscript, we have taken the key suggestions by reviewers to 1) better illustrate the analytical flow and statistical methods, in particular, to show which datasets had been used in discovery, validation, and testing of the score – as a main figure in the manuscript and in the graphical abstract; 2) demonstrate there is no possibility of overfitting in our approach using statistical metrics of performance; 3) emphasize the goal was not for discovery (e.g. our own EWAS was not used for deriving the score), but to compare with existing EWASs and contrast the results from the white European and SA populations; 4) and supplement the analysis with previously derived maternal smoking, smoking and air pollution methylation score and to explore additional health outcomes in relation to lung health in newborns. Finally, we would also like to take this opportunity to re-iterate that it was not our objective to derive the most powerful methylation score of smoking nor to demonstrate the causal role of maternal smoking on birth weight via DNAm. We have restructure the manuscript as well as the discussion to clarify this. Please find below a point-by-point response to the comments below.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>The manuscript could benefit from a more detailed description of methods, especially those used to derive MRS for maternal smoking, which appears to involve overfitting. In particular, the addition of a flow chart would be very helpful to guide the reader through the data and analyses. The FDR correction in the EWAS corresponds to a fairly liberal p-value threshold.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for these good suggestions. In the revised manuscript, we have provided a flow chart as the new Figure 1, more detailed description of the method (added a subsection “Statistical analysis” under Materials and Methods) as well as metrics including measures of fit indices such as AUC and adjusted R2 for each validation and testing dataset to illustrate there is no danger of overfitting (in new Supplementary Table 5).</p>
<p>The choice of use FDR was indeed arbitrary as there has been no consensus on what significance threshold, if any, should be used in the context of EWAS. Here we simply followed the convention in previous studies to contrast the top associated signals for their effects between different populations and with reported effect sizes. Throughout the manuscript, we have removed the notion of significant associations and used the phrase “top associated signals” or “top associations” when discussion EWAS results for individual CpGs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p>
<p>(1) The number of mothers who self-reported any smoking was very low, much lower than in the general population and practically non-existent in the South Asian population. As a result, all analyses appeared to have been underpowered. It is possibly for this reason that the authors chose to generate their DNA methylation model using previously published summary statistics. The resulting score is not of great value in itself due to the low-powered dataset used to estimate covariance between CpG sites. In fact, a score was generated for a much larger, better-powered dataset several years ago (Reese, EHP, 2017, PMID 27323799).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the low exposure in the South Asian population, which we believe is complementary to the literature on maternal smoking that almost exclusively focused on white Europeans. However, the score was validating in the white European cohort (CHILD; current smoking 3.1%), which was reasonably similar to the trend that maternal cigarettes smoking is on the decline from 2016 to 2021, from 7.2% to 4.6% (Martin, Osterman, &amp; Driscoll, 2023). This is also consistent with the fact that CHILD participants were recruited from major metropolitans of Canada with relatively high SES and education as compared to FAMILY.</p>
<p>We do agree with the reviewers that a higher prevalence of maternal smoking in the validating sample could potential improve the power of the score. Our original analytical pipeline focused on CHILD as the validation dataset; FAMILY (see the new Figure 1) was used as the testing data. We alternatively provided an analytical scheme using FAMILY as the validation dataset, as it had a higher proportion of current smokers, however, this is limited by the number of CpGs available (128 in FAMILY vs. 2,619 in CHILD out of the 2,620 CpGs from (Joubert et al., 2016)). The results of all possible combinations of validation vs. testing and restriction of targeted array vs. HM450 are summarized in the new new Supplementary Table 5 and Supplementary Figure 5.</p>
<p>To clarify, our choice to construct DNAm score using published summary statistics was not an ad-hoc decision due to the observed low power from CHILD EWAS. We agree with the reviewer that our study was indeed underpowered and was not originally intended for EWAS discovery. Thus, we specifically proposed to adopt a multivariate strategy from the literature of polygenic risk scores. This approach enabled us to leverage well-powered association signals without individual-level access to data with a sample size of n &gt; 5,000 (Joubert et al., 2016). In comparison, the Reese maternal smoking score (Reese et al., 2017) had a discovery sample size of only n = 1,057. Our score was not out-performed, in fact, the AUC in both FAMILY (external validating dataset; n=411) and CHILD (external testing dataset; n=352) and was larger than that based on the Reese score as tabulated below (part of the new Supplementary Table 5).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Further, regarding the comment on the covariance matrix. Indeed, lassosum via elastic-net and summary data requires a reference covariance matrix that is consistent between the discovery data and external validation data. In fact, for moderately sized correlation/covariance values (r2 &gt; 0.1), a sample size of &gt;100 is sufficiently powered to detect it being different from 0 and thus used for estimation. Similar to the linkage disequilibrium of genotype data, the CpGs also exhibit a block-wise correlation structure and thus the theoretical framework of lassosum extends naturally to MRS.</p>
<p>In the revised manuscript, we included the Reese score, as well as a few additional scores to compare their predictiveness of smoking phenotypes in white European cohorts. We note that the applicability was limited in the FAMILY cohort that was profiled using a targeted array and only 7 out of 28 of the CpGs in the Reese score were available. As a result, though the Reese score had similar performance than our derived score in CHILD (0.94 vs. 0.95), its performance in FAMILY was compromised (0.72 vs. 0.89).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The conclusion that &quot;even minimal smoking exposure in South Asian mothers who were not active smokers showed a DNAm signature of small body size and low birthweight in newborns&quot; is not warranted because no analyses were performed to show that the association between DNA methylation and birth size/weight was driven by maternal smoking.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this subtle point – it was not our intention to suggest there was a causal relationship between DNA methylation and birth size that was mediated by maternal smoking. We meant to suggest that the maternal smoking methylation score was consistently associated with negative outcomes in newborns of both white European and South Asian mothers despite no maternal smoking was present in South Asian mothers. It is possible that maternal smoking MRS was capturing a lot more than just smoking and second-hand smoking, such as other environmental exposures that also lead to oxidative stress. These together are associated with reduced birth size/weight.</p>
<p>In the revised manuscript, we have modified the conclusion above to:</p>
<p>“Notably, these results indicate a consistent association between the DNAm signature of maternal smoking and a small body size and low birthweight in newborns, in both white European mothers who exhibited some amount of smoking and in South Asian mothers who themselves were not active smokers.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Although it was likely that some mothers were exposed to second-hand smoke and/or pollution, data on this was either non-existent or not included in this study. Including this would have allowed a more novel investigation of the effects of smoke exposure on the pregnancies of non-smoking mothers.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with this comment – second-hand smoking was captured by self-reported weekly smoking exposure by the mothers. We reported the association with smoking exposure and found that it was not consistently associated with our methylation scores across the cohorts (cohort specific association p-values of 5.4×10-5, 3.4×10-5, and 0.58, for CHILD, FAMILY, and START; original Table 3), possibly due to the low exposure in South Asian population (max weekly exposure was 42 hrs in contrast to 168 hrs in FAMILY and 98 hrs in CHILD). Meanwhile, air pollution data are currently not available. Here we additionally performed the association between maternal smoking and air pollution methylation score, using key CpGs from the largest air pollution EWAS to-date (Gondalia et al., 2021). However, there was no association between the air pollution score and any maternal smoking phenotypes (ps &gt; 0.4).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) One of the European cohorts and half of the South Asian cohort had DNA methylation measured on only 2500 CpG sites. This set of sites included only 125 sites previously linked to prenatal smoking. The resulting model of prenatal smoking was small (only 11 CpG sites). It is possible that a large model may have been more powerful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>That is correct – also see our response to R2 comment #1. In our previous analysis, we validated two scores (one based on CpGs on the &lt; 3,000 CpGs array and the other one for the full HM450K). The score with more CpGs indeed had slightly better performance. We included this as one of the limitations of the paper. Nevertheless, it does not impact the conclusion that the scores (based on a larger or smaller model) are transferrable to diverse populations and can be used to comparatively study the DNAm influence of maternal smoking in newborns.</p>
<p>The following was added in the discussion:</p>
<p>“First, the customized array with a limited number of CpGs (&lt;3,000) was designed in 2016 and many large EWASs on smoking and maternal smoking conducted more recently had not been included.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The health outcomes investigated are potentially interesting but there are other possibly more important outcomes of interest such as birth complications, asthma, and intellectual impairment which are known to be associated with prenatal smoking.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for bring up this point. One of the key health outcomes in the CHILD study was asthma, and data at later time points are available. However, we do not have similar outcomes collected in the other two studies (FAMILY and START), which focused on cardiometabolic health in young children. Thus, we did not initially include outcomes that were not available across all cohorts as the intention was to contrast the effects between populations.</p>
<p>We recognize that this is an important question and decided to provide the association results for asthma and allergy at available time points in CHILD, FAMILY, and START. We also included mode of delivery via emergency C-section as an additional proxy outcome of birth complications.

<p>The genomic inflation factor was moderately across the cohorts for smoking exposure: 1.02 in CHILD, 0.94 in FAMILY, and 1.00 in START. However, there was more inflation in the tail of the distribution in START than the European cohorts. The empirical type I error rates at 0.01, 0.001, 0.00001, were high in START (x1.7, x5.7, and x165 times at each respective threshold), in contrast to CHILD (x1.06, x1.05, and x0.6) or FAMILY (x1.6, x1.9, and 0). The smoking exposure EWAS based on START was thus removed as these are likely false positives and there was very low smoking exposure to start with (11 reported weekly exposure between 2–42 hrs/week out of 462 with non-missing data). We have added the QQ-plots as well as the genomic inflation factor for the reported meta-analysis in the new Supplementary Figure 2. The following was added to the Results:</p>

<p>Discussion</p>
<p>(28) Studying the association between maternal smoking and cord blood DNAm is interesting from a biological perspective as it allows for assessing the immediate and long-term effects of maternal smoking on newborn health. However, in terms of calculating the MRS, what are the benefits of using cord blood over the mother's blood? We know that blood-based DNAm smoking score is a powerful predictor of long-term smoking status.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer raises an interesting point – abundant literature supports that DNAm changes are tissue-specific. While mother’s blood DNAm smoking score reflect the long-term exposure to smoking in mothers, the cord blood DNAm captures the consequence of such long-term exposure for newborn health. One of the key results of our study is showing that established DNAm signatures of maternal smoking, which is known to mediate birth size and weight in white Europeans (these references were cited in the original manuscript), carries the same effect of reducing birth weight and size in the South Asian population. This is a critical finding from a DoHaD and public health perspective, as DNAm signatures of maternal smoking, irrespective of the smoking status of the mother, can influence the health trajectory of the newborns.</p>
<p>We have expanded our discussion based on this suggestion to highlight the unique features of studying maternal smoking via different tissues and their implications. The following was added to the discussion:</p>
<p>“There are several advantages of using a cord blood based biomarker from the DoHaD perspective. Firstly, cord blood provides a direct reflection of the in utero environment and fetal exposure to maternal smoking. Additionally, since cord blood is collected at birth, it eliminates potential confounding factors such as postnatal exposures that may affect maternal blood samples. Furthermore, studying cord blood DNAm allows for the assessment of epigenetic changes specifically relevant to the newborn, offering valuable information on the potential long-term health implications.”</p>

<p>(36) Page 17, line 381: Given the stated importance of ancestry, why not restrict the sample to genetically confirmed groups?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer has a valid point that ancestry, either perceived or genetic, can introduce additional heterogeneity due to potential differences in genetics, cultural and social practices, and lifestyles. Genetic data are indeed available for a subset of the individuals. In the original version of the manuscript, we used a stringent ancestry calling method by mapping all individuals with the 1000 Genomes samples from continental populations. The final definition was based on a combination of self-reported and genetically confirmed ancestry. However, if we restricted only to genetically confirmed groups, the sample size would be reduced to 312 (vs. 411), 268 (vs. 352), and 488 (vs. 504) in FAMILY, CHILD, and START, respectively.</p>
<p>We compared the mean difference in the beta-values of the top associated CpGs and the derived MRS between those genetically confirmed vs. self-reported ancestral groups, and observed no material difference. These results are now included in the Supplementary Materials as part of the sensitivity analysis. Thus, given these considerations, we decided to use this complementary approach to retain the maximum number of samples while ensuring some aspect of ancestral homogeneity.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. Smoking exposure is indeed skewed and in fact very much zero-inflated across the cohorts. The raw phenotype violated several model assumptions in terms of variance heteroskedasticity, outlying values (influential points), and linearity. The diagnostics suggested improved deviation from model assumption, yet some aspects of the violation remained at a lesser degree. We included a comparison of results before and after transformation and model diagnostics for the lead CpG using CHILD and FAMILY data in the Supplementary Materials. The following was added to the results:</p>
<p>“As a sensitivity analysis, we repeated the analysis for the continuous smoking exposure under rank transformation vs. raw phenotype for the associated CpG in GFI1 and examined the regression diagnostics (Supplementary Material), and found that the model under rank-transformation deviated less from assumptions.”</p>

<p>(39) Page 19, line 418: FDR seems quite a lenient threshold, especially when genome-wide significance thresholds exist. I would be inclined to view the EWAS findings as null.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The choice of use FDR to was indeed arbitrary as there has been no consensus on what significance threshold, if any, should be used in the context of EWAS. The significance threshold for GWAS (Pe’er et al., 2008) probably does not apply directly to EWAS as the number of effective tests will likely differ between genome-wide genetic variants and CpGs. The Bonferroni corrected p-value threshold in this context would be 0.05/200,050=2.5´10-7, which is still less stringent than the GWAS significance threshold. We originally decided to follow the convention of previous studies and use FDR to filter out a subset of plausible associations to contrast the top association signals for their effects between different populations and with reported effect sizes.</p>
<p>We have revised the manuscript throughout by removing the notion of significant associations, and instead used the phrase “top associated signals” or “top associations” when discussion EWAS results for individual CpGs. The following was added to Materials and Methods to clarify the choice of our threshold:</p>
<p>“For each EWAS or meta-analysis, the false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment was used to control multiple testing and we considered CpGs that passed an FDR-adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05 to be relevant for maternal smoking.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(40) I do not understand Supplementary Figure 6 - how have the data been standardised? Why not plot the CpGs on the beta-value scale?</p>

<p>The standardized values were plotted as the reported p-values for the mean and variance equality tests (i.e. ANOVA F-test, Levene’s test, Anderson-Darling test) were based on these transformed values to reduce inflation due to non-normality. We have since removed this comparison and kept only the comparison of the overall score as the number of CpGs in the HM450k score (143 CpGs) for comparison is too high to be visually interpretable.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(41) It is my understanding, that the MRS for maternal smoking was constructed using external weights projected and regularised using elastic net (effectively trained) in CHILD cohort. The results section discusses associations between maternal smoking history and outcomes in CHILD, FAMILY, and START. Training and testing the score in the same sample (cohort) may result in overfitting and therefore should not be implemented.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The original MRS was constructed using external weights from an independent discovery sample (Joubert et al., 2016; n &gt; 5,000) and the LASSO validation was done in CHILD (n = 352), external testing was in FAMILY and START. This was the lassosum framework whereby we leverage larger sample size from external studies to select more plausible CpGs as candidates to include in the model. Thus, training, validation, and testing were not done in the same samples. We have included a Figure 1 to illustrate the updated analytical flow and a graphical abstract to summarize the methods.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(42) Is it a concern that the findings don't seem to replicate Joubert's results, which came from a much larger study?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Replication is usually done in samples much larger than the discovery samples, thus it is not a concern that we were unable to confirm all signals from Joubert et al., (2016). However, 6/7 of the top associations (FDR adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05) in the meta-analysis were declared as significant in Joubert et al. (2016). In addition, the fact that using Joubert’s summary statistics, we were able to derive MRSs that were strongly associated with both smoking history and weekly exposure suggests shared signals.

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The impact of this study is reduced due to previous findings:</p>
<p>(1) Previous studies have already shown that DNA methylation may mediate the effect of maternal smoking on birth size/weight (see e.g.<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2018.0120">https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2018.0120</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyv048">https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyv048</ext-link>).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this point and would like to take the opportunity to clarify that it was not our objective to examine whether there was a causal relationship, between DNA methylation and birth size that was mediated by maternal smoking. One of the key messages of our study is to evaluate whether epigenetic associations – at individual CpGs and aggregated as a score – are consistent between white European and South Asian populations. One way to examine this is through using established DNAm signatures of maternal smoking, which is known to mediate birth size and weight in white Europeans (these references were cited in the original manuscript), and confirm whether they also carry the same effect on birth outcomes in the South Asian population.</p>
<p>Indeed, our results support that maternal smoking methylation score was consistently associated with negative outcomes in newborns of both white European and South Asian mothers despite no maternal smoking was present in South Asian mothers. These collective point to the possibility that the maternal smoking MRS was capturing a lot more than just smoking and second-hand smoking, but potentially other environmental exposures that also lead to oxidative stress. These together are associated with health consequences, including reduced birth size/weight. One of the candidates for such exposure is air pollution as some of the maternal smoking CpGs were previously linked to air pollution. However, we were unable to assess this hypothesis directly without the air pollution data, and the air pollution methylation score was not associated with smoking history (Supplementary Figure 5) nor smoking exposure (p &gt; 0.4 in CHILD, FAMILY and START).</p>
<p>The following was added to Materials and Methods under the subsection Using DNA Methylation to Construct Predictive Models for Maternal Smoking:</p>
<p>“To benchmark and compare with existing maternal smoking MRSs, we calculated the Reese score using 28 CpGs (48,49),  Richmond score using 568 CpGs (49), Rauschert score using 204 CpGs (50), Joubert score using all 2,620 CpGs with evidence of association for maternal smoking (19), and finally a three-CpG score for air pollution (51). The details of these scores and score weight can be found in Supplementary Table 4.”</p>
<p>The following was added to Results</p>
<p>“Both produced methylation scores that were significantly associated with maternal smoking history (ANOVA F-test p-values =1.0×10-6 and 2.4×10-14 in CHILD and  6.9×10-16 and &lt;2.2×10-16 in FAMILY), and the best among alternative scores for CHILD and FAMILY (Supplementary Table 5). With the exception of the air pollution MRS, all remaining scores were marginally associated with smoking history in both CHILD and FAMILY (Supplementary Figure 5).”</p>

<p>(2) Due to the small study size and low levels of prenatal smoke exposure, the model derived here is of little value and is, in fact, superseded by a previously published model (PMID: 27323799). At the very least, the model should be evaluated here. A novel aspect of this study is the inclusion of a South Asian cohort. Unfortunately, smoke exposure is practically non-existent, so it is unclear how it can be used. The more interesting finding in this study is the possibility that environmental factors such as second-hand smoke or pollution may have similar effects on pregnancies as maternal smoking. Are these available? If so, they could be evaluated for associations with DNA methylation. This would be novel.</p>

<p>In the revised manuscript, we included the Reese score (Reese et al., 2017) and a few other maternal smoking scores for comparison. In the CHILD cohort, the performance was comparable to our derived score (AUC of 0.95 vs. 0.94 for Reese score), but its applicability was limited since the FAMILY dataset was profiled using a targeted array and only 7 out of 28 of the CpGs in the Reese score were available (AUC of 0.89 vs. 0.72 for Reese). As compared to the remaining scores from literature (see the new Supplementary Table 5 for complete results), Reese’s score has generally favorable performance.</p>
<p>We did examine second-hand smoking in the original manuscript, showing a significant association with weekly maternal smoking exposure (original Table 3 and Supplementary Table 8). However, air pollution data is not available for assessment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The other novel aspect is the evaluation of associations with outcomes later in life. Height and weight are interesting but impact could be gained by including other relevant outcomes such as birth complications, asthma, and intellectual impairment which are known to be associated with prenatal smoking.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for bring up this point. One of the key health outcomes in the CHILD study was asthma, and data at later time points are available. However, we do not have similar outcomes collected in the other two studies (FAMILY and START), which focused on cardiometabolic health in young children. Thus, we did not initially include outcomes that were not available across all cohorts as the intention was to contrast the effects between populations.</p>
<p>We recognize that this is an important question and decided to provide the association results for mother reported asthma and allergy, but based on different definitions as these outcomes cannot be harmonized across the cohorts. We also included mode of delivery via emergency C-section as an additional proxy outcome of birth complication.</p>
<p>The following was added to Materials and Methods:</p>
<p>“Mode of delivery (emergency c-section vs. other) was collected at the time of delivery.”</p>
<p>“Additional phenotypes included smoking exposures (hours per week) at home, potential allergy based on mother reporting any of: eczema, hay fever, wheeze, asthma, food allergy (egg, cow milk, soy, other) for her child in FAMILY and START, and asthma based on mother’s opinion in CHILD (“In your opinion, does the child have any of the following? Asthma”).”</p>
<p>The following was added to Results:</p>
<p>“The maternal smoking MRS was consistently associated with increasing weekly smoking exposure in children reported by mothers at the 1-year (0.51±0.15, FDR adjusted p= 0.0052) , 3-year (0.53±0.16, FDR adjusted p= 0.0052), and 5-year (0.40±0.15, FDR adjusted p= 0.021) visits with similar effects.”</p>
<p>“We did not find any association with self-reported allergy or asthma in children at later visits (Supplementary Table 8). Further, there was no evidence of association between the MRS and any maternal outcomes (Supplementary Table 8).”</p>
