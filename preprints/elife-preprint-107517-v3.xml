<abstract>
<p>To enable navigation in both physical and mental spaces, the human brain employs a cognitive map constructed from the global metrics of the entorhinal cortex and the local representations of the hippocampus. However, how these two regions coordinate to enable navigation remains poorly understood. Here, we designed an object-matching task where human participants unknowingly manipulated object variants arranged in a ring-like structure around a central prototype. Functional MRI revealed a 3-fold spatial periodicity in the hippocampal activity that tracked navigation directions from object variants to the central prototype. This hippocampal periodicity was phase-locked with the well-documented 6-fold periodicity of the entorhinal cortex, suggesting hierarchical interaction between these regions. Consistent with this neural pattern, a corresponding 3-fold periodicity was observed in behavioral performance, which was synchronized with hippocampal activity. Finally, an EC-HPC PhaseSync model reproduced this phenomenon, in which the 6-fold activity periodicity of entorhinal grid cells across directions projects vectorial representations to the hippocampus, and the collection of these vectors exhibits 3-fold periodicity to represent conceptual directions. Together, these findings reveal a periodic mechanism through which entorhinal grid codes structure hippocampal vector representations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The cognitive map, initially introduced by Tolman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Tolman, 1948</xref>) and later supported by the discovery of place cells in the hippocampus (HPC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">O’Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971</xref>), has served as a framework for spatial navigation. Grid cells in the upstream entorhinal cortex (EC), known for their hexagonal firing pattern to provide the metric for space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hafting et al., 2005</xref>), have also been found to represent conceptual space beyond the physical reference frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Constantinescu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Raithel et al., 2023</xref>). These findings suggest that the EC-HPC circuit fundamentally organizes spatial and non-spatial knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Epstein et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Behrens et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bottini and Doeller, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Park et al., 2020</xref>), and to guide flexible behaviors such as retrieving knowledge from the past and making decisions for the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Addis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hassabis and Maguire, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Schacter et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Flexible navigation requires the mental simulation of prospective pathways on a cognitive map, which is defined by essential cues such as self-location, goal location, direction, and distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Nyberg et al., 2022</xref>). This process necessarily involves dynamic representations of the external world relative to self-location. Converging evidence indicates that the HPC binds spatial cues into vectorial representations, providing activity gradients that reflect potential pathways toward goals. In bats, a subpopulation of CA1 neurons exhibited conjunctive tuning to both direction and distance, with activity gradually decaying within 10–15 minutes after the goal is displaced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sarel et al., 2017</xref>). In rats, similar findings were observed for neurons tuned to featureless goal locations distributed across space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ormond and O’Keefe, 2022</xref>). These neurons fire maximally when the animal is oriented toward the goal and rapidly reorganize following goal shifts. Consistently, the neural representation of prospective pathways in the human brain is affected by goal locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Muhle-Karbe et al., 2023</xref>). The neural geometry derived from the BOLD signals in the HPC is distorted by goals, reflecting the successful learning of goal-directed navigation. Collectively, these findings suggest that the formation of prospective pathways relies on memory-based vectorial representations in the HPC. However, these studies raise the question of how grid cells in the EC contribute to this process.</p>
<p>We hypothesize that projections from EC grid cell populations provide a coherent cognitive-map framework in the HPC that embeds a three-fold periodic structure across spatial directions to support vectorial representations and simulating the prospective pathways. Grid cells exhibit hexagonal firing patterns with nearly invariant orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hafting et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sargolini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Krupic et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gardner et al., 2022</xref>). These properties may support the formation of vector-like representations of pathways by coactivation of grid cell populations. In the simplest case, when one mentally simulates a straight pathway aligned with the grid orientation, a subpopulation of grid cells would be sequentially activated, and the resulting population activity would manifest a near-perfect vectorial representation with constant activity strength along the pathway. In contrast, when the pathway is misaligned with the grid orientation, the corresponding grid cell population yields a distorted vectorial code. Consequently, simulating straight pathways spanning 0°–360° yields only half the number of unique activity patterns. This arises because the hexagonal grid’s 180° rotational symmetry makes orientations separated by 180° indistinguishable. We therefore speculate that the vectorial representations embedded in grid cell activity are periodic across spatial orientations and are transmitted through the EC–HPC circuit to bind prospective path directions. Consistent with this idea, reorientation paradigms in both rodents and young children demonstrate that subjects search equally at two opposite directions, reflecting successful orientation encoding but a failure to integrate spatial direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hermer and Spelke, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Julian et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gallistel, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Julian et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>This hypothesis is supported by evidence from anatomical, functional, computational, and physiological findings on the EC–HPC circuit. Anatomically, the EC serves as one of the major sources of input to the downstream HPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Witter and Amaral, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">van Groen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Garcia and Buffalo, 2020</xref>). Functionally, grid cells in the medial EC exhibited multiplexed and heterogeneous responses corresponding to position, direction, and speed before they are integrated in the HPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sargolini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hardcastle et al., 2017</xref>). Computationally, grid cells have been proposed as the foundation of hippocampal place field formation by integrating multiple grid modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Solstad et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">De Almeida et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bush et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bush et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bicanski and Burgess, 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Physiologically, EC lesions disrupt the precision and stability of place fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hales et al., 2014</xref>), leading to reduced discharge rates and field sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Van Cauter et al., 2008</xref>). If our hypothesis is correct, a 3-fold periodicity aligned with the three principal grid axes should emerge in the HPC, phase-locked with EC activity along path directions. Because simultaneous population-level recordings from the EC and HPC remain technically challenging, we employed fMRI, which has previously revealed 6-fold periodicity in the EC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Doeller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Constantinescu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wagner et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Raithel et al., 2023</xref>), to test for periodicity in the HPC.</p>
<p>A novel 3D object, named Greeble (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gauthier and Tarr, 1997</xref>), was used to create a conceptual Greeble space. Within this space, locations were represented by Greeble variants characterized by two features (“Loogit” and “Vacso”). The feature length defined the two dimensions of the space. The central Greeble served as the prototype. Participants were instructed to morph Greeble variants to match this target prototype (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). This process generated a sequence of Greebles that resembled movements along navigational path in a two-dimensional conceptual space (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>), although participants were unaware of the underlying Greeble space. To ensure a comprehensive exploration of the Greeble space for detecting hippocampal periodicity, Greeble variants were pseudo-randomly sampled at the periphery of space. This ensured a high-resolution sampling of conceptual directions ranging from 0° to 360° (i.e., the orange locations in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>), while controlling for distance. As a result, we observed a 3-fold periodicity in hippocampal activity, cross-validated using sinusoidal modulation and spectral analyses. The spatial phase of the HPC was coupled with the 6-fold periodicity in the EC, no spatial offset was identified. In addition, we identified a 3-fold periodicity in participants’ behavioral performance that was phase-locked with hippocampal activity. Finally, the EC–HPC PhaseSync model, developed to simulate EC projections into the HPC, reproduced the emergence of 3-fold activity periodicity across directions under randomized goal locations. Together, these empirical findings highlight a periodic representation of conceptual directions within the HPC, suggesting that vectorial representations in the hippocampus may arise through projections from periodic grid codes in the EC.</p>

<title>Behavioral results</title>
<p>Participants adjusted Greeble features using two response boxes inside the MRI scanner. Each response box controlled one feature, with two buttons used to stretch and shrink the feature, respectively. To prevent a “horizontal–vertical movement” strategy, in which participants navigate primarily along the cardinal directions (e.g., repeatedly adjusting one feature towards North and then East), participants were encouraged to adjust both features simultaneously to promote directional variability in path directions for detecting neural periodicity. This strategy, referred to as “Radial Adjustment” involved making a one-unit adjustment to one feature with the left hand followed by a one-unit adjustment to the other feature with the right hand.</p>
<p>To examine participants’ movement strategy, we first calculated the number of unique directions across every three consecutive steps within their original movement paths (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). Participants showed an average of 3.8 directions per path, which was significantly higher than the two directions predicted under the “horizontal–vertical movement” strategy (t(32) = 15.76, p &lt; 0.001, two-tailed; Cohen’s d = 2.78). Next, we examined the uniformity of directional distributions across all generated paths spanning 0°–360°. No significant deviation from uniformity was observed (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>; p &gt; 0.05, Rayleigh test for circular uniformity). These results confirm that the “Radial Adjustment” strategy was stably adopted by participants during navigation in the conceptual Greeble space, thereby reducing potential bias in subsequent analyses.</p>
<p>To eliminate potential learning effect on potential BOLD signal periodicity, all participants completed a training task one day prior to the MRI scanning to familiarize themselves with Greebles morphing (see methods for details). Behavioral performance was defined as a composite score combining path length and error size, with superior performance characterized by smaller scores. Learning effects were observed during the practice experiment on day 1 (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>; t(32) = −2.46, p = 0.019, two-tailed; Cohen’s d = 0.44), but were no longer present during the MRI experiment on day 2 (t(32) = −0.74, p = 0.462, two-tailed; Cohen’s d = 0.13). These results suggest that participants maintained stable task accuracy across experimental sessions during MRI scanning.

<title>6-fold periodicity in the EC</title>
<p>Using sinusoidal modulation, the grid orientation, reflecting the allocentric direction of the grid axes, was calculated for each voxel within the bilateral EC using half of the dataset (Experimental session 1, 3, 5, 7). Participants’ path directions were determined by the 2D position of Greeble variants relative to the ending locations, with 0° arbitrarily defined as movement from the East (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Significant deviations from uniformity were observed in 30 out of 33 participants (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>, p &lt; 0.05; Rayleigh test of uniformity and pairwise phase consistency (PPC), Bonferroni-corrected across participants), indicating that voxelwise grid orientations in the EC were consistent for the majority of participants.</p>

<p>Hexagonal 6-fold activity was examined using the other half of the dataset (Experimental session 2, 4, 6, 8), with path directions calibrated according to participant-dependent grid orientations. This analysis identified a significant cluster in the right EC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>; initial threshold: p = 0.05, two-tailed; cluster-based SVC correction for multiple comparisons: p &lt; 0.05; Cohen’s d = 0.63; Peak MNI coordinate: 32, −6, −30). Four ROI-based control analyses were performed using rotationally symmetric parameters (3-, 4-, 5-, and 7-fold) to validate the robustness of the cluster in representing the 6-fold periodicity. The ROI was defined as a functional mask of the right EC identified in the voxel-based analysis and further restricted within the anatomical EC. These analyses revealed significant periodic modulation only at 6-fold (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>; t(32) = 3.56, p = 0.006, two-tailed, corrected for multiple comparisons across rotational symmetries; Cohen’s d = 0.62). In contrast, no significant effects were observed for 3-fold periodicity (120° periodicity; t(32) = 1.10, p = 0.28, Cohen’s d = 0.19), 4-fold periodicity (90° periodicity; t(32) = 0.31, p = 0.76, Cohen’s d = 0.05), 5-fold periodicity (72° periodicity; t(32) = −0.21, p = 0.83, Cohen’s d = −0.04), or 7-fold periodicity (51.4° periodicity; t(32) = 0.88, p = 0.39, Cohen’s d = 0.16).</p>
<p>We further examined the fluctuation of hexagonal activity across the angular domain of path directions, following the approach reported in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Doeller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Constantinescu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wagner et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Raithel et al., 2023</xref>). In these studies, EC activity exhibited six peaks as a function of path direction. To do so, we reconstructed the BOLD signals using sinusoidal modulation for each path direction and each participant. To account for individual difference in spatial phase, path directions were calibrated by subtracting the participant-specific grid orientation estimated from the odd sessions. The directional tuning curve was then derived by averaging the reconstructed BOLD signals across voxels within a hand-drawn bilateral EC mask and across participants. A stable 6-fold periodicity was observed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>, left; p &lt; 0.05, permutation corrected for multiple comparisons), characterized by stronger activity when path directions were aligned with the calibrated grid axes and weaker activity when they were misaligned, confirming a 60° periodicity of EC activity across conceptual directions in the Greeble space (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>, right).</p>

<title>3-fold periodicity in the HPC</title>
<p>Potential neural periodicity in the HPC was assessed using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based spectral analysis. FFT was employed to permit unbiased identification of multiple candidate periodicities (e.g., from 3- to 7-fold), independent of any a priori assumptions regarding spatial phase (orientation). Unlike the EC where a 6-fold periodicity is well established, the periodic structure of the HPC was not known a priori. FFT was thus applied as a phase-invariant approach to detect potential periodicities. Moreover, FFT was employed as an independent analysis to cross-validate the sinusoidal modulation results, thereby offering complementary evidence for the 6-fold periodicity in EC and the 3-fold periodicity in HPC. Accordingly, BOLD signals from all eight experimental sessions were modeled using a GLM to estimate direction-dependent activity. Participants’ path directions were down-sampled into 10° bins, resulting in a total of 36 directional bins (e.g., 0°, 10°, 20°, etc.). These bins were entered into the GLM as binary regressors. The resulting direction-dependent parametric maps were sorted in ascending order of spatial directions, and FFT was applied to extract spectral magnitude maps for periodicities ranging from 3- to 7-fold (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>; see Methods for details).</p>

<p>A significant cluster of 3-fold periodicity was observed in the bilateral HPC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>; initial threshold: p = 0.05, two-tailed; Cluster-based SVC corrected for multiple comparisons: p &lt; 0.05; Cohen’s d = 1.06; Peak MNI coordinate: −24, −20, −18).

No significant periodic activity was observed for the other folds (p &gt; 0.05).</p>
<p>The hippocampal 3-fold periodicity has not been previously reported in the spatial domain by either neurophysiological or fMRI studies. To validate its reliability, we conducted additional analyses. First, sinusoidal modulation confirmed significant 3-fold clusters in the bilateral HPC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>; initial threshold: p = 0.05, two-tailed; Cluster-based SVC-corrected for multiple comparisons: p &lt; 0.05; Cohen’s d = 0.68; Peak MNI coordinate: −24, −18, −12). ROI analysis, using a functional mask of the HPC identified in the spectral analysis and further restricted within the anatomical HPC, indicated that HPC activity selectively fluctuated at 3-fold periodicity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>; t(32) = 3.94, p= 0.002, corrected for multiple comparisons across rotational symmetries; Cohen’s d = 0.70), whereas no significant activity periodicity was observed at other spatial fold (4-fold periodicity: t(32) = 0.09, p = 0.93, Cohen’s d = 0.02; 5-fold periodicity: t(32) = 0.31, p = 0.76, Cohen’s d = 0.05; 6-fold periodicity: t(32) = 2.36, p = 0.12, Cohen’s d = 0.42; 7-fold periodicity t(32) = 1.21, p = 0.24, Cohen’s d = 0.21). The reconstructed BOLD signals, direction-calibrated for each participant based on their spatial phase estimated from sinusoidal modulation, showed a significant 3-fold periodic pattern in the bilateral HPC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>, left; p &lt; 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons). In sum, both the spectral and sinusoidal modulation confirmed a 3-fold periodic activity in the HPC across the conceptual directions within the 2D Greeble space (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>, right), which was distinct from the 6-fold periodicity observed in the EC.</p>
<p>Second, the 3-fold HPC periodicity was not affected by the precision of directional sampling, as consistent findings were observed when 20° bins were applied (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>; initial threshold: p = 0.05, two-tailed; Cluster-based SVC corrected for multiple comparisons: p &lt; 0.05; Cohen’s d = 1.18; Peak MNI coordinate: 22, −24, −14). Third, we independently analyzed HPC and EC periodicity using spectral analysis for each of the three site-dependent experimental groups (See methods for details). These analyses showed reliable activity periodicities in both brain areas across experimental groups (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7</xref>; initial threshold: p = 0.05, two-tailed. Cluster-based SVC corrected for multiple comparisons: p &lt; 0.05). Fourth, we further examined the whole brain representation of both 3- and 6-fold activity periodicity, respectively (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8</xref>). The 3-fold periodicity revealed significant involvement of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), precuneus (PCu), and parietal cortex (PC)(initial threshold: p = 0.05, two-tailed. Whole brain correction for multiple comparisons: p &lt; 0.05), suggesting engagement of the default mode network (DMN). In contrast, the 6-fold periodicity highlighted the Salience network, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and insular cortex (INS), in addition to the EC (initial threshold: p = 0.05, two-tailed; Whole brain cluster-based correction for multiple comparisons: p &lt; 0.05). These results demonstrated distinct functional networks involved in integrating spatial metric (6-fold periodicity) and in judging self-motion within conceptual space (3-fold periodicity).</p>

<p>In addition to the across-participant phase correlation, we further examined the spatial alignment between the 6-fold EC and 3-fold HPC activity patterns. Given that the spatial phase of the HPC is hypothesized to depend on EC projections, particularly along the three primary axes of the hexagonal code, we examined whether the periodic activities of the EC and HPC were spatially peak-aligned. Notably, unlike previous studies that focused on temporal coherence of neural oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Buzsaki, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Maris et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Friese et al., 2013</xref>), our analysis focused on periodic coupling between brain areas in the directional space. To test spatial peak alignment between EC and HPC, a cross-frequency spatial coupling analysis (adapted from the amplitude–phase coupling framework; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Canolty et al., 2006</xref>) was employed to identify at which HPC phase the EC exhibited maximal amplitude modulation. If the activities of both areas were peak-aligned (i.e., no peak offset), a strong coupling at phase 0 of the HPC would be expected as shown by the one-cycle-based schema in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>. In doing so, the instantaneous phase of the HPC and the amplitude envelope of the EC were extracted from the reconstructed activity using the Hilbert transform (see methods for details). HPC phases were classified into nine bins, and the modulation index (M), quantifying the scalar coupling strength between EC amplitude and HPC phase, was computed within each bin. As a result, significant coupling was observed in the bin centered at phase 0 of the HPC (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>; t(32) = 2.57, p = 0.02, Bonferroni-corrected across tests; Cohen’s d = 0.45). In contrast, no significant coupling was found in other bins (p &gt; 0.05). To rule out the possibility that the observed coupling was driven by a potential harmonic (integer multiple) relationship between the 3-fold and 6-fold periodicities, we additionally conducted control analyses using 9-fold and 12-fold EC components. However, no significant coupling was observed in these controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>; p &gt; 0.05). Together, these results confirmed selective alignments of spatial peaks between the 6-fold EC and 3-fold HPC periodicity in the conceptual direction domain.</p>

<title>3-fold periodicity in human behavior</title>
<p>Considering the reciprocal connectivity between the medial temporal lobe (MTL), where the EC and HPC reside, and the parietal cortex implicated in visuospatial perception and action, together with the observed 3-fold periodicity within the DMN (including the PC and PCu; <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8</xref>), we hypothesized that the 3-fold periodic representations of path directions extend beyond the MTL to the egocentric cortical areas, such as the PC, thereby influencing participants’ visuospatial task performance (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we assessed participants’ behavioral performance using two metrics: (1) path length and (2) the deviation (i.e., error size) between the actual ending location and the goal location per trial, since participants rarely stopped exactly at the goal. This procedure yielded, for each participant, a performance vector in the directional space (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>), with superior performance indexed by a composite score reflecting shorter path and smaller error size.</p>

In contrast, no significant spectral power was observed at other spatial folds, including 6-fold behavioral periodicity (p &gt; 0.05). As a control, we also examined behavioral periodicity along each individual metric, path length and error size. A significant 3-fold periodicity was observed for path length (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9</xref>; p &lt; 0.05, permutation-corrected for multiple comparisons), whereas no significant modulation was found for error size, likely reflecting a residual 4-fold bias inherent to the four cardinal-direction movement structure. To further investigate the causal relationship in brain-behavior coupling, we calculated the phase-lag index between the 3-fold behavioral periodicity and HPC activity for each participant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Stam et al., 2007</xref>).

Contrary to the commonly held assumption of isotropic task performance across path directions, these results demonstrated a biased behavioral pattern influenced by HPC and EC activity periodicity, with superior navigational performance (i.e., shorter path length and smaller error size) observed when path directions aligned with grid axes compared to when they were misaligned.</p>

A population of 45-by-45 grid cells were generated to tessellate the space (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>, left), with spatial orientations kept constant while spatial phases varied across locations. The population activity in the EC, associated with movements from a start location, was termed the path code <italic>V</italic>, simulated by summing the grid codes across locations along the path (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>, right).

<p>The downstream HPC activity was simulated using a two-dimensional <bold><italic>δ</italic></bold> vector to represent spatial orientation.

<p>During simulations, 100 goal locations were randomly generated within the space, each paired with 120 starting locations, arranged in a ring-shaped pattern near the boundary. At each simulation step, a vector of HPC activity was extracted from the locations surrounding the current location, and the next movement was determined by the strongest activity of adjacent locations, following winner-take-all dynamics. The step size, initialized as 1 pixel, was dynamically adjusted using a stepwise approach, with a maximum limit of 5 pixels; for example, the step size increased by 1 pixel if no stronger activity was found among the surrounding locations compared to the activity of self-location. Model performance was defined by the path length, calculated as the sum of Euclidean distances between consecutive locations, with superior performance corresponding to shorter path length. The model performance of all directions was sorted in ascending order before spectral analysis, and the mean spectral powers, calculated across 100 navigations tasks, was compared with a permutation-based significant threshold. The simulations revealed a significant 3-fold periodicity in path length across 100 navigation tasks (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>; p &lt; 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons).

A longstanding puzzle is how they collaborate to encode spatial navigation. In the present study, we modulated the EC and HPC activity using conceptual directions, and identified 6-fold periodicity from EC activity and 3-fold periodicity from HPC activity. The periodic activities of both areas were synchronized and peak-aligned. Additionally, 3-fold periodicity was also observed in participants’ behavioral performance, which was synchronized with the HPC activity, suggesting a direct influence of periodic brain activity on visuospatial perception. Our findings provide a potential explanation for the observation of the hippocampal vector field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sarel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ormond and O’Keefe, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Muhle-Karbe et al.,2023</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the HPC and EC, whole-brain spectral analysis revealed involvement of the DMN and salience network for the 3- and 6-fold periodicity, respectively, suggesting that concept-dependent periodic neural activity is supported by distinct networks and extends beyond the EC–HPC circuit. These results do not imply that grid cell’s hexagonal code is the origin of the spatially selective periodic activity observed in these brain networks. Rather, these large-scale activity dynamics more likely reflect hierarchical computations across the brain. In upstream visual areas, neurons encode position-specific features and provide egocentric cues when an allocentric map is unavailable, as seen in the feature-selective neurons in V1 that represent locations across visual space, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hubel and Wiesel (1959</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">1962</xref>). Moreover, spatial attention has been shown to operate through rhythmic sampling in the temporal domain. Neural activity in the frontoparietal attention networks oscillates at 3–8 Hz and predicts trial-by-trial performance in spatial discrimination tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fiebelkorn et al., 2018</xref>). This finding parallels our observed 3-fold behavioral periodicity, indexed by task performance, suggesting that neural representation in both the temporal and spatial domains may rely on periodic computations, potentially reflecting a shared mechanism by which the brain organizes perception and guides goal-directed behavior.</p>
<p>The EC–HPC PhaseSync model demonstrates how a vectorial representation may emerge in the HPC from the projections of populations of periodic grid codes in the EC. The model was motivated by two observations. First, the EC intrinsically serves as the major source of hippocampal input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Witter and Amaral, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">van Groen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Garcia and Buffalo, 2020</xref>), and grid codes exhibit nearly invariant spatial orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hafting et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gardner et al., 2022</xref>). Second, mental planning, characterized by “forward replay” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Pfeiffer, 2020</xref>), has the capacity to activate populations of grid cells that represent sequential experiences in the absence of actual physical movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Nyberg et al., 2022</xref>). We hypothesize that an integrated path code of sequential experiences may eventually be generated in the HPC, providing a vectorial gradient toward the goal location. The path code exhibits regular, vector-like representations when the path direction aligns with the orientations of grid axes, and becomes irregular when they misalign. This explanation is consistent with the band-like representations observed in the dorsomedial EC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Krupic et al., 2012</xref>) and the irregular activity fields of trace cells in the HPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Poulter et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, our study identifies a 3-fold hippocampal code that complements the 6-fold EC metrics, potentially supporting flexible navigation. Extending previous cognitive models based on grid- and place-cell simulations of navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bicanski and Burgess, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Whittington et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Edvardsen et al., 2020</xref>), our findings highlight a potential hierarchical periodic architecture of neurons within the MTL, particularly in representing spatial directions. Moreover, considering that the task space was simplified to an idealized square layout. In more complex, real-world environments, hippocampal three-fold periodicity may interact with other spatial variables such as distance, movement speed, and environmental boundaries. Future studies should aim to characterize how the periodic activity of the EC–HPC circuit interacts with the external environment to support real-world navigation.</p>

<title>Greeble space</title>
<p>The Greebles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gauthier and Tarr, 1997</xref>) were generated based on the modified codes of the TarrLab stimulus datasets (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tarrlab.org/">http://www.tarrlab.org/</ext-link>) using Autodesk 3ds Max (version 2022, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.autodesk.com">http://www.autodesk.com</ext-link>). A Greeble’s identity was defined by the lengths of two distinct features, represented by two nonsense words, “Loogit” and “Vacso” (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). These nonsense names were arbitrarily assigned and carried no semantic relevance to the task. The generated Greebles were arranged in a 45-by-45 matrix, forming a two-dimensional space, with each Greeble representing a “location”. The feature ‘Loogit’ corresponded to the y-axis, while the feature ‘Vacso’ represented the x-axis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). The prototype Greeble, positioned at the center of the Greeble space (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>; blue dot), served as the target (i.e., “goal location”), with Loogit and Vacso having equal lengths. The length ratios of Greebles’ feature relative to the Greeble prototype ranged from 0.12 to 1.88, with a step size of 0.04, providing a smooth morphing experience as participants adjusted the lengths of the Greeble features.</p>
<p><italic>Experimental design</italic>.</p>
<p>The object matching task was programmed using Pygame (version 2.0, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pygame.org/">https://www.pygame.org/</ext-link>; Python version 3.9). Each trial began with a 2.0-s fixation screen, followed by a pseudo-randomly selected Greeble variant presented at the center of the screen (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). These variants were sampled from those near the boundary of the feature space (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>; orange dots). Participants were instructed to adjust the features of the Greeble variant by pressing buttons to match the Greeble prototype as quickly as possible. Two response boxes enabled participants to stretch or shrink the two features. These boxes were counterbalanced between the left and right hands of participants. To mitigate the impact of learning effects on BOLD signals, participants completed a training task one day prior to MRI scanning. On the training day, participants completed the task in a self-paced manner. They first familiarized themselves with the task and then performed at least 10 practice trials before the main training session, freely adjusting Greeble features and pressing the return key to end each trial. Feedback was provided during the first 7 sessions (e.g., “Loogit: 5 percent longer than the target”), while no feedback was given in the final session. Day 2’s MRI experiment procedure mirrored day 1, except that 1) participants were required to complete a trial within 10 seconds. A timer was presented on top of screen (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>), and 2) no feedback was provided for all experimental sessions. Based on the present design, the “path” from a Greeble variant towards the prototype can be interpreted as forming a conceptual direction. To ensure an even distribution of conceptual directions, we arbitrarily defined the “movement” from the East as 0°. For each 30° bin, 24 Greeble variants were pseudo-randomly selected from the boundary of the feature space with an angular precision of 1.25°, resulting in a total of 288 Greeble variants distributed in 8 experimental sessions. Each session contained 36 object matching trials and 4 lure trials. The lure trial presented a blank screen after the fixation for 10 seconds. The MRI experiment lasted approximately 1 hour. Participants were incentivized to perform accurately with exponentially increasing monetary rewards based on their performance. After the scan, participants were debriefed, shown their performance results, and asked to discuss their subjective feeling as well as any perceived reasons for any performance issues. Importantly, participants were unaware of the existence of the Greeble space or the spatial features such as the location and direction during the task.</p>

<title>Behavioral performance</title>
<p>The behavioral performance score was calculated for each trial as <italic>T</italic>- <italic>T</italic><sup>;</sup> + <italic>E</italic>/0.04, where <italic>T</italic> and <italic>T</italic>’ denote the participants’ actual and the objectively optimal path length, respectively. The term <italic>E</italic>/0.04 quantified the error size, the Euclidean distance (in pixels) between the participants’ ending locations (final adjusted Greeble) and the goal location (Greeble prototype). The constant “0.04” represents the step size of the Greeble feature ratio, and was used to convert the ratio-based error to pixel units. The actual path length <italic>T</italic> was defined as the number of movement steps (in pixels) recorded from the participants’ paths, whereas the optimal path length <italic>T</italic>’ was determined by the number of pixels in the shortest possible path between the Greeble variants and Greeble prototype. Subtracting <italic>T</italic>’ from <italic>T</italic> thus normalized each participants’ performance relative to the optimal path. The rationale for this correction was to eliminate the systematic difference in path length between cardinal (i.e., “East”, “South”, “West”, and “North”) and intercardinal (e.g., “Southeast”) directions, which arises from the restricted movements along the horizontal and vertical axis of the squared Greeble space. In this design, movements along cardinal directions inherently result in shorter paths, while those along intercardinal directions become longer. Although this normalization effectively reduced the directional bias in path length, it did not remove the residual 4-fold bias in error size. Nevertheless, because path length and error size capture complementary aspects of task performance—navigational efficiency and positional accuracy—we incorporated both terms in quantifying behavioral performance. Superior performance was represented by shorter paths and smaller errors, corresponding to lower performance scores.</p>

<p>Imaging data were collected using a 3T Siemens Prisma scanner, equipped with a 64-and 20-channel receiver head coil at Tsinghua University and Peking University Imaging Center, respectively. Functional data were acquired with a Multi-band Echo Planer imaging (EPI) sequence with the following parameters: Acceleration Factor: 2, TR = 2000 ms, TE = 30 ms, matrix size = 112 × 112 x 62, flip angle = 90°, resolution = 2 × 2 × 2.3 mm<sup>3</sup>, 62 slices with a slice thickness of 2 mm and a gap of 0.3 mm, in a transversal slice orientation. Additionally, high-resolution T1-weighted three-dimensional anatomical datasets were collected for registration purposes using MPRAGE sequences, detailed as follows: TR = 2530 ms, TE = 2.98 ms, matrix size = 448 x 512 x 192, flip angle = 7°, resolution = 0.5 × 0.5 × 1 mm³, 192 slices with a slice thickness of 1 mm, in the sagittal slice orientation. At Tsinghua University, stimuli were presented through a Sinorad LCD projector (Shenzhen Sinorad Medical Electronics) onto a 33-inch rear-projection screen.

<title>fMRI data preprocessing</title>
<p>The BOLD signal series of each scanning session was preprocessed independently using the FSL FEAT toolbox from the FMRIB’s Software Library (version 6.0, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki">https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Smith et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Woolrich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Jenkinson et al., 2012</xref>). For each scanning session, the BOLD signals were corrected for motion artifacts, slice time acquisition differences, geometrical distortion using fieldmaps, and were applied with a high-pass filter with a cutoff of 100 seconds. Spatial smoothing was performed using a Gaussian kernel with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 5 mm. For group-level analysis, the preprocessed BOLD signals were registered to each participant’s high-resolution anatomical image and subsequently normalized to the standard MNI152 image using FSL FLIRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jenkinson and Smith, 2001</xref>).

<title>Sinusoidal modulation</title>
<p>A GLM with sinusoidal regressors was employed to investigate the periodic neural activity in the EC and HPC, following previously established protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Doeller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Constantinescu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wagner et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Raithel et al., 2023</xref>). First, the grid orientation in each voxel within the EC from each participant was calculated using half of the dataset (odd-numbered sessions: 1, 3, 5, 7). Specifically, a GLM was created for each session to model the BOLD signals of the EC with two parametric modulators: sin(6θ) and cos(6θ), convolved with the Double-Gamma hemodynamic response function. θ represents the path directions, derived from drawing a line between the starting and the ending location, as each raw adjustment step was limited to four cardinal directions. Defining direction by start–end vectors thus allowed full 0–360° coverage, consistent with previous grid-like coding studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Constantinescu et al., 2016</xref>). The factor “6” represents the rotationally symmetric 6-fold neural activity. The factors “3”, “4”, “5” and “7”, misaligned with the primary axes of grid cells, were used as control parameters. The estimated weights <italic>β<sub>sine</sub></italic> and <italic>β<sub>cosine</sub></italic> were then used to compute the grid orientation <italic>φ</italic>, ranging from 0° to 59°, where <inline-formula id="inline-eqn-1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="478346v9_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. The <italic>φ</italic> maps of each participant were averaged across the voxels of a hand-drawn bilateral EC mask and odd-numbered sessions to represent the grid orientation. Second, the neural representation of hexagonal activity, modulated by path directions in Greeble space, was examined by another GLM using the other half of the dataset (even-numbered sessions: 2, 4, 6, 8), with path direction calibrated by the participant-specific grid orientation. The GLM was specified with a cosine parametric modulator, cos(6[θ - Φ]). Third, the hexagonal activity maps were averaged across the even-numbered sessions for each participant before entering second-level analysis. The same procedure was applied to the bilateral HPC to test for 3-fold periodicity. Specifically, voxel-wise phase estimates were obtained from odd sessions using sin(3θ) and cos(3θ) regressors, and the participant-specific 3-fold phase was obtained by averaging voxel-wise estimates across the bilateral HPC, using a mask derived from the AAL template. In the even sessions, path directions were rotationally calibrated by subtracting this participant-specific phase, and a GLM with cos(3[θ - Φ]) was fitted. The resulting maps of 3-fold periodic modulation were averaged across even sessions for each participant and then submitted to group-level analysis. To present the directional tuning curves of EC and HPC activity in the angular domain of path directions, we reconstructed the BOLD signals for each participant using parameters estimated from sinusoidal modulation. Functional masks derived from significant subregions identified in the voxel-wise analyses were employed to capture their tuning profiles with maximum sensitivity.</p>

<title>Spectral analysis of MRI BOLD signals</title>
<p>Spectral analysis was employed to examine the spatial periodicity of BOLD signals. This procedure consisted of three stages: First-level analysis. A GLM was constructed to estimate direction-dependent activity maps. Participants’ path directions were down-sampled into 36 bins of 10° each (e.g., path directions between 0° and 10° were assigned to the 0° bin, whereas those between 350° and 360° were assigned to the 350° bin). These bins were entered as regressors in the GLM, yielding activity estimates associated with each directional bin for every participant. Second-level analysis. The direction-dependent activity maps were sorted in ascending order (from 0° to 360°), detrended, and processed with a Hanning window. They were then transformed from the spatial to the frequency domain using FFT (implemented in the stats package of R, version 4.0; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org/">https://www.r-project.org/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Landau and Fries, 2012</xref>). The absolute values of the complex FFT outputs were used to generate spectral magnitude maps for each participant, covering periodicities from 0- to 18-fold. Third-level analysis. For group inference, the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile (two-tailed) of the pseudo-t distribution, computed as the mean spectral magnitude divided by the standard error across participants, was used as the initial threshold for family-wise error correction in multiple comparisons.</p>

<title>Phase–amplitude coupling</title>
<p>To quantify the spatial peak relationship between EC and HPC BOLD activity, we implemented a cross-frequency amplitude–phase coupling analysis in the directional space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Canolty et al., 2006</xref>). Rather than analyzing raw BOLD signals, we reconstructed 6-fold EC activity and 3-fold HPC activity in each voxel using sinusoidal modulation weights (<italic>β<sub>sine</sub></italic> and <italic>β<sub>cosine</sub></italic>) estimated from the raw BOLD signals. Specifically, activity was modeled as <italic>β<sub>cosine</sub></italic>cos(<italic>k</italic>θ) + <italic>β<sub>sine</sub></italic>sin(<italic>k</italic>θ), where <italic>k</italic> denotes the rotational symmetry. This approach selectively captures the hypothesized spatial symmetries of neural activity (e.g., 6-fold or 3-fold periodicity) as a function of movement direction. For this coupling analysis, we used participants’ original movement directions (i.e., without applying orientation calibration). The reconstructed 6-fold EC and 3-fold HPC activity were then converted into analytic representations using the Hilbert transform, yielding the instantaneous phase of the HPC (<italic>φ<sub>HPC</sub></italic>) and the amplitude envelope of the EC (<italic>A<sub>ERC</sub></italic>). HPC phases were classified into nine bins. The composite analytic signal, defined as <italic>z</italic>= <italic>A<sub>ERC</sub>e<sup>iφHPC</sup></italic>, was used to compute the modulation index <italic>M</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Canolty et al., 2006</xref>), defined as the absolute value of the mean of z values, quantifying the scalar coupling strength between EC amplitude and HPC phase within each bin. A surrogate dataset, a null distribution of the modulation indices (<italic>M</italic>’), was generated by spatially offsetting the EC amplitude relative to the HPC phase across all possible spatial lags. The mean of this surrogate distribution was used as the baseline reference against which the observed coupling strength was compared.</p>

<p>Voxel-wise clusters from the sinusoidal modulation and spectral analyses were first identified using a cluster-defining threshold of p &lt; 0.05 (two-tailed t-test). Cluster significance was determined with cluster-based permutation (5,000 iterations) using FSL randomise (v2.9; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Nichols &amp; Holmes, 2002</xref>), with small-volume correction (SVC) applied within the bilateral MTL. Clusters exceeding the 95th percentile of the maximal suprathreshold cluster size were deemed significant. The directional tuning reliability was assessed via a label-shuffling permutation, in which directional labels were randomly permuted 5,000 times to derive a null distribution of spectral power. The 95th percentile of surrogate power defined the uncorrected threshold, and the across-fold 95th percentile served as the FWE–corrected threshold. For the PPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Vinck et al., 2010</xref>), significance was tested using 5,000 permutations of uniformly distributed random phases (0–2π) to generate a null distribution for comparison with the observed PPC. For behavioral periodicity, both human and EC–HPC PhaseSync model data were evaluated against shuffled null distributions (5,000 iterations). Multiple comparisons across folds (0–18) were controlled using the maximum-statistic approach. Finally, coherence analyses were performed for EC–HPC and behavior–HPC coupling. Direction-domain signals were band-pass filtered at the 3- and 6-fold using a two-way least-squares FIR filter (eegfilt.m, EEGLAB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Delorme &amp; Makeig, 2004</xref>). EC–HPC coherence was quantified using amplitude–phase coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Canolty et al., 2006</xref>), and behavior–HPC coherence was quantified using the phase-lag index (PLI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Stam et al., 2007</xref>). The relationship between EC and HPC phases was evaluated using the circular–circular correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Jammalamadaka &amp; Sengupta, 2001</xref>) implemented in the CircStat MATLAB toolbox.

Surrogate datasets were generated by circularly shifting the signal series along the direction axis across all possible offsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Canolty et al., 2006</xref>), thereby preserving the within-domain phase structure while disrupting consistent phase alignment between signals. Each surrogate dataset underwent identical filtering and coherence computation to obtain a null distribution.

<caption><title>The averaged number of path directions across all paths (i.e., trial).</title> <p>The original path directions towards East (e.g., key 1 on the response box), West (e.g., key 2), North (e.g., key 3), and South (e.g., key 4) were identified based on three consecutive movement steps within each path. On average, participants moved in 3.8 directions, suggesting a “Radial Adjustment” strategy and excluding the possibility of the “horizontal-vertical movement” strategy, which would result in 2 path directions (black dashed line) per path (t(32) = 15.76, p &lt; 0.001; two-tailed; Cohen’s d = 2.78). The error bars indicate SEM.</p></caption>

<caption><title>Histograms of path directions for each participant.</title> <p>Path directions were binned into 36 bins of 10° each. The uniformity of the distributions was assessed using the Rayleigh test. For all participants, no significant deviations from uniformity were observed (all p &gt; 0.05, Bonferroni-corrected across participants). Bar height indicates the number of samples per bin.</p></caption>

<caption><title>Learning effect of the object matching task.</title> <p>The two-day design effectively eliminated the learning effect from the MRI experiment. On day 1, participants’ behavioral performance increased as a function of experimental sessions, resulting a significantly negative slope (grey bar, t(32) = −2.46, p = 0.019, two-tailed; Cohen’s d = 0.44). In contrast, no significant learning effect was found on day 2 (red bar, t(32) = −0.74, p = 0.462, two-tailed; Cohen’s d = 0.13). The dots indicate individual participants.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Zhang and colleagues examine neural representations underlying abstract navigation in entorhinal cortex (EC) and hippocampus (HC) using fMRI. This paper replicates a previously identified hexagonal modulation of abstract navigation vectors in abstract space in EC in a novel task involving navigating in a conceptual Greeble space. In HC, the authors identify a three-fold signal of the navigation angle. They also use a novel analysis technique (spectral analysis) to look at spatial patterns in these two areas and identify phase coupling between HC and EC. Interestingly, the three-fold pattern identified in the hippocampus explains quirks in participants' behavior where navigation performance follows a three-fold periodicity. Finally, the authors propose a EC-HPC PhaseSync Model to understand how the EC and HC construct cognitive maps. The wide array and creativity of the techniques used is impressive but because of their unique nature, the paper would benefit from more details on how some of these techniques were implemented.</p>

<p>The authors report results from behavioral data, fMRI recordings, and computer simulations during a conceptual navigation task. They report 3-fold symmetry in behavioral and simulated model performance, 3-fold symmetry in hippocampal activity, and 6-fold symmetry in entorhinal activity (all as a function of movement directions in conceptual space).

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Zhang and colleagues examine neural representations underlying abstract navigation in entorhinal cortex (EC) and hippocampus (HC) using fMRI. This paper replicates a previously identified hexagonal modulation of abstract navigation vectors in abstract space in EC in a novel task involving navigating in a conceptual Greeble space. In HC, the authors identify a three-fold signal of the navigation angle. They also use a novel analysis technique (spectral analysis) to look at spatial patterns in these two areas and identify phase coupling between HC and EC. Interestingly, the three-fold pattern identified in the hippocampus explains quirks in participants' behavior where navigation performance follows a three-fold periodicity.

<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>Most of my concerns were adequately addressed, and I believe the paper is greatly improved. I have two more points. I noticed that the legend for Figure 4 still refers to some components of the previous figure version, this should be updated to reflect the current version of the figure. I also think the paper would benefit from more details regarding some of the analyses.</p>
<p>Specifically, the phase-amplitude coupling analysis should have a section in the methods which should be sure to clarify how the BOLD signals were reconstructed.</p>

<p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have revised the legend of Figure 4 by removing the significance notation “***: p &lt; 0.001”, which referred to elements from a previous version of the figure.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree and appreciate the reviewer’s helpful suggestion. We have added a dedicated subsection entitled “Phase–amplitude coupling” to the Materials and Methods, in which we provide a detailed description of how the EC and HPC BOLD signals were reconstructed and how the coupling analysis was implemented. Correspondingly, we refined the description of this analysis in the Results section under “Phase synchronization between the HPC and EC activity”. The revised sections have been included below for your convenience.</p>
<p>Materials and Methods: Phase–amplitude coupling</p>
<p>To quantify the spatial peak relationship between EC and HPC BOLD activity, we implemented a cross-frequency amplitude–phase coupling analysis in the directional space (Canolty et al., 2006). Rather than analyzing raw BOLD signals, we reconstructed 6-fold EC activity and 3-fold HPC activity in each voxel using sinusoidal modulation weights (β<sub>sine</sub> and β<sub>cosine</sub>) estimated from the raw BOLD signals. Specifically, activity was modeled as β<sub>cosine</sub>cos(kθ) + β<sub>sine</sub>sin(kθ), where k denotes the rotational symmetry. This approach selectively captures the hypothesized spatial symmetries of neural activity (e.g., 6-fold or 3-fold periodicity) as a function of movement direction. For this coupling analysis, we used participants’ original movement directions (i.e., without applying orientation calibration). The reconstructed 6-fold EC and 3-fold HPC activity were then converted into analytic representations using the Hilbert transform, yielding the instantaneous phase of the HPC (ϕ<sub>HPC</sub>) and the amplitude envelope of the EC (A<sub>ERC</sub>). HPC phases were classified into nine bins. The composite analytic signal, defined as z = A<sub>ERC</sub>e<sup>iϕHPC</sup>, was used to compute the modulation index M (Canolty et al., 2006), defined as the absolute value of the mean of z values, quantifying the scalar coupling strength between EC amplitude and HPC phase within each bin. A surrogate dataset, a null distribution of the modulation indices (M<sup>-</sup>), was generated by spatially offsetting the EC amplitude relative to the HPC phase across all possible spatial lags. The mean of this surrogate distribution was used as the baseline reference against which the observed coupling strength was compared.</p>
<p>Results: Phase synchronization between the HPC and EC activity</p>
<p>To examine whether the spatial phase structure in one region could predict that in another, we tested whether the orientations of the 6-fold EC and 3-fold HPC periodic activities, estimated from odd-numbered sessions using sinusoidal modulation with rotationally symmetric parameters, were correlated across participants. A cross-participant circular correlation was conducted between the spatial phases of the two areas to quantify the spatial correspondence of their activity patterns (EC: purple dots; HPC: green dots) (Jammalamadaka &amp; Sengupta, 2001). The analysis revealed a significant circular correlation (Fig. 4a; r = 0.42, p &lt; 0.001), as reflected by the continuous color progression across the participants (i.e., the colored lines connecting each pair of the EC and HPC dots in Fig. 4a), suggesting that participants with smaller hippocampal phases (green, outer ring) tended to have smaller entorhinal phases (purple, inner ring), and vice versa.</p>
<p>In addition to the across-participant phase correlation, we further examined the spatial alignment between the 6-fold EC and 3-fold HPC activity patterns. Given that the spatial phase of the HPC is hypothesized to depend on EC projections, particularly along the three primary axes of the hexagonal code, we examined whether the periodic activities of the EC and HPC were spatially peak-aligned. Notably, unlike previous studies that focused on temporal coherence of neural oscillations (Buzsaki, 2006; Maris et al., 2011; Friese et al., 2013), our analysis focused on periodic coupling between brain areas in the directional space. To test spatial peak alignment between EC and HPC, a cross-frequency spatial coupling analysis (adapted from the amplitude–phase coupling framework; Canolty et al., 2006) was employed to identify at which HPC phase the EC exhibited maximal amplitude modulation. If the activities of both areas were peak-aligned (i.e., no peak offset), a strong coupling at phase 0 of the HPC would be expected as shown by the one-cyclebased schema in Fig. 4b. In doing so, the instantaneous phase of the HPC and the amplitude envelope of the EC were extracted from the reconstructed activity using the Hilbert transform (see methods for details). HPC phases were classified into nine bins, and the modulation index (M), quantifying the scalar coupling strength between EC amplitude and HPC phase, was computed within each bin. As a result, significant coupling was observed in the bin centered at phase 0 of the HPC (Fig. 4c; t(32) = 2.57, p = 0.02, Bonferroni-corrected across tests; Cohen’s d = 0.45). In contrast, no significant coupling was found in other bins (p &gt; 0.05). To rule out the possibility that the observed coupling was driven by a potential harmonic (integer multiple) relationship between the 3-fold and 6-fold periodicities, we additionally conducted control analyses using 9-fold and 12-fold EC components. However, no significant coupling was observed in these controls (Fig. 4c; p &gt; 0.05). Together, these results confirmed selective alignments of spatial peaks between the 6fold EC and 3-fold HPC periodicity in the conceptual direction domain.</p>
