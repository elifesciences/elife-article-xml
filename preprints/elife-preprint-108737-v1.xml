<abstract><p>Plants rely on receptor-like proteins and receptor-like kinases (RLPs/RLKs) to detect a variety of invading pathogens and insects. However, it remains unclear how these invaders are able to overcome receptor perception and disable the plant signaling pathways. Here, we show that whiteflies and planthoppers independently evolve salivary effectors to target defensive RLP4, therefore minimizing the plant immunity. RLP4 is a leucine-rich repeat RLP (LRR-RLP) that confers plant resistance against herbivorous insects by forming RLP4/SOBIR1 complexes. In whitefly <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic>, BtRDP is an Aleyrodidae-restricted protein that attaches to salivary sheath. It interacts with RLP4 from different plants, causing the degradation of RLP4 in an ubiquitin-dependent manner. Transgenic plants overexpressing NtRLP4 exerts a detrimental impact on <italic>B. tabaci</italic> by exploiting the crosstalk between the salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) pathways. Conversely, the overexpression of BtRDP or silencing of NtRLP4 effectively alleviates such negative effects. In planthopper <italic>Nilaparvata lugens</italic>, a Delphacidae-restricted salivary protein NlSP694 also targets and promotes degradation of OsRLP4 from rice plants. Our results reveal the convergent evolution of salivary proteins in insects, and shed lights on the complex interactions between plants and herbivorous insects.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The activation of innate immunity by membrane-localized receptors is a highly conserved mechanism in eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. In sessile plants, the first line of defense against potential pathogenic microbes or insects relies on cell surface pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. The plant genome encodes hundreds of PRRs, including receptor-like kinases (RLKs) and receptor-like proteins (RLPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. RLKs consist of different types of N-terminal ectodomains, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic protein kinase domain, while RLPs have a similar structure but lack the kinase domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. As RLPs lack intracellular signaling domains, they are usually associated with SOBIR1 or SOBIR1-like adaptors to form bimolecular receptor kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Despite the large number of PRRs encoded by plant genomes, only a few of them have been well characterized in terms of their function in recognizing microbial-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs), damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), and herbivore-associated molecular patterns (HAMPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. For instance, FLS2 is known to recognize bacterial flagellin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], EFR can recognize bacterial elongation factor Tu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], and EIX2 is responsible for recognizing the fungal ethylene-inducing xylanase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Piercing-sucking insects, such as whiteflies, aphids, and planthoppers, damage plants by feeding or transmitting viruses. They inject a mixture of saliva into plant tissues, which aids their performance by binding to the leaked calcium, degrading extracellular DNA, and regulating plant hormonal signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. In response, plants have evolved the ability to detect herbivores by sensing HAMPs present in insect saliva [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. This triggers pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and hormone signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Although a few salivary proteins have been reported to activate plant PTI, the specific PRRs that recognize these proteins and trigger plant immunity are still not well understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. One exception is the inceptin receptor (INR), which is a legume-specific LRR-RLP recognizing the Vu-In in insect oral secretions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Moreover, plant PRRs have been widely reported to be targeted by pathogen effectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. It remains unknown how insects cope with the immune recognition system.</p>
<p>The whitefly <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic> (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) and brown planthopper <italic>Nilaparvata lugens</italic> (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) are notorious pests globally. During the feeding process, both insects secrete abundant species-specific salivary proteins into host plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. The plants have been reported to initiate defense responses when they recognize insect feeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. However, the specific PRRs responsible for this process are unknown. Both insects can successfully ingest phloem saps with limited plant defenses. It remains unclear how insects attenuate plant defenses. Given that many defense mechanisms are conserved across plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], it is interesting to investigate whether insect evolves a similar strategy to aid feeding in convergent evolution. In this study, we characterize the function of RLPs in plant immunity responsive to piercing-sucking insects, and demonstrate that <italic>B. tabaci</italic> and <italic>N. lugens</italic> independently evolve salivary proteins to regulate the posttranslational modification of RLPs.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>BtRDP is most abundantly expressed in salivary glands and secreted into host plants</title>
<p>According to the transcriptomic results, BtRDP (<italic>B. tabaci</italic> RLP-degrading protein; GenBank accession: MN738093) is the most abundantly expressed gene in salivary glands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. It is a secretory protein containing a signal peptide at the N-terminal, and totally 6 unique peptides from BtRDP are detected in <italic>B. tabaci</italic> watery saliva (Fig. S1). As there is no gene homolog identified in the NCBI nr database, BtRDP is subjected to BLAST analysis against the transcriptomic or genomic data of 30 insect species. The results show that RDP is distributed in all the analyzed Aleyrodidae species, while no RDP homolog is detected in other species (Table S1). Based on phylogenetic analysis, RDPs from five <italic>B. tabaci</italic> cryptic species are clustered in the same clade, showing a close relationship to RDP from <italic>Aleurocanthus spiniferus</italic> (Fig. S2).</p>
    <p>BtRDP can be secreted into host plants, with two bands between 25-35kDa being detected in <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic> plants infested by <italic>B. tabaci</italic>, but not in the non-infested plants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). The smaller high intensity band is the same size as that of BtRDP in salivary glands, and always presents in the <italic>B. tabaci</italic>-infested plants. For the larger lower intensity band, it presents in infested samples with lower frequency. It is possible that the larger band might be the BtRDP that undergoes modification after being secreted into plants, similar with another salivary effector previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that this larger band is the non-specific <italic>N. tabacum</italic> protein induced by <italic>B. tabaci</italic> feeding. Western-blotting, qPCR and transcriptomic analysis demonstrate that BtRDP is nearly exclusively expressed in the salivary glands (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b, c</xref>; Fig. S3a), which is significantly different from the actin or ribosomal 18S rRNA (Fig. S4a). In addition, BtRDP is mainly expressed in the adult stages, but lowly expressed in the egg, nymph, and pseudopupa stages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>; Fig. S3b), similar to another salivary protein BtFTSP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>] but different from actin or ribosomal 18S rRNA (Fig. S4b). Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining shows that BtRDP is specifically distributed in principle salivary gland, but not in the accessory salivary gland or other tissues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). A few salivary proteins have been reported to attach to salivary sheath after secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. We also stain the salivary sheath secreted by <italic>B. tabaci</italic> using anti-BtRDP serum. The results show that BtRDP signal is mainly detected in the protuberant structure of sheath (Fig. S5), indicating that BtRDP attaches to salivary sheath after secretion.</p>

<title>BtRDP is important for <italic>B. tabaci</italic> feeding on tobacco plants</title>
<p>RNA interference is firstly employed to investigate the potential role of BtRDP in whitefly feeding, and ds<italic>BtRDP</italic> treatment efficiently and specifically suppresses the target gene at transcriptional and protein level (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>; Fig. S6). We do not observe a significant difference in salivary sheath morphology between ds<italic>BtRDP</italic>- and ds<italic>GFP</italic>-treated <italic>B. tabaci</italic> (Fig. S7a). However, the salivary sheath length of ds<italic>BtRDP</italic>-treated <italic>B. tabaci</italic> is significantly shorter than that of the ds<italic>GFP</italic>-treated control (Fig. S7b). Moreover, ds<italic>BtRDP</italic> treatment exerts no influence on the whitefly survivorship (Fig. S7c). For reproduction analysis, the ds<italic>BtRDP</italic>-treated whiteflies oviposit less eggs than the control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). The whitefly feeding behavior, which can be classified into nonpenetration (np), pathway duration (C), phloem salivation (E1), and phloem ingestion (E2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>] (Fig. S8), is recorded using the electrical penetration graph (EPG) technique. Compared with ds<italic>GFP</italic> treatment, ds<italic>BtRDP</italic>-treated <italic>B. tabaci</italic> exhibits a dramatic decrease in phloem ingestion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>).

<p>Salivary proteins are reported to function in intercellular space and/or extracellular space after secreted into host plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. To investigate the role of BtRDP in different subcellular location of host plants, we construct two transgenic <italic>N. tabacum</italic> overexpressing BtRDP, one with a complete coding region (oeBtRDP) and the other without signal peptide (oeBtRDP<sup>-sp</sup>). The signal peptide of BtRDP may enable protein secretion into the extracellular space. The flag tag is fused to the C-terminal ends of recombinant proteins, respectively. The empty vector (EV) transgenic plants, which exert no significant influence on insect performance compared with the WT (Fig. S9), is used as a negative control. Fecundity assay demonstrates that both oeBtRDP and oeBtRDP<sup>-sp</sup> transgenic plants are beneficial to whiteflies, with more eggs oviposited in these two overexpressing plants compared with the EV controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d-i</xref>; Fig. S10). Two-choice experiments exert similar results, with more insects being settled and oviposited in oeBtRDP or oeBtRDP<sup>-sp</sup> transgenic plants than the EV controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d-i</xref>; Fig. S10). These results indicate that BtRDP is beneficial to whiteflies, regardless of its subcellular location in host plants.</p>
<p>Transcriptomic sequencing is performed on EV, oeBtRDP#1, and oeBtRDP<sup>-sp</sup>#1 transgenic plants. PCA analysis demonstrates that the biological replicates of each transgenic plant can be well clustered (Fig. S11a). Totally 1253 and 1227 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are identified when comparing oeBtRDP#1 and oeBtRDP<sup>-sp</sup>#1 with EV plants, respectively (Table S2; Table S3). Enrichment analysis of DEGs in these two comparison groups exerts similar results, with pathways associated with MAPK signaling, environmental adaptation, signal transduction, and plant-pathogen interaction significantly enriched (Fig. S10b, c). There are 464 DEGs overlap in these two comparison groups (Fig. S11d). Interestingly, the majority of these DEGs exhibit similar expression pattern in oeBtRDP#1 and oeBtRDP<sup>-sp</sup>#1 when compared with EV plants (Fig. S11e), suggesting that BtRDP affect some plant pathways regardless of its subcellular location. There are 1084 DEGs identified in comparison of oeBtRDP#1 and oeBtRDP<sup>-sp</sup>#1 plants (Table S4). Enrichment analysis show that the DEGs associated with metabolism, diterpenoid biosynthesis, and plant-pathogen interaction are significantly enriched (Fig. S12), suggesting that subcellular location of BtRDP also has non-negligible influence on host plants.</p>

<title>BtRDP interacts with NtRLP4/NtSORBIR1 complex</title>
<p>To investigate the underlying mechanism of BtRDP in improving whitefly feeding, yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening against a <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> cDNA library is conducted using BtRDP<sup>-sp</sup> as a bait. Totally seven proteins are found to potentially interact with BtRDP<sup>-sp</sup> (Table S5), including an NbRLP4 (accession Niben261Chr07g1310001.1 in Niben261 genome).

<p>The relative expression of <italic>NtRLP4</italic> in response to <italic>B. tabaci</italic> infestation is investigated. qRT-RCR results demonstrate that the transcript level of <italic>NtRLP4</italic> is not significantly influenced by <italic>B. tabaci</italic> (Fig. S13). However, a decrease in protein level of NtRLP4 is detected by western-blotting assay (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Point-to-point Y2H assays reveal that NtRLP4 without signal peptides and transmembrane domains interacts with BtRDP<sup>-sp</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). To investigate the specificity of NtRLP4-BtRDP interaction, another RLP protein NtCf9 showing the highest sequence similarity to tomato resistance protein Cf9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], as well as three randomly selected salivary proteins from <italic>B. tabaci</italic>, are used as controls. The results show that BtRDP<sup>-sp</sup> cannot interact with truncated NtCf9 without signal peptides and transmembrane domains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). Also, NtRLP4<sub>(23-541)</sub> cannot interact with the other three salivary proteins without signal peptides (Fig. S14a, b). In addition, it is the LRR domain, but not the malectin-like domain or the short intercellular region, that is required for the NtRLP4-BtRDP interaction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). To investigate the shortest LRR sequence responsible for BtRDP interaction, LRR domain is divided into three segments. However, none of these segments interact with BtRDP<sup>- sp</sup> (Fig. S14a). Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays further confirm the specific interaction between BtRDP and NtRLP4 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). It is the C-terminal myc tag-fused NtRLP4 (NtRLP4-myc), but not the NtCf9 (NtCf9-myc), that can be immunoprecipitated by C-terminal flag tag fused BtRDP (BtRDP-flag). In bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay, YFP fluorescence is observed when co-expressing the N-terminal nYFP tag fused NtRLP4 and N-terminal cYFP tag fused BtRDP<sup>-sp</sup> (Fig. S14c). Furthermore, oeBtRDP transgenic plants that overexpressing BtRDP-flag are incubated with anti-flag beads. The results show that endogenous NtRLP4 can be immunoprecipitated, which is significantly different from the control (Fig. S14d). These results suggest that BtRDP interacts with NtRLP4.</p>
<p>The absence of kinase motifs in the C-terminal region of NtRLP4 suggests that it must function in cooperation with other proteins to initiate the signaling. The receptor-like kinase SOBIR1, which contained a kinase domain (Fig. S15a), is reported to be required for the function of several RLPs involved in the innate immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Through Co-IP assays, our study demonstrates that NtRLP4 is capable of interacting with NtSOBIR1 (Fig. S15b).</p>

<title>NtRLP4 and NtSOBIR1 are resistant to <italic>B. tabaci</italic> infestation</title>
<p>The transgenic <italic>N. tabacum</italic> overexpressing NtRLP4 (oeRLP#1 and oeRLP#2, without any tags) is constructed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). Compared with the EV control, both oeRLP lines are less attractive to <italic>B. tabaci</italic>, with less settling and ovipositing insects (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>; Fig. S16a). Also, we observe the significantly decreased fecundity of <italic>B. tabaci</italic> in oeRLP plants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>; Fig. S16b). Similar results are observed after transient overexpression of NtRLP4-GFP in <italic>N. tabacum</italic> (Fig. S16c, d), indicating that NtRLP4 is resistant to <italic>B. tabaci</italic> infestation.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the EV and oeRLP#1 plants are subjected to transcriptomic sequencing (Fig. 17a). Totally 729 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are identified, including 423 up-regulated and 306 down-regulated ones (Table S6). Enrichment analysis demonstrate that the majority of up-regulated DEGs are associated with plant-pathogen interaction, environmental adaptation, MAPK signaling pathway, and signal transduction (Fig. 17b). By contrast, the glutathione metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and amino acid metabolism pathways are significantly enriched in down-regulated DEGs (Fig. 17c). Noteworthily, there are many DEGs annotated as RLK/RLP or WRKY transcription factor, with the majority of them being significantly upregulated (Fig. S17d, e). These results suggest an increased defense in oeRLP plants. The crosstalk between salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) pathways is critical for plant defenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. The increased defense of oeRLP transgenic plant is partially caused by the altered hormonal signaling. The JA-associated genes <italic>FAD7</italic> is significantly induced, while the SA-associated genes <italic>PAL</italic> and <italic>NPR1</italic> are repressed in oeRLP plants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h</xref>). Transient overexpression of NtRLP4-GFP in <italic>N. tabacum</italic> plants via <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> infiltration exert similar results (Fig. S16e). Furthermore, NtRLP4-GFP significantly enhances the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation (Fig. S16f).</p>
<p>We also investigate the function of NtSOBIR1 by transient overexpression and hairpin RNAi (Fig. S18). Overexpression of NtSOBIR1-GFP induces the cell death phenotype five days post agro-injection (Fig. S18b). Insects prefer to settle and oviposit on GFP-expressed <italic>N. tabacum</italic> than on NtSOBIR1-GFP-expressed control, even no obvious death phenotype is observed two days post agro-injection (Fig. S18c, d). For NtSOBIR1 silencing, no cell death phenotype is observed, while the NtSOBIR1-silenced leaves exhibit reduced growth (Fig. S18f). Compared with EV-silenced control, NtSOBIR1-silenced <italic>N. tabacum</italic> is slightly attractive to <italic>B. tabaci</italic> (Fig. S18g, h). Collectively, these results demonstrate that NtSOBIR1 is resistant to <italic>B. tabaci</italic> infestation.</p>

<title>BtRDP attenuates plant defenses by promoting the degradation of host RLP4</title>
<p>To investigate the interplay between NtRLP4 and BtRDP, we construct transgenic <italic>N. tabacum</italic> silencing NtRLP4 (<italic>RNAi-RLP</italic>#1 and <italic>RNAi-RLP</italic>#2) (Fig. S19a). Compared with EV plants, <italic>B. tabaci</italic> show a tendency to settle on NtRLP4-silenced plants and lay more eggs (Fig. S19b, c). Thereafter, ds<italic>GFP</italic>- and ds<italic>BtRDP</italic>-treated <italic>B. tabaci</italic> are reared on EV, <italic>RNAi-RLP</italic>#1, and <italic>RNAi-RLP</italic>#2, respectively.

<p>To investigate the influence of BtRDP on NtRLP4, the GFP-tagged NtRLP4 (NtRLP4-GFP) is transiently co-expressed with mCherry-tagged BtRDP (BtRDP-mCherry), red fluorescent protein (RFP)-mCherry, and BtFTSP1-mCherry via agroinfiltration, respectively. All tags are fused to the C-terminus. BtRDP-mCherry does not influence the location patterns of NtRLP4-GFP (Fig. S20). However, a significant reduction in the fluorescent signal of NtRLP4-GFP is detected when co-expressed with BtRDP-mCherry, but not the controls (Fig. S20). The co-expression of BtRDP-mCherry/NtRLP4-GFP significantly reduces H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>) and suppresses the expression of the JA-associated genes <italic>FAD7</italic> and <italic>PDF.12</italic>, while inducing the expression of the SA-associated genes <italic>PAL</italic> and <italic>NPR1</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). Insect bioassays demonstrate that transient overexpression of BtRDP-mCherry rescues the negative effects on whitefly performance caused by NtRLP4-GFP overexpression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d, e</xref>). In host choice experiments, <italic>B. tabaci</italic> display a preference for settling on <italic>N. tabacum</italic> leaves co-expressing BtRDP-mCherry/NtRLP4-GFP over those co-expressing RFP-mCherry/NtRLP4-GFP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). We observe almost no preference in <italic>B. tabaci</italic> feeding on <italic>N. tabacum</italic> plants co-expressing BtRDP-mCherry/NtRLP4-GFP and plants expressing GFP alone (Fig. S21).</p>
<p>The attenuated NtRLP4-GFP fluorescent signal (Fig. S20), along with the observed decrease in the protein level of NtRLP4 during <italic>B. tabaci</italic> infestation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>), leads us to speculate on whether BtRDP influences the accumulation of NtRLP4. To this end, the BtRDP<sup>-sp</sup>-his and GFP-his proteins are prokaryotic expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Different concentrations of purified BtRDP<sup>-sp</sup>-his and GFP-his proteins are infiltrated into <italic>N. tabacum</italic> plants overexpressing NtRLP4-myc. Interestingly, the protein level of NtRLP4-myc shows a slight decrease with increasing amounts of BtRDP<sup>-sp</sup>-his, while no such effect is observed with GFP-his (Fig. S22). Moreover, the BtRDP<sup>-sp</sup>-his protein does not have significant effect on the accumulation of another RLP NtCf9-like (Fig. S22).</p>
<p>Then, we detect the NtRLP4 level in oeBtRDP and oeBtRDP<sup>-sp</sup> plants. Compared with the EV control, a reduced NtRLP4 abundance is observed in both oeBtRDP#1 and oeBtRDP#2 transgenic lines, but not the oeBtRDP<sup>-sp</sup> plants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>), suggesting the importance of BtRDP secretion in extracellular space. BtRDP attaches to salivary sheath that localizes in plant apoplast (Fig. S5). The presence of signal peptide promotes the secretion of BtRDP into extracellular space. Therefore, we use the complete coding region of <italic>BtRDP</italic> in subsequent experiments. The NtRLP4-myc and BtRDP-flag are transiently co-expressed in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> plants through <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> infiltration. The results show that BtRDP-flag significantly decreasing the protein level of NtRLP4-myc, but not the NtCf9-myc (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref>). qRT-PCR analyses demonstrate that the transcript level of <italic>NtRLP4</italic> remains unchanged (Fig. S23). These findings indicate that the reduction in protein level of NtRLP4 is not caused by transcriptional changes but rather to degradation.</p>
<p>The ubiquitin system and autophagy are two major pathways regulating protein degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. At first, we employ MG132, a 26S proteasome inhibitor known to inhibit the degradation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. The results show that MG132 efficiently prevents the degradation of NtRLP4-myc by BtRDP-flag (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4h</xref>). Then, we employ autophagy inhibitor 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) and bafilomycin A1 (BAF) that can block autophagy in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. However, the decreased protein level of NtRLP4-myc is still observed in the presence of 3-MA or BAF (Fig. S24). Additionally, NtRLP4-myc and HA-tagged ubiquitin (HA-UBQ) are co-expressed in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>. Total proteins are extracted from <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-myc beads. The ubiquitin attached to NtRLP4 is determined by immunoblot using anti-HA antibody. Leaves expressing NtRLP4-myc or UBQ-HA along are used as negative controls. The results show that a strong UBQ signal is detected in the immunoprecipitated product only when NtRLP4-myc and UBQ-HA are co-expressed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4i</xref>). The molecular weight of UBQ-attached NtRLP4-myc is remarkably larger than NtRLP4-myc itself (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4i</xref>). These results suggest that BtRDP promotes NtRLP4 degradation through the ubiquitin system, but not the autophagy pathway.</p>

<title>Degrading plant RLP4s by salivary effectors is a common strategy for insects</title>
<p>To investigate the ability of BtRDP to degrade RLPs from other host plants of <italic>B. tabaci</italic>, <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> RLP4 (SlRLP4; GenBank accession: XP_004232910) is selected for analysis. Sequence analysis reveals a similar gene structure between SlRLP4 and NtRLP4 (Fig. S25; Fig. S26a). The interaction between BtRDP and SlRLP4 is confirmed through Y2H and Co-IP assays (Fig. S26b, c). Moreover, we transiently co-express SlRLP4-myc and SlCf9-like-myc with varying concentrations of BtRDP-flag or GUS-flag, with the myc and flag tags fused to the C-terminus. The results show that BtRDP-flag exerts no influence on the accumulation of SlCf9-like-myc protein. By contrast, the protein level of SlRLP4-myc is significantly reduced in the presence of BtRDP-flag (Fig. S26d), indicating the conserved function of BtRDP in <italic>B. tabaci</italic> adaptation to different host plants.</p>
<p>BtRDP is an Aleyrodidae-restricted gene that does not have homologues in other species. To explore whether RLP degradation by salivary effectors is conserved among different herbivorous insects, a RLP4 homology from <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> (OsRLP4; GenBank accession: XP_015645303; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>) and twenty salivary proteins from planthopper species without signal peptides are paired to identify the potential interactions using Y2H assays. As a result, only the salivary protein NlSP694<sup>- sp</sup> (GenBank accession: MF278694) interacts with OsRLP4<sub>(29-551)</sub> (OsRLP4 without signal peptides and transmembrane domains), while the other salivary proteins analyzed do not (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b, c</xref>; Fig. S27). NlSP694 does not show any sequence or structure similarity to BtRDP (Fig. S28). Based on truncation analysis, NlSP694<sup>-sp</sup> interacts with both the LRR domain and malectin-like domain of OsRLP4 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>), slightly different from that of the BtRDP-NtRLP4 interaction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). Considering that both BtRDP and NlSP694 interact with the LRR domain of RLP4, the specific region of LRR domain responsible for NlSP694 binding is further investigated. The LRR domain of OsRLP4 is divided into three segments, in accordance with the LRR domain division in NtRLP4 (Fig. S14a). NlSP694<sup>-sp</sup> interacts with the truncated LRR domain (OsRLP4<sub>(480-526)</sub>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). By contrast, none of the truncated LRR domain of NtRLP4 interact with BtRDP<sup>-sp</sup> (Fig. S14a). These results suggest that the binding sites of salivary proteins to RLP4 may be different between <italic>N. lugens</italic> and <italic>B. tabaci</italic>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Plants have evolved a complex innate immune system to protect themselves against pathogen/insect invasion, and the cell surface-localized PRRs function on the frontline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. To counteract this response, the pathogens have been reported to develop various methods to avoid plant PRR-mediated PTI for their own advantage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. However, it remains unknown whether insects take the similar strategy to sabotage plant immunity. In this study, we demonstrate that the RLP4/SOBIR1 complexes confer plant resistance against herbivorous insects. In response, both planthoppers and whiteflies secrete salivary effectors that facilitate the degradation of defensive RLP4, leading to attenuated plant immunity. Our results suggest that manipulation of PRRs may be a conserved strategy for herbivorous insects.</p>
<p>PRRs recognize modified-self or non-self patterns and activate a series of immune signaling, which subsequently regulate downstream defense responses and confer plant resistance against invaders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. While various insect salivary components have been reported to trigger plant immune responses, the specific PRRs responsible for this process are elusive. Our study demonstrates that RLP4 exerts a significant impact on insect performance by modulating plant hormones and ROS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f-h</xref>; Fig. S16-S17), highlighting the critical role of this gene in plant immunity. Nevertheless, the exact ligand for RLP4 remains unknown. It is possible that malectin-LRR receptor RLP4 responds to the DAMPs or HAMPs that are released during insect feeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>], which deserved further investigation. RLP4 lacks the intracellular kinase domain, and forms bimolecular receptor kinases by interacting with SOBIR1 (Fig. S15). Overexpression of NtRLP4 or NtSOBIR1 enhances insect feeding, while silencing of either gene exerts the opposite effect (Fig. Fig. S16-S19). The association between RLPs and SOBIR1 protein kinases is a structural and functional equivalent to genuine receptor kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Therefore, disrupting the stability of the RLP4/SOBIR1 complex can potentially undermine the immune recognition process.</p>
<p>As pivotal regulators in immune signaling, PRRs are frequently targeted by multiple pathogens through diverse mechanism. For example, <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> hampered the functionality of receptor complexes by disrupting the ligand-dependent association between receptor-like kinase BAK1 and the flagellin receptor FLS2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>], while <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic> fostered alternative splicing of the host RLPKs to enhance infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. PRRs are usually subjected to degradation via post-translational modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. In plants, the activity and stability of PRRs undergo stringent regulation since excessive activation of PRRs can be detrimental [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. One prevalent regulatory mechanism involves ubiquitination followed by subsequent degradation mediated by the 26S proteasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. Mounting evidence has demonstrated the exploitation of such mechanisms by bacteria, fungi, viruses, and oomycetes to facilitate PRR degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. Nevertheless, the occurrence of effector-mediated PRR degradation in insects is unreported. Our study reveals that the salivary effectors BtRDP from <italic>B. tabaci</italic> and NlSP694 from <italic>N. lugens</italic> interact with plant RLP4s, leading to their degradation in an ubiquitin-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f-i</xref>). Notably, BtRDP and NlSP694 share no sequence or structural similarity and lack resemblance to known eukaryotic ubiquitin-ligase domains. Their interaction with RLP4s occurs in the extracellular space (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>), whereas the ubiquitin-proteasome system primarily functions in the cytosol and nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. Furthermore, NtRLP4 reduction is observed only in oeBtRDP transgenic plants, not in oeBtRDP<sup>-sp</sup> plants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>), suggesting that BtRDP exerts its influence on NtRLP4 in the extracellular space. These findings might exclude the possibility that BtRDP/NlSP694 harbors E3 ligase activity that directly ubiquitinates RLP4s in plant cells. It is likely that salivary proteins indirectly influence the post-translational modification of RLP4, increasing its degradation rate, which warrants further investigation.</p>
<p>Herbivorous insects use a combination of salivary components to facilitate successful feeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that <italic>B. tabaci</italic> suppresses plant defenses by leveraging SA-JA crosstalk, with the salivary protein Bt56 playing a pivotal role during this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Bt56 triggers the SA-signaling pathway by directly interacting with a KNOTTED 1-like homeobox transcription factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. This study investigates the effects of another salivary effector, BtRDP, on plant hormones, and finds that it elicits similar effects to Bt56, albeit primarily impacting the signal recognition process (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h</xref>; Fig. S16e). This leads us to speculate that different salivary effectors from the same insect species might simultaneously target the same signaling pathway to ensure effective immune suppression. Our analysis reveals that BtRDP interacts with other host genes in addition to NtRLP4 (Table S5), and silencing NtRLP4 cannot completely rescue the impaired feeding performance of ds<italic>BtRDP</italic>-treated insects (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Salivary proteins exert a crucial role in mediating the interactions between herbivores and plants. The dynamic interplay between plants and insects might be highly complex, one salivary protein can target multiple plant pathways, and one plant pathway is influenced by multiple salivary proteins.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study shows that suppressing PRR-mediated plant immunity may be the common strategy for the successful feeding of herbivorous insects. Whiteflies and planthoppers independently evolve salivary effectors that facilitate the degradation of to degrade defensive RLP4 of host plants in an ubiquitin-dependent manner, which can therefore disrupt the RLP4/SOBIR1 complexes for signal recognition (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>The proposed model for the suppression of receptor-like proteins (RLPs)-mediated plant defenses by salivary effectors.</title>
<p>Host plants employ pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect various damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and herbivore-associated molecular patterns (HAMPs) triggered by insect feeding. The RLP4/SOBIR1 complex plays a vital role in initiating pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), including H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> burst, upregulation of jasmonic acid (JA), and downregulation of salicylic acid (SA), which hinders insect feeding. The whitefly <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic> and planthopper <italic>Nilaparvata lugens</italic> independently evolved salivary proteins that targeted plant RLP4. <italic>B. tabaci</italic> salivary sheath protein BtRDP interacts with the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of RLP4 from <italic>Nicotiana tabaci</italic> and <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>, while <italic>N. lugens</italic> NlSP694 targets both the LRR domain and the malectin-like domain of <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> RLP4. These interactions promote the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of RLP4, thereby disrupting the stability of the RLP4/SOBIR1 complex. The presence of salivary effectors causes a hormonal shift and suppresses the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> burst, finally favoring insect feeding.</p></caption>

Cleared lysates were incubated with anti-flag beads (#L00432-1, GenScript, Nanjing, China) for 4 h at 4°C, washed with PBS, and eluted in 2× SDS-PAGE buffer (500 mM Tris-HCl, pH=6.8, 50% glycerin, 10% SDS, 1% bromophenol blue, and 2% β-mercaptoethanol) for Western-blotting assay.</p>
<p>In the BiFC assay, BtRDP<sup>-sp</sup>, BtFTSP<sup>-sp</sup>, NtRLP4, and NtCf9-like were cloned into the pCV-cYFP or pCV-nYFP vectors, respectively. After transforming <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> GV3101, pairwise combinations were co-infiltrated into <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves. Following 36-48 h incubation in a growth chamber, reconstituted YFP fluorescence was visualized using a Leica SP8 confocal microscope with standard filter sets for YFP detection.</p>

<title>RLP degradation by salivary effectors among different herbivorous insects</title>
<p>To examine salivary protein effects on RLPs, we co-infiltrated <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> GV3101 strains carrying various constructs into <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves. The recombinant vectors expressed C-terminally tagged proteins: BtRDP-flag, NlSP694-flag, GUS-flag, NlSP7-flag, and myc-tagged RLPs (NtRLP4, SlRLP4, OsRLP4, SlCf9, NtCf9). Bacterial suspensions were mixed at predetermined OD<sub>600</sub> ratios before infiltration, with leaf samples collected 48 hours post-infiltration for subsequent analysis.</p>
<p>For confocal microscopy studies, <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves were co-infiltrated with <italic>A. tumefaciens carrying</italic>: (1) NtRLP4-GFP plus BtRDP-mCherry, (2) NtRLP4-GFP plus RFP-mCherry, or (3) NtRLP4-GFP plus BtFTSP-mCherry. The samples were imaged by confocal microscopy at 48 h post injection. The same parameters were used in photographing.</p>
<p>This study also conducted a treatment on <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> plants that were overexpressing NtRLP4-myc using purified proteins. Briefly, the BtRDP<sup>-sp</sup> and GFP coding sequences were cloned into pET-28a for 6×His-tagged expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> Transetta (TransGen Biotech). Protein expression was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG at 25°C for 8 h, followed by purification using Ni-NTA agarose and buffer exchange into PBS using a 3-kDa molecular-weight cutoff Amicon Ultra-4 Centrifugal Filter Device (Millipore, MA, USA). Different concentrations of purified proteins were infiltrated into leaves of <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> plants stably expressing NtRLP4-myc, with samples collected 24 h post-treatment.</p>
<p>To investigate degradation pathways, we infiltrated <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves with: 50 μM MG132 (#M7449, Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany), 5 μM 3-MA (#M9281, Sigma-Aldrich,), or 10 nM BAF (#BML-CM110-0100, Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, USA) at 24 h post-agroinfiltration. The samples were incubated for additional24 h. Protein levels were detected using Western-blotting assay.</p>

<title><italic>In planta</italic> ubiquitination assay</title>
<p>Ubiquitination detection in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> was performed according to the methods previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. The recombinant vector for transient expression of the HA-fused ubiquitin protein was kindly provided by Dr. Chao Zheng (Ningbo University). Myc-tagged proteins were co-expressed with HA-UBQ by agroinfiltration, and 50 μM MG132 was injected into the <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves one day post <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> infiltration. Immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-myc beads (ytma-20, ChromoTek , Planegg-Martinsried, Germany). Ubiquitination signals were detected by immunoblot with anti-HA antibody (HT301, TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China).</p>

<p><italic>B. tabaci</italic> adults were allowed to feed on artificial diet solutions for 24 h. Parafilm sections containing salivary sheaths were carefully excised and rinsed with 1× PBS (pH 7.4) to remove residual diet. The samples were mounted on aluminum stubs, desiccated under vacuum, and sputter-coated with gold before imaging with a TM4000 II Plus SEM (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Salivary sheath length (from apex to base) was measured, with 20 sheaths analyzed per treatment to ensure statistical reliability.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The log-rank test (SPSS Statistics 19, Chicago, IL, USA) was used to determine the statistical significance of survival distributions. Two-tailed unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test (comparisons between two groups) or one-way ANOVA test followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (comparisons among three groups) was used to analyze the results of qRT-PCR, fecundity analysis, and host choice analysis. The EPG data were first checked for the normality and homogeneity of variance, and those not fitting a normal distribution were log<sub>10</sub> transformed before Student’s <italic>t</italic> test, as described in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>].

<p>This study provides an <bold>important</bold> contribution by showing that whiteflies and planthoppers use salivary effectors to suppress plant immunity through the receptor-like protein RLP4, suggesting convergent evolution in these insect lineages. The topic is of clear interest for understanding plant-insect interactions and offers ideas that could stimulate further research in the field. However, the strength of evidence is <bold>incomplete</bold>, as some aspects of the data and experimental design limit the extent to which the main claims are fully supported.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is a well-structured and interesting manuscript that investigates how herbivorous insects, specifically whiteflies and planthoppers, utilize salivary effectors to overcome plant immunity by targeting the RLP4 receptor.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors present a strong case for the independent evolution of these effectors and provide compelling evidence for their functional roles.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Western blot evidence for effector secretion is weak. The possibility of contamination from insect tissues during the sample preparation should be avoided.</p>
<p>Below are some specific comments and suggestions to strengthen the manuscript.</p>
<p>(1) Western blot evidence for effector secretion:</p>
<p>The western blot evidence in Figure 1, which aims to show that the insect protein is secreted into plants, is not fully convincing. The band of the expected size (~30 kDa) in the infested tissues is very weak. Furthermore, the high and low molecular weight bands that appear in the infested tissues do not match the size of the protein in the insects themselves, and a high molecular weight band also appears in the uninfested control tissues. It is difficult to draw a definitive conclusion that this protein is secreted into the plants based on this evidence. The authors should also address the possibility of contamination from insect tissues during the sample preparation and explain how they have excluded this possibility.</p>
<p>(2) Inconsistent conclusion (Line 156 and Figure 3c): T</p>
<p>The statement in line 156 is inconsistent with the data presented in Figure 3c. The figure clearly shows that the LRR domain of the protein is the one responsible for the interaction with BtRDP, not the region mentioned in the text. This is a critical misrepresentation of the experimental findings and must be corrected. The conclusion in the text should accurately reflect the data from the figure.</p>
<p>(3) Role of SOBIR1 in the RLP4/SOBIR1 Complex:</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate that the salivary effectors destabilize the RLP4 receptor, leading to a decrease in its protein levels and a reduction in the RLP4/SOBIR1 complex. A key question remains regarding the fate of SOBIR1 within this complex. The authors should clarify what happens to the SOBIR1 protein after the destabilization of RLP4. Does SOBIR1 become unbound, targeted for degradation itself, or does it simply lose its function without RLP4? This would provide further insight into the mechanism of action of the effectors.</p>
<p>(4) Clarification on specificity and evolutionary claims:</p>
<p>The paper's most significant claim is that the effectors from both whiteflies and planthoppers &quot;independently evolved&quot; to target RLP4. While the functional data is compelling, this evolutionary claim would be more convincing with stronger evidence. Showing that two different effector proteins target the same host protein is a fascinating finding but without a robust phylogenetic analysis, the claim of independent evolution is not fully supported. It would be valuable to provide a more detailed evolutionary analysis, such as a phylogenetic tree of the effector proteins, showing their relationship to other known insect proteins, to definitively rule out a shared, but highly divergent, common ancestor.</p>
<p>(5) Role of SOBIR1 in the interaction:</p>
<p>The results suggest that the effectors disrupt the RLP4/SOBIR1 complex. It is not entirely clear if the effectors are specifically targeting RLP4, SOBIR1, or both. Further experiments, such as a co-immunoprecipitation assay with just RLP4 and the effector, could clarify if the effector can bind to RLP4 in the absence of SOBIR1. This would help to definitively place RLP4 as the primary target.</p>
<p>(6) Transcriptome analysis (Lines 130-143):</p>
<p>The transcriptome analysis section feels disconnected from the rest of the manuscript. The findings, or lack thereof, from this analysis do not seem to be directly linked to the other major conclusions of the paper. This section could be removed to improve the manuscript's overall focus and flow. If the authors believe this data is critical, they should more clearly and explicitly connect the conclusions of the transcriptome analysis to the core findings about the effector-RLP4 interaction.</p>
<p>(7) Signal peptide experiments (Lines 145 and beyond):</p>
<p>The experiments conducted with the signal peptide (SP) are questionable. The SP is typically cleaved before the protein reaches its final destination. As such, conducting experiments with the SP attached to the protein may have produced biased observations and could lead to unjustified conclusions about the protein's function within the plant cell. We suggest the authors remove the experiments that include the signal peptide.</p>
<p>(8) Overly strong conclusion and unclear evidence (Line 176):</p>
<p>The use of the word &quot;must&quot; on line 176 is very strong and presents a definitive conclusion without sufficient evidence. The authors state that the proteins must interact with SOBIR1, but they do not provide a clear justification for this claim. Is SOBIR1 the only interaction partner for NtRLP4? The authors should provide a specific reason for focusing on SOBIR1 instead of demonstrating an interaction with NtRLP4 first. Additionally, do BtRDP or NlSP694 also interact with SOBIR1 directly? The authors should either tone down their language to reflect the evidence or provide a clearer justification for this strong claim.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors tested an interesting hypothesis that white flies and planthoppers independently evolved salivary proteins to dampen plant immunity by targeting a receptor-like protein.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors used a wide range of methods to dissect the function of the white fly protein BtRDP and identify its host target NtRLP4.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Serious concerns about protein work.</p>
<p>I did not find the indicated protein bands for anti-BtRDP in Figures 1a and 1b in the original blot pictures shown in Figure S30. In Figure 1a, I can't get the point of showing an unspecific protein band with a size of ~190 kD as a loading control for a protein of ~ 30 kD.</p>
<p>The data discrepancy led me to check other Western blot pictures. Similarly, Figures 2d, 3b, 3d, and S15b (anti-Myc) do not correspond to the original blots shown. In addition, the anti-Myc blot in Figure 4i, all blot pictures in Figures 5b, 5h, and S19a appeared to be compressed vertically. These data raised concerns about the quality of the manuscript.</p>
<p>Blots shown in Figure 3d, 4f, 4g, and 4h appeared to be done at a different exposure rate compared to the complete blot shown in Figure S30. The undesirable connection between Western blot pictures shown in the figures and the original data might be due to the reduced quality of compressed figures during submission. Nevertheless, clarification will be necessary to support the strength of the data provided.</p>
<p>(2) Misinterpretation of data.</p>
<p>I am afraid the authors misunderstood pattern-triggered immunity through receptor-like proteins. It is true that several LRR-type RLPs constitutively associate with SOBIR1, and further recruit BAK1 or other SERKs upon ligand binding. One should not take it for granted that every RLP works this way. To test the hypothesis that NtRLP4 confers resistance to B.tabaci infestation, the author compared transcriptional profiles between an EV plant line and an RLP4 overexpression line. If I understood the methods and figure legends correctly, this was done without B. tabaci treatment. This experimental design is seriously flawed. To provide convincing genetic evidence, independent mutant lines (optionally independent overexpression lines) in combination with different treatments will be necessary. Otherwise, one can only conclude that overexpressing the RLP4 protein generated a nervous plant. In addition, ROS burst, but not H2O2 accumulation, is a common immune response in pattern-triggered immunity.</p>
<p>(3) Lack of logic coherence.</p>
<p>The written language needs substantial improvement. This impeded the readability of the work. More importantly, the logic throughout the manuscript appeared scattered. The choice of testing protein domains for protein-protein interactions, using plants overexpressing an insect protein to study its subcellular localization, switching back and forth between using proteins with signal peptides and without signal peptides, among others, lacks a clear explanation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Wang et al. investigate how herbivorous insects overcome plant receptor-mediated immunity by targeting plant receptor-like proteins. The authors identify two independently evolved salivary effectors, BtRDP in whiteflies and NlSP694 in brown planthoppers, that promote the degradation of plant RLP4 through the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway. NtRLP4 from tobacco and OsRLP4 from rice are shown to confer resistance against herbivores by activating defense signaling, while BtRDP and NlSP694 suppress these defenses by destabilizing RLP4 proteins.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work highlights a convergent evolutionary strategy in distinct insect lineages and advances our understanding of insect-plant coevolution at the molecular level.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) I found the naming of BtRDP and NlSP694 somewhat confusing. The authors defined BtRDP as &quot;B. tabaci RLP-degrading protein,&quot; whereas NlSP694 appears to have been named after the last three digits of its GenBank accession number (MF278694, presumably). Is there a standard convention for naming newly identified proteins, for example, based on functional motifs or sequence characteristics? As it stands, the inconsistency makes it difficult for readers to clearly distinguish these proteins from those reported in other studies.</p>
<p>(2) Figure 2 and other figures. Transgenic experiments require at least two independent lines, because results from a single line may be confounded by position effects or unintended genomic alterations, and multiple lines provide stronger evidence for reproducibility and reliability.</p>
<p>(3) Figure 3e. Quantitative analysis of NtRLP4 was required. Additionally, since only one band was observed in oeRLP, were any tags included in the construct?</p>
<p>(4) Figure 4a. The RNAi effect appears to be well rescued in Line 1 but poorly in Line 2. Could the authors clarify the reason for this difference?</p>
<p>(5) ROS accumulation is shown for only a single leaf. A quantitative analysis of ROS accumulation across multiple samples would be necessary to support the conclusion. The same applies to Figure 16f.</p>
<p>(6) Figure 4f: NtRLP4 abundance was significantly reduced in oeBtRDP plants but not in oeBtRDP-SP. Although coexpression analysis suggests that BtRDP promotes NtRLP4 degradation in an ubiquitin-dependent manner, the reduced NtRLP4 levels may not result from a direct interaction between BtRDP and NtRLP4. It is possible that BtRDP influences other factors that indirectly affect NtRLP4 abundance. The authors should discuss this possibility.</p>
<p>(7) The statement in lines 335-336 that 'Overexpression of NtRLP4 or NtSOBIR1 enhances insect feeding, while silencing of either gene exerts the opposite effect' is not supported by the results shown in Figures S16-S19. The authors should revise this description to accurately reflect the data.</p>
<p>(8) BtRDP is reported to attach to the salivary sheath. Does the planthopper NlSP694 exhibit a similar secretion localization (e.g., attachment to the salivary sheath)? The authors should supplement this information or discuss the potential implications of any differences in secretion localization between BtRDP and NlSP694 for their respective modes of action.</p>
