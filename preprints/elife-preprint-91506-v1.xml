<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Allosteric cooperativity between ATP and substrates is a prominent characteristic of the cAMP-dependent catalytic (C) subunit of protein kinase A (PKA). Not only this long-range synergistic action is involved in substrate recognition and fidelity, but it is likely to regulate PKA association with regulatory subunits and other binding partners. To date, a complete understanding of the molecular determinants for this intramolecular mechanism is still lacking.</p>
<p>Here, we used an integrated NMR-restrained molecular dynamics simulations and a Markov Model to characterize the free energy landscape and conformational transitions of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA-C). We found that the apo-enzyme populates a broad free energy basin featuring a conformational ensemble of the active state of PKA-C (ground state) and other basins with lower populations (excited states). The first excited state corresponds to a previously characterized inactive state of PKA-C with the αC helix swinging outward. The second excited state displays a disrupted hydrophobic packing around the regulatory (R) spine, with a flipped configuration of the F100 and F102 residues at the tip of the αC-β4 loop. To experimentally validate the second excited state, we mutated F100 into alanine and used NMR spectroscopy to characterize the binding thermodynamics and structural response of ATP and a prototypical peptide substrate. While the activity of PKA-C<sup>F100A</sup> toward a prototypical peptide substrate is unaltered and the enzyme retains its affinity for ATP and substrate, this mutation rearranges the αC-β4 loop conformation interrupting the allosteric coupling between nucleotide and substrate. The highly conserved αC-β4 loop emerges as a pivotal element able to modulate the synergistic binding between nucleotide and substrate and may affect PKA signalosome. These results may explain how insertion mutations within this motif affect drug sensitivity in other homologous kinases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Eukaryotic protein kinases (EPKs) are plastic enzymes of paramount importance to signaling processes, catalyzing phosphoryl transfer reactions, or acting as scaffolds for other enzymes and/or binding partners <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Of all kinases, the catalytic subunit of PKA (PKA-C) was the first to be structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> In its inhibited state, PKA-C forms a heterotetrametric complex comprising two catalytic (C) and two regulatory (R) subunits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> The canonical activation mechanism of PKA involves binding two cAMP molecules and disassembling the holoenzyme, which unleashes active PKA-C monomers that target signaling partners.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> In 1997, however, Scott and coworkers suggested that the holoenzyme does not disassemble under physiological conditions; rather, the intact holo-enzyme forms <italic>signaling islands</italic> localized by A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) in the proximity of substrates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>X-ray crystallography studies revealed that PKA-C is a bilobal enzyme, with a dynamic N-terminal lobe comprising β-sheets and the αC helix and a more rigid C-terminal lobe, with mostly α-helices (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> The N-lobe harbors the nucleotide-binding site, whereas the substrate binding cleft lays at the interface between the N-lobe and C-lobe. The three-dimensional structure of the enzyme features a highly conserved hydrophobic core decorated by catalytically important motifs, <italic>i.e.</italic>, the Gly-rich loop, DFG-loop, activation loop, positioning loop, and magnesium and peptide positioning loops.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> In the catalytically active state, these motifs are all poised for phosphoryl transfer. However, the conformation of these motifs is necessary but not sufficient to define an active kinase. More recent studies revealed a critical role of the hydrophobic core, which is crossed by a catalytic (C) spine, a regulatory (R) spine, and shell residues (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> The C spine comprises an array of hydrophobic residues and is assembled upon binding ATP, whereas the R spine is engaged when the activation loop is phosphorylated, which contributes to the positioning of the αC-helix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>A distinct property of PKA-C is the binding cooperativity between ATP and substrate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> During the catalytic cycle, the kinase recognizes and binds substrates with positive binding cooperativity between ATP and unphosphorylated substrates, whereas a negative binding cooperativity between ADP and phosphorylated substrate characterizes the exit complex.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> The biological importance of binding cooperativity has been emphasized by our recent studies on disease-driven mutations of PKA-C,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> which all feature disrupted cooperativity between nucleotides and protein kinase inhibitor (PKI) or typical substrates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> Since the recognition sequence of the substrate is highly homologous to the regulatory subunits,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> a loss of cooperativity of binding may affect not only substrate binding fidelity but also the regulation by the R subunit. However, the molecular determinants for the binding cooperativity between ATP and substrate and its role in PKA signalosome remain elusive to date.</p>
<p>Here, we combined NMR-restrained replica-averaged metadynamics (RAM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> and Markov State Model (MSM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> to define the conformational landscape and the corresponding dynamics of PKA-C. We found that both the apo kinase and the nucleotide-bound kinase occupy three distinct basins: (<italic>i</italic>) a most populated ground state with constitutively active conformations competent for catalysis, (<italic>ii</italic>) a first high free energy basin representative of typical inactive states with a dislodged configuration of the αC helix, and (<italic>iii</italic>) a second high free energy basin with a disrupted hydrophobic array of residues at the core of the enzyme. Notably, the equilibrium between the most populated ground state and the other low-populated states agrees with previous NMR relaxation dispersion and CEST measurements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> To compound the existence of the second inactive basin, we mutated F100 at the tip of the αC-β4 loop into Ala (PKA-C<sup>F100A</sup>) and characterized its binding thermodynamics and ligand binding response by isothermal titration calorimetry and NMR spectroscopy. We found that PKA-C<sup>F100A</sup> phosphorylates canonical peptides and preserves the binding affinity for both nucleotide and substrate. However, PKA-C<sup>F100A</sup> lacks binding cooperativity between nucleotide and substrate. NMR revealed that perturbing the hydrophobic packing around the αC-β4 loop interrupts the allosteric communication between the two lobes of the enzyme. These results further support the pivotal role of the αC-β4 loop in kinases function and may explain why single-site mutations or insertion mutations in the homologous kinase that stabilize this motif result in oncogenes and confer different drug sensitivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup></p>

<title>The free energy landscape of PKA-C charted by NMR-restrained replica-averaged metadynamics (RAM) simulations</title>
<p>To characterize the experimentally accessible conformational landscape of PKA-C in the µs-to-ms range, we performed NMR-restrained metadynamics simulations within the RAM framework.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> We simulated the apo, binary (PKA-C/ATP), and ternary (PKA-C/ATP/PKI5-24) forms of PKA-C, using four replicas restrained using backbone chemical shifts (CS) to ensure a close agreement with conformational space explored by the kinase under the conditions used in this work. The enhanced sampling was achieved through bias-exchange metadynamics along different collective variables (CVs) to boost the conformational plasticity of the enzyme (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2 - figure supplement 1</xref></bold>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> Back-calculation of the CS using the Sparta+ software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> shows that the CS restraints improved the agreement between back-calculated and experimental CS. Specifically, we obtained an overall improvement of ∼0.2 ppm on the amide N atom and ∼0.1 ppm on the remainder backbone atoms (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2 - figure supplement 2</xref></bold>). The bias-exchange metadynamics allowed for each replica to span a broader conformational space relative to classical simulations (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2 - figure supplement 3</xref></bold>). The deposition of Gaussian biases required by the metadynamics approach converged after 300 ns, where the fluctuations along the first 3 CVs were less than 1 kcal/mol (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2 - figure supplement 4</xref></bold>). The converged bias revealed that the <italic>apo</italic> kinase accesses multiple minima along each CV, and the conformational heterogeneity is significantly reduced upon ligand binding, especially in the ternary form (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). The full free energy landscape was then reconstructed by sampling an extra 100 ns production phase with reduced biases along each CV. The free energy landscape shows how the population of the conformers is modulated by ligands within the NMR detection limit of sparsely populated states (∼ 0.5% or ΔG &lt; 3.2 kcal/mol).</p>

<p>According to these simulations, apo PKA-C populates preferentially a ground state and five readily accessible low-populated excited states (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2tbl1">Figure 2 – supplementary table 1</xref></bold>). The nucleotide-bound PKA-C (binary form) features a similar ground state and a broad higher energy basin (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2tbl1">Figure 2 – supplementary table 1</xref></bold>). Finally, the ternary complex occupies a narrow dominant ground state (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2tbl1">Figure 2 – supplementary table 1</xref></bold>). This free energy landscape obtained from the RAM simulations is consistent with the qualitative picture previously inferred from our NMR spin relaxation experiments,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> while providing a detailed structural characterization of the excited states.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>MSM reveals the conformational transitions of PKA-C from ground to high free energy (excited) states</title>
<p>To explore the conformational transitions of the kinase upon ligand binding, we performed additional unbiased sampling to build a Markov State Model (MSM). MSMs are commonly used to describe the dynamic transitions of macromolecules in terms of (1) the probabilities of occupation of a specific set of states and (2) the transition probabilities of moving between these states. In practice, a MSM is typically created by combining thousands of short unbiased simulations. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> Following this strategy, we performed several short simulations (10 – 20 ns) using thousands of the low free energy conformations (ΔG &lt; 3.2 kcal/mol) chosen randomly from the three forms of PKA-C as starting structures. The conformational ensembles were clustered into microstates and seeded to start a second round of adaptive sampling (see Methods). The iterative process was repeated three times to assure convergence and yielded a total of 100 μs trajectories for both the apo and binary forms, whereas for the less dynamic ternary complex, we collected trajectories of 60 μs. Once we reached a sufficient sampling, we built a MSM including L95, V104, L106, M118, M120, Y164, and F185 to investigate the dynamic transitions of the hydrophobic R spine and shell residues (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3 – figure supplement 1</xref></bold>). These residues are ideal reporters of the dynamic processes governing the activation/deactivation of the kinase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> To compare the free energy landscape of different complexes, we first projected the conformational ensembles of three forms and existing crystal structures along the first two time-lagged independent components (tICs) of the <italic>apo</italic> form, which were obtained by a time-lagged independent component analysis (tICA) analysis (see Methods). These tICs represent the directions of the slowest motion of the kinase and visualize the conformational transitions of V104, L95, and F185 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3 – figure supplement 1</xref></bold>). Apo PKA-C accesses three major basins. The broadest basin represents the ground state (GS) and represents the conformations of the kinase captured by essentially all crystal structures (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). Additionally, there are two distinct excited states: the first excited state (ES1) features a disrupted hydrophobic packing of L95, V104, and F185. This conformation features an inactive state with an orientation of the αC-helix typical of the inhibited states as found for the PKA-C bound to regulatory subunits RIα and RIIβ. The second excited state (ES2), to our knowledge, was never captured in crystal structures. The ES2 state displays a flipped configuration of the V104 side chain and a rearrangement of the αC-β4 loop, with the dihedral angles of F100 and F102 adopting a gauche<sup>+</sup> configuration. This orientation of the F100 and F102 aromatic rings breaks the hydrophobic packing of the αC-β4 loop with the C-lobe, causing steric contacts between F100 and V104 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). In contrast, the active GS ensemble features a <italic>trans</italic> configuration of the F100 and F102 side chains that stabilizes the hydrophobic interactions with αE- and αJ-helices in the C-lobe (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). Upon binding ATP, the conformational space span by the kinase becomes narrower, and the conformers populate mostly the GS, with a small fraction in the ES1 state (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>). This is consistent with the role of the nucleotide as an allosteric effector, enhancing the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate. In the ternary form (ATP and PKI-bound), PKA-C populates only the GS consistent with the competent conformation observed in the first ternary complex structure. In this case, the αC-β4 loop of the enzyme is locked in a well-defined configuration, as shown in <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>.</p>

<title>The F100A mutation disrupts the allosteric network of the kinase</title>
<p>The above analysis suggests that F100 located at the αC-β4 loop is critical for the GS to ES1 transition path of the kinase. Therefore, we modeled the F100A mutant and analyzed its dynamic trajectories. First, we performed a short equilibration using classical MD simulations starting from the coordinates of the X-ray structure of the ternary complex (PDB ID: 4WB5). During 1 μs of MD simulations, the αC-β4 loop of the F100A mutant undergoes a significant motion as manifested by the increased values of the backbone rmsd and the conformational transition (flipping) of the F102 side chain (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref></bold>). This region in the WT PKA-C adopts a stable β-turn in the WT, with a persistent H-bond between the backbone oxygen of F100 and the amide hydrogen of L103. In the simulation of F100A, H-bond is formed more frequently between A100 and F102, and this region adopts a γ- turn conformation. Such local rearrangement disrupts the hydrogen bond between N99 and Y156 of αE, altering the anchoring of the αC-β4 to the αE helix (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>In the F100A mutant, the local changes caused by the αC-β4 loop structural transitions propagate and alter the response of the nucleotide binding as shown on the rmsd changes for key hydrophobic motifs such as the R- and C- spines and shell residues (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref></bold>). While the nucleotide binding decreases the average RMSD for these hydrophobic motifs for WT PKA-C, it stabilizes only the C-spine and fails to drive the R-spine and shell residues to an intermediate state competent for substrate binding (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref></bold>). The latter can be attributed to the perturbation of hydrophobic packing of L95, L106 of R-spine, and V104 of the shell residues close to the mutation site. Using the lowest principal components, we also analyzed the global dynamic response to ATP binding. Not only does F100A change the breathing mode of the two lobes (PC1), but it also alters the shearing motion (PC2) of the kinase, emphasizing the importance of this allosteric mutation on the internal communication across the hydrophobic core (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C-E</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>To determine the global response to ligand binding for WT and F100A, we analyzed the chemical shifts of the amide fingerprints of the two proteins using the COordiNated ChemIcal Shifts bEhavior (CONCISE).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> CONCISE describes the global response of the protein fingerprint resonances by providing the probability density (population) of each state along the conformational equilibrium for binding phenomena that follow linear chemical shift trajectories. For PKA-C<sup>WT</sup>, both nucleotide and pseudosubstrate binding shift the overall population of the residues from an open to an intermediate and a fully closed state (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10 – figure supplement 1</xref></bold>). A similar trend is observed for PKA-C<sup>F100A</sup>, though the probability densities are broader, indicating that the amide resonances follow a less coordinated response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> Also, the maximum probability density for the closed state shows that the ternary complex of the mutant is slightly more open than the corresponding wild-type (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10 – figure supplement 1</xref></bold>). Overall, the shape of the probability distributions of the amide chemical shifts suggests that several residues do not respond in a coordinated manner and that PKI5-24 binding shifts the conformation of the kinase toward a partially closed state, which may explain the loss in binding cooperativity as previously observed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>To analyze these coordinated chemical shift changes in detail and define the allosteric network of the kinase upon binding ligands and substrate, we utilized the CHEmical Shift Covariance Analysis (CHESCA),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> a statistical method that identifies correlated responses of residues to a specific perturbation.

The CHESCA matrix of PKA-C<sup>F100A</sup> exhibits sparser and more attenuated (i.e., lower value of correlation coefficient) correlations relative to PKA-C<sup>WT</sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref></bold>). Although many inter-lobe correlations are still present for the mutant, several correlations in specific structural domains such as the αG-, αH-, and αI-helices are absent or attenuated. For instance, the F100A mutation does not display correlations between the αA-helix and the C-terminal tail. We also utilized the CHESCA maps to assess the allosteric communication among the communities as defined by McClendon <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> Using the community definition, the CHESCA map for PKA-C<sup>WT</sup> shows a strong correlation across the enzyme, especially for structurally adjacent communities and at the interface between the two lobes (see for instance the correlations among ComA, ComB, ComC, ComE, and ComH). The community CHESCA for F100A shows that the cross-talk between the nucleotide-binding (ComA) and positioning of αC-helix (ComB) is preserved, as well as the coupling between the R-spine assembly (ComC), and the activation loop (ComF). Except for ComD, the correlations among these communities in the N-lobe and ComF1, ComG, and Com H are completely abolished. Note that ComF1, ComG, and ComH are involved in the substrate binding and are instrumental in docking the R-subunits. Overall, the CHESCA analysis shows that the reduced degree of cooperativity we determined thermodynamically for PKA-C<sup>F100A</sup> corresponds to a decrease in coordinated structural changes upon ligand binding, and these changes affect the C-lobe communities involved in the substrate binding and protein/protein interactions.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A distinct feature of PKA-C is the binding cooperativity between nucleotide and substrate that originate from the allosteric coupling between the nucleotide-binding pocket and the interfacial region between the two lobes that harbors the substrate binding cleft. Structural and dynamic NMR data suggested that a well-tuned coupling between the two lobes of the kinase is required for efficient substrate binding. Also, additional NMR and functional studies showed that mutations in the activation loop linked to Cushing’s syndrome reduce drastically substrate binding affinity, and more importantly, reduce the communication between the ligand binding pockets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> Interestingly, a mutation (E31V) distal from the active site and linked to the progression of Cushing’s syndrome has a similar effect, suggesting a possible allosteric modulation of the kinase substrate recognition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> NMR chemical shift perturbation data suggested that these mutations are connected to allosteric nodes that, once perturbed, radiate their effects in the periphery of the enzyme and prevent an efficient dynamic coupling between the two lobes of the enzyme. Interestingly, these mutations do not prevent Kemptide phosphorylation. Rather, they cause a loss of substrate fidelity with consequent aberrant phosphorylation of downstream substrates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> Additionally, thermodynamics and recent NMR studies using different nucleotides and inhibitors demonstrated that it is possible to control substrate binding affinity by changing the chemistry of the ligand at the ATP binding pocket. Altogether, these studies suggest that phosphorylation reaction and binding synergy between ATP and substrates may be controlled independently.</p>
<p>Our NMR data combined with RAM simulations and MSM enabled us to comprehensively map the free energy landscape of PKA-C in various forms. We found that the active kinase unleashed from the regulatory subunits occupies a broad energy basin (GS) that corresponds to the conformation of the ternary structure of PKA-C with ATP and pseudosubstrate (PKI5-24) that exemplifies a catalytic competent state, poised for phosphoryl transfer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> We also found two orthogonal conformationally excited states ES1 and ES2. While the ES1 state corresponds to the inactive kinase conformations, the ES2 state was never observed in the crystallized structures. Our previous CEST NMR measurements suggested the presence of a sparsely populated state that, at that time, we were unable to characterize structurally. These new simulations and MSM show that the transition from GS to ES2 is due to a disruption of hydrophobic packing, featuring a conformational rearrangement for the αC-β4 loop, which causes a partial disruption of the hydrophobic R-spine. These structural changes interrupt the allosteric coupling between the two lobes, as shown by mutual information analysis. A single mutation (F100A), suggested by our simulations, promotes the flip of the αC-β4 loop and reproduces the hypothesized structural uncoupling between the two lobes of PKA-C. We experimentally tested the effects of the F100A mutations and found that it prevents the enzyme from adopting a conformation competent for substrate binding, resulting in a drastic reduction of the cooperativity between ATP and nucleotide. These NMR data further support our working model, showing that the inter-lobe communication is interrupted and the binding response of the F100A kinase is attenuated based on chemical shift perturbation. Furthermore, our study further emphasizes the active role of the hydrophobic interior of the kinase and shows that small alterations in the spines and shell sequences may lead to a dysfunctional kinase by either preventing phosphorylation (see V104G and I150A mutations)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> or by disrupting the binding cooperativity as for F100A.</p>
<p>The αC-β4 loop is a regulatory element present in all EPKs and its importance has been stressed in bioinformatics studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> and supported by computational work, showing that F100 and F102 are at intersections of various communities and constitute a critical hydrophobic node, anchoring the N- to the C-lobe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> More importantly, studies on EGFR and ErbB2 kinases lead to the hypothesis that the αC-β4 loop may act as a molecular brake <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> or an autoinhibitory switch.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> Therefore, it is not surprising that activating mutations and in-frame insertions in the αC-β4 loop are frequently found in kinase-related cancers, such as somatic oncogenic mutations such as P101S, P101L, and L103F.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> Finally, an elegant study by Kannan and coworkers emphasized the role of the αC-β4 loop in dimerization of EGFR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> These researchers found that in-frame insertions rigidify and activate the kinase in a length dependent manner. More importantly, these human mutations display a gradual response to drugs, a factor that may exploited for designing mutant-selective inhibitors of EGFR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> The data presented here show that it is possible to abolish the binding cooperativity of a kinase by turning the dial in the opposite direction, <italic>i.e.</italic>, increasing the dynamics of the αC-β4 loop and disconnecting the allosteric network between the N- and C-lobes. The identification of this new, partially inactivating pathway provides further understanding of how to control the dynamics and function of kinases.</p>

<label>I</label><title>System setup</title>
<p>We used the crystal structure of the wild type PKA-C (PDB ID: 1ATP) as the template and added the missing residues 1-14 at the N terminus. The protonation state of histidine residues followed our previous settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> The protein was solvated in a rhombic dodecahedron solvent box with the tree-point charge TIP3P model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> for water extended approximately 10 Å away from the surface of the proteins. Counter ions (K<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup>) were added to ensure electrostatic neutrality corresponding to an ionic concentration of ∼ 150 mM. All protein covalent bonds were constrained with the LINCS algorithm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> and long-range electrostatic interactions are treated with the particle-mesh Ewald method with a real-space cut-off of 10 Å.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> Parallel simulations on the apo form, the binary form with one Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion and one ATP, and the ternary form with two Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions, one ATP and one PKI5-24 are performed simultaneously using GROMACS 4.6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> with CHARMM36a1 force field.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> For the two mutants, F100A and V104G, the corresponding residues were mutated through the mutagenesis wizard of PYMOL.</p>

<label>II</label><title>Standard MD simulations</title>
<p>Each system was minimized using the steepest decent algorithm to remove the bad contacts, and then gradually heated to 300 K at a constant volume over 1 ns, using harmonic restraints with a force constant 1000 kJ/(mol *Å<sup>2</sup>) on heavy atoms of both proteins and nucleotides. Over the following 12 ns of simulations at constant pressure (1 atm) and temperature (300 K), the restraints were gradually released. The systems were equilibrated for an additional 20 ns without positional restraints. A Parrinello-Rahman barostat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> was used to keep the pressure constant, while a V-rescale thermostat <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> with a time step of 2 fs was used to keep the temperature constant. Each system was simulated for 1.05 µs, with snapshots recorded every 20 ps.</p>

<label>III</label><title>Replica exchange (REX) simulations</title>
<p>Following the standard MD simulations, parallel replica exchange (REX) simulations on the apo, binary and ternary form of PKA-C were set up. For each REX simulations, four replicas were used, and the initial structures were randomly chosen from the µs-scale unbiased simulations. Chemical shifts of PKA-C for N, CA, CO, CB, HN from NMR experiments were imposed as restraints based on the penalty function

All other settings are the same as the previous unbiased simulations. REX simulations were carried out with GROMACS 4.6,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> with the replica exchange controlled by the module PLUMED 2.1.1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> These simulations were further conducted ∼100 ns for each replica of the three forms.</p>

<sec id="s4a4">
<label>IV</label><title>Replica-averaged metadynamics (RAM) simulations</title>
<p>The subsequent RAM simulations were started from the final structures of REX simulations. The CS restraints were imposed in the same way as the REX simulations. Four CVs are chosen to increase the conformational plasticity around the catalytic cores (detailed in Figure S1): (CVI) the ψ angles of backbone of all the loops that are not in contact with ATP (Back-far), (CVII) the ϕ angles of backbone of all the loops that are in contact with ATP (Back-close), (CVIII) the χ1 angles of side-chains of all the loops that are in contact with ATP (Side-close), (CVIV) the radius of gyration calculated over the rigid part (<italic>i.e.</italic>, residues 50-300) of the protein (rgss). Gaussian deposition rate was performed with an initial rate of 0.125 kJ/mol/ps, where the σ values were set to 0.5, 0.2, 0.2, and 0.01 nm for the four CVs, respectively. The RAM simulations were also carried out with GROMACS 4.6 in conjunction with PLUMED 2.1 and ALMOST 2.1, and continued for ∼400 ns for each replica, with exchange trails every 1 ps.</p>

<label>V</label><title>Reconstruction of free energy surface (FES) from the RAM simulations</title>
<p>After about 300 ns, the sampling along the first 3 CVs reached convergence, allowing a reliable reconstruction of the corresponding FES. The production run was continued for another 100 ns to sample enough conformations. These conformations were first clustered into microstates using the regular spatial method (cut-off radius of 0.13), and then the free energy of each state is reweighted according to the deposited potential along each CV, which can be obtained from the analysis module of METAGUI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup> To visualize the distribution of these microstates and their relative energies differences, we further performed principal component analysis to project the microstates represented in the 3-dimennsional CV space into 2-dimensional space spanned by PC1 and PC2. Then we can plot these microstates in a 3-dimensional space spanned by PC1, PC2 and free energy differences <italic>ΔG</italic>.</p>

<label>VI</label><title>Independent validation of chemical shifts with SPARTA+</title>
<p>During the REX and RAM simulations, chemical shifts were computed via CamShift in ALMOST 2.1. As an independent validation for the efficacy of the bias, we further calibrated chemical shifts of 2000 snapshots with MDTraj<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup> and SPARTA+.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup></p>

<label>VII</label><title>Adaptive sampling</title>
<p>The first round of adaptive sampling started from the snapshots of low-energy microstates obtained from the previous step, <italic>i.e.</italic>, 1200 structures for the apo form, 400 structures for the binary form and 200 structures for the ternary form. The initial velocities were randomly generated to satisfy the Maxwell distribution at 300K. For the apo form, a 10 ns simulation was performed for each run, whereas for the binary, each simulation lasted 30 ns, resulting in a total of 12 μs trajectories for both the apo and binary forms. To obtain converged free energy landscape, a total of three rounds of adaptive sampling was started from the 400 microstates that was obtained by K-mean clustering of all snapshots of previous ensembles. Therefore, a total of 100 µs trajectories and 100,0000 snapshots (100 ps per frame) were collected for both the apo and binary form after three rounds of adaptive sampling, and a total of 60 µs trajectories were collected for the ternary form.</p>

<label>VIII</label><title>Markov state model (MSM) and time-lagged independent component analysis (tICA)</title>
<p>The Cartesian coordinates of key hydrophobic residues, include R-spine residues, L95, L106, Y164 and F185, and the shell residues, V104, M118 and M120, were chosen as the metrics to characterize the conformational transition of the hydrophobic core of PKA-C. Specifically, each snapshot was first aligned to the same reference structure by superimposition of αE (residues 140-160) and αF helices (residues 217-233), and represented by the deviation of Cartesian coordinates of the key residues. The representation in this metric space was further reduced to 10-dimension vectors using time-lagged independent component analysis (tICA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup> at a lag time of 1 ns. All the snapshots were clustered into 400 microstates with K-mean clustering. A MSM was built upon the transition counts between these microstates.</p>

<title>Kinetic Monte Carlo trajectory of PKA-C in different forms</title>
<p>Long trajectories were generated using a kinetic Monte Carlo method based on the MSM transition probability matrix of the three forms of PKA-C. Specifically, the discrete jumps between the 100 microstates were sampled for 60 us. And then random conformations were chosen for each state from all the available snapshots. Time series of various order parameters were analyzed subsequently.</p>

<title>CHEmical Shift Covariance Analysis (CHESCA)</title>
<p>This analysis was used to identify and functionally characterize allosteric networks of residues eliciting concerted responses to, in this case, nucleotide and pseudosubstrate. To identify inter-residue correlations, four states were used: apo, ATPγN-bound, ADP-bound, and ATPγN/PKI5–24. The identification of inter-residue correlations by CHESCA relies on agglomerative clustering (AC) and singular value decomposition (SVD). Pairwise correlations between chemical shift variations experienced by different residues were calculated to identify networks. When plotted on a correlation matrix, this allows for the identification of regions that are correlated to one another. For each residue, the maximum change in chemical shift was calculated in both the <sup>1</sup>H (<italic>x</italic>) and <sup>15</sup>N (<italic>y</italic>) dimensions (Δδ<italic>x,y</italic>). The residues included in the CHESCA analysis were the ones that satisfied the following: Δδx,y &gt; ½ <italic>Δν</italic>x<italic>A</italic>,y<italic>A</italic>+½ <italic>Δν</italic>x<italic>B</italic>,y<italic>B</italic>, where A and B correspond to two different forms analyzed (note that there is no dependence on which two forms satisfied this statement), and Δν denotes the linewidth. Correlation scores were used to quantify the CHESCA correlation of a single residue or a group of residues with another group. Correlation scores were evaluated for both (a) a single residue and (b) the full protein. The generalized expression for evaluating either case is:

where <italic>RiJ</italic> is the CHESCA correlation matrix and <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> denote (a) a single residue and all other assigned residues in the protein, respectively, or (b) both represent all the assigned residues in the protein. For all the analysis a <italic>Rcutoff</italic> of 0.98 was used.</p>
<p>Community CHESCA analysis is a chemical shift-based correlation map between functional communities within the kinase. Each community is a group of residues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> associated with a function or regulatory mechanism. To represent community-based CHESCA analysis, we lowered the correlation cut-off such that <italic>Rcutoff</italic> &gt; 0.8.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors use insights into the dynamics of the PKA kinase domain, obtained by NMR experiments, to inform MD simulations that generate an energy landscape of PKA kinase domain conformational dynamics.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors integrate strong experimental data through the use of state-of-the-art MD studies and derive detailed insights into allosteric communication in PKA kinase. Comparison of wt kinase with a mutant (F100A) shows clear differences in the allosteric regulation of the two proteins. These differences can be rationalized by NMR and MD results.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The very detailed insights gained by the authors into allosteric regulation require very specialized techniques in this study. This poses a challenge to communicate the methods, the results, and the meaning of the results to a broader audience. In some places, the authors overcome this challenge better than in others.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this study, Olivieri &amp; Wang et.al. probe the role of the conserved alphaC-beta4 loop in the allosteric regulation of the PKA catalytic subunit. The authors employ a combination of NMR-restrained molecular dynamics simulations and mutational analysis to uncover the conformational transitions between distinct excited states and identify a pivotal role for the alphaC-beta4 loop in facilitating these conformational transitions. These studies support previous models proposing the alphaC-beta4 loop as a critical element in kinase conformational regulation. Overall, this is a timely and fitting study.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
1. Exciting application of NMR and MD to explore hidden conformation states of kinases.</p>
<p>
2. Novel mechanistic insights into the role of the alphaC-beta4 loop in PKA.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
1. While the alphaC-beta4 loop is a conserved feature of protein kinases, the residues within this loop vary across various kinase families and groups, enabling group and family-specific control of activity through cis and trans acting elements. F102 in PKA interacts with co-conserved residues in the C-tail, which has been proposed to function as a cis regulatory element. The authors should elaborate on the conformational changes in the C-tail, particularly in the arginine that packs against F102, in the results and discussion. This would further extend the impact and scope of the manuscript, which is currently confined to PKA.</p>
<p>
2. The MD data and conformational states would be a valuable resource for the community and should be shared via some open-source repositories.</p>
<p>
3. The authors state that ES1 and ES2 states are novel and not observed in previous crystal structures. The authors should quantify this through comparisons with PKA inactive states and with other AGC kinases.</p>
<p>
4. Based on the results, can the authors speculate on the impact of oncogenic mutations in the alphaC-beta4 loop mutations in PKA?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Combining several MD simulation techniques (NMR-constrained replica-exchange metadynamics, Markov State Model, and unbiased MD) the authors identified the aC-beta4 loop of PKA kinase as a switch crucially involved in PKA nucleotide/substrate binding cooperatively. They identified a previously unreported excited conformational state of PKA (ES2), this switch controls and characterized ES2 energetics with respect to the ground state. Based on translating the simulations into chemical shits and NMR characterizing of PKA WT and an aC-beta4 mutant, the author made a convincing case in arguing that the simulation-suggested excited state is indeed an excited state observed by NMR, thus giving the excited state conformational details.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This work incorporates extensive simulation works, new NMR data, and in vitro biochemical analysis. It stands out in its comprehensiveness, and I think it made a great case.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The manuscript is somewhat difficult to read even for kinase experts, and even harder for the layman. The difficulty partially arises from mixing technical description of the simulations with structural interpretation of the results, which is more intuitive, and partially arises from the assumption that readers are familiar with kinase architecture and its key elements (the aC helix, the APE motif etc).</p>
