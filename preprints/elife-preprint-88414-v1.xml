<title>Abstract</title><p>While modern high efficacy disease modifying therapies have revolutionized the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, they are less effective at controlling progressive forms of the disease. Meningeal inflammation is a recognized risk factor for cortical grey matter pathology which can result in disabling symptoms such as cognitive impairment and depression, but the mechanisms linking meningeal inflammation and grey matter pathology remain unclear. Here, we performed MRI-guided spatial transcriptomics in a mouse model of autoimmune meningeal inflammation to characterize the transcriptional signature in areas of meningeal inflammation and the underlying brain parenchyma. We found broadly increased activity of inflammatory signaling pathways at sites of meningeal inflammation, but only a subset of these pathways active in the adjacent brain parenchyma. Sub-clustering of regions adjacent to meningeal inflammation revealed the subset of immune programs induced in brain parenchyma, notably the B cell mediated immune response and antigen processing/presentation. Trajectory gene and gene set modeling analysis confirmed variable penetration of immune signatures originating from meningeal inflammation into the adjacent brain tissue. This work contributes a valuable data resource to the field, provides the first detailed spatial transcriptomic characterization in a model of meningeal inflammation, and highlights several candidate pathways in the pathogenesis of grey matter pathology.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by a relapsing remitting and/or progressive course of demyelination, axonal injury, and neurologic dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Highly efficacious disease modifying therapies have revolutionized the prevention and treatment of MS relapses, but are less effective at stopping hallmarks of MS progression such as brain atrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Accumulating evidence points to a pivotal role for leptomeningeal inflammation (LMI) in contributing to this pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. LMI is found in all subtypes of MS, ranging histologically from disorganized collections of leukocytes to highly organized ectopic lymphoid follicles, and correlates with the presence of cortical grey matter demyelination, neurite loss, and decreased volume<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Grey matter pathology (GMP) has been linked to debilitating symptoms such as cognitive impairment and depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, and tends to occur in spatial relation to areas of LMI. Indeed, the most common grey matter lesion location is directly sub-pial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, and there is a gradient of increased pathology towards the surface of the brain in MS patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Interestingly, GMP occurs without local blood-brain barrier disruption or robust infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the brain parenchyma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. LMI is therefore speculated to be a source of pro-inflammatory molecules that contribute to GMP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, but the pathway(s) involved remain unknown.</p>
<p>Several putative mechanisms linking LMI to GMP have been proposed. Magliozzi and colleagues identified increased expression of numerous cytokines and chemokines, including interferon gamma (IFNÉ£), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-2, IL-22, CXCL13, and CXCL10, in the meninges and CSF of postmortem MS cases with high levels of meningeal inflammation and GM demyelination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Microarray analysis of cortical lesions from MS cases with LMI revealed a shift in TNF signaling from TNFR1/TNFR2 and NFkB-mediated anti-apoptotic pathways towards TNFR1- and RIPK3-mediated pro-apoptotic/pro-necroptotic pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. In marmoset and rat models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), sub-pial cortical lesions were found with prominent microglial activation and immunoglobulin deposition on myelin sheaths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Interestingly, complement deposition, one possible mechanism of immunoglobulin-related cellular injury, is not found in purely cortical grey matter lesions, in contrast to white or grey/white matter lesions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Numerous other mediators of injury, including reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, metabolic stress, and excitotoxicity have been proposed to drive neurodegeneration in MS and may be at play in GMP.</p>
<p>Previous attempts to characterize the relation between LMI and GMP have been limited by the absence of spatially resolved data, which therefore lacks critical information about the anatomic relationship between LMI and the underlying brain parenchyma. Here, we present a spatial transcriptomic dataset and analysis in a mouse model of relapsing/remitting CNS autoimmunity and meningeal inflammation, Swiss Jim Lambert (SJL) mouse EAE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Our prior work in SJL EAE demonstrated meningeal areas of gadolinium contrast enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that correspond histologically to collections of B cells, T cells, and myeloid cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. In the parenchyma adjacent to areas of meningeal inflammation we identified astrocytosis, activated microglia, demyelination and evidence of axonal stress and damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. This work characterizes the spatially resolved transcriptome of LMI in the SJL EAE model system, revealing the subset of genes and gene sets active in the LMI that extend into the adjacent parenchyma and providing insights into immune pathways that could underlie sub-pial neurodegeneration.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>SJL/J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories for all experiments. All mice were maintained in a federally approved animal facility at Johns Hopkins University in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Female mice aged 7â8 weeks were used in all experiments and were housed in the animal facility for at least 1 week prior to the start of experiments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Induction of SJL EAE</title>
<p>Female SJL/J mice were immunized subcutaneously at two sites over the lateral abdomen with 100 Î¼g PLP139-151 peptide with complete Freundâs adjuvant containing 4 Î¼g/ml <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> H37RA (Difco Laboratories). Mice were weighed and scored serially to document disease course. Scoring was performed using the following scale: 0, normal; 1, limp tail; 2, hind limb weakness; 3, hind limb paralysis; 4, hind limb and forelimb weakness; and 5, death.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>MRI imaging</title>
<p>At weeks 6, 8, and 10 post immunization, a horizontal 11.7 T scanner (Bruker BioSpin) with a triple-axis gradient system (maximum gradient strength = 740 mT/m), 72 mm volume transmit coil and 4-channel receive-only phased array coil was used to image the mouse forebrain. During imaging, mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane together with mixed air and oxygen (3:1 ratio) and respiration was monitored via a pressure sensor and maintained at 60 breaths/min. Before imaging, 0.1 ml diluted Magnevist<sup>Â®</sup> (gadopentetate dimeglumine, Bayer HealthCare LLC, 1:10 with PBS) was injected. Scans were then analyzed to identify areas of meningeal contrast enhancement by two independent examiners (P.B., S.K.). We counted the number of areas of meningeal contrast enhancement on each individual MRI slice and used the cumulative number to represent the amount of meningeal contrast enhancement. All quantifications were performed by at least two independent examiners and their scores were averaged.</p>

<title>Tissue preparation and spatial gene expression assay</title>
<p>At 12 weeks post-immunization, animals were euthanized in CO2 chamber and perfused with cold PBS. Brains were dissected and one hemisphere drop fixed in isopentane cooled on dry ice. Fresh frozen brain samples were then cut coronally at a thickness of 10Î¼m and placed on the capture area of Visium Gene Expression slides (v1; 10x Genomics). Each slide contained four 6.5 mm x 6.5 mm capture areas. Sample preparation was carried out according to manufacturerâs instructions. After fixation with methanol at -20C, Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining was performed for morphological analysis and spatial alignment of the sequencing data. After the enzymatic permeabilization, mRNA was captured by probes and cDNA generated. Barcoded cDNA was isolated using SPRIselect-cleanup (Beckman Coulter) and amplified. Amplified cDNA was fragmented and subjected to end-repair, poly-A-tailing, adaptor ligation, and 10x-specific sample indexing as per the manufacturerâs instructions. Following assessment of RNA quality, sequencing was performed using a Novaseq S2 100. Brains from four naÃ¯ve and four EAE mice were used to prepare 5 and 6 individual samples per group, respectively.</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title>Spatial transcriptomics data processing</title>
<p>Each sample went through identical quality control processing steps. SpaceRanger software (v.1.3.1) was used to pre-process the sequencing data, aligning to the mm10-2020A reference transcriptome. Feature barcoded expression matrixes were used as input for downstream spatial transcriptomics analysis using Seurat (v.4.3.0) and SPATA2 (v.0.1.0)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Data was loaded and analyzed using the Seurat, and all spots that were determined to not be over tissue were discarded using the filter.matrix option in Seuratâs Load10XSpatial function. Spots with less than 250 measured genes and less than 500 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) were filtered out. Data normalization and stabilization of sequence depth variance was performed on each sample using SCTransform with default parameters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Sample data was then annotated and combined into a merged object for downstream quality control and analysis. Dimensionality reduction was performed using principal component analysis (PCA), followed by computation of shared nearest neighbors of the first 10 principal components and cluster identification (resolution 0.3). To visualize all spots in a two-dimensional plot, a UMAP was created with Seuratâs RunUMAP function using the first 10 principal components. Cluster and sub-cluster enriched genes were identified with Wilcoxon tests as implemented in the FindMarkers function within Seurat. Differential gene expression between groups was attained using DESeq2 (v.1.38.2) on samples pseudobulked by biological replicate. Gene set enrichment analysis and visualization was performed using the gene ontology database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> and the clusterProfiler package (v.4.6.0)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Estimated signaling pathway activities were calculated for each spot with the top 500 genes of each pathway on SCTransformed data using the PROGENy package (v.1.20.0)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. For subclustering analysis, select clusters were subsetted before undergoing dimensionality reduction, neighbor calculation, cluster identification, marker identification, and gene set enrichment as described above. Trajectory gene and gene set modeling analysis was performed with the SPATA2 package.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Statistics and data visualization</title>
<p>Plots were generated and statistics calculated using R (v.4.2.2) and Rstudio (v.2022.07.2). Bar plots, box plots, MA plots, Venn diagram, and dot plots were produced with ggplot2 (v.3.4.0); heat maps were produced with pHeatmap (v.1.0.12); spatial feature plots and dimensionality reduction plots were produced with Seurat; tree plots were produced with clusterProfiler, and trajectory heatmaps were produced with SPATA2.</p>
<p>All reported P-values adjusted for multiple comparisons were corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> unless otherwise specified. The number of samples in the EAE and naÃ¯ve groups was chosen based on expected levels of variability in prior experiments.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We tracked the development of LMI during SJL EAE using contrast enhanced serial MRI imaging. MRI data was then used to target areas of LMI for spatial transcriptomics (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Mice developed a characteristic relapsing pattern of neurologic impairment, and contrast-enhanced MRI was performed at weeks 6, 8, and 10 post immunization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-C</xref>). In the SJL EAE model, contrast enhancing meningeal lesions are most frequently found in the intrapeduncular cistern, quadrigeminal cistern, and the cleft between the hippocampus and medial geniculate nucleus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Lesion number remained stable throughout the disease course independent of EAE score (Supplemental Figures 1A-B).</p>

<p>Brain slices were collected from four naÃ¯ve mice and four EAE mice 11 weeks post- immunization and used to prepare five and six samples for spatial transcriptomics, respectively. H&amp;E staining confirmed the presence of meningeal inflammation in the areas of contrast enhancement, as we had previously observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Data from all samples were of high quality and read depth when assessed by treatment group (Supplemental Figure 2A-C) or sample (Supplemental Figure 2D-E). There was expected anatomic variability in number of read counts and number of features per spot, with relatively low counts and features in white matter as compared to the cortex or hippocampus (Supplemental Figure 2F-G), and spots had similar degrees of average complexity between EAE and naÃ¯ve samples (Supplemental Figure 2H). UMAP clustering revealed no significant independent effect of sample (Supplemental Figure 2I) or slide (Supplemental Figure 2J). Numerous genes were differentially expressed between EAE and naÃ¯ve slices as estimated by DESeq2 on samples pseudobulked by biological replicate (Supplementary Table 1; Supplemental Figure 2K), including genes associated with the complement cascade, immune infiltration, antigen presentation, and astrocyte activation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>).</p>
<p>We next explored the activity of a broad range of pathways using the pathway responsive genes (PROGENy) method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Inflammatory pathways related to TNF, JAK-STAT, and NFÎºB signaling were upregulated in EAE compared to naÃ¯ve, with peak activity around sites of meningeal inflammation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B-C</xref>). Pathways related to Trail and PI3K were downregulated in EAE compared to naÃ¯ve (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D-E</xref>), and TGFÎ² pathway activity was unchanged between groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D-E</xref>).</p>

<p>To focus our analyses on foci of meningeal inflammation specifically, we performed unbiased UMAP clustering on the spatial transcriptomic dataset and identified 11 distinct clusters (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Grouping the dimensional reduction UMAP plot by EAE and naÃ¯ve revealed that cluster eleven (C11) was restricted to EAE samples (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). C11 makes up 1â5% of the total spots in those samples (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), or about 20â120 total spots, and was significantly enriched in EAE relative to naÃ¯ve samples (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Visualizing the clusters using spatial feature plots confirmed that most clusters map consistently to specific anatomic regions and were similar between naÃ¯ve and EAE (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>; Supplementary Figure 3A). C11 overlapped with previously noted areas of meningeal MRI enhancement, suggesting that C11 represents areas of meningeal inflammation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>; Supplementary Figure 3B-D). We compared the gene expression in C11 to other clusters and found 132 upregulated genes and 70 downregulated genes (p &lt; 0.05; Log2 fold change &gt; 1; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Inflammation-related genes were prominently represented in C11 relative to other clusters (Supplementary Table 2), with top genes including <italic>Cd74</italic>, <italic>C3</italic>, and <italic>Gfap</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>; Supplementary Figure 3E). We next performed gene set enrichment analysis of C11 spots using the Gene Ontology (GO) database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, finding 538 variable gene sets (adjusted P-value &lt; 0.05; Supplementary Table 3). Among the most prominently enriched gene sets were those involved in antigen processing and presentation, complement activation, lymphocyte activation, and cytokine production and response (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>).</p>

<p>After establishing the defining transcriptomic features of meningeal inflammation in our model, we next sought to characterize inflammatory changes in the adjacent CNS parenchyma. We performed unbiased sub-clustering of each cluster in turn and found EAE-specific subclusters and differentially expressed genes within clusters 1 and 2. These subclusters were labelled 1_3, 1_4, and 2_6 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-B</xref>; Supplemental Figure 4) and represent regions of the thalamus and hypothalamus (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we assessed whether EAE-specific subclusters were physically closer to meningeal inflammation than other related subclusters. The distance between the average location in each subcluster to the nearest point of C11 was calculated. In the subclusters of cluster 1, we found no difference in proximity to C11 between EAE-specific subclusters vs. subclusters present in EAE and naÃ¯ve. However, in subclusters of cluster 2, the EAE-specific subcluster was significantly closer to C11 on average compared to other subclusters (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). To explore which pathways were activated in these subclusters, we performed gene set enrichment analysis using the GO database (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E-G</xref>; Supplementary Tables 4-6). Overall, 31 upregulated pathways were conserved between cluster 11 and subclusters 1_3, 1_4, 2_6 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). We found prominent conserved upregulation of pathways related to adaptive/B-cell mediated immunity, antigen processing and presentation, cell killing, and others (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>).</p>
<p>Our pathway analysis of meningeal inflammation and areas of inflamed adjacent brain parenchyma suggested that inflammatory signals increased in meningeal inflammation could have variable âpenetrationâ into the adjacent brain. We sought to test this using spatial trajectory gene/gene set expression modelling available within the SPATA2 software package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Trajectories were drawn in EAE samples from the largest region of meningeal inflammation to the central thalamus (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Gene and gene set expression levels were then evaluated along the length of these trajectories and compared to ideal patterns of expression, as demonstrated for representative genes <italic>B2m</italic> and <italic>C3</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B-E</xref>). The difference between gene or gene set expression and the ideal patterns, here âlogarithmic descendingâ or âgradient descendingâ, is represented by the residual line (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5B</xref>, 5E). The area under the residual curve (residual AUC) is therefore inversely proportional to fit for the given gene or gene set and ideal pattern. <italic>C3</italic> expression declines rapidly along the trajectory and the logarithmic descending residual AUC is lower than gradient descending residual AUC (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>), while <italic>B2m</italic> follows a less steep decline and fits the two patterns similarly (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Trajectory analysis of gene sets enriched in meningeal inflammation and adjacent brain parenchyma was performed in this way, and the average residual AUC was calculated for gradient descending/ascending and logarithmic descending/ascending patterns (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref><italic>i</italic>). As expected, all gene sets fit descending patterns better than ascending ones. There was variability in fit to the gradient descending pattern of expression, representing a more gradual decline in pathway enrichment along the trajectory, with gene sets related to antigen processing and presentation, cell killing, interleukin 6 production, and interferon gamma response having the best fit (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref><italic>i</italic>). Enrichment score trajectory heatmap of a representative sample corroborates this, showing increased activity farther along the spatial trajectory for these gene sets (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref><italic>ii</italic>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Meninges-restricted inflammation in MS is intimately related to subpial grey matter demyelination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, atrophy, and neurocognitive symptoms, but therapeutically targeting this aspect of the disease is challenging due to poorly understood pathologic mechanisms. Here, we present spatial transcriptomics analysis in a mouse model of LMI, finding a broad swath of inflammatory pathways upregulated at foci of LMI and a subset of them upregulated in the nearby brain parenchyma. Notably, genes related to B cell mediated responses and antigen processing and presentation were upregulated in inflammatory parenchymal subclusters. Variable penetrance of inflammatory pathway activity was evident when analyzing genesetsâ expression pattern along a linear trajectory from LMI into the CNS parenchyma, where antigen processing and presentation, interleukin 6 production, and the IFNÉ£ response pathway activity followed a more gradual decline as compared to other pathways.</p>
<p>Prior work supports roles for pathways identified in our dataset, including B cell and IFNÉ£ mediated responses, in contributing to neurodegeneration in MS. LMI in MS is rich in B cells, and the critical role of B cells in MS has been underscored by the success of B cell depletion in relapsing and progressive MS. Recent studies have proposed numerous mechanisms whereby B cells could contribute to cortical pathology, including indirectly through activation and inflammatory polarization of T cells, myeloid cells, and astrocytes or directly through production of neurotoxic cytokines or antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. B cell culture supernatants from MS patients, but not healthy controls, are toxic to rat and human neurons and oligodendrocytes with this effect being mediated by the extracellular vesicle (EV) fraction of the supernatants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. B cells are also sources for inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and GM-CSF, and antibodies, which are speculated to contribute to GMP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The role of IFNÉ£ in the pathogenesis of MS and EAE is complex, and likely has stage specific protective and pathologic effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Its prominent upregulation in EAE was initially considered evidence of its pathogenic nature, but subsequent experiments showed that it was pathogenic during the initiation phase but protective later in the course<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. IFNÉ£ signaling and subsequent upregulation of antigen processing and presentation on glia has been identified as a mechanism that could lead to remyelination failure and subsequent neuronal loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) upregulate antigen presentation and cross-presentation pathways in response to IFNÉ£, promoting inflammation and making them susceptible to CD8+ T cell killing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Upregulation of genes for self-antigen presentation has also been noted in neurons and oligodendrocyte lineage (OL) cells in post-mortem MS single nucleus RNAseq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, and OL cells in EAE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>While SJL EAE models many features of LMI in MS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, it has several important limitations. The majority of LMI identified in mice with SJL EAE in our experiments occurred in subarachnoid cisterns, and as a result prominently affected areas of parenchyma including thalamus and hypothalamus as opposed to cortical lesions typically seen in MS. Interestingly, neuronal loss in the thalamus and other deep grey nuclei does occur in MS with a similar âsurface-inâ gradient of neuronal injury, thought to also be related to toxic CSF-derived factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. We also noted some variability in the extent and location of LMI, which is unavoidable in EAE. While other animal models of LMI, such as directly injecting inflammatory cytokines into the meninges/cortex, produce more predictable regions of LMI, they involve traumatic injury to the brain and typically lack follicle-like structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>This work is the first to characterize a mouse model of LMI and grey matter injury using spatial transcriptomics, and in addition to the analysis presented here contributes a publicly available dataset for future research. We highlight the importance of antigen processing and presentation and B cell mediated inflammation, which are prominently upregulated in sub-pial grey matter, in our model. Future studies should focus on spatial transcriptomics in post-mortem or biopsied human tissue. While access to appropriate samples remains a significant barrier, recent advances in RNA extraction from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> will allow for the use of large banks of historically collected and preserved samples and could dramatically improve availability.</p>

<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating autoimmune disease that causes loss of myelin in neurons of the central nervous system. MS is characterized by the presence of inflammatory immune cells in several brain regions as well as the brain barriers (meninges). This study aims to understand the local immune hallmarks in regions of the brain parenchyma that are adjacent to the leptomeninges in a mouse model of MS. The leptomeninges are known to be a foci of inflammation in MS and perhaps &quot;bleed&quot; inflammatory cells and molecules to adjacent brain parenchyma regions. To do so, they use novel technology called spatial transcriptomics so that the spatial relationships between the two regions remain intact. The study identifies canonical inflammatory genes and gene sets such as complement and B cells enriched in the parenchyma in close proximity to the leptomeninges in the mouse model of MS but not control. The manuscript is very well written and easy to follow. The results will become a useful resource to others working in the field and can be followed by time series experiments where the same technology can be applied to the different stages of the disease.</p>

<p>Accumulating data suggests that the presence of immune cell infiltrates in the meninges of the multiple sclerosis brain contributes to the tissue damage in the underlying cortical grey matter by the release of inflammatory and cytotoxic factors that diffuse into the brain parenchyma. However, little is known about the identity and direct and indirect effects of these mediators at a molecular level. This study addresses the vital link between an adaptive immune response in the CSF space and the molecular mechanisms of tissue damage that drive clinical progression. In this short report the authors use a spatial transcriptomics approach using Visium Gene Expression technology from 10x Genomics, to identify gene expression signatures in the meninges and the underlying brain parenchyma, and their interrelationship, in the PLP-induced EAE model of MS in the SJL mouse. MRI imaging using a high field strength (11.7T) scanner was used to identify areas of meningeal infiltration for further study. They report, as might be expected, the upregulation of genes associated with the complement cascade, immune cell infiltration, antigen presentation, and astrocyte activation. Pathway analysis revealed the presence of TNF, JAK-STAT and NFkB signaling, amongst others, close to sites of meningeal inflammation in the EAE animals, although the spatial resolution is insufficient to indicate whether this is in the meninges, grey matter, or both.</p>
<p>UMAP clustering illuminated a major distinct cluster of upregulated genes in the meninges and smaller clusters associated with the grey matter parenchyma underlying the infiltrates. The meningeal cluster contained genes associated with immune cell functions and interactions, cytokine production, and action. The parenchymal clusters included genes and pathways related to glial activation, but also adaptive/B-cell mediated immunity and antigen presentation. This again suggests a technical inability to resolve fully between the compartments as immune cells do not penetrate the pial surface in this model or in MS. Finally, a trajectory analysis based on distance from the meningeal gene cluster successfully demonstrated descending and ascending gradients of gene expression, in particular a decline in pathway enrichment for immune processes with distance from the meninges.</p>
<p>Although these results confirm what we already know about processes involved in the meninges in MS and its models and gradients of pathology in sub-pial regions, this is the first to use spatial transcriptomics to demonstrate such gradients at a molecular level in an animal model that demonstrates lymphoid like tissue development in the meninges and associated grey matter pathology. The mouse EAE model being used here does reproduce many, although not all, of the pathological features of MS and the ability to look at longer time points has been exploited well. However, this particular spatial transcriptomics technique cannot resolve at a cellular level and therefore there is a lot of overlap between gene expression signatures in the meninges and the underlying grey matter parenchyma.</p>
<p>The short nature of this report means that the results are presented and discussed in a vague way, without enough molecular detail to reveal much information about molecular pathogenetic mechanisms.</p>
<p>The trajectory analysis is a good way to explore gradients within the tissues and the authors are to be applauded for using this approach. However, the trajectory analysis does not tell us much if you only choose 2 genes that you think might be involved in the pathogenetic processes going on in the grey matter. It might be more useful to choose some genes involved in pathogenetic processes that we already know are involved in the tissue damage in the underlying grey matter in MS, for which there is already a lot of literature, or genes that respond to molecules we know are increased in MS CSF, although the animal models may be very different. Why were C3 and B2m chosen here?</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
- The mouse model does exhibit many of the features of the compartmentalized immune response seen in MS, including the presence of meningeal immune cell infiltrates in the central sulcus and over the surface of the cortex, with the presence of FDC's HEVs PNAd+ vessels and CXCL13 expression, indicating the formation of lymphoid like cell aggregates. In addition, disruption of the glia limitans is seen, as in MS. Increased microglial reactivity is also present at the pial surface.</p>
<p>
- Spatial transcriptomics is the best approach to studying gradients in gene expression in both white matter and grey matter and their relationship between compartments.</p>
<p>
- It would be useful to have more discussion of how the upregulated pathways in the two compartments fit with what we know about the cellular changes occurring in both, for which presumably there is prior information from the group's previous publications.</p>
<p>Limitations:</p>
<p>
- EAE in the mouse is not MS and may be far removed when one considers molecular mechanisms, especially as MS is not a simple anti-myelin protein autoimmune condition. Therefore, this study could be following gene trajectories that do not exist in MS. This needs a significant amount of discussion in the manuscript if the authors suggest that it is mimicking MS.</p>
<p>
- The model does not have the cortical subpial demyelination typical of MS and it is unknown whether neuronal loss occurs in this model, which is the main feature of cytokine-mediated neurodegeneration in MS. If it does not then a whole set of genes will be missing that are involved in the neuronal response to inflammatory stimuli that may be cytotoxic.</p>
<p>
- Visium technology does not get down to single cell level and does not appear to allow resolution of the border between the meninges and the underlying grey matter.</p>
<p>
- Neuronal loss in the MS cortex is independent of demyelination and therefore not related to remyelination failure. There does not appear to be any cortical grey matter demyelination in these animals, so it is difficult to relate any of the gene changes seen here to demyelination.</p>
<p>
- No mention of how the ascending and descending patterns of gene expression may be due to the gradient of microglial activation that underlies meningeal inflammation, which is a big omission.</p>

<p>In this study, Gadani et al. induced EAE in SJL/J mice and performed a comprehensive spatial transcriptomic analysis in areas of meningeal inflammation during the relapse phase of the disease. The authors found specific enrichment in spatial gene signatures (cluster 11) in the regions of increased contrast-enhancement by MRI (where meningeal extravasation of activated immune cells is observed) that overlap with signatures in the adjacent brain parenchyma, namely the thalamus. Several pathways were similarly upregulated in the meningeal-associated cluster 11 and adjacent parenchymal clusters (like adaptive mediated immunity, and antigen processing and presentation), suggestive of a &quot;leakage&quot; of inflammatory mediators from the meninges into the brain during the re-activation of disease. The tested hypothesis, as well as the data presented in this study, is quite interesting and novel.</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewerâs concise summary and comments on our manuscript. We agree that the Visium spatial sequencing technology we applied is limited in its resolution and cannot precisely distinguish individual cells or anatomic regions. For that reason, there is undoubtedly some overlap between gene expression signatures in the meninges and underlying parenchyma, particularly in spots on the borders of the meningeal inflammation clusters. However, we believe that the majority of meningeal inflammation (âcluster 11â) spots are indeed in the meninges and represent the spatial transcriptome of that niche. To support this, in the revised manuscript we will provide H&amp;E images with the UMAP clusters overlayed to demonstrate the anatomic borders that correlate with the clusters.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. The goal of this work is to transcriptomically characterize the spatial relationship between areas of meningeal inflammation and the underlying parenchyma. While we agree that mechanistic studies are needed to further evaluate the role of presented signaling pathways, those experiments are beyond the scope of this brief report.</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewerâs points here. C3 and B2m were chosen as examples of genes that have differential fit to the gradient descending pattern to assist the reader in interpreting subsequent gene set trajectory analysis. However, we agree that there are many other genes of interest and will expand the number of genes displayed in our revised manuscript.</p>

<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
- The mouse model does exhibit many of the features of the compartmentalized immune response seen in MS, including the presence of meningeal immune cell infiltrates in the central sulcus and over the surface of the cortex, with the presence of FDC's HEVs PNAd+ vessels and CXCL13 expression, indicating the formation of lymphoid like cell aggregates. In addition, disruption of the glia limitans is seen, as in MS. Increased microglial reactivity is also present at the pial surface.</p>
<p>
- Spatial transcriptomics is the best approach to studying gradients in gene expression in both white matter and grey matter and their relationship between compartments.</p>
<p>
- It would be useful to have more discussion of how the upregulated pathways in the two .compartments fit with what we know about the cellular changes occurring in both, for which presumably there is prior information from the group's previous publications.</p>
<p>Limitations:</p>
<p>
- EAE in the mouse is not MS and may be far removed when one considers molecular mechanisms, especially as MS is not a simple anti-myelin protein autoimmune condition. Therefore, this study could be following gene trajectories that do not exist in MS. This needs a significant amount of discussion in the manuscript if the authors suggest that it is mimicking MS.</p>
<p>
- The model does not have the cortical subpial demyelination typical of MS and it is unknown whether neuronal loss occurs in this model, which is the main feature of cytokine-mediated neurodegeneration in MS. If it does not then a whole set of genes will be missing that are involved in the neuronal response to inflammatory stimuli that may be cytotoxic.</p>
<p>
- Visium technology does not get down to single cell level and does not appear to allow resolution of the border between the meninges and the underlying grey matter.</p>
<p>
- Neuronal loss in the MS cortex is independent of demyelination and therefore not related to remyelination failure. There does not appear to be any cortical grey matter demyelination in these animals, so it is difficult to relate any of the gene changes seen here to demyelination.</p>
<p>
- No mention of how the ascending and descending patterns of gene expression may be due to the gradient of microglial activation that underlies meningeal inflammation, which is a big omission.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for their insightful comments on the strengths and limitations of our study. Regarding the SJL EAE model we use in this paper, it certainly is not a perfect model of meningeal inflammation in MS, indeed we believe that no such animal model exists, but it does recapitulate several key features of human disease as described by the reviewer. Spatial transcriptomics of cortical grey matter lesions and overlying meninges of samples derived from patients with MS would be ideal, though access to this tissue is highly limited. In the revised manuscript we will include more detailed discussion of the limitations in applying these findings to MS. However, in addition to potential implications for MS research, our data contribute more generally to understanding of meningeal inflammation and penetrance of inflammation into brain tissue.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that sub-pial neuronal loss has not been assessed in SJL EAE, and if present it would increase the relevance of this model to neurodegeneration. We are currently working to assess this.</p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that Visium technology is limited in its ability to discriminate individual cells, as discussed above (2.2).</p>
<p>We agree that gene expression by activated microglia is likely a major driver of the transcriptomic changes observed in the parenchyma, and thank the reviewer for highlighting this. We will add discussion of this to our revised manuscript, and intend to generate additional data regarding the contribution of subpial microglial activation to the measured transcriptomic changes.</p>
<p>Finally, we thank Reviewer #3 for their assessment of our work.</p>
